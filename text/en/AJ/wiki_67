<text>Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) is a retired British passenger ship converted into a floating hotel. Originally built for the Cunard Line, the ship was operated by Cunard as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008. She was then laid up until converted and since 18 April 2018 has been operating as a floating hotel in Dubai.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of Southampton, UK, to New York, United States. She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by in 2004. &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was designed in Cunard&#x27;s offices in Liverpool and Southampton and built in Clydebank, Scotland. She was considered the last of the transatlantic ocean liners until &quot;Project Genesis&quot; was announced by Cunard Line in 1995 after the business purchase of Cunard by Micky Arison; chairman of Carnival and Carnival UK. Project Genesis was intended to create new life in the ocean liner saga, and in 1998, Cunard revealed the name: RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was refitted with a modern diesel powerplant in 1986–87. She undertook regular world cruises during almost 40 years of service, and later operated predominantly as a cruise ship, sailing out of Southampton, England. &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; had no running mate and never ran a year-round weekly transatlantic express service to New York. She did, however, continue the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; retired from active Cunard service on 27 November 2008. She had been acquired by the private equity arm of Dubai World, which planned to begin conversion of the vessel to a 500-room floating hotel moored at the Palm Jumeirah, Dubai. The 2008 financial crisis intervened, however, and the ship was laid up at Dubai Drydocks and later Mina Rashid. When she started her new life in Port Rashid as a floating hotel, during that time she completed 1,400 voyages over six million nautical miles while carrying 2.5 million passengers over 25 world tours. Subsequent conversion plans were announced in 2012 and then again by the &quot;Oceanic Group&quot; in 2013, but both plans stalled. In November 2015, Cruise Arabia &amp; Africa quoted DP World chairman Ahmed Sultan Bin Sulayem as saying that QE2 would not be scrapped and a Dubai-based construction company announced in March 2017 that it had been contracted to refurbish the ship. The restored QE2 opened to visitors on 18 April 2018, with a soft opening.

==Development==
By 1957, transatlantic sea travel was becoming displaced by air transit due to its speed and low relative cost, with passenger numbers split 50:50 between them. With jets capable of spanning the ocean non-stop replacing prop planes, and the debut of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC8 in 1958, the trend was rapidly increasing. Simultaneously, the aging and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; were becoming increasingly expensive to operate, and both internally and externally were relics of the pre-war era.

Despite falling passenger revenues, Cunard did not want to give up its traditional role as a provider of a North Atlantic passenger service and Royal Mail carrier, and so decided to replace the obsolete &quot;Queens&quot; with a new generation liner.

Designated &quot;Q4&quot; during work-up, it was projected to measure 75,000 gross register tons, have berths for 2,270 passengers, and cost about £30 million.

Work had proceeded as far as the preparation of submissions from six shipyards and applying for government financial assistance with the construction when misgivings among some executives and directors, coupled with a shareholder revolt, led to the benefits of the project being reappraised and ultimately cancelled on 19 October 1961.

Cunard decided to continue with a replacement plan but with an altered operating regime and more flexible design. Realising the decline of transatlantic trade, it was visualised that the new &quot;Queen&quot; would be dual-purpose three-class ship offering First, Cabin and Tourist passage for eight months a year on the transatlantic route, then as a cruise ship in warmer climates and during the winter months.

Compared with the older Queens, which had two engine rooms and four propellers, the newly designated &quot;Q4&quot; would be much smaller, with one boiler room, one engine room, and two propellers, which combined with automation would allow a smaller engineering complement. Producing 110,000 shp, the new ship was to have the same service speed as her predecessors, while consuming half the fuel. A reduction to 520 tons per 24 hours was estimated to save Cunard £1 million annually. Able to transit both the Panama and Suez canals, her shallower draught of would allow her to enter more and smaller ports than the old ships, particularly in tropical waters.

==Design==


The interior and superstructure for the &quot;QE2&quot; was designed by James Gardner. The result was described by The Council of Industrial Design as that of a &quot;very big yacht&quot; and with a &quot;look [that was] sleek, modern and purposeful&quot;.

===Characteristics===
As built, &quot;QE2&quot; had a gross tonnage of , was long, and had a top speed of with steam turbines; this was increased to when the vessel was re-engined with the diesel-electric powerplant. At the time of retirement, the ship had a gross tonnage of 70,327.

===Hull===
The hull was of welded steel plates, which avoided the weight penalty of over ten million rivets and overlappeding of historic ship construction, and was fitted with a modern bulbous bow.

===Superstructure===
Like both and , &quot;QE2&quot; had a flared stem and clean forecastle.

What was controversial at the time was that Cunard decided not to paint the funnel with the line&#x27;s distinctive colour and pattern, something that had been done on all its merchant vessels since the first Cunarder, , sailed in 1840. Instead, the funnel was painted white and black, with the Cunard orange-red appearing only on the inside of the wind scoop. This practice ended in 1983 when &quot;QE2&quot; returned from service in the Falklands War, and the funnel was repainted in traditional Cunard orange and black, with black horizontal bands, known as &quot;hands&quot;.

The original narrow funnel was rebuilt larger during her 1986 refurbishment in Bremerhaven, using steel panels from the original, when the ship was converted from steam to diesel power.

Large quantities of weight-saving aluminium were used in the framing and cladding of &quot;QE2&quot;″s superstructure in place of steel. Reducing the draft of the ship lowered fuel consumption, but invited the electrochemical corrosion where the dissimilar metals are joined together, prevented by using a jointing compound. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when &quot;QE2&quot; was serving as a troopship during the Falklands War, with some fearing that if the ship were struck by a missile her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire.

In 1972, the first penthouse suites were added in an aluminium structure on Signal Deck and Sports Deck (now &quot;Sun Deck&quot;), behind the ship&#x27;s bridge, and in 1977 this structure was expanded to include more suites with balconies, making &quot;QE2&quot; one of the first ships to offer private terraces to passengers since &quot;Normandie&quot; in the 1930s. Her balcony accommodation was expanded for the final time when her funnel was widened during the 1986/87 overhaul. 

&quot;QE2&quot;″s final structural changes included the reworking of the aft decks during the 1994 refit, following the removal of the magrodome, and the addition of an undercover area on Sun Deck during the 2005 refit outfitted as the Funnel Bar.

===Interiors===
&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;″s interior configuration was originally designed for segregated two-class Atlantic crossings. It was laid out in a horizontal fashion, similar to &quot;France&quot;, where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread on specific decks, in contrast to the deck-spanning vertical class divisions of older liners. Where &quot;QE2&quot; differed from &quot;France&quot; in having only two classes of service, with the upper deck dedicated to tourist class and the quarter deck beneath it to first-class. Each had its own main lounge.

Another modern variation was providing tourist class with a grand two-story main ballroom, called the Double Room (later the Grand Lounge), created by opening a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges in the ship&#x27;s original three class design. This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander space for tourist class passengers than first class, who gathered in the standard height Queen&#x27;s Room. The First-class was given the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, and tourist class the orchestra level on Upper Deck.

Over the span of her thirty-nine-year seagoing career, &quot;QE2&quot; received a number of interior refits and alterations.

The year &quot;QE2&quot; entered service, 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, the Concorde prototype was unveiled, and the Boeing 747 first took flight. In keeping with those technology influenced times, Cunard abandoned the Art Deco interiors of the previous &quot;Queens&quot; in favor of everyday modern materials like laminates, aluminium and Perspex. The public rooms featured glass, stainless steel, dark carpeting and sea green leather. Furniture was modular, and abstract art was used throughout public rooms and cabins.

Dennis Lennon was responsible for co-ordinating the interior design, assisted by Jon Bannenberg and Gaby Schreiber; his original designs only remained intact for three years.

The Midships Lobby on Two Deck, where first-class passengers boarded for transatlantic journeys and all passengers boarded for cruises, was a circular room with a sunken seating area in the centre with green leather-clad banquettes surrounded by a chrome railing. In the centre was a flared, white, trumpet-shaped, lighted column.

The Theatre Bar on Upper Deck featured red chairs, red drapes, a red egg crate fibreglass screen, and even a red baby grand piano. Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous &quot;Queens&quot;, which offered views through large windows over the ship&#x27;s bow. The &quot;QE2&quot;″s 1972 refit plated over the windows and turned the room into galley space.

Almost all of the remaining original decor was replaced in the 1994 refit, with Cunard opting to use the line&#x27;s traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the Art Deco inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom-designed piano from &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. The (by then) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the traditional Edwardian-themed Golden Lion Pub.

Some original elements were retained, including the flared columns in the Queen&#x27;s Room and Mid-Ships Lobby. The Queen&#x27;s Room&#x27;s indirect ceiling lighting was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling&#x27;s slot.

By the time of &quot;QE2&#x27;s&quot; retirement, the ship&#x27;s synagogue was the only room that had remained unaltered since 1969. However it was reported that during &quot;QE2&quot;″s 22 October five-night voyage, the synagogue was dismantled and removed from the ship before her final sailing to Dubai.

===Artwork and artefacts===

The designers included numerous pieces of artwork within the public rooms of the ship, as well as maritime artefacts drawn from Cunard&#x27;s long history of operating merchant vessels.

Althea Wynne&#x27;s sculpture of the &quot;White Horses&quot; of the Atlantic Ocean was installed in the Mauretania Restaurant. Two bronze busts were installed—one of Sir Samuel Cunard outside the Yacht Club, and one of Queen Elizabeth II in the Queen&#x27;s Room. Four life-size statues of human forms—created by sculptor Janine Janet in marine materials like shell and coral, representing the four elements—were installed in the Princess Grill. A frieze designed by Brody Nevenshwander, depicting the words of T. S. Eliot, Sir Francis Drake, and John Masefield, was in the Chart Room. The Midships Lobby housed a solid silver model of &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; made by Asprey of Bond Street in 1975, which was lost until a photograph found in 1997 led to the discovery of the model itself. It was placed on &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; in 1999.

Three custom-designed tapestries were commissioned from Helena Hernmarck for the ship&#x27;s launch, depicting the Queen as well as the launch of the ship. These tapestries were originally hung in the Quarter Deck &quot;D&quot; Stairway, outside the Columbia Restaurant. They were originally made with golden threads, but much of this was lost when they were incorrectly cleaned during the 1987 refit. They were subsequently hung in the &quot;E&quot; stairway and later damaged in 2005.

There are numerous photographs, oils, and pastels of members of the Royal Family throughout the vessel.

The ship also housed items from previous Cunard ships, including both a brass relief plaque with a fish motif from the first and an Art-Deco bas-relief titled &quot;Winged Horse and Clouds&quot; by Norman Foster from . There were also a vast array of Cunard postcards, porcelain, flatware, boxes, linen, and Lines Bros Tri-ang Minic model ships. One of the key pieces was a replica of the figurehead from Cunard&#x27;s first ship , carved from Quebec yellow pine by Cornish sculptor Charles Moore and presented to the ship by Lloyd&#x27;s of London.

On the Upper Deck sits the silver Boston Commemorative Cup, presented to &quot;Britannia&quot; by the City of Boston in 1840. This cup was lost for decades until it was found in a pawn shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On &quot;2&quot; Deck was a bronze entitled &quot;Spirit of the Atlantic&quot; that was designed by Barney Seale for the second . A large wooden plaque was presented to &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; by First Sea Lord Sir John Fieldhouse to commemorate the ship&#x27;s service as a Hired Military Transport (HMT) in the Falklands War.

There was also an extensive collection of large-scale models of Cunard ships located throughout &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;.

Over the years the ship&#x27;s collection was added to. Among those items was a set of antique Japanese armour presented to &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; by the Governor of Kagoshima, Japan, during her 1979 world cruise, as was a Wedgwood vase presented to the ship by Lord Wedgwood.

Throughout the public areas were also silver plaques commemorating the visits of every member of the Royal Family, as well as other dignitaries such as South African president Nelson Mandela.

Istithmar acquired most of these items from Cunard when it bought &quot;QE2&quot;.

===Crew accommodation===
The majority of the crew were accommodated in two- or four-berth cabins, with showers and toilets at the end of each alleyway. These were located forward and aft on decks three to six. At the time she entered service, the crew areas were a significant improvement over those aboard and ; however the ship&#x27;s age and the lack of renovation of the crew area during her 40 years of service, in contrast to passenger areas, which were updated periodically, meant that this accommodation was considered basic by the end of her career. Officers were accommodated in single cabins with private in-suite bathrooms located on Sun Deck.

There were six crew bars, the main four were split into the Senior Rates Recreation Rooms on Deck 2 and the Junior Rates on Deck 3, with Deck and Engine Departments on the port side and Hotel on the starboard side of the ship. The Female crew recreation room was on Deck 1 next to their dedicated mess room. Over time the Deck &amp; Engine Ratings Room became The Petty Officers Club and then the Fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle Club when the British Deck and Engine crew were changed to Filipino crew. The Hotel Senior Rates room became a crew gym. The Junior Rates Rooms on Deck 3 were the main crew bars and were called &quot;The Pig &amp; Whistle&quot;. (&quot;The 2 deck Pig&quot; and three deck pig, for short and a tradition aboard Cunard ships) and Castaways on the starboard side. After the expansion of female crew following the conversion to diesel power, the female-only recreation and mess room became a crew library and later the crew services office. The final bar on Deck 6 aft was small and in a former crew launderette so it was called the Dhobi Arms, a hang out for the Liverpool crew but was closed in the late &#x27;80s. A bar, dedicated for the officers, is located at the forward end of Boat Deck. Named &quot;The Officers Wardroom&quot;, this area enjoyed forward-facing views and was often opened to passengers for cocktail parties hosted by the senior officers. The crew mess was situated at the forward end of One Deck, adjacent to the crew services office.

===Machinery===

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was originally fitted out with a steam turbine propulsion system using three Foster Wheeler E.S.D II boilers, which provided steam for the two Brown-Parsons turbines. The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of (normally operating at ) and coupled via double-reduction gearing to two six-bladed fixed-pitch propellers.

The steam turbines were plagued with problems from the time the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty-four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service, the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines and the constant use of the machinery which was mainly due to Cunard&#x27;s cost-saving deletion of the originally planned 4th boiler while the ship was still on the drawing board.

The shipping company decided that the options were to either do nothing for the remainder of the ship&#x27;s life, re-configure the existing engines, or completely re-engine the vessel with a modern, more efficient and more reliable diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years while giving the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief. Her steam turbines had taken her to a record-breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.

During the ship&#x27;s 1986 to 1987 refit, the steam turbines were removed and replaced with nine German MAN 9L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, in addition to powering the ship&#x27;s auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each.

The ship&#x27;s service speed of was now maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. The maximum power output with the new engine configuration running increased to 130,000 hp, which was greater than the previous system&#x27;s 110,000 hp. Using the same IBF-380 (Bunker C) fuel, the new configuration yielded a 35% fuel saving over the previous system. During the re-engining process, her funnel was modified into a wider one to accommodate the exhaust pipes for the nine MAN diesel engines.

During the refit, the original fixed-pitch propellers were replaced with variable-pitch propellers. The old steam propulsion system required astern turbines to move the ship backward or stop her moving forward. The pitch of the new variable pitch blades could simply be reversed, causing a reversal of propeller thrust while maintaining the same direction of propeller rotation, allowing the ship shorter stopping times and improved handling characteristics.

The new propellers were originally fitted with &quot;Grim Wheels&quot;, named after their inventor, Dr. Ing Otto Grim. These were free-spinning propeller blades fitted behind the main propellers, with long vanes protruding from the centre hub. The Grim Wheels were designed to recover lost propeller thrust and reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 to 3%. After the trial of these wheels, when the ship was drydocked, the majority of the vanes on each wheel were discovered to have broken off. The wheels were removed and the project was abandoned.

Other machinery includes nine heat recovery boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash evaporators and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate seawater to produce 1000 tons of freshwater daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.

==Construction==
On 30 December 1964, Cunard placed an order for construction of the new ship with John Brown and Company, who would build it at their shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. The agreed price was £25,427,000 (equal to £ today) provision for escalation of labour and materials increases, with an agreed delivery date of May 1968. To assist with its construction the British government provided financial assistance to Cunard in the form of a £17.6 million loan at 4.5% interest.

The keel was laid down on 5 July 1965, as hull number 736 on the same slipway where previous Cunard liners such as , , &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; had been constructed.

The ship was launched and named on 20 September 1967 by Queen Elizabeth II, using the same pair of gold scissors her mother and grandmother used to launch &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, respectively. After the bottle of champagne was smashed the &quot;QE2&quot; stayed put on the slipway for 90 seconds before being let free. In a break with tradition, Cunard declined to give the ship royal mail status. 

===Name===
Authorities disagree over whether the ship&#x27;s namesake is the monarch Elizabeth II or the liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. During the naming and launching ceremony on 20 September 1967, the monarch clearly and verbally states the name of the ship is &quot;Queen Elizabeth the Second&quot;. However, the written form of ship is &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, (Queen Elizabeth Two), not the &quot;Queen Elizabeth II&quot; (Queen Elizabeth the Second) formal title used by the monarch. It is likely that Her Majesty misinterpreted the written numeral &quot;2&quot; as the Roman numeral &quot;II&quot;.

====Form of name====
The name of the liner as it appears on the bow and stern is &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, with upper- and lower-case lettering and an Arabic numeral 2 as opposed to the Roman numeral II, distinguishing her from the monarch, Elizabeth II; it is commonly pronounced in speech as &quot;Queen Elizabeth Two&quot;. Soon after launching, the name was shortened in common use as &quot;QE2&quot;.

====Background====
&quot;Queen Mary&quot;, in 1934, and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, in 1938, were both named by and for contemporary spouses of reigning monarchs: Mary of Teck and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, respectively. These two previous Cunarders both had capitalised bow names, as &quot;QUEEN MARY&quot; and &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;.

Cunard practice at the time of naming &quot;QE2&quot; was to re-use the existing name of its former ships, for example, launching in 1938 after the previous was scrapped in 1935.

The original &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was still in service with Cunard when &quot;QE2&quot; was launched in 1967, although she was retired and sold before &quot;QE2&quot; entered revenue service with Cunard in 1969.

The addition of a &quot;2&quot; in this manner was unknown at the time, but it was not unknown for Roman numerals to denote ships in service with the same name. Two non-Cunard ships were named &quot;Queen Mary II&quot;: a Clyde steamer, and &quot;Mauretania II&quot;, a Southampton steamer of Red Funnel, since the Cunard ships already had the names without Roman numerals.

====Launch====
As was Cunard practice at the time, the name of the liner was not to be publicly revealed until the launch. Dignitaries were invited to the &quot;Launch of Cunard Liner No. 736&quot;, as no name had yet been painted on the bow.

The Queen launched the ship with the words &quot;I name this ship &quot;Queen Elizabeth the Second&quot;,&quot; the normal short form of address of the monarch, Elizabeth II herself.
The following day, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; of London printed the name as &quot;Queen Elizabeth II&quot;, the short form of written style of the monarch. However, when the liner left the shipyard in 1968 she bore the name &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; on her bow, and has continued to do so ever since.

====1969 authorised history====
In an authorised history of &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; published in 1969, various explanations of events occur.

These state that, as at the launch ceremony, an envelope and card were also held in New York in case of transmission failure, and when opened the card was found to read the name Queen Elizabeth, and that the decision to add &quot;The Second&quot; to the name was an alteration by the Queen. The book quotes the Cunard chairman Sir Basil Smallpeice as saying &quot;The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; [named] after her Grandmother, the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; after her mother, and now this magnificent ship after herself.&quot;

Following the unexpected addition of &quot;the Second&quot; by the Queen, the book attributes the use of upper and lower case lettering and a numeric &quot;2&quot; – rather than a Roman &quot;II&quot; – to the decision by Cunard to use a more modern typeface to suit the style of the 1960s. The book also surmises that the naming of the liner after the reigning monarch, in the form Queen Elizabeth II, was potentially offensive to some Scots, as the title of Queen Elizabeth II (of the United Kingdom) relates to the lineage of the throne of England and Ireland (the Tudor monarch Elizabeth I having reigned only in England and Ireland).

====Ron Warwick, former captain====
In a later account by Ronald Warwick, who was the son of William &quot;Bil&quot; Warwick and the first master of &quot;QE2&quot;, Warwick junior (himself later in his Cunard career a master of the &quot;QE2&quot; and latterly the first captain of &quot;QM2&quot;) supports the account that the Queen initiated the surprise move of naming the liner after herself rather than simply Queen Elizabeth as had originally been planned (the name having been made vacant by the retirement of the current liner before the new one was commissioned). The name had been given to the Queen in a sealed envelope which she didn&#x27;t open. The book, referencing his autobiography, states that the Cunard chairman Sir Basil was delighted with this development, it being in keeping with the previous Queen liners, and the 2 was added by Cunard for differentiation of the ship while still denoting it was named after the Queen.

====Cunard website====
From at least 2002 the official Cunard website stated that &quot;The new ship is not named after the Queen but is simply the second ship to bear the name – hence the use of the Arabic 2 in her name, rather than the Roman II used by the Queen&quot;, however, in late 2008 this information had been removed due to the ship&#x27;s retirement.

====Other accounts====
Other later accounts repeat the position that Cunard originally intended to name the ship &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and the addition of a 2 by the Queen was a surprise to Cunard, in 1990 and 2008, although two books by William H. Miller state that Queen Elizabeth 2 was the name agreed on before the launch between Cunard officials and the Queen.

Accounts that repeat the position that &quot;QE2&quot; was not named after the reigning monarch have been published in 1991, 1999, 2004, 2005, and 2008. In 2008, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; goes further to state the ship is named not only as the second ship named &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, but is specifically named after the wife of King George VI. In contradiction however, some modern accounts continue to publish that the &quot;QE2&quot; was named after the reigning monarch, in 2001 and 2008. There is a gilded bust that stands in the ship&#x27;s queen&#x27;s room depicting Queen Elizabeth II, not her mother.

===Delivery===
As construction continued on the new ship, Cunard found itself in increasing financial difficulties as increased competition from airlines resulted in the company&#x27;s passenger ships losing money. With profits from its cargo ships eventually unable to offset the losses, Cunard was forced to sell &quot;Mauretania&quot;, &quot;Sylvania&quot;, &quot;Carinthia&quot;, &quot;Caronia&quot;, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; between 1965 and 1968. Income also fell due to a seven-week-long seamens&#x27; strike in 1966. Then John Brown advised that the delivery would be delayed by six months, which meant the ship would miss the 1968 peak summer transatlantic season. Following market research, Cunard decided to take advantage of the delay to change the original three-class configuration of the ship to a more flexible two-class arrangement of First and Tourist.

On 20 September 1967 with the launch date approaching, Cunard (having lost £7.5 million the previous year) approached the government with a request for an additional £3 million loan to complete the ship. Eventually the government agreed to increase the original £17.6 million loan up to £24 million.

On 19 November 1968, she left John Brown&#x27;s fitting-out berth. Several industrial disputes with the Clydebank workers, with their resultant delays and quality issues, forced Cunard to transfer the ship to Southampton, where Vosper Thorneycroft completed the installation and commissioning work, prior to the sea trials.

Sea trials began on 26 November 1968 in the Irish Sea, proceeding to speed trials off the Isle of Arran.

Cunard initially refused to accept the ship, as the sea trials identified that the ship suffered from a resonant vibration which was traced to a design flaw in the blades of the steam turbines. This delayed her being handed over to her new owners until 18 April 1969. She then departed on a &quot;shakedown cruise&quot; to Las Palmas on 22 April 1969.

==Service==

===Early career===

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;″s maiden voyage, from Southampton to New York, commenced on 2 May 1969, taking 4 days, 16 hours, and 35 minutes, at an average speed of 28.02 knots. Upon her arrival to New York Harbour, she was greeted by two Royal Air Force Harrier jets that hovered on each side of the ship. The Harriers were in New York City at the time competing in the Daily Mail Trans-Atlantic Air Race.

In 1971, she participated in the rescue of some 500 passengers from the burning French Line ship .
Later that year on 5 March &quot;QE2&quot; was disabled for four hours when jellyfish were sucked into and blocked her seawater intakes.

On 17 May 1972, while travelling from New York to Southampton, she was the subject of a bomb threat. She was searched by her crew, and a combined Special Air Service and Special Boat Service team which parachuted into the sea to conduct a search of the ship. No bomb was found, but the hoaxer was arrested by the FBI.

The following year &quot;QE2&quot; undertook two chartered cruises through the Mediterranean to Israel in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the state&#x27;s founding. The ship&#x27;s Columbia Restaurant was koshered for Passover, and Jewish passengers were able to celebrate Passover on the ship. According to the book &quot;The Angel&quot; by Uri Bar-Joseph, Muammar Gaddafi ordered a submarine to torpedo her during one of the chartered cruises in retaliation for Israel&#x27;s downing of Libyan Flight 114, but Anwar Sadat intervened secretly to foil the attack.

She continued the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life, crossing on an opposite and symbiotic summer schedule with the CGT&#x27;s famous between 1961 and 1974. Upon the withdrawal of competing SS &quot;France&quot; from service in 1974, &quot;QE2&quot; became the largest operational passenger ship in the world for a few years, until the &quot;France&quot; was returned to service as in 1980.
On 23 July 1976 while the ship was 80 miles off the Scilly Isles on a transatlantic voyage, a flexible coupling drive connecting the starboard main engine high-pressure rotor and the reduction gearbox ruptured. This allowed lubricating oil under pressure to enter into the main engine room where it ignited, creating a severe fire. It took 20 minutes to bring the fire under control. Reduced to two boilers, &quot;QE2&quot; limped back to Southampton. Damage from the fire resulted in a replacement boiler having to be fitted by dry-docking the ship and cutting an access hole in her side.

By 1978 &quot;QE2&quot; was breaking even with an occupancy of 65%, generating revenues of greater than £30 million per year against which had to be deducted an annual fuel cost of £5 million and a monthly crew cost of £225,000. With it costing £80,000 a day for her to sit idle in port, her owners made every attempt to keep her at sea and full of passengers. As a result, as much maintenance as possible was undertaken while at sea. However, she needed all three of her boilers to be in service if she was to maintain her transatlantic schedule. With limited ability to maintain her boilers, reliability was becoming a serious issue.

Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, the ship was testing a new ablative anti-fouling type paint for the Admiralty which was only available in blue. When they finally made the paint available in different colours they returned &quot;QE2&quot; anti-fouling paint to the traditional red colour.

===Falklands War===

On 3 May 1982, she was requisitioned by the British government for service as a troop carrier in the Falklands War.

In preparation for war service, Vosper Thornycroft commenced in Southampton on 5 May 1982 the installation of two helicopter pads, the transformation of public lounges into dormitories, the installation of fuel pipes that ran through the ship down to the engine room to allow for refuelling at sea, and the covering of carpets with 2,000 sheets of hardboard. A quarter of the ship&#x27;s length was reinforced with steel plating, and an anti-magnetic coil was fitted to combat naval mines. Over 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage, to look after the 3,000 members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade, which the ship transported to South Georgia.

On 12 May 1982, with only one of her three boilers in operation, the ship departed Southampton for the South Atlantic, carrying 3,000 troops and 650 volunteer crew. The remaining boilers were brought back into service as she steamed south.

During the voyage, the ship was blacked out and the radar switched off to avoid detection, steaming on without modern aids.

&quot;QE2&quot; returned to the UK on 11 June 1982, where she was greeted in Southampton Water by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on board . Peter Jackson, the captain of the ocean liner, responded to the Queen Mother&#x27;s welcome: &quot;Please convey to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth our thanks for her kind message. Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; is proud to have been of service to Her Majesty&#x27;s Forces.&quot; The ship underwent conversion back to passenger service, with her funnel being painted in the traditional Cunard orange with black stripes, which are known as &quot;hands,&quot; for the first time, during the refit the hull&#x27;s exterior a decision was made to repaint the hull in a light pebble grey. The ship returned to service on 7 August 1982.

The new colour scheme proved unpopular with passengers, as well as difficult to maintain, so the hull reverted to traditional colours in 1983. Later that year, &quot;QE2&quot; was fitted with a magrodome over her quarterdeck pool.

===Diesel era and Project Lifestyle===
&quot;QE2&quot; once again experienced mechanical problems following her annual overhaul in November 1983. Boiler problems caused Cunard to cancel a cruise, and, in October 1984, an electrical fire caused a complete loss of power. The ship was delayed for several days before power could be restored. Instead of replacing the &quot;QE2&quot; with a newer vessel, Cunard decided that it was more prudent to simply make improvements to her. Therefore, from 27 October 1986 to 25 April 1987, &quot;QE2&quot; underwent one of her most significant refurbishments when she was converted by Lloyd Werft at their shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany from steam power to diesel. Nine MAN B&amp;W diesel-electric engines, new propellers and a heat recovery system (to use heat expelled by the engines) were fitted, which halved the fuel consumption. With this new propulsion system, &quot;QE2&quot; was expected to serve another 20 years with Cunard. The passenger accommodation was also modernised. The refurbishment cost over £100 million.

On 7 August 1992, the underside of the hull was extensively damaged when she ran aground south of Cuttyhunk Island near Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, while returning from a five-day cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia along the east coast of the United States and Canada. A combination of her speed, an uncharted shoal, overestimating the height of tide and underestimating the increase in the ship&#x27;s draft due to the effect of squat led to the ship&#x27;s hull scraping rocks on the ocean floor. The accident resulted in the passengers disembarking earlier than scheduled at nearby Newport, Rhode Island and the ship being taken out of service while temporary repairs were made in drydock at Boston. Several days later, divers found the red paint from the keel on previously uncharted rocks where the ship struck the bottom.

By the mid-1990s, it was decided that &quot;QE2&quot; was due for a new look and in 1994 the ship was given a multimillion-pound refurbishment in Hamburg code-named Project Lifestyle.

On 11 September 1995, &quot;QE2&quot; encountered a rogue wave, estimated at , caused by Hurricane Luis in the North Atlantic Ocean about south of eastern Newfoundland. One year later, during her twentieth world cruise, she completed her four millionth mile. The ship had sailed the equivalent of 185 times around the planet.

&quot;QE2&quot; celebrated the 30th anniversary of her maiden voyage in Southampton in 1999. In three decades she had 1,159 voyages, sailed and carried over two million passengers.

===Later years===

Following the 1998 acquisition of the Cunard Line by Carnival Corporation, in 1999 &quot;QE2&quot; was given a US$30 million refurbishment which included refreshing various public rooms, and a new colour palette in the passenger cabins. The Royal Promenade, which formerly housed upscale shops such as Burberry, H. Stern and Aquascutum, were replaced by boutiques typical of cruise ships, selling perfumes, watches and logo items. During this refit, the hull was stripped to bare metal, and the ship repainted in the traditional Cunard colours of matte black (Federal Grey) with a white superstructure.

On 29 August 2002, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; became the first merchant ship to sail more than 5 million nautical miles at sea.

In 2004, the vessel stopped plying the traditional transatlantic route and began full-time cruising, the transatlantic route having been assigned to Cunard&#x27;s new flagship, . However, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; still undertook an annual world cruise and regular trips around the Mediterranean. By this time, she lacked the amenities to rival newer, larger cruise ships, but she still had unique features such as her ballrooms, hospital, and 6,000-book library. &quot;QE2&quot; remained the fastest cruise ship afloat (28.5 knots), with fuel economy at this speed at 49.5 ft to the gallon (4 m/L). While cruising at slower speeds efficiency was improved to 125 ft per gallon (10 m/L).

On 5 November 2004, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; became Cunard&#x27;s longest serving express liner, surpassing ″s 35 years, while on 4 September 2005, during a call to the port of Sydney, Nova Scotia, &quot;QE2&quot; became the longest serving Cunarder, surpassing ″s record.

At the end of her 2005 world cruise, some pieces of her artwork were damaged when some crew members who had become inebriated at an on-board crew party, went on a vandalism rampage through the public areas of the ship. A unique tapestry of &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, commissioned for the launch of the ship, was thrown overboard by a drunken crewman. An oil painting of Queen Elizabeth II and two other tapestries were also damaged, along with a part of the entertainment area and a lifeboat. The crew members involved were dismissed from service.

On 20 February 2007 &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, while on her annual world cruise, met her running mate and successor flagship &quot;QM2&quot; (herself on her maiden world cruise) in Sydney Harbour, Australia. This was the first time two Cunard &quot;Queens&quot; had been together in Sydney since the original &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; served as troop ships in 1941.

==== Retirement announcement ====
On 18 June 2007, Cunard announced that &quot;QE2&quot; had been bought by the Dubai investment company Istithmar for $100 million. Her retirement, in part, was forced by the oncoming June 2010 implementation of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations, which would have forced large and expensive structural changes to the ship.

===Retirement and final Cunard voyage===
In a ceremonial display before her retirement, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; met and &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; near the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor on 13 January 2008, with a celebratory fireworks display; &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; had made a tandem crossing of the Atlantic for the meet. This marked the first time three &quot;Cunard Queens&quot; had been present in the same location. (Cunard stated this would be the last time these three particular ships would meet, due to the impending retirement of &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. However, due to a change in &quot;QE2&quot;″s schedule, the three ships met again in Southampton on 22 April 2008.)

&quot;QE2&quot; shared the harbour at Zeebrugge with &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; on 19 July 2008, where the two Cunarders exchanged whistle blasts.

On 3 October 2008, &quot;QE2&quot; set off from Cork for Douglas Bay on her farewell tour of Ireland and Britain, before heading for Liverpool. She left Liverpool and arrived in Belfast on 4 October 2008, before moving to Greenock the next day (the ship&#x27;s height with funnel makes it impossible to pass under the Erskine Bridge so Clydebank is not reachable). There she was escorted by Royal Navy destroyer and visited by . The farewell was viewed by large crowds and concluded with a firework display. &quot;QE2&quot; then sailed around Scotland to the Firth of Forth on 7 October 2008, where she anchored in the shadow of the Forth Bridge. The next day, following an RAF flypast, she left amidst a flotilla of small craft to head to Newcastle upon Tyne, before returning to Southampton.

==== Final Westbound and Eastbound Transatlantic Crossings ====

&quot;QE2&quot; completed her final Atlantic crossings in tandem with her successor, &quot;QM2&quot;. The ships departed for the final westbound crossing from Southampton on 10 October, sailing tandem and arriving in New York City one final time on 16 October. The Queen Mary 2 docked at the Brooklyn cruise terminal, while the QE2 docked in Manhattan. The two liners departed New York on 16 October for the final eastbound crossing, arriving in Southampton on 22 October. This marked the end of &quot;QE2&quot;″s transatlantic voyages.

==== Final voyage ====
On her final arrival into Southampton, &quot;QE2&quot; (on 11 November 2008, with 1,700 passengers and 1,000 crew on board) ran aground in the Solent near the Southampton Water entrance at 5.26 am, on a triangular sandbank roughly equidistant between the mouth of Southampton Water and East Cowes named Bramble Bank. BBC reported &quot;Cunard has confirmed it touched the bottom at the Brambles Turn sandbank (sandback) near Calshot, Southampton Water, with three tugs attached to her stern (0530 GMT). A fourth tug secured a line to the ship&#x27;s bow.&quot; Solent Coastguard stated: &quot;Five tugs were sent out to assist her getting off the sandbank, and she was pulled off just before 6.10 am. She had been refloated and was under way under her own power and heading back to her berth in Southampton. She had only partially gone aground, and the tugs pulled her off.&quot;

Once safely back at her berth, preparations continued for her farewell celebrations. These were led by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh who toured the ship at great length. He visited areas of interest including the Engine Control Room. He also met with current and former crew members. During this time, divers were sent down to inspect the hull for any possible damage caused by the vessel&#x27;s earlier mishap – none was found.
&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; left Southampton Docks for the final time at 1915 GMT on 11 November 2008, to begin her farewell voyage by the name of &quot;&quot;QE2&quot;″s Final Voyage&quot;. After purchasing her for US$100 million her ownership passed to Nakheel Properties, a company of Dubai World, on 26 November. The decommissioning of the ship was particularly poignant for &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;″s only permanent resident, Beatrice Muller, aged 89, who lived on board in retirement for nine years, at a cost of some £3,500 (~€4,300, ~$5,400) per month.

At the time of her retirement, &quot;QE2&quot; had sailed 5.8 million nautical miles, carried close to 3 million passengers and completed 806 transatlantic crossings, plus 26 world cruises.

===Istithmar, Nakheel, &quot;QE2&quot; in Dubai and Cape Town hotel proposal===

Her final voyage from Southampton to Dubai under the command of Captain Ian McNaught began on 11 November 2008, arriving on 26 November in a flotilla of 60 smaller vessels, led by MY &quot;Dubai&quot;, the personal yacht of Sheikh Mohammed, ruler of Dubai, in time for her official handover the following day.

She was greeted with a fly-past from an Emirates Airbus A380 jet and a huge fireworks display, while thousands of people gathered at the Mina Rashid, waving the flags of the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Since her arrival in Dubai &quot;QE2&quot; remained moored at Port Rashid. Shortly after her final passengers were disembarked, she was moved forward to the cargo area of the port, to free up the passenger terminal for other cruise vessels.

She was expected to be refurbished and berthed permanently at Nakheel&#x27;s Palm Jumeirah as &quot;a luxury floating hotel, retail, museum and entertainment destination.&quot; The refurbishment planned to see &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; transformed into a tourist destination in Dubai; however, due to the global economic crisis, &quot;QE2&quot; remained moored at Port Rashid awaiting a decision about her future.

&quot;QE2&quot; remained an oceangoing vessel at this time, and as such, former Captain Ronald Warwick of &quot;QE2&quot; and (&quot;QM2&quot;) and retired commodore of the Cunard Line was initially employed by V-Ships, who managed &quot;QE2&quot; post the Cunard handed her over as the vessel&#x27;s legal master, but was replaced by other V-Ships captains over time as the ship remained idle.

It was anticipated that &quot;QE2&quot; would be moved to the Dubai Drydocks sometime in 2009 to begin a series of far-reaching refurbishments which would result in a conversion into a floating hotel.

Due to the 2008 global recession, it was rumoured that &quot;QE2&quot;″s refurbishment and hotel conversion would not take place and that the ship would be resold. These rumours resulted in the owners, Istithmar, issuing a series of press releases stating that plans for QE2&#x27;s conversion were ongoing, with no intention to sell. However, since arriving in Dubai the only visible exterior change to &quot;QE2&quot; was the painting out of the Cunard titles from the ship&#x27;s superstructure.

&quot;QE2&quot; was joined in Mina Rashid by &quot;QM2&quot; on 21 March 2009 while &quot;QM2&quot; visited Dubai as part of her 2009 world cruise. She was joined once again by (&quot;QV&quot;) on 29 March 2009 as a part of her 2009 world cruise. &quot;QM2&quot; and &quot;QV&quot; again visited &quot;QE2&quot; in 2010 and on 31 March 2011 the new &quot;(QE)&quot; called at Dubai during her maiden world cruise – photos were arranged by Cunard to capture the occasion. &quot;QM2&quot; called in Dubai two days after &quot;QE&quot; left.

In April 2009, a supposed concept model of the post-refurbishment &quot;Hotel QE2&quot; was shown for sale on an online auction website. The model depicted a much altered &quot;QE2&quot;.

In June 2009, the &quot;Southampton Daily Echo&quot; reported that &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; would return to the UK as an operating cruise ship. On 10 July 2009, it was revealed that &quot;QE2&quot; might sail to Cape Town, South Africa, to become a floating hotel for use primarily during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in a Dubai World sponsored venture at the V&amp;A Waterfront. This was confirmed by Nakheel on 20 July 2009. In preparation for this expected voyage the ship was placed into the Dubai Drydock and underwent an extensive exterior refurbishment. During this refit, the ship&#x27;s underwater hull was repainted and inspected. Shortly after the refit, &quot;QE2&quot; was registered under the flag of Vanuatu, and Port Vila was painted on her stern, replacing Southampton. &quot;QE2&quot; returned to Port Rashid, where it was anticipated she would soon sail for Cape Town. The arrival of &quot;QE2&quot; in Cape Town was expected to create many local jobs including hotel staff, restaurant staff, chefs, cleaners and shop attendants, all being sourced from the local workforce. But, in January 2010, it was confirmed that &quot;QE2&quot; would not be moved to Cape Town.

===2010 sale and relocation speculation===
In early 2010, due to the continued poor financial performance of Dubai World, there was much media speculation that &quot;QE2&quot;, along with other assets owned by Istithmar, Dubai World&#x27;s private-equity arm, would be sold to raise capital. Despite this sale speculation, a number of alternative locations for QE2 were cited including London, Singapore, Clydebank, Japan and Fremantle, the latter showing interest in using QE2 as a hotel for the ISAF Sailing World Championships to be held in December 2011. However, as at June 2010 Nakheel&#x27;s official statement regarding QE2 was that &quot;a number of options being considered for QE2&quot;.

===2011 drifting===
On 28 January 2011 during a heavy dust storm, &quot;QE2&quot; broke loose from her moorings and drifted out into the channel at Port Rashid. She was attended by pilots and tugs and safely returned to berth at Port Rashid. Images of &quot;QE2&quot;&#x27;s unexpected movements appeared on-line after being taken by an observer on the ship in front of QE2.

===Warm layup===
Throughout 2011 and 2012, &quot;QE2&quot; remained berthed at Port Mina Rashid in Dubai . She was maintained in a seaworthy condition and generated her own power. Each of her nine diesel generators were turned over and used to power the ship. A live-in crew of approximately 50 people maintained &quot;QE2&quot; to a high standard. Activities include painting, maintenance, cabin checks, and overhauls of machinery. Istithmar were considering plans for &quot;QE2&quot; which could have involved the ship sailing to an alternative location under her own power.

On 21 March 2011, &quot;QM2&quot; called in Dubai and docked close to &quot;QE2&quot;. During the departure, the two ships sounded their horns.

===2011 move to Liverpool plan, Port Rashid and &quot;QE2&quot; development plans===
On 28 September 2011 news circulated that a plan was being formulated to return QE2 to the United Kingdom by berthing her in Liverpool. Liverpool has a historic connection with Cunard Line being the first British home for the line as well as housing the iconic Cunard Building.

It was revealed that Liverpool Vision, the economic development company responsible for Liverpool&#x27;s regeneration, has been involved in confidential discussions with Out of Time Concepts, a company headed by a former Chief Engineer on the ship, who recently advised its current owners on plans to turn it into a luxury hotel in Dubai.

In a letter from Out of Time Concepts to Liverpool Vision, it was explained that &quot;The free global media attention derived from bringing home &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; will without question promote Liverpool&#x27;s new waterfront developments, its amazing architecture, its maritime and world heritage sites, its museums, its culture and its history&quot;.

On the same week that the Liverpool Vision plans were revealed, Nakheel stated that plans for &quot;QE2&quot; to be berthed at The Palm had been dropped because they now planned to build 102 houses on the site which was once intended to be named the QE2 Precinct.

Nakheel suggested that &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, under the ownership of Istithmar, would remain at Port Rashid to become an integral part of the growing cruise terminal. &quot;The &quot;QE2&quot; would be placed in a much better location&quot;, Ali Rashid Lootah, the chairman of Nakheel, told Dubai&#x27;s The National newspaper &quot;The Government of Dubai is developing an up-to-date modern cruise terminal which will mean a better environment&quot;, confirming the ship would remain in Dubai for the foreseeable future.

===2011–2012 New Year&#x27;s party aboard &quot;QE2&quot;===
On 31 December 2011, &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; was the location of a lavish New Year&#x27;s Eve party in Dubai. The black tie event was run by Global Event Management and included over 1,000 guests. Global Event Management were offering events aboard QE2 in Dubai for 2012 and 2013.

===July 2012: Hotel announcement===
On 2 July 2012 in a coordinated press release, the ship&#x27;s owner, operator and Port Rashid operator, DP Ports, jointly announced &quot;QE2&quot; would re-open as a 300-bed hotel after an 18-month refit. The release claims the ship was to be refitted to restore original features, including her 1994–2008 &#x27;Heritage Trail&#x27; of classic Cunard artefacts. The ship was to be berthed alongside a redeveloped Port Rashid cruise terminal which would double as a maritime museum.

===Scrapping in China, &quot;QE2&quot; London and &quot;QE2&quot; Asia===
On 23 December 2012, it was reported that &quot;QE2&quot; had been sold for scrapping in China for £20 million, after a bid to return her to the UK was rejected. With monthly berthing and maintenance charges of £650,000, it was reported that a Chinese salvage crew arrived at the vessel on 21 December, to replace a crew of 40 which has been maintaining the vessel since it arrived at Port Rashid. However, Cunard dismissed the reports as &quot;pure speculation&quot;. When the ship was sold in 2007, a clause in the contract which started from her retirement in 2009 stipulated a ten-year &quot;no onward sale&quot; clause, without payment of a full purchase price default penalty.

The &quot;&quot;QE2&quot; London&quot; Plan had included a £20 million bid for &quot;QE2&quot; and a further £40 million refurbishment that was supposed to create more than 2,000 jobs in London, with &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; docked near the O2 Arena. It had reportedly obtained the support of the then London Mayor Boris Johnson.
On 17 January 2013, the Dubai Drydocks World announced that &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; would be sent to an unknown location in Asia to serve as a floating luxury hotel, shopping mall, and museum. Despite this move, the QE2 London team stated on the same day that &quot;We believe our investors can show Dubai that &quot;QE2&quot; London is still the best proposal&quot;.

===&quot;Bring &quot;QE2&quot; Home&quot; proposals===
Cunard&#x27;s 175th anniversary celebrations on 25 May 2015 led to renewed interest in &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. John Chillingworth secured the backing of London mayor Boris Johnson for a plan to anchor the ship opposite The O2 Arena at Greenwich. A move to London however would require the ship to pass through the Thames Barrier. In late 2015 there was disagreement between ship preservation advocates and harbour authorities on whether a dead ship of her size could safely manoeuvre through the barrier. John Houston suggested returning the ship to Greenock as a maritime attraction, hotel and events space.

Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe has called on the UK and Scottish governments to campaign to buy the ship, saying that &quot;Bringing the &quot;QE2&quot; home is a Herculean task, one that requires national support in Scotland and perhaps across the UK, if it has any chance of happening.&quot; In January 2016 Aubrey Fawcett, the chair of the working group to regenerate the Clyde, admitted defeat in this effort as &quot;QE2&#x27;s&quot; owners refused to respond to any requests regarding her condition or sale. &quot;Consequently, we must conclude that it is highly unlikely that Scotland features in the future plans for the vessel.&quot;

===2015–2016===

On 12 August 2015, the QE2 was observed to have been moved from her berth within Dubai Dry Docks, where she had been since January 2013, to a more open location within Port Rashid. On 17 November 2015, QE2 was again moved within Port Rashid, to the former cruise terminal. It was not known whether these recent moves are connected with any of the publicly known plans regarding the ship&#x27;s fate.

Between May and August 2016, observers noted that the ship&#x27;s lifeboats were lowered and stored on a nearby car park. Following this, the lifeboat davits were removed in September, giving the ship an altered profile on her boat deck. Subsequently, the wooden decking was removed from the deck and replaced by synthetic block flooring.

===50th anniversary celebration===
September 2017 marked the 50th anniversary of QE2&#x27;s launch. To mark the occasion, Cunard Line, the ship&#x27;s former owners, arranged a commemorative voyage aboard MS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; – a 17-night cruise, with special activities and theme days. Meanwhile, in Glasgow, the QE2 Story Forum hosted a 50th anniversary conference with Captain Nick Bates as a speaker. Several books were released for the anniversary, including &quot;Building the Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; by Cunard historian Michael Gallagher, and &quot;QE2: A 50th Anniversary Celebration&quot; by Chris Frame and Rachelle Cross.

==Hotel and tourist attraction==

&quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; reopened in Dubai as a floating hotel on 18 April 2018 following an extensive refurbishment. Over 2.7 million man-hours were committed to the work to upgrade and rebuild the ship to meet hotel standards. This included a full hull repaint and the replacing of Port Vila registry with Dubai on her stern. It was a &#x27;soft opening&#x27; while remaining work continued.

On board is a new QE2 Heritage Exhibition, adjacent to the lobby, detailing the vessel&#x27;s history. The ship was operated by PCFC Hotels, a division of the Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, which is owned by the Dubai government. French hospitality group Accor took over operation of the hotel and attraction in May 2022. Accor has announced plans to further renovate the vessel; following completion there will be 447 hotel rooms.

<text>A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and higher speeds made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.

Biplanes offer several advantages over conventional cantilever monoplane designs: they permit lighter wing structures, low wing loading and smaller span for a given wing area. However, interference between the airflow over each wing increases drag substantially, and biplanes generally need extensive bracing, which causes additional drag.

Biplanes are distinguished from tandem wing arrangements, where the wings are placed forward and aft, instead of above and below.

The term is also occasionally used in biology, to describe the wings of some flying animals.

==Characteristics==

In a biplane aircraft, two wings are placed one above the other. Each provides part of the lift, although they are not able to produce twice as much lift as a single wing of similar size and shape because the upper and the lower are working on nearly the same portion of the atmosphere and thus interfere with each other&#x27;s behaviour. In a biplane configuration with no stagger from the upper wing to the lower wing, the lift coefficient is reduced by 10 to 15 percent compared to that of a monoplane using the same airfoil and aspect ratio.
The lower wing is usually attached to the fuselage, while the upper wing is raised above the fuselage with an arrangement of cabane struts, although other arrangements have been used. Either or both of the main wings can support ailerons, while flaps are more usually positioned on the lower wing. Bracing is nearly always added between the upper and lower wings, in the form of interplane struts positioned symmetrically on either side of the fuselage and bracing wires to keep the structure from flexing, where the wings are not themselves cantilever structures.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

The primary advantage of the biplane over a monoplane is its ability to combine greater stiffness with lower weight. Stiffness requires structural depth and where early monoplanes had to have this provided with external bracing, the biplane naturally has a deep structure and is therefore easier to make both light and strong. Rigging wires on non-cantilevered monoplanes are at a much sharper angle, thus providing less tension to ensure stiffness of the outer wing. On a biplane, since the angles are closer to the ideal of being in direct line with the forces being opposed, the overall structure can then be made stiffer. Because of the reduced stiffness, wire braced monoplanes often had multiple sets of flying and landing wires where a biplane could easily be built with one bay, with one set of landing and flying wires. The extra drag from the wires was not enough to offset the aerodynamic disadvantages from having two airfoils interfering with each other however. Strut braced monoplanes were tried but none of them were successful, not least due to the drag from the number of struts used.

The structural forces acting on the spars of a biplane wing tend to be lower as they are divided between four spars rather than two, so the wing can use less material to obtain the same overall strength and is therefore lighter. A given area of wing also tends to be shorter, reducing bending moments on the spars, which then allow them to be more lightly built as well. The biplane does however need extra struts to maintain the gap between the wings, which add both weight and drag.

The low power supplied by the engines available in the first years of aviation limited aeroplanes to fairly low speeds. This required an even lower stalling speed, which in turn required a low wing loading, combining both large wing area with light weight. Obtaining a large enough wing area without the wings being long, and thus dangerously flexible was more readily accomplished with a biplane.

The smaller biplane wing allows greater maneuverability. Following World War I, this helped extend the era of the biplane and, despite the performance disadvantages, most fighter aircraft were biplanes as late as the mid-1930s. Specialist sports aerobatic biplanes are still made in small numbers.

Biplanes suffer aerodynamic interference between the two planes when the high pressure air under the top wing and the low pressure air above the lower wing cancel each other out. This means that a biplane does not in practice obtain twice the lift of the similarly-sized monoplane. The farther apart the wings are spaced the less the interference, but the spacing struts must be longer, and the gap must be extremely large to reduce it appreciably.

As engine power and speeds rose late in World War I, thick cantilever wings with inherently lower drag and higher wing loading became practical, which in turn made monoplanes more attractive as it helped solve the structural problems associated with monoplanes, but offered little improvement for biplanes.

=== Stagger ===

The default design for a biplane has the wings positioned directly one above the other. Moving the upper wing forward relative to the lower one is called positive stagger or, more often, simply stagger. It can increase lift and reduce drag by reducing the aerodynamic interference effects between the two wings by a small degree, but more often was used to improve access to the cockpit. Many biplanes have staggered wings. Common examples include the de Havilland Tiger Moth, Bücker Bü 131 Jungmann and Travel Air 2000.

Alternatively, the lower wing can instead be moved ahead of the upper wing, giving negative stagger, and similar benefits. This is usually done in a given design for structural reasons, or to improve visibility. Examples of negative stagger include the Sopwith Dolphin, Breguet 14 and Beechcraft Staggerwing. However, positive (forward) stagger is much more common.

=== Bays ===
The space enclosed by a set of interplane struts is called a &quot;bay&quot; (much as the architectural form is used), hence a biplane or triplane with one set of such struts connecting the wings on each side of the aircraft is a &quot;single-bay biplane&quot;. This provided sufficient strength for smaller aircraft such as the First World War-era Fokker D.VII fighter and the Second World War de Havilland Tiger Moth basic trainer.

The larger two-seat Curtiss JN-4 Jenny is a &quot;two bay biplane&quot;, the extra bay being necessary as overlong bays are prone to flexing and can fail. The SPAD S.XIII fighter, while appearing to be a two bay biplane, has only one bay, but has the midpoints of the rigging braced with additional struts; however, these are not structurally contiguous from top to bottom wing. The Sopwith 1½ Strutter has a W shape cabane, however as it does not connect the wings to each other, it does not add to the number of bays.

Large transport and bombing biplanes often needed still more bays to provide sufficient strength. These are often referred to as &quot;multi-bay biplanes&quot;. A small number of biplanes, such as the Zeppelin-Lindau D.I have no interplane struts and are referred to as being &quot;strutless&quot;.
=== Rigging ===

Because most biplanes do not have cantilever structures, they require rigging wires to maintain their rigidity. Early aircraft used simple wire (either braided or plain), however during the First World War, the British Royal Aircraft Factory developed airfoil section wire named RAFwire in an effort to both increase the strength and reduce the drag. 
Four types of wires are used in the biplane wing structure. Drag wires inside the wings prevent the wings from being folded back against the fuselage, running inside a wing bay from the forward inboard corner to the rear outboard corner. Anti-drag wires prevent the wings from moving forward when the aircraft stops and run the opposite direction to the drag wires. Both of these are usually hidden within the wings, and if the structure is sufficiently stiff otherwise, may be omitted in some designs. Indeed many early aircraft relied on the fabric covering of the wing to provide this rigidity, until higher speeds and forces made this inadequate. 
Externally, lift wires prevent the wings from folding up, and run from the underside of the outer wing to the lower wing root. Conversely, landing wires prevent the wings from sagging, and resist the forces when an aircraft is landing, and run from the upper wing centre section to outboard on the lower wings. Additional drag and anti-drag wires may be used to brace the cabane struts which connect the fuselage to the wings, and interplane struts, which connect the upper and lower wings together.

===Sesquiplane=== 

The &quot;sesquiplane&quot; is a type of biplane where one wing (usually the lower) is significantly smaller than the other. The word, from Latin, means &quot;one-and-a-half wings&quot;. The arrangement can reduce drag and weight while retaining the biplane&#x27;s structural advantages. The lower wing may have a significantly shorter span, or a reduced chord.

Examples include the series of Nieuport military aircraft—from the Nieuport 10 through to the Nieuport 27 which formed the backbone of the Allied air forces between 1915 and 1917. The performance of the Nieuport sesquiplanes was so impressive that the (the German Inspectorate of flying troops) requested their aircraft manufacturers to produce copies, an effort which was aided by several captured aircraft and detailed drawings; one of the most famed copies was the Siemens-Schuckert D.I. The Albatros D.III and D.V, which had also copied the general layout from Nieuport, similarly provided the backbone of the German forces during the First World War. The Albatros sesquiplanes were widely acclaimed by their aircrews for their maneuverability and high rate of climb.

During interwar period, the sesquiplane configuration continued to be popular, with numerous types such as the Nieuport-Delage NiD 42/52/62 series, Fokker C.Vd &amp; e, and Potez 25, all serving across a large number of air forces. In the general aviation sector, aircraft such as the Waco Custom Cabin series proved to be relatively popular. The Saro Windhover was a sesquiplane with the upper wing smaller than the lower, which was a much rarer configuration than the reverse. The Pfalz D.III also featured a somewhat unusual sesquiplane arrangement, possessing a more substantial lower wing with two spars that eliminated the flutter problems encountered by single-spar sesquiplanes.

==History==


The stacking of wing planes was suggested by Sir George Cayley in 1843. Hiram Maxim adopted the idea for his steam-powered test rig, which lifted off but was held down by safety rails, in 1894. Otto Lilienthal designed and flew two different biplane hang gliders in 1895, though he is better known for his monoplanes. By 1896 a group of young men in the United States, led by Octave Chanute, were flying hang gliders including biplanes and concluded that the externally braced biplane offered better prospects for powered flight than the monoplane. In 1903, the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; biplane became the first successful powered aeroplane.

Throughout the pioneer years, both biplanes and monoplanes were common, but by the outbreak of the First World War biplanes had gained favour after several monoplane structural failures resulted in the RFC&#x27;s &quot;Monoplane Ban&quot; when all monoplanes in military service were grounded, while the French also withdrew most monoplanes from combat roles and relegated them to training. Figures such as aviation author Bruce observed that there was an apparent prejudice held even against newly-designed monoplanes, such as the Bristol M.1, that caused even those with relatively high performance attributes to be overlooked in favour of &#x27;orthodox&#x27; biplanes, and there was an allegedly widespread belief held at that time that monoplane aircraft were inherently unsafe during combat.

Between the years of 1914 and 1925, a clear majority of new aircraft introduced were biplanes; however, during the latter years of the First World War, the Germans had been experimenting with a new generation of monoplanes, such as the Fokker D.VIII, that might have ended the biplane&#x27;s advantages earlier had the conflict not ended when it had. The French were also introducing the Morane-Saulnier AI, a strut-braced parasol monoplane, although the type was quickly relegated to the advanced trainer role following the resolution of structural issues. Sesquiplane types, which were biplanes with abbreviated lower wings such as the French Nieuport 17 and German Albatros D.III, offered lower drag than a conventional biplane while being stronger than a monoplane.

During the Interwar period, numerous biplane airliners were introduced. The British de Havilland Dragon was a particularly successful aircraft, using straightforward design to could carry six passengers on busy routes, such as London-Paris services. During early August 1934, one such aircraft, named &quot;Trail of the Caribou&quot;, performed the first non-stop flight between the Canadian mainland and Britain in 30 hours 55 minutes, although the intended target for this long distance flight had originally been Baghdad, Iraq. Despite its relative success, British production of the Dragon was quickly ended when in favour of the more powerful and elegant de Havilland Dragon Rapide, which had been specifically designed to be a faster and more comfortable successor to the Dragon.
As the available engine power and speed increased, the drag penalty of external bracing increasingly limited aircraft performance. To fly faster, it would be necessary to reduce external bracing to create an aerodynamically clean design; however, early cantilever designs were either too weak or too heavy. The 1917 Junkers J.I sesquiplane utilized aluminum for all flying surfaces, with a minimum of struts; however, it was relatively easy to damage the thin metal skin and required careful handling by ground crews. The 1918 Zeppelin-Lindau D.I fighter was an all-metal stressed-skin monocoque fully cantilevered biplane, but its arrival had come too late to see combat use in the conflict.

By the 1930s, biplanes had reached their performance limits, and monoplanes become increasingly predominant, particularly in continental Europe where monoplanes had been increasingly common from the end of World War I. At the start of World War II, several air forces still had biplane combat aircraft in front line service but they were no longer competitive, and most were used in niche roles, such as training or shipboard operation, until shortly after the end of the war. The British Gloster Gladiator biplane, the Italian Fiat CR.42 Falco and Soviet I-153 sesquiplane fighters were all still operational after 1939. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the CR.42 was able to achieve success in the defensive night fighter role against RAF bombers that were striking industrial targets throughout northern Italy.
The British Fleet Air Arm operated the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber from its aircraft carriers, and used the type in the anti-submarine warfare role until the end of the conflict, largely due to their ability to operate from the relatively compact decks of escort carriers. Its low stall speed and inherently tough design made it ideal for operations even in the often severe mid-Atlantic weather conditions. By the end of the conflict, the Swordfish held the distinction of having caused the destruction of a greater tonnage of Axis shipping than any other Allied aircraft.

Both the German Heinkel He 50 and the Soviet Polikarpov Po-2 were used with relative success in the night ground attack role throughout the Second World War. In the case of the Po-2, production of the aircraft continued even after the end of the conflict, not ending until around 1952. A significant number of Po-2s were fielded by the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force during the Korean War, inflicting serious damage during night raids on United Nations bases. The Po-2 is also the only biplane to be credited with a documented jet-kill, as one Lockheed F-94 Starfire was lost while slowing down to – below its stall speed – during an intercept in order to engage the low flying Po-2.

Later biplane trainers included the de Havilland Tiger Moth in the Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and others and the Stampe SV.4, which saw service postwar in the French and Belgian Air Forces. The Stearman PT-13 was widely used by the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) while the US Navy operated the Naval Aircraft Factory N3N. In later civilian use in the US, the Stearman became particularly associated with stunt flying such as wing-walking, and with crop dusting, where its compactness worked well at low levels, where it had to dodge obstacles.
Modern biplane designs still exist in specialist roles such as aerobatics and agricultural aircraft with the competition aerobatics role and format for such a biplane well-defined by the mid-1930s by the Udet U 12 Flamingo and Waco Taperwing. The Pitts Special dominated aerobatics for many years after World War II and is still in production.

The vast majority of biplane designs have been fitted with reciprocating engines. Exceptions include the Antonov An-3 and WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, fitted with turboprop and turbofan engines respectively. Some older biplane designs, such as the Grumman Ag Cat are available in upgraded versions with turboprop engines.

The two most produced biplane designs were the 1913 British Avro 504 of which 11,303 were built, and the 1928 Soviet Polikarpov Po-2 of which over 20,000 were built, with the Po-2 being the direct replacement for the Soviet copy of the Avro 504. Both were widely used as trainers. The Antonov An-2 was very successful too, with more than 18,000 built.

===Ultralight aircraft===

Although most ultralights are monoplanes, the low speeds and simple construction involved have inspired a small number of biplane ultralights, such as Larry Mauro&#x27;s &quot;Easy Riser&quot; (1975–). Mauro also made a version powered with solar cells driving an electric motor called the Solar Riser. Mauro&#x27;s &quot;Easy Riser&quot; was used by &quot;Father Goose&quot;, Bill Lishman.

Other biplane ultralights include the Belgian-designed Aviasud Mistral, the German FK12 Comet (1997–), the Lite Flyer Biplane, the Sherwood Ranger, and the Murphy Renegade.

==Avian evolution==
The feathered dinosaur &quot;Microraptor gui&quot; glided, and perhaps even flew, on four wings, which may have been configured in a staggered sesquiplane arrangement. This was made possible by the presence of flight feathers on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, with the feathers on the forelimbs opening to a greater span. It has been suggested that the hind limbs could not have opened out sideways but in flight would have hung below and slightly behind the fore limbs.

<text>Ignacy Błażej Franciszek Krasicki (3 February 173514 March 1801), from 1766 Prince-Bishop of Warmia (in German, &quot;Ermland&quot;) and from 1795 Archbishop of Gniezno (thus, Primate of Poland), was Poland&#x27;s leading Enlightenment poet (&quot;the Prince of Poets&quot;), a critic of the clergy, Poland&#x27;s La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel, playwright, journalist, encyclopedist, and translator from French and Greek.

His most notable literary works were his &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; (1779), &quot;Satires&quot; (1779), and poetic letters and religious lyrics, in which the artistry of his poetic language reached its summit.

==Life==
Ignacy Krasicki was born in Dubiecko, on southern Poland&#x27;s San River, into the noble Krasicki family, which bore the title of Imperial Count. His parents were Count Jan Boży Krasicki (1704–1751) and the Count&#x27;s wife, Anna Starzechowska (1706–1766) of the Nieczuja coat of arms. Ignacy was related by blood to the most illustrious families in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the Sapieha, Potocki, and Rzewuski families, and spent his childhood surrounded with the love and solicitude of his own family.

He attended a Jesuit school in Lwów, then studied at a Warsaw Catholic seminary (1751–54). In 1759 he took holy orders and continued his education in Rome (1759–61). Two of his brothers also entered the priesthood.

Returning to Poland, Krasicki became secretary to the Primate of Poland and developed a friendship with future King Stanisław August Poniatowski. When Poniatowski was elected king (1764), Krasicki became his chaplain. He participated in the King&#x27;s famous &quot;Thursday dinners&quot; and co-founded the &quot;Monitor&quot;, the preeminent Polish Enlightenment periodical, sponsored by the King.
In 1766 Krasicki, after having served that year as coadjutor to Prince-Bishop of Warmia Adam Stanisław Grabowski, was himself elevated to Prince-Bishop of Warmia and &quot;ex officio&quot; membership in the Senate of the Commonwealth. This office gave him a high standing in the social hierarchy and a sense of independence. It did not, however, prove a quiet haven. The Warmia cathedral chapter welcomed its superior coolly, fearing changes. At the same time, there were growing provocations and pressures from Prussia, preparatory to seizure of Warmia in the First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Krasicki protested publicly against external intervention.

In 1772, as a result of the First Partition, instigated by Prussia&#x27;s King Frederick II (&quot;the Great&quot;), Krasicki became a Prussian subject. He did not, however, pay homage to Warmia&#x27;s new master.

He now made frequent visits to Berlin, Potsdam and Sanssouci at the bidding of Frederick, with whom he cultivated an acquaintance. This created a difficult situation for the poet-bishop who, while a friend of the Polish king, maintained close relations with the Prussian king. These realities could not but influence the nature and direction of Krasicki&#x27;s subsequent literary productions, perhaps nowhere more so than in the &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; (1779).

Soon after the First Partition, Krasicki officiated at the 1773 opening of Berlin&#x27;s St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral, which Frederick had built for Catholic immigrants to Brandenburg and Berlin. In 1786 Krasicki was called to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. His residences in the castle of the bishops of Warmia at Lidzbark Warmiński (in German, &quot;Heilsberg&quot;) and in the summer palace of the bishops of Warmia at Smolajny became centers of artistic patronage for all sectors of partitioned Poland.

After Frederick the Great&#x27;s death, Krasicki continued relations with Frederick&#x27;s successor.

In 1795, six years before his death, Krasicki was elevated to Archbishop of Gniezno (thus, to Primate of Poland).

Krasicki was honored by Poland&#x27;s King Stanisław August Poniatowski with the Order of the White Eagle and the Order of Saint Stanisław, as well as with a special 1780 medal featuring the Latin device, &quot;Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori&quot; (&quot;The Muse will not let perish a man deserving of glory&quot;); and by Prussia&#x27;s King Frederick the Great, with the Order of the Red Eagle.

Upon his death in Berlin in 1801, Krasicki was laid to rest at St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral, which he had consecrated. In 1829 his remains were transferred to Poland&#x27;s Gniezno Cathedral.

Czesław Miłosz describes Krasicki:

==Works==
Ignacy Krasicki was the leading literary representative of the Polish Enlightenment—a prose writer and poet highly esteemed by his contemporaries, who admired his works for their wit, imagination, and fluid style.

Krasicki&#x27;s literary writings lent splendor to the reign of Poland&#x27;s King Stanisław August Poniatowski, while not directly advocating the King&#x27;s political program.

Krasicki, the leading representative of Polish classicism, debuted as a poet with the strophe-hymn, &quot;Święta miłości kochanej ojczyzny&quot; (&quot;O Sacred Love of the Beloved Country&quot;), published in 1774. He was then nearing forty. It was thus a late debut that brought the extraordinary success of this strophe, which Krasicki would incorporate as part of song IX in his mock-heroic poem, &quot;Myszeida&quot; (Mouseiad, 1775). In &quot;O Sacred Love of the Beloved Country,&quot; Krasicki formulated a universal idea of patriotism, expressed in high style and elevated tone. The strophe would later, for many years, serve as a national anthem and see many translations, including three into French.

The Prince Bishop of Warmia gave excellent Polish form to all the genres of European classicism. He also blazed paths for new genres. Prominent among these was the first modern Polish novel, &quot;Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki&quot; (The Adventures of Nicholas Experience, 1776), a synthesis of all the varieties of the Enlightenment novel: the social-satirical, the adventure (&quot;à la&quot; &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;), the Utopian, and the didactic.

Tradition has it that Krasicki&#x27;s mock-heroic poem, &quot;Monachomachia&quot; (War of the Monks, 1778), was inspired by a conversation with Frederick II at the palace of Sanssouci, where Krasicki was staying in an apartment that had once been used by Voltaire. At the time, the poem&#x27;s publication caused a public scandal.

The most enduring literary monument of the Polish Enlightenment is Krasicki&#x27;s fables: &quot;Bajki i Przypowieści&quot; (Fables and Parables, 1779) and &quot;Bajki nowe&quot; (New Fables, published posthumously in 1802). The poet also set down his trenchant observations of the world and human nature in &quot;Satyry&quot; (Satires, 1779).

Other works by Krasicki include the novels, &quot;Pan Podstoli&quot; (Lord High Steward, published in three parts, 1778, 1784 and posthumously 1803), which would help inspire works by Mickiewicz, and &quot;Historia&quot; (History, 1779); the epic, &quot;Wojna chocimska&quot; (The Chocim War, 1780, about the Khotyn War); and numerous others, in homiletics, theology and heraldry.

In 1781–83 Krasicki published a two-volume encyclopedia, &quot;Zbiór potrzebniejszych wiadomości&quot; (A Collection of Essential Information), the second Polish-language general encyclopedia after Benedykt Chmielowski&#x27;s &quot;Nowe Ateny&quot; (The New Athens, 1745–46).

Krasicki wrote &quot;Listy o ogrodach&quot; (Letters about Gardens) and articles in the &quot;Monitor&quot;, which he had co-founded, and in his own newspaper, &quot;Co Tydzień&quot; (Each Week).

Krasicki translated, into Polish, Plutarch, &quot;Ossian&quot;, fragments of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, and works by Anacreon, Boileau, Hesiod and Theocritus. He wrote a 1772 essay &quot;On the Translation of Books&quot; (&quot;O przekładaniu ksiąg&quot;) and another, published posthumously in 1803, &quot;On Translating Books&quot; (&quot;O tłumaczeniu ksiąg&quot;).

==Fame==

Krasicki&#x27;s major works won European fame and were translated into Latin, French, German, Italian, Russian, Czech, Croatian, Slovene, and Hungarian. The broad reception of his works was sustained throughout the 19th century.

Krasicki has been the subject of works by poets of the Polish EnlightenmentStanisław Trembecki, Franciszek Zabłocki, Wojciech Mierand in the 20th century, by Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński. He has been the hero of prose works by Wincenty Pol, Adolf Nowaczyński and Henryk Sienkiewicz.

==Literary reflection==
Scholars have viewed Krasicki&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;Satires&quot; as adaptive to the culture for which they were written, and as politically charged. The characterizations were not based on reconstructions of individuals from direct observation, but were fictional constructs that reflected society&#x27;s actual values. Krasicki held that Poles, and humanity generally, were governed by greed, folly, and vice.

== Target audience ==
Evidence for this is found in the preface, &quot;To the Children,&quot;, targeted not to children but to villagers, congregations, and the commonalty. The fables were meant to bring attention to major questions of the day, and to advocate for social reforms. Although the &quot;New Fables&quot;, the sequel to the &quot;Fables and Parables&quot;, were published posthumously in 1803, the better known &quot;Fables and Parables&quot; found their audience between 1735 and Krasicki&#x27;s death in 1801, most of them being published after the First Partition of Poland, of 1772. The fables usually find their meaning in the final line, through the symbology of the tale rather than through a complex presentation of ideology, thereby readily conveying even to the illiterate the moral and the Enlightenment ideal behind it.

== Enlightenment contributions ==
Katarzyna Zechenter argues in &quot;The Polish Review&quot; that Western historians have generally overlooked Krasicki&#x27;s works, and that the publisher of &quot;Polish Fables&quot; (1997) overlooked the importance of the &quot;political and social context contributing to [the fable&#x27;s] origin.&quot; However, it is easy to see Krasicki&#x27;s influence on his contemporaries and on the early 19th century, as in the case of Gabriela Puzynina, a Polish princess, poet, and diarist. In 1846 she started a newspaper for the intelligentsia of Vilnius and Warsaw, and furthered the establishment of Krasicki&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; in Poland&#x27;s suppressed political life. In her &quot;Diary of the Years 1815–1843&quot;, Puzynina focuses on the fable, &quot;Birds in a Cage&quot;, as a commentary on the Partitions of Poland.

<text>Laurette Marcia Gemser (born 5 October 1950) is an Indonesian-Dutch retired actress, model and costume designer. She is primarily known for her work in Italian erotic cinema, most notably the &quot;Emanuelle&quot; series. Many of her films were collaborations with directors Joe D&#x27;Amato and Bruno Mattei.

Gemser has also been credited as Moira Chen, most notably in &quot;Love Is Forever&quot; (1983).

==Early life==
Gemser left Indonesia in 1955, at the age of four, and moved with her parents to the Netherlands. She grew up in the Dutch city of Utrecht, where she attended the MULO Regentesseschool high school. After that, she attended the Artibus Art School in Utrecht, where she specialised in fashion design.

==Career==
After modelling in various magazines in the Netherlands and Belgium, in 1974 she moved to Italy to star in the erotic film &quot;Amore libero - Free Love&quot;. The film was a box office success and launched Gemser&#x27;s career. She played one of the masseuses in the 1975 film &quot;Emmanuelle 2&quot; (aka &quot;Emmanuelle, The Joys of a Woman&quot;), and later that year took the starring role in Bitto Albertini&#x27;s &quot;Black Emanuelle&quot;. She starred in 5 &quot;Black Emanuelle&quot; films in less than three years. 

She starred as Laotian actress Keo Sirisomphone in Michael Landon&#x27;s 1983 American television film, &quot;Love Is Forever&quot;, in which she was credited as Moira Chen. During the 1970s and 1980s, she made many movies with Joe D&#x27;Amato. Gemser continued to make films, at times working with her actor husband, Gabriele Tinti (m. 1976-1991). In the 1990s, she retired from films to work on costume designing for film, and completely vanished from the public life.

<text>A carburetor (also spelled carburettor or carburetter) is a device used by a gasoline internal combustion engine to control and mix air and fuel entering the engine. Carburetors can be quite complex but the three primary methods of adding fuel to the intake air in the main metering circuit are through the pressure difference using the Venturi effect from two separate static pressure orifices in the air flow or between the ambient air pressure fed into the fuel bowl and the pressure from Bernoulli&#x27;s principle at the fuel orifice or between the Pitot pressure at the air entry into the carburetor and the pressure from Bernoulli&#x27;s principle at the fuel orifice.

Since the 1990s, carburetors have been largely replaced by fuel injection for cars and trucks, but carburetors are still used by some small engines (e.g. lawnmowers, generators, and concrete mixers) and motorcycles. In addition, they are still widely used on piston-engine–driven aircraft. Diesel engines have always used fuel injection instead of carburetors, as the compression-based combustion of diesel requires the greater precision and pressure of fuel injection.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;carburetor&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;carburet&quot;, which means &quot;to combine with carbon&quot;, or, in particular, &quot;to enrich a gas by combining it with carbon or hydrocarbons&quot;. Thus a carburetor mixes intake air with hydrocarbon-based fuel, such as petrol or autogas (LPG).

The name is spelled &quot;carburetor&quot; in American English and &quot;carburettor&quot; in British English. Colloquial abbreviations include &quot;carb&quot; in the UK and North America or &quot;carby&quot; in Australia.

== Operating principle ==

Air from the atmosphere enters the carburetor (usually via an air cleaner), has fuel added within the carburetor, then passes into the inlet manifold, then through the inlet valve(s), and finally into the combustion chamber. Most engines use a single carburetor shared between all of the cylinders, though some high-performance engines historically had multiple carburetors.

For cars in most cases (except for the &quot;accelerator pump&quot;), the driver pressing the throttle pedal does not directly increase the fuel entering the engine. Instead, as the airflow through the carburetor increases, that in turn increases the amount of fuel drawn into the intake mixture. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle applies (apart from friction and viscosity etc.) to both the air and the fuel, so that the pressure reduction in the air flow tends to be generally proportional to the square of the intake air speed, and the fuel in the main jets will obtain a speed generally as the square root of the pressure reduction so the two will be generally proportional to each other. 

If pressure difference is produced by a reduction of area within the carbureter for the air flow from a first point to the fuel entry point, and the pressure at the first point is fed to the float chamber, the effect on the fuel flow can be described as from the Venturi effect and even though that can be regarded as simply a derivation from the Bernoulli&#x27;s principle at the two positions, the carbureter is using the first method mentioned above. The simplest form of carburetor, and mainly used in older cars, uses the pressure difference from the float chamber which is fed from ambient air, compared with the static pressure at the fuel entry point and thus is using the second method mentioned above. Mainly used in newer cars is form which uses the pressure difference from the float chamber which is fed from the total pressure at the Pitot tube at the air entry into the carburetor, compared with the static pressure at the fuel entry point and thus is using the third method mentioned above. 

The actual fuel and air flows are more complicated and need adjustment. This might be done variously at lower speeds or higher speeds, or over the whole range by a variable emulsion device to add air to the fuel after the main jets/s. In SU and other (e.g. Zenith-Stromberg) variable jet (needle) carburetors, it was mainly controlled by varying the jet size along the needle.

The orientation of the carburetor is a design consideration but does not significantly alter the working principles. Older engines used updraft carburetors, where the air enters from below the carburetor and exits through the top. From the late 1930s, downdraft carburetors become more commonly used (especially in the United States), along with side draft carburetors (especially in Europe).

== Fuel circuits ==
===Main metering circuit===
The main metering circuit usually consists of barrel/s which reduces to a narrow part where the air is at its highest speed often before widening again, forming a throat. Fuel is introduced into the air stream through small tubes leading from the main jet being driven by the difference in pressure to that at the float bowl. The pressure in the float bowl may be from static pressure at a position upstream of the throat or a vent from ambient air or from total pressure near the air entry into the carburetor with pitot tube/s (as in photo of High performance four-barrel carburetor below).

Downstream of the throat is a throttle (usually in the form of a butterfly valve) which is used to control the amount of air entering the carburetor. In a car, this throttle is usually mechanically connected to the vehicle&#x27;s throttle pedal, which varies engine speed.

At lesser throttle openings, the air speed through the throat may be insufficient to maintain the fuel flow, so then the fuel may be supplied by the carburetor&#x27;s idle and/or off-idle circuits.

At greater throttle openings, the speed of air passing through the throat increases, which lowers the pressure of the air and draws more fuel into the airstream. At the same time, the reduced manifold vacuum results in less fuel flow through the idle and/or off-idle circuits.

==== Choke ====
During cold weather fuel vaporizes less readily and tends to condense on the walls of the intake manifold, starving the cylinders of fuel and making cold starts difficult. Additional fuel is required (for a given amount of air) to start and run the engine until it warms up, provided by a &quot;choke valve&quot;.

While the engine is warming up the choke valve is partially closed, restricting the flow of air at the entrance to the carburetor. This increases the vacuum in the main metering circuit, causing more fuel to be supplied to the engine via the main jets. Alternately, a mechanical system can form a parallel path for extra fuel to flow in the carburetor without using a restriction of the air flow. 

Prior to the late 1950s the choke was usually manually operated by the driver, often using a lever or knob on the dashboard. Since then, automatic chokes became more commonplace. These either use a bimetallic thermostat to automatically regulate the choke based on the temperature of the engine&#x27;s coolant liquid, an electrical resistance heater to do so, or air drawn through a tube connected to an engine exhaust source. A choke left closed after the engine has warmed up increases the engine&#x27;s fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and causes the engine to run rough and lack power due to an over-rich fuel mixture. However, excessive fuel can flood an engine and prevent it from starting. To remove the excess fuel, many carburetors with automatic chokes allow it to be held open (by manually, depressing the accelerator pedal to the floor and briefly holding it there while cranking the starter) to allow extra air into the engine until the excess fuel is cleared out.

Another method used by carburetors to improve the operation of a cold engine is a &quot;fast idle cam&quot;, which is connected to the choke and prevents the throttle from closing fully while the choke is in operation. The resulting increase in idle speed provides a more stable idle for a cold engine (by better atomizing the cold fuel) and helps the engine warm up quicker.

=== Idle circuit ===
The system within a carburetor that meters fuel when the engine is running at low RPM. The idle circuit is generally activated by vacuum near the (near closed) throttle plate, where the air speed increases to cause a low-pressure area in the idle passage/port, thus causing fuel to flow through the idle jet. The idle jet is set at some constant value by the carburetor manufacturer, thus flowing a specified amount of fuel.

===Off-idle circuit===
Many carburetors use an off-idle circuit, which includes an additional fuel jet which is briefly used as the throttle starts to open. This jet is located in a low-pressure area caused by the high air speed near the (partly closed) throttle. The additional fuel it provides is used to compensate for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the throttle is opened, thus smoothing the transition from the idle circuit to the main metering circuit.

===Power valve===
In a four-stroke engine it is often desirable to provide extra fuel to the engine at high loads (to increase the power output and reduce engine knocking). A &#x27;power valve&#x27;, which is a spring-loaded valve in the carburetor that is held shut by engine vacuum, is often used to do so. As the airflow through the carburetor increases the reduced manifold vacuum pulls the power valve open, allowing more fuel into the main metering circuit.

In a two-stroke engine, the carburetor power valve operates in the opposite manner: in most circumstances the valve allows extra fuel into the engine, then at a certain engine RPM it closes to reduce the fuel entering the engine. This is done in order to extend the engine&#x27;s maximum RPM, since many two-stroke engines can temporarily achieve higher RPM with a leaner air-fuel ratio.

This is not to be confused with the unrelated exhaust power valve arrangements used on two-stroke engines.

==== Metering rod / step-up rod ====
A metering rod or step-up rod system is sometimes used as an alternative to a power valve in a four-stroke engine in order to supply extra fuel at high loads. One end of the rods is tapered, which sits in the main metering jets and acts as a valve for fuel flow in the jets. At high engine loads, the rods are lifted away from the jets (either mechanically or using manifold vacuum), increasing the volume of fuel flow through the jet. These systems have been used by the Rochester Quadrajet and in the 1950s Carter carburetors.

===Accelerator pump===
While the main metering circuit can adequately supply fuel to the engine in steady-state conditions, the inertia of fuel (being higher than that of air) causes a temporary shortfall as the throttle is opened. Therefore, an accelerator pump is often used to briefly provide extra fuel as the throttle is opened. When the driver presses the throttle pedal, a small piston or diaphragm pump injects extra fuel directly into the carburetor throat.

The accelerator pump can also be used to &quot;prime&quot; an engine with extra fuel prior to attempting a cold start.

==Fuel supply==

===Float chamber===

In order to ensure an adequate supply at all times, carburetors include a reservoir of fuel, called a &quot;float chamber&quot; or &quot;float bowl&quot;. Fuel is delivered to the float chamber by a fuel pump or by gravity with the fuel tank located higher than the carburetor. A floating inlet valve regulates the fuel entering the float chamber, assuring a constant level. In some small engines that may instead of a float chamber just use a fuel tank close below the carburetor and use suitable tank pressure to supply the fuel.

Unlike in a fuel injected engine, the fuel system in a carbureted engine is not pressurized. For engines where the intake air travelling through the carburetor is pressurized (such as where the carburetor is downstream of a supercharger) the entire carburetor must be contained in an airtight pressurized box to operate. However, this is not necessary where the carburetor is upstream of the supercharger.

Problems of fuel boiling and vapor lock can occur in carbureted engines, especially in hotter climates. Since the float chamber is located close to the engine, heat from the engine (including for several hours after the engine is shut off) can cause the fuel to heat up to the point of vaporization. This causes air bubbles in the fuel (similar to the air bubbles that necessitate brake bleeding), which prevents the flow of fuel and is known as &#x27;vapor lock&#x27;.

===Diaphragm chamber===
If an engine must be operated when the carburetor is not in an upright orientation (for example in a chainsaw or airplane), a float chamber and gravity activated float valve would not be suitable. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is typically used. This consists of a flexible diaphragm on one side of the fuel chamber, connected to a needle valve which regulates the fuel entering the chamber. As the flowrate of the air in the chamber (controlled by the throttling valve/butterfly valve) decreases, the diaphragm moves inward (downward), which closes the needle valve to admit less fuel. As the flowrate of the air in the chamber increases, the diaphragm moves outward (upward) which opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, allowing the engine to generate more power. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, that remains constant in any orientation.

== Other components ==
Other components that have been used on carburetors include:
* Air bleeds allowing air into various portions of the fuel passages, to premix air and fuel, and minimise vaporization, and to largely correct air/fuel ratio over a large range, typically referred to as the emulsion system. 
* Fuel flow restrictors in aircraft engines, to prevent fuel starvation during inverted flight.
* Heated vaporizers to assist with the atomization of the fuel, particularly for engines using kerosene, tractor vaporizing oil or in petrol-paraffin engines
* Early fuel evaporators
* Feedback carburetors, which adjusted the fuel/air mixture in response to signals from an oxygen sensor, in order to allow a catalytic converter to be used
* Constant vacuum carburetors (also called variable choke carburetors), whereby the throttle cable is connected directly to the throttle cable plate. Pulling the cord caused raw gasoline to enter the carburetor, creating a large emission of hydrocarbons. Implicit in that description is that the fuel flow is directly increased by movement of the throttle plate.
* Constant velocity carburetors use a variable opening in the intake air stream after movement of the throttle plate from the accelerator pedal. This variable opening is controlled by pressure/vacuum at the variable opening itself. This pressure-controlled opening provides relatively even intake pressure throughout the engine&#x27;s speed and load ranges. Implicit in that description is that the fuel flow is increased by the movement of the variable opening and where the throttle plate is downstream of the variable opening.

== Two-barrel and four-barrel designs ==

The basic design for a carburetor consists of a single venturi (main metering circuit), though designs with two or four venturi (two-barrel and four-barrel carburetors respectively) are also quite commonplace. Typically the barrels consist of &quot;primary&quot; barrel(s) used for lower load situations and secondary barrel(s) activating when required to provide additional air/fuel at higher loads. The primary and secondary venturi are often sized differently and incorporate different features to suit the situations in which they are used.

Many four-barrel carburetors use two primary and two secondary barrels. A four-barrel design of two primary and two secondary barrels was commonly used in V8 engines to conserve fuel at low engine speeds while still affording an adequate supply at high.
The use of multiple carburetors (e.g., a carburetor for each cylinder or pair of cylinders) also results in the intake air being drawn through multiple venturi. Some high-performance engines have used multiple two-barrel or four-barrel carburetors, for example six two-barrel carburetors on Ferrari V12s.

== History ==

In 1826, American engineer Samuel Morey received a patent for a &quot;gas or vapor engine&quot;, which had a carburetor that mixed turpentine and air. The design did not reach production. In 1875 German engineer Siegfried Marcus produced a car powered by the first petrol engine (which also debuted the first magneto ignition system). Karl Benz introduced his single-cylinder four-stroke powered Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1885.

All three of these engines used surface carburetors, which operated by moving air across the top of a vessel containing the fuel.

The first float-fed carburetor design, which used an atomizer nozzle, was introduced by German engineers Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler in their 1885 &quot;Grandfather Clock engine&quot;. The Butler Petrol Cycle car—built in England in 1888—also used a float-fed carburetor.

The first carburetor for a stationary engine was patented in 1893 by Hungarian engineers János Csonka and Donát Bánki.

The first four-barrel carburetors were the Carter Carburetor WCFB and the identical Rochester 4GC, introduced in various General Motors models for 1952. Oldsmobile referred the new carburetor as the &quot;Quadri-Jet&quot; (original spelling) while Buick called it the &quot;Airpower&quot;.

In the United States, carburetors were the common method of fuel delivery for most US-made gasoline (petrol) engines until the late 1980s, when fuel injection became the preferred method. One of the last motorsport users of carburetors was NASCAR, which switched to electronic fuel injection after the 2011 Sprint Cup series. NASCAR still uses the four-barrel carburetor in the NASCAR Xfinity Series.

In Europe, carburetors were largely replaced by fuel injection in the late 1980s, although fuel injection had been increasingly used in luxury cars and sports cars since the 1970s. EEC legislation required all vehicles sold and produced in member countries to have a catalytic converter after December 1992. This legislation had been in the pipeline for some time, with many cars becoming available with catalytic converters or fuel injection from around 1990.

== Icing in aircraft engine carburetors ==

A significant concern for aircraft engines is the formation of ice inside the carburetor. The temperature of air within the carburetor can be reduced by up to 40 °C (72 °F), due to a combination of the reduced air pressure in the venturi and the latent heat of the evaporating fuel. The conditions during the descent to landing are particularly conducive to icing, since the engine is run at idle for a prolonged period with the throttle closed. Icing can also occur in cruise conditions at altitude.

A carburetor heat system is often used to prevent icing. This system consists of a secondary air intake which passes around the exhaust, in order to heat the air before it enters the carburetor. Typically, the system is operated by the pilot manually switching the intake air to travel via the heated intake path as required. The carburetor heat system reduces the power output (due to the lower density of heated air) and causes the intake air filter to be bypassed, therefore the system is only used when there is a risk of icing.

If the engine is operating at idle RPM, another method to prevent icing is to periodically open the throttle, which increases the air temperature within the carburetor.

Carburetor icing also occurs on other applications and various methods have been employed to solve this problem. On inline engines the intake and exhaust manifolds are on the same side of the head. Heat from the exhaust is used to warm the intake manifold and in turn the carburetor. On V configurations, exhaust gases were directed from one head through the intake cross over to the other head. One method for regulating the exhaust flow on the cross over for intake warming was a weighted eccentric butterfly valve called a heat riser that remained closed at idle and opened at higher exhaust flow. Some vehicles used a heat stove around the exhaust manifold. It was connected to the air filter intake via tubing and supplied warmed air to the air filter. A vacuum controlled butterfly valve pre heat tube on the intake horn of the air cleaner would open allowing cooler air when engine load increased.

<doc id="49214" wikidata="Q181040" url="?curid=49214" title="Clef">
<text>A clef (from French: &#x27;key&#x27;) is a musical symbol used to indicate which notes are represented by the lines and spaces on a musical staff. Placing a clef on a staff assigns a particular pitch to one of the five lines or four spaces, which defines the pitches on the remaining lines and spaces.

The three clef symbols used in modern music notation are the G-clef, F-clef, and C-clef. Placing these clefs on a line fixes a reference note to that line—an F-clef fixes the F below middle C, a C-clef fixes middle C, and a G-clef fixes the G above middle C. In modern music notation, the G-clef is most frequently seen as treble clef (placing G4 on the second line of the staff), and the F-clef as bass clef (placing F3 on the fourth line). The C-clef is mostly encountered as alto clef (placing middle C on the third line) or tenor clef (middle C on the fourth line). A clef may be placed on a space instead of a line, but this is rare.

The use of different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in range. Using different clefs for different instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on a staff with a minimum of ledger lines. To this end, the G-clef is used for high parts, the C-clef for middle parts, and the F-clef for low parts. Transposing instruments can be an exception to this—the same clef is generally used for all instruments in a family, regardless of their sounding pitch. For example, even the low saxophones read in treble clef.

A symmetry exists surrounding middle C regarding the F-, C- and G-clefs. C-clef defines middle C whereas G-clef and F-clef define the note at the interval of a fifth above middle C and below middle C, respectively. 

Common mnemonics for the notes on treble clef:
:*&quot; Every Good Boy Does Fine&quot; (lines)
:*&quot; F A C E &quot; (spaces)

For bass clef:
:*&quot; Good Boys Do Fine Always&quot; (lines)
:*&quot; All Cows Eat Grass&quot; (spaces)

==Placement on the staff==
Theoretically, any clef may be placed on any line. With five lines on the staff and three clefs, there are fifteen possibilities for clef placement. Six of these are redundant because they result in an identical assignment of the notes—for example, a G-clef on the third line yields the same note placement as a C-clef on the bottom line. Thus there are nine possible distinct clefs when limiting their placement to the lines. All have been used historically: the G-clef on the two bottom lines, the F-clef on the three top lines, and the C-clef on the four bottom lines. The C-clef on the topmost line has also been used, but is equivalent to the F-clef on the third line, giving a total of ten historically attested clefs placed on the lines. In addition, the C-clef has been used on the third &quot;space&quot;, i.e. not on a line at all.

The ten clefs placed on lines (two are equivalent) have different names based on the tessitura for which they are best suited.

In modern music, only four clefs are used regularly: treble clef, bass clef, alto clef, and tenor clef. Of these, the treble and bass clefs are by far the most common. The tenor clef is used for the upper register of several instruments that usually use bass clef (including cello, bassoon, and trombone), while the alto is most prominently used by the viola. Music for instruments and voices that transpose at the octave is generally written at the transposed pitch, but is sometimes seen written at concert pitch using an octave clef.


== Individual clefs ==
This section shows a complete list of the clefs, along with a list of instruments and voice parts notated with them. A dagger (†) after the name of a clef indicates that the clef is no longer in common use.

===G-clefs===

==== Treble clef ====
The only G-clef still in use is the treble clef, with the G-clef placed on the second line. This is the most common clef in use and is generally the first clef learned by music students. For this reason, the terms &quot;G-clef&quot; and &quot;treble clef&quot; are often seen as synonymous. The treble clef was historically used to mark a treble, or pre-pubescent, voice part.

Instruments that use the treble clef include violin, flute, oboe, cor anglais, all clarinets, all saxophones, horn, trumpet, cornet, vibraphone, xylophone, mandolin, recorder, bagpipe and guitar. Euphonium and baritone horn are sometimes treated as transposing instruments, using the treble clef and sounding a major ninth lower, and are sometimes treated as concert-pitch instruments, using bass clef. The treble clef is also the upper staff of the grand staff used for harp and keyboard instruments. Most high parts for bass-clef instruments (e.g. cello, double bass, bassoon, and trombone) are written in the tenor clef, but very high pitches may be notated in the treble clef. The viola also may use the treble clef for very high notes. The treble clef is used for the soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, contralto and tenor voices. Tenor voice parts sound an octave lower and are often written using an octave clef (see below) or a double-treble clef.

====French violin clef†====

A G-clef placed on the first line is called the French clef, or French violin clef. It was used in France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for violin music and flute music. It places the notes in the same staff positions as the bass clef, but two octaves higher.

===F-clefs===

==== Baritone clef† ====

When the F-clef is placed on the third line, it is called the baritone clef. Baritone clef was used for the left hand of keyboard music (particularly in France; see Bauyn manuscript) and for baritone parts in vocal music. A C-clef on the fifth line creates a staff with identical notes to the baritone clef, but this variant is rare.
==== Bass clef====

The only F-clef still in use is the bass clef, with the clef placed on the fourth line. Since it is the only F-clef commonly encountered, the terms &quot;F-clef&quot; and &quot;bass clef&quot; are often regarded as synonymous.

Bass clef is used for the cello, double bass and bass guitar, bassoon and contrabassoon, bass recorder, trombone, tuba, and timpani. It is used for baritone horn or euphonium when their parts are written at concert pitch, and sometimes for the lowest notes of the horn. Baritone and bass voices also use bass clef, and the tenor voice is notated in bass clef if the tenor and bass are written on the same staff. Bass clef is the bottom clef in the grand staff for harp and keyboard instruments. Double bass, bass guitar, and contrabassoon sound an octave lower than the written pitch; some scores show an &quot;8&quot; beneath the clef for these instruments to differentiate from instruments that sound at the actual written pitch (see &quot;Octave clefs&quot; below).
====Sub-bass clef†====

When the F-clef is placed on the fifth line, it is called the sub-bass clef. It was used by Johannes Ockeghem and Heinrich Schütz to write low bass parts, by Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe for low notes on the bass viol, and by J. S. Bach in his &quot;Musical Offering&quot;.

It is the same as the treble clef, but two octaves lower.


===C-clefs===

==== Alto clef====


A C-clef on the third line of the staff is called the alto or viola clef. It is currently used for viola, viola d&#x27;amore, alto trombone, viola da gamba, and mandola. It is also associated with the countertenor voice and sometimes called the countertenor clef. A vestige of this survives in Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s use of the clef for the cor anglais in his symphonies. It occasionally appears in keyboard music (for example, in Brahms&#x27;s Organ Chorales and John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Dream&quot; for piano). It was originally used for alto parts in choral music to reduce the number of ledger lines needed, since much of the alto range is between treble and bass clef. Alto parts are now commonly written in treble clef instead.
==== Tenor clef====

A C-clef on the fourth line of the staff is called tenor clef. It is used for the viola da gamba (rarely, and mostly in German scores; otherwise the alto clef is used) and for upper ranges of bass-clef instruments such as the bassoon, cello, euphonium, double bass, and tenor trombone. Treble clef may also be used for the upper extremes of these bass-clef instruments. Tenor violin parts were also written in this clef (see e.g. Giovanni Battista Vitali&#x27;s Op. 11). It was used by the tenor part in vocal music but its use has been largely supplanted either with an octave version of the treble clef or with bass clef when tenor and bass parts are written on a single staff.

Another tenor clef variant, formerly used in music for male chorus, has a ladder-like shape. This C-clef places the C on the third space of the staff, and is equivalent to the sub-octave treble clef. See also History.
====Mezzo-soprano clef†====

A C-clef on the second line of the staff is called the mezzo-soprano clef, rarely used in modern Western classical music. It was used in 17th century French orchestral music for the second viola or first tenor part (&#x27;taille&#x27;) by such composers as Lully, and for mezzo-soprano voices in operatic roles, notably by Claudio Monteverdi. Mezzo-soprano clef was also used for certain flute parts during renaissance, especially when doubling vocal lines. In Azerbaijani music, the tar uses this clef.

====Soprano clef†====

A C-clef on the first line of the staff is called the soprano clef. It was used for the right hand of keyboard music (particularly in France – see Bauyn manuscript), in vocal music for sopranos, and sometimes for high viola da gamba parts along with the alto clef. It was used for the second violin part (&#x27;haute-contre&#x27;) in 17th century French music.

==Other clefs==

===Octave clefs===


Starting in the 18th century, music for some instruments (such as guitar) and for the tenor voice have used treble clef, although they sound an octave lower. To avoid ambiguity, modified clefs are sometimes used, especially in choral writing. Using a C-clef on the third space places the notes identically, but this notation is much less common as it is easily confused with the alto and tenor clefs.

Such a modified treble clef is most often found in tenor parts in SATB settings, using a treble clef with the numeral &quot;8&quot; below it. This indicates that the pitches sound an octave lower. As the true tenor clef has fallen into disuse in vocal writings, this &quot;octave-dropped&quot; treble clef is often called the tenor clef. The same clef is sometimes used for the octave mandolin. This can also be indicated with two overlapping G-clefs.

Tenor banjo is commonly notated in treble clef. However, notation varies between the written pitch sounding an octave lower (as in guitar music and called octave pitch in most tenor banjo methods) and music sounding at the written pitch (called actual pitch). An attempt has been made to use a treble clef with a diagonal line through the upper half of the clef to indicate octave pitch, but this is not always used.

To indicate that notes sound an octave higher than written, a treble clef with an &quot;8&quot; positioned above the clef may be used for penny whistle, soprano and sopranino recorder, and other high woodwind parts. A treble clef with a &quot;15&quot; above (sounding two octaves above the standard treble clef) is used for the garklein (sopranissimo) recorder.

An F-clef can also be notated with an octave marker. While the F-clef notated to sound an octave lower can be used for contrabass instruments such as the double bass and contrabassoon, and the F-clef notated to sound an octave higher can be used for the bass recorder, these uses are extremely rare. In Italian scores up to Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s Overture to &quot;William Tell&quot;, the cor anglais was written in bass clef an octave lower than sounding. The unmodified bass clef is so common that performers of instruments whose ranges lie below the staff simply learn to read ledger lines.
===Neutral clef===

&quot;Main Article: Percussion Notation&quot;

The &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;percussion&quot; clef is not a true clef like the F, C, and G clefs. Rather, it assigns different unpitched percussion instruments to the lines and spaces of the staff. With the exception of some common drum-kit and marching percussion layouts, the assignment of lines and spaces to instruments is not standardised, so a legend is required to show which instrument each line or space represents. Pitched percussion instruments do not use this clef — timpani are notated in bass clef and mallet percussion instruments are noted in treble clef or on a grand staff.

If the neutral clef is used for a single percussion instrument the staff may only have one line, although other configurations are used.

The neutral clef is sometimes used where non-percussion instruments play non-pitched extended techniques, such as hitting the body of a string instrument, or having a vocal choir clap, stamp, or snap. However, it is more common to write the rhythms using × noteheads on the instrument&#x27;s normal staff, with a comment to indicate the appropriate rhythmic action.

===Tablature===

For guitars and other fretted instruments, it is possible to notate tablature in place of ordinary notes. This TAB sign is not a clef — it does not indicate the placement of notes on a staff. The lines shown are not a music staff but rather represent the strings of the instrument (six lines would be used for guitar, four lines for the bass guitar, etc.), with numbers on the lines showing which fret, if any, should be used and symbols for specific techniques.

==History==
Before the advent of clefs, the reference line of a staff was simply labeled with the name of the note it was intended to bear: &quot;F&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, or sometimes &quot;G&quot;. These were the most common &#x27;clefs&#x27;, or (key-letters), in Gregorian chant notation. Over time the shapes of these letters became stylised, leading to their current versions.

Many other clefs were used, particularly in the early period of chant notation, keyed to many different notes, from the low &quot;Γ&quot; (&quot;gamma&quot;, the G on the bottom line of the bass clef) to the G above middle C (written with a small letter &quot;g&quot;). These included two different lowercase &quot;b&quot; symbols for the note just below middle C: round for B, and square for B. In order of frequency of use, these clefs were: &quot;F&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;Γ&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and the round and square &quot;b&quot;. In later medieval music, the round &quot;b&quot; was often written in addition to another clef letter to indicate that B rather than B was to be used throughout a piece; this is the origin of the key signature.
In the polyphonic period up to 1600, unusual clefs were occasionally used for parts with extremely high or low tessituras. For very low bass parts, the Γ clef is found on the middle, fourth, or fifth lines of the staff (e.g., in Pierre de La Rue’s &quot;Requiem&quot; and in a mid-16th-century dance book published by the Hessen brothers); for very high parts, the high-D clef (&quot;d&quot;), and the even higher &quot;ff&quot; clef (e.g., in the &quot;Mulliner Book&quot;) were used to represent the notes written on the fourth and top lines of the treble clef, respectively.

The practice of using different shapes for the same clef persisted until very recent times. The F-clef was, until as late as the 1980s in some cases (such as hymnals), or in British and French publications, written like this: 

In printed music from the 16th and 17th centuries, the C clef often assumed a ladder-like form, in which the two horizontal rungs surround the staff line indicated as C: ; this form survived in some printed editions (see this example, written in four-part men&#x27;s harmony and positioned to make it equivalent to an octave G clef) into the 20th century.

The C-clef was formerly written in a more angular way, sometimes still used, or, more often, as a simplified &quot;K&quot;-shape when writing the clef by hand: 

In modern Gregorian chant notation the C clef is written (on a four-line staff) in the form and the F clef as 

The flourish at the top of the G-clef probably derives from a cursive &quot;S&quot; for &quot;sol&quot;, the name for &quot;G&quot; in solfege.

C clefs (along with G, F, Γ, D, and A clefs) were formerly used to notate vocal music. Nominally, the soprano voice parts were written in first- or second-line C clef (&quot;soprano clef&quot; or &quot;mezzo-soprano clef&quot;) or second-line G clef (&quot;treble clef&quot;), the alto or tenor voices in third-line C clef (&quot;alto clef&quot;), the tenor voice in fourth-line C clef (&quot;tenor clef&quot;) and the bass voice in third-, fourth- or fifth-line F clef (&quot;baritone&quot;, &quot;bass&quot;, or &quot;sub-bass clef&quot;).

Until the 19th century, the most common arrangement for vocal music used the following clefs: 

* Soprano = soprano clef (first-line C clef)
* Alto = alto clef (third-line C clef)
*Tenor = tenor clef (fourth-line C clef)
* Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)

In more modern publications, four-part music on parallel staffs is usually written more simply as:
* Soprano = treble clef (second-line G clef)
* Alto = treble clef
* Tenor = treble clef with an &quot;8&quot; below &quot;or&quot; a double treble clef. Many pieces, particularly those from before the 21st century, use an unaltered treble clef, with the expectation the tenors will still sing an octave lower than notated.
* Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)
This may be reduced to two staffs, the soprano and alto sharing a staff with a treble clef, and the tenor and bass sharing a staff marked with the bass clef.

==Further uses==
Clef combinations played a role in the modal system toward the end of the 16th century, and it has been suggested certain clef combinations in the polyphonic music of 16th-century vocal polyphony are reserved for authentic (odd-numbered) modes, and others for plagal (even-numbered) modes, but the precise implications have been the subject of much scholarly debate.

Reading music as if it were in a different clef from the one indicated can be an aid in transposing music at sight since it will move the pitches roughly in parallel to the written part. Key signatures and accidentals need to be accounted for when this is done.

==In Unicode==

For use with computer systems, the Unicode Consortium has created code points for twelve different clef symbols as part of a repertoire called the &quot;Musical Symbols&quot; block. Although much of the list was established by 1999, general provision of these symbols in common computer fonts remains rather limited. The clef symbols provided are these:

<text>C or Do is the first note of the C major scale, the third note of the A minor scale (the relative minor of C major), and the fourth note (G, A, B, C) of the Guidonian hand, commonly pitched around 261.63 Hz. The actual frequency has depended on historical pitch standards, and for transposing instruments a distinction is made between written and sounding or concert pitch. It has enharmonic equivalents of B and D.

In English the term &quot;Do&quot; is used interchangeably with C only in the context of fixed Do solfège; in the movable Do system Do refers to the tonic of the prevailing key.

==Frequency==
Historically, concert pitch has varied. For an instrument in equal temperament tuned to the A440 pitch standard widely adopted in 1939, middle C has a frequency around 261.63 Hz (for other notes see piano key frequencies). Scientific pitch was originally proposed in 1713 by French physicist Joseph Sauveur and based on the numerically convenient frequency of 256 Hz for middle C, all C&#x27;s being powers of two. After the A440 pitch standard was adopted by musicians, the Acoustical Society of America published new frequency tables for scientific use. A movement to restore the older A435 standard has used the banners &quot;Verdi tuning&quot;, &quot;philosophical pitch&quot; or the easily confused scientific pitch.

==Octave nomenclature==
===Middle C===
Middle C (the fourth C key from left on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is designated C4 in scientific pitch notation, c in Helmholtz pitch notation, and note number 60 in the MIDI standard.

While the expression &quot;middle C&quot; is generally clear across instruments and clefs, some musicians naturally use the term to refer to the C note in the middle of their specific instrument&#x27;s range. C4 (approximately 261.626 Hz) may be called &quot;Low C&quot; by someone playing a Western concert flute, which has a higher and narrower playing range than the piano, while C5 (523.251 Hz) would be middle C. This practice has led some to encourage standardizing on C4 as the definitive middle C in instructional materials across all instruments.

On the grand staff, middle C is notated with a ledger line above the top line of the bass staff or below the bottom line of the treble staff. Alternatively, it is written on the centre line of a staff using the alto clef, or on the fourth line from the bottom, or the second line from the top, of staves using the tenor clef.

===Other octaves===
In vocal music, the term &quot;High C&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Top C&quot;) can refer to either the soprano&#x27;s C6 (1046.502 Hz; in Helmholtz notation) or the tenor&#x27;s C5; soprano written as the C two ledger lines above the treble clef, with the tenor voice the space above concert A, sung an octave lower. Sometimes written with “8v” below the treble, to represent the octave (8 tones in a major scale).

&quot;Tenor C&quot; is an organ builder&#x27;s term for &quot;small C&quot; or C3 (130.813 Hz), the note one octave below middle C. In older stoplists it usually means that a rank was not yet full compass, omitting the bottom octave, until that octave was added later on.

<doc id="49229" wikidata="Q192193" url="?curid=49229" title="Staff (music)">
<text>In Western musical notation, the staff (UK also stave; plural: &quot;staffs&quot; or &quot;staves&quot;), also occasionally referred to as a pentagram, is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch or in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments. Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function. Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention.

The absolute pitch of each line of a non-percussive staff is indicated by the placement of a clef symbol at the appropriate vertical position on the left-hand side of the staff (possibly modified by conventions for specific instruments). For example, the treble clef, also known as the G clef, is placed on the second line (counting upward), fixing that line as the pitch first G above &quot;middle C&quot;.

The lines and spaces are numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the &quot;first line&quot; and the top line is the &quot;fifth line&quot;.

The musical staff is analogous to a mathematical graph of pitch with respect to time. Pitches of notes are given by their vertical position on the staff and notes are played from left to right. Unlike a graph, however, the number of semitones represented by a vertical step from a line to an adjacent space depends on the key, and the exact timing of the beginning of each note is not directly proportional to its horizontal position; rather, exact timing is encoded by the musical symbol chosen for each note in addition to the tempo.

A time signature to the right of the clef indicates the relationship between timing counts and note symbols, while bar lines group notes on the staff into measures.

==Usage and etymology==

&quot;Staff&quot; is more common than &quot;stave&quot; in both American English and British English, with the latter being, in fact, a back-formation from the plural &quot;staves&quot;. The plural &quot;staffs&quot; also exists for &quot;staff&quot; in both American and British English, alongside the traditional plural &quot;staves&quot;. In addition to the pronunciations expected from the spellings, both plural forms are also pronounced in American English.

==Staff positions==

The vertical position of the notehead on the staff indicates which note to play: higher-pitched notes are marked higher on the staff. The notehead can be placed with its center intersecting a line (&quot;on a line&quot;) or in between the lines touching the lines above and below (&quot;in a space&quot;). Notes outside the range of the staff are placed on or between ledger lines—lines the width of the note they need to hold—added above or below the staff.

Which staff positions represent which notes is determined by a clef placed at the beginning of the staff. The clef identifies a particular line as a specific note, and all other notes are determined relative to that line. For example, the treble clef puts the G above middle C on the second line. The interval between adjacent staff positions is one step in the diatonic scale. Once fixed by a clef, the notes represented by the positions on the staff can be modified by the key signature or accidentals on individual notes. A clefless staff may be used to represent a set of percussion sounds; each line typically represents a different instrument.

==Ensemble staves==

A vertical line drawn to the left of multiple staves creates a system, indicating that the music on all the staves is to be played simultaneously. A brace (curly bracket) is used to join multiple staves that represent an instrument, such as a piano, organ, harp, or marimba. A bracket is an additional vertical line joining staves to show groupings of instruments that function as a unit, such as the string section of an orchestra. Sometimes a second bracket is used to show instruments grouped in pairs, such as the first and second oboes or first and second violins in an orchestra. In some cases, a brace is used for this purpose.

When more than one system appears on a page, often two parallel diagonal strokes are placed on the left side of the score to separate them.

Four-part SATB vocal settings, especially in hymnals, use a &quot;divisi&quot; notation on a two-staff system with soprano and alto voices sharing the upper staff and tenor and bass voices on the lower staff.

Confusingly, the German &quot;System&quot; (often in the combined forms &quot;Liniensystem&quot; or &quot;Notensystem&quot;) may refer to a single staff as well as to the &quot;Akkolade&quot; (from the French) or system in the English sense; the Italian term is &quot;accollatura&quot;.

== Grand staff ==

When music on two staves is joined by a brace, or is intended to be played at once by a single performer (usually a keyboard instrument or harp), a grand staff (American English) or great stave (British English) is created. Typically, the upper staff uses a treble clef and the lower staff has a bass clef. In this instance, middle C is centered between the two staffs, and it can be written on the first ledger line below the upper staff or the first ledger line above the lower staff. Very rarely, a centered line with a small C clef is written, and usually used to indicate that B, C, or D on the line can be played with either hand (ledger lines are not used from a center alto as this creates confusion). When playing the piano or harp, the upper staff is normally played with the right hand and the lower staff with the left hand. In music intended for organ with pedalboard, a grand staff normally comprises three staves, one for each hand on the manuals and one for the feet on the pedalboard.
==History==

Early Western medieval notation was written with neumes, which did not specify exact pitches but only the shape of the melodies, i.e. indicating when the musical line went up or down; presumably these were intended as mnemonics for melodies which had been taught by rote.

During the 9th through 11th centuries a number of systems were developed to specify pitch more precisely, including diastematic neumes whose height on the page corresponded with their absolute pitch level (Longobardian and Beneventan manuscripts from Italy show this technique around the year 1000). Digraphic notation, using letter names similar to modern note names in conjunction with the neumes, made a brief appearance in a few manuscripts, but a number of manuscripts used one or more horizontal lines to indicate particular pitches.

The treatise &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; () uses Daseian notation for indicating specific pitches, but the modern use of staff lines is attributed to Guido d&#x27;Arezzo (990–1050), whose four-line staff is still used (though without the red and yellow coloring he recommended) in Gregorian chant publications today. Five-line staves appeared in Italy in the 13th century and it was promoted by Ugolino da Forlì; staves with four, five, and six lines were used as late as 1600.

<doc id="49234" wikidata="Q202021" url="?curid=49234" title="Chromatic scale">
<text>The chromatic scale (or twelve-tone scale) is a set of twelve pitches (more completely, pitch classes) used in tonal music, with notes separated by the interval of a semitone. Chromatic instruments, such as the piano, are made to produce the chromatic scale, while other instruments capable of continuously variable pitch, such as the trombone and violin, can also produce microtones, or notes between those available on a piano.

Most music uses subsets of the chromatic scale such as diatonic scales. While the chromatic scale is fundamental in western music theory, it is seldom directly used in its entirety in musical compositions or improvisation.

==Definition==
The chromatic scale is a musical scale with twelve pitches, each a semitone, also known as a half-step, above or below its adjacent pitches. As a result, in 12-tone equal temperament (the most common tuning in Western music), the chromatic scale covers all 12 of the available pitches. Thus, there is only one chromatic scale. The ratio of the frequency of one note in the scale to that of the preceding note is given by formula_1.

In equal temperament, all the semitones have the same size (100 cents), and there are twelve semitones in an octave (1200 cents). As a result, the notes of an equal-tempered chromatic scale are equally-spaced.



The ascending and descending chromatic scale is shown below.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 12/4
 c4^\markup { Ascending } cis d dis e f fis g gis a ais b
 c^\markup { Descending } b bes a aes g ges f e es d des c
}
&lt;/score&gt;

==Notation==
The chromatic scale has no set enharmonic spelling that is always used. Its spelling is, however, often dependent upon major or minor key signatures and whether the scale is ascending or descending. In general, the chromatic scale is usually notated with sharp signs when ascending and flat signs when descending. It is also notated so that no scale degree is used more than twice in succession (for instance, G – G – G).

Similarly, some notes of the chromatic scale have enharmonic equivalents in solfege. The rising scale is Do, Di, Re, Ri, Mi, Fa, Fi, Sol, Si, La, Li, Ti and the descending is Ti, Te/Ta, La, Le/Lo, Sol, Se, Fa, Mi, Me/Ma, Re, Ra, Do, However, once 0 is given to a note, due to octave equivalence, the chromatic scale may be indicated unambiguously by the numbers 0-11 mod twelve. Thus two perfect fifths are 0-7-2. Tone rows, orderings used in the twelve-tone technique, are often considered this way due to the increased ease of comparing inverse intervals and forms (inversional equivalence).

==Pitch-rational tunings==

===Pythagorean===
The most common conception of the chromatic scale before the 13th century was the Pythagorean chromatic scale (). Due to a different tuning technique, the twelve semitones in this scale have two slightly different sizes. Thus, the scale is not perfectly symmetric. Many other tuning systems, developed in the ensuing centuries, share a similar asymmetry.

In Pythagorean tuning (i.e. 3-limit just intonation) the chromatic scale is tuned as follows, in perfect fifths from G to A centered on D (in bold) (G–D–A–E–B–F–C–G–D–A–E–B–F–C–G–D–A), with sharps &quot;higher&quot; than their enharmonic flats (cents rounded to one decimal):
where is a diatonic semitone (Pythagorean limma) and is a chromatic semitone (Pythagorean apotome).

The chromatic scale in Pythagorean tuning can be tempered to the 17-EDO tuning (P5 = 10 steps = 705.88 cents).

===Just intonation===

In 5-limit just intonation the chromatic scale, Ptolemy&#x27;s intense chromatic scale, is as follows, with flats &quot;higher&quot; than their enharmonic sharps, and new notes between E–F and B–C (cents rounded to one decimal):

The fractions and , and , and , and , and many other pairs are interchangeable, as (the syntonic comma) is tempered out.

Just intonation tuning can be approximated by 19-EDO tuning (P5 = 11 steps = 694.74 cents).

==Non-Western cultures==
The ancient Chinese chromatic scale is called &quot;Shí-èr-lǜ&quot;. However, &quot;it should not be imagined that this gamut ever functioned as a scale, and it is erroneous to refer to the &#x27;Chinese chromatic scale&#x27;, as some Western writers have done. The series of twelve notes known as the twelve &quot;lü&quot; were simply a series of fundamental notes from which scales could be constructed.&quot; However, &quot;from the standpoint of tonal music [the chromatic scale] is not an independent scale, but derives from the diatonic scale,&quot; making the &quot;Western chromatic scale&quot; a gamut of fundamental notes from which scales could be constructed as well.

<doc id="49239" wikidata="Q170123" url="?curid=49239" title="St. Hedwig's Cathedral">
<text>St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral () is the Catholic cathedral of the Archdiocese of Berlin on Bebelplatz in the historic centre of Berlin. Dedicated to Hedwig of Silesia, it was erected from 1747 to 1773 by order of Frederick the Great according to plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff in Baroque style. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the cathedral&#x27;s interior was restored from 1952 to 1963 in post-war modernist style as part of the rebuilding of the Forum Fridericianum on Bebelplatz. The listed building was closed for renovation work from 2018 and reopened on November 24, 2024 with a modern interior design.

==History and architecture==
St. Hedwig&#x27;s Church was built in the 18th century following a request from local parishioners to King Frederick II. He donated the land on which the church was built. The church was dedicated to the patron of Silesia and Brandenburg, Saint Hedwig of Andechs. 
It was the first Catholic church built in Prussia after the Reformation. The building was designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff and modelled after the Pantheon in Rome.
Construction started in 1747, but was interrupted and delayed several times by economic problems. It was not opened until 1 November 1773, when the king&#x27;s friend, Ignacy Krasicki, the Bishop of Warmia (later Archbishop of Gniezno), officiated at the cathedral&#x27;s consecration.

After the Kristallnacht pogroms that took place on the night of 9–10 November 1938, Bernhard Lichtenberg, a canon of the cathedral chapter of St. Hedwig since 1931, prayed publicly for Jews at evening prayer. Lichtenberg was later jailed by the Nazis and died on the way to the concentration camp at Dachau. 
In 1965, Blessed Bernhard Lichtenberg&#x27;s remains were transferred to the crypt at St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral.

The cathedral was severely damaged by Allied bombing in an air raid on 1 March 1943. Only the damaged shell of the building was left standing. Reconstruction started in 1952 and on 1 November 1963, All Saints&#x27; Day, the new high altar was consecrated by the Bishop of Berlin, Alfred Cardinal Bengsch.

Between 1949 and 1990, St. Hedwig&#x27;s was in East Berlin, under the control of the East German government.

The cathedral closed for major renovations on 1 September 2018. The relics of Bl. Bernhard Lichtenberg have been transferred to the crypt of Maria Regina Martyrum during the cathedral&#x27;s renovation. The church of St. Joseph in Wedding is the interim location for pontifical masses. A focal point of the renovations is a hemispherical altar composed of small stones from around the diocese collected by parishioners, based on an idea proposed by Austrian artist Leo Zogmayer. The two-story interior of 1963, with a wide gallery and an awkwardly narrow opening down to the chancel, was divided into two floors, with the new church interior on the upper level.

==Tapestries==
Fitting to the character of the liturgical season, a huge tapestry is hanging behind the cathedra. The cathedral owns three of them; all three share the motif of the heavenly Jerusalem.

The tapestry of former Bauhaus student Margaretha Reichardt (Grete Reichardt) (1907–1984) of Erfurt was handwoven in 1963.

<text>Patrice Émery Lumumba ( ; born Isaïe Tasumbu Tawosa; 2 July 192517 January 1961) was a Congolese politician and independence leader who served as the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then known as the Republic of the Congo) from June until September 1960, following the May 1960 election. He was the leader of the Congolese National Movement (MNC) from 1958 until his assassination in 1961. Ideologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, he played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.

Shortly after Congolese independence in June 1960, a mutiny broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo Crisis. After a coup, Lumumba attempted to escape to Stanleyville to join his supporters who had established a new anti-Mobutu state called the Free Republic of the Congo. Lumumba was captured en route by state authorities under Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, sent to the State of Katanga and, with the help of Belgian mercenaries, tortured and executed by the separatist Katangan authorities of Moïse Tshombe. In 2002, Belgium formally apologised for its role in the execution, admitting &quot;moral responsibility&quot;, and in 2022, they returned Lumumba’s tooth to his family. He is seen as a martyr for the pan-African movement.

== Early life and career ==

Patrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 as Isaïe Tasumbu Tawosa to Julienne Wamato Lomendja and her husband, François Tolenga Otetshima, a farmer, in Onalua, in the Katakokombe region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo. He was a member of the Tetela ethnic group, where he was referred to with the name Élias Okit&#x27;Asombo. His original surname means &quot;heir of the cursed&quot; and is derived from the Tetela words / (&#x27;heir&#x27;, &#x27;successor&#x27;) and (&#x27;cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly&#x27;). He had three brothers (Charles Lokolonga, Émile Kalema, and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother (Jean Tolenga). Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, where he passed the one-year course with distinction. He was known for being a vocal, precocious young man, regularly pointing out the errors of his teachers in front of his peers. This outspoken nature would come to define his life and career. Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba.

Outside of his regular studies, Lumumba took an interest in the Enlightenment ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire. He was also fond of Molière and Victor Hugo. He wrote poetry, and many of his works had anti-imperialist themes. He worked as a travelling beer salesman in Léopoldville and as a postal clerk in Stanleyville for eleven years. Lumumba was married three times. He married Henriette Maletaua a year after arriving in Stanleyville; they divorced in 1947. In the same year, he married Hortense Sombosia, but this relationship also fell apart. He began an affair with Pauline Kie. While he had no children with his first two wives, his relationship with Kie resulted in a son, François Lumumba. Though he remained close with Kie until his death, Lumumba ultimately ended their affair to marry Pauline Opangu in 1951.

In the period following World War II, young leaders across Africa increasingly worked for national goals and independence from the colonial powers. In 1952 he was hired to work as a personal assistant for French sociologist Pierre Clément, who was performing a study of Stanleyville. That year he also co-founded and subsequently became president of a Stanleyville chapter of the Association des Anciens élèves des pères de Scheut (ADAPÉS), an alumni association for former students at Scheut schools, despite the fact that he had never attended one. In 1955, Lumumba became regional head of the &quot;Cercles&quot; of Stanleyville and joined the Liberal Party of Belgium. He edited and distributed party literature. Between 1956 and 1957 he wrote his autobiography (which was published posthumously in 1962). After a study tour in Belgium in 1956, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement of $2500 from the post office. He was convicted and sentenced one year later to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment and a fine.

== Leader of the MNC ==


After his release, Lumumba helped found the &quot;Mouvement National Congolais&quot; (MNC) party in 1958 and quickly became the organisation&#x27;s leader. The MNC, unlike other Congolese parties developing at the time, did not draw on a particular ethnic base. It promoted a platform that included independence, gradual Africanisation of the government, state-led economic development, and neutrality in foreign affairs. Lumumba had a large popular following and as a result, he had more political autonomy than contemporaries who were more dependent on Belgian connections. Lumumba was one of the delegates who represented the MNC at the All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference in Accra, Ghana, in December 1958. At this international conference, hosted by Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah, Lumumba further solidified his pan-Africanist credentials. Nkrumah was personally impressed by Lumumba&#x27;s intelligence and ability. 

In 1959, the MNC split into the majority MNC-L, led by Lumumba, and the more radical and federalist MNC-K. In late October 1959, Lumumba, as leader of the MNC, was arrested for inciting an anti-colonial riot in Stanleyville during which 30 people were killed. He was sentenced to six months in prison. The trial&#x27;s start date of 18 January 1960 was the first day of the Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels, intended to make a plan for the future of the Congo. Despite Lumumba&#x27;s imprisonment, the MNC won a convincing majority in the December local elections in the Congo. As a result of strong pressure from delegates upset by Lumumba&#x27;s trial, he was released and allowed to attend the Brussels conference.

== Independence and election as prime minister ==


The conference culminated on 27 January 1960 with a declaration of Congolese independence. It set 30 June 1960 as the independence date with national elections to be held from 11 to 25 May 1960. The MNC won a plurality in the election. Six weeks before the date of independence, Walter Ganshof van der Meersch was appointed as the Belgian Minister of African Affairs. He lived in Léopoldville, in effect becoming Belgium&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; resident minister in the Congo, administering it jointly with Governor-general Hendrik Cornelis. He was charged with advising King Baudouin on the selection of a .

On 8 June 1960, Ganshof flew to Brussels to meet with Baudouin. He made three suggestions for : Lumumba, as the winner of the elections; Joseph Kasa-Vubu, the only figure with a reliable national reputation who was associated with the coalescing opposition; or some to-be-determined third individual who could unite the competing blocs. Ganshof returned to the Congo on 12 June 1960. The following day he appointed Lumumba to serve as the delegate () tasked with investigating the possibility of forming a national unity government that included politicians with a wide range of views, with 16 June 1960 as his deadline.

The same day as Lumumba&#x27;s appointment, the parliamentary opposition coalition, the , was announced. Though Kasa-Vubu was aligned with their beliefs, he remained distanced from them. The MNC-L was also having trouble securing the allegiances of the PSA, CEREA (), and BALUBAKAT (). Initially, Lumumba was unable to establish contact with members of the cartel. Eventually several leaders were appointed to meet with him, but their positions remained entrenched. On 16 June 1960, Lumumba reported his difficulties to Ganshof, who extended the deadline and promised to act as an intermediary between the MNC-L leader and the opposition. Once Ganshof had made contact with the cartel leadership, he was impressed by their obstinacy and assurances of a strong anti-Lumumba polity. By evening, Lumumba&#x27;s mission was showing even less chance of succeeding. Ganshof considered extending the role of to Cyrille Adoula and Kasa-Vubu, but faced increasing pressure from Belgian and moderate Congolese advisers to end Lumumba&#x27;s assignment.

The following day, on 17 June 1960, Ganshof declared that Lumumba had failed and terminated his mission. Acting on Ganshof&#x27;s advice, Baudouin then named Kasa-Vubu . Lumumba responded by threatening to form his own government and present it to parliament without official approval. He called a meeting at the OK Bar in Léopoldville, where he announced the creation of a &quot;popular&quot; government with the support of Pierre Mulele of the PSA. Meanwhile, Kasa-Vubu, like Lumumba, was unable to communicate with his political opponents.

He assumed that he would secure the presidency, so he began looking for someone to serve as his prime minister. Most of the candidates he considered were friends who had foreign support similar to his own, including Albert Kalonji, Joseph Iléo, Cyrille Adoula, and Justin Bomboko. Kasa-Vubu was slow to come to a final decision. On 18 June 1960, Kasa-Vubu announced that he had completed his government with all parties except the MNC-L. That afternoon Jason Sendwe, Antoine Gizenga, and Anicet Kashamura announced in the presence of Lumumba that their respective parties were not committed to the government. The next day, on 19 June 1960, Ganshof summoned Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to a meeting so they could forge a compromise. This failed when Lumumba flatly refused the position of prime minister in a Kasa-Vubu government.

The following day, on 20 June 1960, the two rivals met in the presence of Adoula and diplomats from Israel and Ghana, but no agreement was reached. Most party leaders refused to support a government that did not include Lumumba. The decision to make Kasa-Vubu the was a catalyst that rallied the PSA, CEREA, and BALUBAKAT to Lumumba, making it unlikely that Kasa-Vubu could form a government that would survive a vote of confidence. When the chamber met, on 21 June 1960, to select its officers, Joseph Kasongo of the MNC-L was elected president with 74 votes (a majority), while the two vice presidencies were secured by the PSA and CEREA candidates, both of whom had the support of Lumumba. With time running out before independence, Baudouin took new advice from Ganshof and appointed Lumumba as .

Once it was apparent that Lumumba&#x27;s bloc controlled parliament, several members of the opposition became eager to negotiate for a coalition government in order to share power. By 22 June 1960, Lumumba had a government list, but negotiations continued with Jean Bolikango, Albert Delvaux, and Kasa-Vubu. Lumumba reportedly offered the Alliance of Bakongo (ABAKO) the ministerial positions for foreign affairs and middle classes, but Kasa-Vubu instead demanded the ministry of finance, a minister of state, the secretary of state for the interior, and a written pledge of support from the MNC-L and its allies for his presidential candidacy. Kalonji was presented with the agriculture portfolio by Lumumba, which he rejected, although he was suitable due to his experience as an agricultural engineer. Adoula was also offered a ministerial position, but refused to accept it.

By the morning of 23 June 1960, the government was, in the words of Lumumba, &quot;practically formed&quot;. At noon, he made a counter-offer to Kasa-Vubu, who instead responded with a letter demanding the creation of a seventh province for the Bakongo. Lumumba refused to comply and instead pledged to support Jean Bolikango in his bid for the presidency. At 14:45, Lumumba presented his proposed government before the press. Neither the ABAKO nor the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K) were represented among the ministers, and the only PSA members were from Gizenga&#x27;s wing of the party. The Bakongo of Léopoldville were deeply upset by their exclusion from Lumumba&#x27;s cabinet. They subsequently demanded the removal of the PSA-dominated provincial government and called for a general strike to begin the following morning. At 16:00, Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu resumed negotiations. Kasa-Vubu eventually agreed to Lumumba&#x27;s earlier offer, though Lumumba informed him that he could not give him a guarantee of support in his presidential candidacy.

The resulting 37-strong Lumumba government was very diverse, with its members coming from different classes, different tribes, and holding varied political beliefs. Though many had questionable loyalty to Lumumba, most did not openly contradict him out of political considerations or fear of reprisal. At 22:40 on 23 June 1960, the Chamber of Deputies convened in the to vote on Lumumba&#x27;s government. After Kasongo opened the session, Lumumba delivered his main speech, promising to maintain national unity, abide by the will of the people, and pursue a neutralist foreign policy. It was warmly received by most deputies and observers.

The chamber proceeded to engage in a heated debate. Though the government contained members from parties that held 120 of the 137 seats, reaching a majority was not a straightforward task. While several leaders of the opposition had been involved in the formative negotiations, their parties as a whole had not been consulted. Furthermore, some individuals were upset they had not been included in the government and sought to personally prevent its investiture. In the subsequent arguments, multiple deputies expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of representation of their respective provinces and/or parties, with several threatening secession. Among them was Kalonji, who said he would encourage people of Kasaï to refrain from participating in the central government and form their own autonomous state. One Katangese deputy objected to the same person being appointed as premier and as head of the defence portfolio.

When a vote was finally taken, only 80 of the 137 members of the chamber were present. Of these, 74 voted in favour of the government, five against, and one abstained. The 57 absences were almost all voluntary. Though the government had earned just as many votes as when Kasongo won the presidency of the chamber, the support was not congruent; members of Cléophas Kamitatu&#x27;s wing of the PSA had voted against the government while a few members of the PNP, PUNA, and ABAKO voted in favour of it. Overall, the vote was a disappointment for the MNC-L coalition.

The session was adjourned at 02:05 on 24 June 1960. The senate convened that day to vote on the government. There was another heated debate, in which Iléo and Adoula expressed their strong dissatisfaction with its composition. Confederation of Tribal Associations of Katanga (CONAKAT) members abstained from voting. When arguments concluded, a decisive vote of approval was taken on the government: 60 voted in favour, 12 against, while eight abstained. All dissident arguments for alternative cabinets, particularly Kalonji&#x27;s demand for a new administration, were rendered impotent, and the Lumumba government was officially invested. With the institution of a broad coalition, the parliamentary opposition was officially reduced to only the MNC-K and some individuals.

At the onset of his premiership, Lumumba had two main goals: to ensure that independence would bring a legitimate improvement in the quality of life for the Congolese and to unify the country as a centralised state by eliminating tribalism and regionalism. He was worried that opposition to his government would appear rapidly and would have to be managed quickly and decisively.

To achieve the first aim, Lumumba believed that a comprehensive &quot;Africanisation&quot; of the administration, in spite of its risks, would be necessary. The Belgians were opposed to such an idea, as it would create inefficiency in the Congo&#x27;s bureaucracy and lead to a mass exodus of unemployed civil servants to Belgium, whom they would be unable to absorb into the government there. It was too late for Lumumba to enact Africanisation before independence. Seeking another gesture that might excite the Congolese people, Lumumba proposed to the Belgian government a reduction in sentences for all prisoners and an amnesty for those serving a term of three years or less. Ganshof feared that such an action would jeopardise law and order, and he evaded taking any action until it was too late to fulfill the request. Lumumba&#x27;s opinion of the Belgians was soured by this affair, which contributed to his fear that independence would not appear &quot;real&quot; to the average Congolese.

In seeking to eliminate tribalism and regionalism in the Congo, Lumumba was deeply inspired by the personality and undertakings of Kwame Nkrumah and by Ghanaian ideas of the leadership necessary in post-colonial Africa. He worked to seek such changes through the MNC. Lumumba intended to combine it with its parliamentary allies—CEREA, the PSA, and possibly BALUBAKAT—to form one national party, and to build a following in each province. He hoped it would absorb other parties and become a unifying force for the country.

Independence Day was celebrated on 30 June 1960 in a ceremony attended by many dignitaries, including King Baudouin of Belgium and the foreign press. Baudouin&#x27;s speech praised developments under colonialism, his reference to the &quot;genius&quot; of his great-granduncle Leopold II of Belgium, glossing over atrocities committed during his reign over the Congo Free State. The King continued, &quot;Don&#x27;t compromise the future with hasty reforms, and don&#x27;t replace the structures that Belgium hands over to you until you are sure you can do better. Don&#x27;t be afraid to come to us. We will remain by your side, give you advice.&quot;

Lumumba, who had not been scheduled to speak, delivered an impromptu speech that reminded the audience that the independence of the Congo had not been granted magnanimously by Belgium:

Most European journalists were shocked by the stridency of Lumumba&#x27;s speech. The Western media criticised him. &quot;Time&quot; magazine characterised his speech as a &quot;vicious attack&quot;.

=== Independence ===

Independence Day and the three days that followed it were declared a national holiday. The Congolese were preoccupied by the festivities, which were conducted in relative peace. Meanwhile, Lumumba&#x27;s office was overtaken by a flurry of activity. A diverse group of individuals, Congolese and European, some friends and relatives, hurried about their work. Some undertook specific missions on his behalf, sometimes without direct permission. Numerous Congolese citizens showed up at the office at whim for various reasons. Lumumba, for his part, was mostly preoccupied with a lengthy itinerary of receptions and ceremonies. On 3 July Lumumba declared a general amnesty for prisoners, but it was never implemented. The following morning he convened the Council of Ministers to discuss the unrest among the troops of the Force Publique.

Many soldiers hoped that independence would result in immediate promotions and material gains, but were disappointed by Lumumba&#x27;s slow pace of reform. The rank-and-file felt that the Congolese political class—particularly ministers in the new government—were enriching themselves while failing to improve the troops&#x27; situation. Many of the soldiers were also fatigued from maintaining order during the elections and participating in independence celebrations. The ministers decided to establish four committees to study, respectively, the reorganisation of the administration, the judiciary, and the army, and the enacting of a new statute for state employees. All were to devote special attention to ending racial discrimination. Parliament assembled for the first time since independence and took its first official legislative action by voting to increase the salaries of its members to FC 500,000. Lumumba, fearing the repercussions the raise would have on the budget, was among the few to object, dubbing it a &quot;ruinous folly&quot;.

=== Outbreak of the Congo Crisis ===
On the morning of 5 July 1960, General Émile Janssens, commander of the Force Publique, in response to increasing excitement among the Congolese ranks, summoned all troops on duty at Camp Léopold II. He demanded that the army maintain its discipline and wrote &quot;before independence = after independence&quot; on a blackboard for emphasis. That evening the Congolese sacked the canteen in protest of Janssens. He alerted the reserve garrison of Camp Hardy, 95 miles away in Thysville. The officers tried to organise a convoy to send to Camp Léopold II to restore order, but the men mutinied and seized the armoury. The crisis which followed came to dominate the tenure of the Lumumba government. The next day Lumumba dismissed Janssens and promoted all Congolese soldiers one grade, but mutinies spread out into the Lower Congo.

Although the trouble was highly localised, the country seemed to be overrun by gangs of soldiers and looters. The media reported that Europeans were fleeing the country. In response, Lumumba announced over the radio, &quot;Thoroughgoing reforms are planned in all sectors. My government will make every possible effort to see that our country has a different face in a few months, a few weeks.&quot; In spite of government efforts, the mutinies continued. Mutineers in Leopoldville and Thysville surrendered only upon the personal intervention of Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu.

On 8 July, Lumumba renamed the Force Publique as the (ANC). He Africanised the force by appointing Sergeant Major Victor Lundula as general and commander-in-chief, and chose junior minister and former soldier Joseph Mobutu as colonel and Army chief of staff. These promotions were made in spite of Lundula&#x27;s inexperience and rumours about Mobutu&#x27;s ties to Belgian and US intelligence services. All European officers in the army were replaced with Africans, with a few retained as advisers. By the next day the mutinies had spread throughout the entire country. Five Europeans, including the Italian vice-consul, were ambushed and killed by machine gun fire in Élisabethville, and nearly the entire European population of Luluabourg barricaded itself in an office building for safety. An estimated two dozen Europeans were murdered in the mutiny. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu embarked on a tour across the country to promote peace and appoint new army commanders.

Belgium intervened on 10 July, dispatching 6,000 troops to the Congo, ostensibly to protect its citizens from the violence. Most Europeans went to Katanga Province, which possessed much of the Congo&#x27;s natural resources. Though personally angered, Lumumba condoned the action on 11 July, provided that the Belgian forces acted only to protect their citizens, followed the direction of the Congolese armed forces, and ceased their activities once order was restored. The same day the Belgian Navy bombarded Matadi after it had evacuated its citizens, killing 19 Congolese civilians. This greatly inflamed tensions, leading to renewed Congolese attacks on Europeans. Shortly thereafter Belgian forces moved to occupy cities throughout the country, including the capital, where they clashed with Congolese soldiers. On the whole, the Belgian intervention made the situation worse for the armed forces.

The State of Katanga declared independence under regional premier Moïse Tshombe on 11 July, with support from the Belgian government and mining companies such as Union Minière. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were denied use of Élisabethville&#x27;s airstrip the following day and returned to the capital, only to be accosted by fleeing Belgians. They sent a protest of the Belgian deployment to the United Nations, requesting that they withdraw and be replaced by an international peacekeeping force. The UN Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 143, calling for immediate removal of Belgian forces and establishment of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). Despite the arrival of UN troops, unrest continued. Lumumba requested UN troops to suppress the rebellion in Katanga, but the UN forces were not authorised to do so under their mandate. On 14 July Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu broke off diplomatic relations with Belgium. Frustrated at dealing with the West, they sent a telegram to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, requesting that he closely monitor the situation in the Congo.

=== Visit to the United States ===

Lumumba decided to travel to New York City in order to personally express the position of his government to the United Nations. Shortly before his departure, he announced that he had signed an economic agreement with a U.S. businessman who had created the Congo International Management Corporation (CIMCO). According to the contract (which had yet to be ratified by parliament), CIMCO was to form a development corporation to invest in and manage certain sectors of the economy. He also declared his approval of the second security council resolution, adding that &quot;[Soviet] aid was no longer necessary&quot; and announced his intention to seek technical assistance from the United States. On 22 July Lumumba left the Congo for New York City. He and his entourage reached the United States two days later after brief stops in Accra and London. There they rendezvoused with his UN delegation at the Barclay Hotel to prepare for meetings with UN officials. Lumumba was focused on discussing the withdrawal of Belgian troops and various options for technical assistance with Dag Hammarskjöld.

African diplomats were keen that the meetings would be successful; they convinced Lumumba to wait until the Congo was more stable before reaching any more major economic agreements (such as the CIMCO arrangement). Lumumba saw Hammarskjöld and other staff of the UN Secretariat over three days on 24, 25, and 26 July. Though Lumumba and Hammarskjöld were restrained towards one another, their discussions went smoothly. In a press conference, Lumumba reaffirmed his government&#x27;s commitment to &quot;positive neutralism&quot;.

On 27 July, Lumumba went to the American capital Washington, D.C.. He met with the US Secretary of State and appealed for financial and technical assistance. The US government informed Lumumba that they would offer aid only through the UN. The following day he received a telegram from Gizenga detailing a clash at Kolwezi between Belgian and Congolese forces. Lumumba felt that the UN was hampering his attempts to expel the Belgian troops and defeat the Katangan rebels. On 29 July, Lumumba went to Ottawa, the capital of Canada, to request help. The Canadians rebuffed a request for technicians and said that they would channel their assistance through the UN. Frustrated, Lumumba met with the Soviet ambassador in Ottawa and discussed a donation of military equipment. When he returned to New York the following evening, he was restrained towards the UN. The United States government&#x27;s attitude had become more negative, due to reports of the rapes and violence committed by ANC soldiers, and scrutiny from Belgium. The latter was chagrined that Lumumba had received a high-level reception in Washington. The Belgian government regarded Lumumba as communist, anti-white, and anti-Western. Given its experience in the Congo, many other Western governments gave credence to the Belgian view.

Frustrated with the UN&#x27;s apparent inaction towards Katanga as he departed the US, Lumumba decided to delay his return to the Congo. He visited several African states. This was apparently done to put pressure on Hammarskjöld and, failing that, to seek guarantees of bilateral military support to suppress Katanga. Between 2 and 8 August, Lumumba toured Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, and Togo. He was well received in each country and issued joint communiques with their respective heads of state. Guinea and Ghana pledged independent military support, while the others expressed their desire to work through the United Nations to resolve the Katangan secession. In Ghana, Lumumba signed a secret agreement with President Nkrumah providing for a &quot;Union of African States&quot;. Centred in Léopoldville, it was to be a federation with a republican government. They agreed to hold a summit of African states in Léopoldville between 25 and 30 August to further discuss the issue. Lumumba returned to the Congo, apparently confident that he could now depend upon African military assistance. He also believed that he could procure African bilateral technical aid, which placed him at odds with Hammarskjöld&#x27;s goal of funnelling support through ONUC. Lumumba and some ministers were wary of the UN option, as it would supply them with functionaries who would not respond directly to their authority.

=== Attempts at re-consolidation ===

On 9 August, Lumumba proclaimed a state of emergency throughout the Congo. He subsequently issued several orders in an attempt to reassert his dominance on the political scene. The first outlawed the formation of associations without government sanction. A second asserted the government&#x27;s right to ban publications that produced material likely to bring the administration into disrepute. On 11 August the printed an editorial which declared that the Congolese did not want to fall &quot;under a second kind of slavery&quot;. The editor was summarily arrested and four days later publication of the daily ceased. Shortly afterward, the government shut down the Belga and Agence France-Presse wire services. The press restrictions garnered a wave of harsh criticism from the Belgian media.

Lumumba decreed the nationalisation of local Belga offices, creating the , as a means of eliminating what he considered a centre of biased reporting, as well as creating a service through which the government&#x27;s platform could be more easily communicated to the public. Another order stipulated that official approval had to be obtained six days in advance of public gatherings. On 16 August Lumumba announced the installation of a for the duration of six months. 

Throughout August, Lumumba increasingly withdrew from his full cabinet and instead consulted with officials and ministers he trusted, such as Maurice Mpolo, Joseph Mbuyi, Kashamura, Gizenga, and Antoine Kiwewa. Lumumba&#x27;s office was in disarray, and few members of his staff did any work. His , Damien Kandolo, was often absent and acted as a spy on behalf of the Belgian government. Lumumba was constantly being delivered rumours from informants and the , encouraging him to grow deeply suspicious of others. In an attempt to keep him informed, Serge Michel, his press secretary, enlisted the assistance of three Belgian telex operators, who supplied him with copies of all outgoing journalistic dispatches.

Lumumba immediately ordered Congolese troops to put down the rebellion in secessionist South Kasai, which was home to strategic rail links necessary for a campaign in Katanga. The operation was successful, but the conflict soon devolved into ethnic violence. The army became involved in massacres of Luba civilians. The people and politicians of South Kasai held Lumumba personally responsible for the actions of the army. Kasa-Vubu publicly announced that only a federalist government could bring peace and stability to the Congo. This broke his tenuous political alliance with Lumumba and tilted the political favour in the country away from Lumumba&#x27;s unitary state. Ethnic tensions rose against him (especially around Leopoldville), and the Catholic Church, still powerful in the country, openly criticised his government. Even with South Kasai subdued, the Congo lacked the necessary strength to retake Katanga. Lumumba had summoned an African conference in Leopoldville from 25 to 31 August, but no foreign heads of state appeared and no country pledged military support. Lumumba demanded once again that UN peacekeeping soldiers assist in suppressing the revolt, threatening to bring in Soviet troops if they refused. The UN subsequently denied Lumumba the use of its forces. The possibility of a direct Soviet intervention was thought increasingly likely.

== Dismissal ==
=== Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s revocation order ===

President Kasa-Vubu began fearing a Lumumbist coup d&#x27;état would take place. On the evening of 5 September, Kasa-Vubu announced over radio that he had dismissed Lumumba and six of his ministers from the government for the massacres in South Kasai and for involving the Soviets in the Congo. Upon hearing the broadcast, Lumumba went to the national radio station, which was under UN guard. Though they had been ordered to bar Lumumba&#x27;s entry, the UN troops allowed the prime minister in, as they had no specific instructions to use force against him. Lumumba denounced his dismissal over the radio as illegitimate, and in turn labelled Kasa-Vubu a traitor and declared him deposed. Kasa-Vubu had not declared the approval of any responsible ministers of his decision, making his action legally invalid. Lumumba noted this in a letter to Hammarskjöld and a radio broadcast at 05:30 on 6 September. Later that day Kasa-Vubu managed to secure the countersignatures to his order of Albert Delvaux, Minister Resident in Belgium, and Justin Marie Bomboko, Minister of Foreign Affairs. With them, he announced again his dismissal of Lumumba and six other ministers at 16:00 over Brazzaville radio.

Lumumba and the ministers who remained loyal to him ordered the arrest of Delvaux and Bomboko for countersigning the dismissal order. The latter sought refuge in the presidential palace (which was guarded by UN peacekeepers), but early in the morning on 7 September, the former was detained and confined in the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies convened to discuss Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s dismissal order and hear Lumumba&#x27;s reply. Delvaux made an unexpected appearance and took to the dais to denounce his arrest and declare his resignation from the government. He was enthusiastically applauded by the opposition. Lumumba then delivered his speech. Instead of directly attacking Kasa-Vubu &quot;ad hominem&quot;, Lumumba accused obstructionist politicians and ABAKO of using the presidency as a front for disguising their activities. He noted that Kasa-Vubu had never before offered any criticism of the government and portrayed their relationship as one of cooperation. He lambasted Delvaux and Minister of Finance Pascal Nkayi for their role in the UN Geneva negotiations and for their failure to consult the rest of the government. Lumumba followed his arguments with an analysis of the &quot;Loi Fondemental&quot; and finished by asking Parliament to assemble a &quot;commission of sages&quot; to examine the Congo&#x27;s troubles.

The Chamber, at the suggestion of its presiding officer, voted to annul both Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s and Lumumba&#x27;s declarations of dismissal, 60 to 19. The following day Lumumba delivered a similar speech before the Senate, which subsequently delivered the government a vote of confidence, 49 to zero with seven abstentions. According to Article 51, Parliament was granted the &quot;exclusive privilege&quot; to interpret the constitution. In cases of doubt and controversy, the Congolese were originally supposed to appeal constitutional questions to the Belgian Conseil d&#x27;État. With the rupture of relations in July this was no longer possible, so no authoritative interpretation or mediation was available to bring a legal resolution to the dispute. Numerous African diplomats and newly appointed ONUC head Rajeshwar Dayal attempted to get the president and prime minister to reconcile their differences, but failed. On 13 September, the Parliament held a joint session between the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Though several members short of a quorum, they voted to grant Lumumba emergency powers.

=== Mobutu&#x27;s coup ===


On 14 September Mobutu announced over the radio that he was launching a &quot;peaceful revolution&quot; to break the political impasse and therefore neutralising the President, Lumumba&#x27;s and Iléo&#x27;s respective governments, and Parliament until 31 December. He stated that &quot;technicians&quot; would run the administration while the politicians sorted out their differences. In a subsequent press conference, he clarified that Congolese university graduates would be asked to form a government, and further declared that all Eastern Bloc countries should close their embassies. Lumumba was surprised by the coup and that evening he travelled to Camp Leopold II in search of Mobutu to try and change his mind. He spent the night there but was attacked in the morning by Luba soldiers, who blamed him for the atrocities in South Kasaï. A Ghanaian ONUC contingent managed to extricate him, but his briefcase was left behind. Some of his political opponents recovered it and published documents it supposedly contained, including letters from Nkrumah, appeals for support addressed to the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a memorandum dated 16 September declaring the presence of Soviet troops within one week, and a letter dated 15 September from Lumumba to the provincial presidents (Tshombe excepted) entitled &quot;Measures to be applied during the first stages of the dictatorship&quot;. Some of these papers were genuine, while others, especially the memorandum and the letter to the provincial presidents, were almost certainly forgeries.

Despite the coup, African diplomats still worked towards a reconciliation between Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu. According to the Ghanaians, a verbal agreement of principle concerning closer co-operation between the Head of State and the government was put into writing. Lumumba signed it, but Kasa-Vubu suddenly refused to reciprocate. The Ghanaians suspected that Belgium and the United States were responsible. Kasa-Vubu was eager to re-integrate Katanga back into the Congo through negotiation, and Tshombe had declared that he would not participate in any discussions with a government that included the &quot;communist&quot; Lumumba.

After consultation with Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba, Mobutu announced that he would summon a round table conference to discuss the political future of the Congo. His attempts to follow through were disrupted by Lumumba who, from his official residence, was acting as though he still held the premiership. He continued to hold meetings with members of his government, senators, deputies, and political supporters, and to issue public statements. On numerous occasions he left his residence to tour the restaurants of the capital, maintaining that he still held power. Frustrated by the way he was being treated by Lumumba and facing intense political pressure, by the end of the month Mobutu was no longer encouraging reconciliation; he had aligned with Kasa-Vubu. He ordered ANC units to surround Lumumba&#x27;s residence, but a cordon of UN peacekeepers prevented them from making an arrest. Lumumba was confined to his home. On 7 October Lumumba announced the formation of a new government that included Bolikango and Kalonji, but he later proposed that the UN supervise a national referendum that would settle the split in the government.

On 24 November, the UN voted to recognise Mobutu&#x27;s new delegates to the General Assembly, disregarding Lumumba&#x27;s original appointees. Lumumba resolved to join Deputy Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga in Stanleyville and lead a campaign to regain power. On 27 November he left the capital in a convoy of nine cars with Rémy Mwamba, Pierre Mulele, his wife Pauline, and his youngest child. Instead of heading with all haste to the Orientale Province border—where soldiers loyal to Gizenga were waiting to receive him—Lumumba delayed by touring villages and making conversation with the locals. On 1 December Mobutu&#x27;s troops caught up with his party as it crossed the Sankuru River in Lodi. Lumumba and his advisers had made it to the far side, but his wife and child were left to be captured on the bank. Fearing for their safety, Lumumba took the ferry back, against the advice of Mwamba and Mulele, who both, fearing they would never see him again, bid him farewell. Mobutu&#x27;s men arrested him. He was moved to Port Francqui the next day and flown back to Léopoldville. Mobutu claimed Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes.

===UN response===
Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld made an appeal to Kasa-Vubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to due process. The Soviet Union denounced Hammarskjöld and the First World as responsible for Lumumba&#x27;s arrest and demanded his release.

The United Nations Security Council was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba&#x27;s immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. The Soviets also requested the immediate resignation of Hammarskjöld, the arrests of Mobutu and Tshombe, and the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces. Hammarskjöld, answering Soviet criticism of his Congo operations, said that if the UN forces were withdrawn from the Congo, &quot;I fear everything will crumble.&quot;

The threat to the UN cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their contingents by Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Indonesia, Morocco, and Guinea. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8–2. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskjöld increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union.

==Final days and assassination==

Lumumba was sent first on 3 December 1960 to Thysville military barracks Camp Hardy, 150 km (about 100 miles) from Léopoldville. He was accompanied by Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, two political associates who had planned to assist him in setting up a new government. They were fed poorly by the prison guards, as per Mobutu&#x27;s orders. In Lumumba&#x27;s last documented letter, he wrote to Rajeshwar Dayal: &quot;In a word, we are living amid absolutely impossible conditions; moreover, they are against the law.&quot;

On the morning of 13 January 1961, discipline at Camp Hardy faltered. Soldiers refused to work unless they were paid; they received a total of 400,000 francs ($8,000) from the Katanga Cabinet. Some supported Lumumba&#x27;s release, while others thought he was dangerous. Kasa-Vubu, Mobutu, Foreign Minister Justin Marie Bomboko, and Head of Security Services Victor Nendaka Bika personally arrived at the camp and negotiated with the troops. Conflict was avoided, but it became apparent that holding a controversial prisoner in the camp was too great a risk. Harold Charles d&#x27;Aspremont Lynden, the last Belgian Minister of the Colonies, ordered that Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito be taken to the State of Katanga.

Lumumba was forcibly restrained on the flight to Elisabethville on 17 January 1961. On arrival, his associates and he were conducted under arrest to the Brouwez House, where they were brutally beaten and tortured by Katangan officers, while President Tshombe and his cabinet decided what to do with him.

Later that night, Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito were driven to an isolated spot where three firing squads had been assembled that were commanded by Belgian contract officer Julien Gat. The orders to murder Lumumba were given by Katangan leaders. The last stage of the execution was personally undertaken by the Belgian contracts led by Police Commissioner Frans Verscheure. Lumumba, Mpolo, and Okito were put up against a tree and shot one at a time. The execution is thought to have taken place on 17 January 1961, between 21:40 and 21:43 according to a later Belgian parliamentary inquiry. Tshombe, two other ministers, and four Belgian officers under the command of the Katangan authorities were present. The bodies were thrown into a shallow grave.

The following morning, on orders of Katangan Interior Minister Godefroid Munongo, who wanted to make the bodies disappear and prevent a burial site from being created, Belgian Gendarmerie officer Gerard Soete and his team dug up and dismembered the corpses, and dissolved them in sulfuric acid while the bones were ground and scattered.

Lumumba&#x27;s assassination allowed the governments of Belgium, the U.S., and reportedly the United Kingdom, to abandon their own assassination plans. Allen Dulles, then the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) supported assassinating Lumumba, reportedly as he had heard Eisenhower wishing that Lumumba &quot;fall into a river full of crocodiles.&quot; Eisenhower&#x27;s involvement in the CIA&#x27;s assassination plans remains speculative.

===Announcement of death===

No statement was released until three weeks later, despite rumours that Lumumba was dead. Katangan Secretary of State of Information Lucas Samalenge was one of the first people to reveal Lumumba&#x27;s death, on 18 January. According to De Witte, Samalenge went to the bar &quot;Le Relais&quot; in Élisabethville and &quot;told everyone willing to listen that Lumumba was dead and that he had kicked his corpse. He went around repeating the story until the police took him away.&quot;

On 10 February, the radio announced that Lumumba and two other prisoners had escaped. His death was formally announced over Katangan radio on 13 February: it was alleged that he was killed by enraged villagers three days after escaping from Kolatey prison farm.

After the announcement of Lumumba&#x27;s death, street protests were organised in several European countries; in Belgrade, protesters sacked the Belgian embassy and confronted the police, and in London, a crowd marched from Trafalgar Square to the Belgian embassy, where a letter of protest was delivered and where protesters clashed with police. In New York City, a demonstration at the United Nations Security Council turned violent and spilled over into the streets.

==Foreign involvement in his execution==
The ongoing Cold War affected both Belgium and the United States&#x27; perception of Lumumba, as they feared he was increasingly subject to communist influence due to his appeals for Soviet aid. However, according to journalist Sean Kelly, who covered the events as a correspondent for the Voice of America, Lumumba did this not because he was a communist, but because he felt that the Soviet Union was the only power which would support his government&#x27;s effort to defeat Belgian-supported separatists and rid itself of colonial influence. The US was the first country from which Lumumba requested help. Lumumba, for his part, denied being a communist, stating that he found colonialism and communism to be equally deplorable, and publicly professed his personal preference for neutrality between the East and West.

===Belgian involvement===
On 18 January, panicked by reports that the burial of the three bodies had been observed, members of the execution team dug up the remains and moved them for reburial to a place near the border with Northern Rhodesia. Belgian Police Commissioner Gerard Soete later admitted in several accounts that he and his brother led the original exhumation. Police Commissioner Frans Verscheure also took part. On the afternoon and evening of 21 January, Commissioner Soete and his brother dug up Lumumba&#x27;s corpse for a second time, cut it up with a hacksaw, and dissolved it in concentrated sulfuric acid.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, Lumumba&#x27;s assassination was investigated. In a 1999 interview on Belgian television, in a program about his assassination, Soete displayed a bullet and two teeth that he claimed he had saved from Lumumba&#x27;s body, which included a gold-capped tooth. According to the 2001 Belgian Commission investigating Lumumba&#x27;s assassination: (1) Belgium wanted Lumumba arrested, (2) Belgium was not particularly concerned with Lumumba&#x27;s physical well-being, and (3) although informed of the danger to Lumumba&#x27;s life, Belgium did not take any action to avert his death. The report concluded that Belgium had not ordered Lumumba&#x27;s execution. In February 2002, the Belgian government formally apologised to the Congolese people, and admitted to a &quot;moral responsibility&quot; and &quot;an irrefutable portion of responsibility in the events that led to the death of Lumumba&quot;.

Lumumba&#x27;s execution was carried out by a firing squad led by Belgian mercenary Julien Gat; Katangan Police Commissioner Verscheure, who was Belgian, had overall command of the execution site. The separatist Katangan regime was heavily supported by the Belgian mining conglomerate Union Minière du Haut-Katanga.

In the early 21st century, De Witte found documents challenging the idea that Belgian officers operating in Katanga only took orders from the Katangan authorities. Belgian officers were also following Belgian government policy and orders. The Belgian Minister of African Affairs Count Harold d&#x27;Aspremont Lynden, who had been tasked with organising Katanga&#x27;s secession, on 6 October 1960 sent a cable to Katanga saying that policy from now on would be the &quot;definitive elimination of Patrice Lumumba&quot;. Lynden had also insisted on 15 January 1961, that an imprisoned Lumumba should be sent to Katanga, which essentially would have been a death sentence.

===United States involvement===

The 2001 report by the Belgian Commission describes previous U.S. and Belgian plots to kill Lumumba. Among them was a Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored attempt to poison him. US president Dwight D. Eisenhower authorised the assassination of Lumumba in 1960. However, the plot to poison him was abandoned. CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, a key person in the plan, devised a number of toxic materials to be used for the assassination. In September 1960, Gottlieb brought a vial of the poison to the Congo, and CIA Station Chief Larry Devlin developed plans to place it on Lumumba&#x27;s toothbrush or in his food. The plot was abandoned because Devlin&#x27;s agent was unable to carry out the assassination, and the replacement agent Justin O&#x27;Donnell refused to participate in an assassination plot.

According to Madeleine G. Kalb in her book, &quot;Congo Cables&quot;, many communications by Devlin at the time urged the elimination of Lumumba. Michael P. Holt writes that Devlin also helped to direct the search to capture Lumumba and also helped arrange his transfer to the separatist authorities in Katanga. John Stockwell, a CIA officer in the Congo and later a CIA station chief, wrote in 1978 that the CIA base chief in Elizabethville was in direct contact with Lumumba&#x27;s killers on the night he was executed. Stockwell also wrote that a CIA agent had a body in the trunk of his car that they were trying dispose of. Stockwell, who knew Devlin well, believed that Devlin knew more than anyone else about the murder.

The inauguration of John F. Kennedy in January 1961 caused fear among Mobutu&#x27;s faction, and within the CIA, that the incoming Kennedy administration would favour the imprisoned Lumumba. While awaiting his presidential inauguration, Kennedy had come to believe that Lumumba should be released from custody, though not be allowed to return to power. Lumumba was killed three days before Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration on 20 January, though Kennedy did not learn of the killing until 13 February. Kennedy was informed by United Nations ambassador Adlai Stevenson and according to Jacques Lowe who was with him at the time &quot;his hand went to his head in utter despair, &#x27;Oh, no,&#x27; I heard him groan&quot;.

==== Church Committee ====
In 1975, the Church Committee went on record with the finding that CIA chief Allen Dulles had ordered Lumumba&#x27;s assassination as &quot;an urgent and prime objective&quot;. Furthermore, declassified CIA cables quoted or mentioned in the Church report, and in Kalb (1982), mention two specific CIA plots to murder Lumumba: the poison plot and a shooting plot.

The Committee later found that while the CIA had conspired to kill Lumumba, it was not directly involved in the murder.

==== U.S. government documents ====
In the early 21st century, declassified documents revealed that the CIA had plotted to assassinate Lumumba. The documents indicate that the Congolese leaders who overthrew Lumumba and transferred him to the Katangan authorities, including Mobutu Sese Seko and Joseph Kasa-Vubu, received money and weapons directly from the CIA. The same disclosure showed that, at the time, the U.S. government believed that Lumumba was a communist, and feared him because of what it considered the threat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War.

In 2000, a newly declassified interview with Robert Johnson, who was the minutekeeper of the U.S. National Security Council at the time in question, revealed that U.S. President Eisenhower had said &quot;something [to CIA chief Allen Dulles] to the effect that Lumumba should be eliminated&quot;. The interview from the Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s inquiry on covert action was released in August 2000.

In 2013, the U.S. State Department admitted that President Eisenhower discussed plans at a NSC meeting on 18 August 1960 to assassinate Lumumba. However, documents released in 2017 revealed that an American role in Lumumba&#x27;s murder was only under consideration by the CIA. CIA Chief Allan Dulles had allocated $100,000 to accomplish the act, but the plan was not carried out.

===United Kingdom involvement===
In June 2001, newly discovered documents by De Witte revealed that while the US and Belgium actively plotted to murder Lumumba, the British government secretly wanted him &quot;got rid of&quot; because they believed he posed a serious threat to British interests in the Congo, such as mining facilities in Katanga. Howard Smith, who was to become head of MI5 in 1979, said, &quot;I can see only two possible solutions to the problem. The first is the simple one of ensuring Lumumba&#x27;s removal from the scene by killing him. This should solve the problem&quot;.

In April 2013, in a letter to the &quot;London Review of Books,&quot; British parliamentarian David Lea reported having discussed Lumumba&#x27;s death with MI6 officer Daphne Park shortly before she died in March 2010. Park had been posted to Leopoldville at the time of Lumumba&#x27;s death, and was later a semi-official spokesperson for MI6 in the House of Lords. According to Lea, when he mentioned &quot;the uproar&quot; surrounding Lumumba&#x27;s abduction and murder, and recalled the theory that MI6 might have had &quot;something to do with it&quot;, Park replied, &quot;We did. I organised it.&quot; The BBC reported that, subsequently, &quot;Whitehall sources&quot; described the claims of MI6 involvement as &quot;speculative&quot;.

=== Repatriation of his remains ===
On 30 June 2020, Lumumba&#x27;s daughter, Juliana Lumumba, appealed directly in a letter to Philippe, King of the Belgians, the return of &quot;the relics of Patrice Émery Lumumba to the ground of his ancestors&quot;, describing her father as &quot;a hero without a grave&quot;. The letter stated: &quot;Why, after his terrible murder, have Lumumba&#x27;s remains been condemned to remain a soul forever wandering, without a grave to shelter his eternal rest?&quot; On 10 September 2020, a Belgian judge ruled that Lumumba&#x27;s remains – which then consisted of just a single gold-capped tooth (Gerard Soete had lost the other tooth of Lumumba between 1999 and 2020) – must be returned to his family.

In May 2021, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi announced that there would be a repatriation of the last remains of Lumumba, however, the handover ceremony was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 June 2022, during a speech in the DRC to the country&#x27;s parliament, King Philippe reiterated regrets for Belgium&#x27;s colonial past in its former colony, describing Belgian rule as a &quot;regime ... of unequal relations, unjustifiable in itself, marked by paternalism, discrimination and racism&quot; that &quot;led to violent acts and humiliations&quot;.

On 20 June, Lumumba&#x27;s children received the remains of their father during a ceremony at Egmont Palace in Brussels, where the federal prosecutor formally handed custody to the family. The Belgian Prime Minister, Alexander De Croo, apologised on behalf of the Belgian government for his country&#x27;s role in Lumumba&#x27;s assassination: &quot;For my part, I would like to apologise here, in the presence of his family, for the way in which the Belgian government influenced the decision to end the life of the country&#x27;s first prime minister.&quot; &quot;A man was murdered for his political convictions, his words, his ideals&quot;, he added. Later the full-sized coffin was brought in public and draped in the Congolese flag for the Congolese and wider African diaspora of Belgium to pay their respects before the return.

A special mausoleum was built in Kinshasa to house his remains. The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared three days of national mourning. The burial coincided with the 61st anniversary of his famous independence day speech. An investigation by Belgian prosecutors for &quot;war crimes&quot; related to Lumumba&#x27;s murder is ongoing. His remains were laid to rest 30 June 2022. On 18 November 2024, the mausoleum was vandalised and Lumumba&#x27;s coffin broken, with the interior ministry saying that his tooth was in safe condition.

==Political ideology==
Lumumba did not espouse a comprehensive political or economic platform. According to Patricia Goff, Lumumba was the first Congolese to articulate a narrative of the Congo that contradicted traditional Belgian views of colonisation, and he highlighted the suffering of the indigenous population under European rule. Goff writes that Lumumba was alone among his contemporaries in encompassing all Congolese people in his narrative (the others confined their discussions to their respective ethnicities or regions), and he offered a basis for national identity that was predicated upon having survived colonial victimisation, as well as the people&#x27;s innate dignity, humanity, strength, and unity. Lumumba&#x27;s ideal of humanism included the values of egalitarianism, social justice, liberty, and the recognition of fundamental rights. He viewed the state as a positive advocate for the public welfare and its intervention in Congolese society necessary to ensure equality, justice, and social harmony.

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
Full accounts of Lumumba&#x27;s life and death were printed within weeks of his demise. Beginning in 1961 and continuing for several years thereafter, some biographies on him were published. Most were highly partisan. Several early works on the Congo Crisis also discussed Lumumba at length. In the years after his death, misconceptions of Lumumba persisted by both his supporters and his critics. Serious study of him faded over the following decades. Academic discussion of his legacy was largely limited until the later stages of Mobutu&#x27;s rule in the Congo; Mobutu&#x27;s opening of the country to multi-party politics beginning in 1990 revived interest in Lumumba&#x27;s death. 

Belgian literature in the decades following the Congo Crisis portrayed him as incompetent, demagogic, aggressive, ungrateful, undiplomatic, and communist. Most Africanists of the 20th century, such as Jean-Claude Willame, viewed Lumumba as an intransigent, unrealistic idealist without any tangible programme who distanced himself from his contemporaries and alienated the Western world with radical anti-colonial rhetoric. They saw him as greatly responsible for the political crisis that resulted in his downfall. A handful of other writers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, shared the belief that Lumumba&#x27;s goals were unattainable in 1960 but nevertheless viewed him as a martyr of Congolese independence at the hands of certain Western interests and the victim of events over which he had little control. According to sociologist De Witte, both of these perspectives overstate the political weaknesses and isolation of Lumumba.

A conventional narrative of Lumumba&#x27;s premiership and downfall eventually emerged; he was an uncompromising radical who provoked his own murder by angering domestic separatists. Within Belgium, the popular narrative of his death implicated the involvement of some Belgian individuals, but stressed that they were acting &quot;under orders&quot; of African figures and that the Belgian government was uninvolved. Some Belgian circles peddled the notion that the United States—particularly the Central Intelligence Agency—had arranged the killing. 

This narrative was challenged by De Witte&#x27;s 2001 work, &quot;The Assassination of Patrice Lumumba&quot;, which provided evidence that the Belgian government—with the complicity of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the UN—was largely responsible for his death. Media discussion of Lumumba, spurred by the release of the book as well as a feature film in 2000, &quot;Lumumba&quot;, became significantly more positive afterwards. A new narrative subsequently emerged, holding Western espionage at fault for Lumumba&#x27;s death, and emphasising the threat his charismatic appeal posed to Western interests. Lumumba&#x27;s role in the Congolese independence movement is well-documented, and he is typically recognised as its most important and influential leader. His exploits are usually celebrated as the work of him as an individual and not that of a larger movement.

===Political impact===
Due to his relatively short career in government, quick removal from power, and controversial death, a consensus has not been reached on Lumumba&#x27;s political legacy. His downfall was detrimental to African nationalist movements, and he is generally remembered primarily for his assassination.

Numerous American historians have cited his death as a major contributing factor to the radicalisation of the American civil rights movement in the 1960s, and many African-American activist organisations and publications used public comment on his death to express their ideology. Popular memory of Lumumba has often discarded his politics and reduced him to a symbol.

Within the Congo, Lumumba is primarily portrayed as a symbol of national unity, while abroad he is usually cast as a Pan-Africanist and anticolonial revolutionary. The ideological legacy of Lumumba is known as (French for Lumumbism). Rather than a complex doctrine, it is usually framed as a set of fundamental principles consisting of nationalism, Pan-Africanism, nonalignment, and social progressivism. Mobutism built off of these principles. Congolese university students—who had up until independence held little respect for Lumumba—embraced after his death. According to political scientist Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja, Lumumba&#x27;s &quot;greatest legacy ... for the Congo is the ideal of national unity&quot;. Nzongola-Ntalaja further posited that, as a result of Lumumba&#x27;s high praise of the independence movement and his work to end the Katangese secession, &quot;the people of the Congo are likely to remain steadfast in their defense of national unity and territorial integrity, come hell or high water.&quot; Political scientist Ali Mazrui wrote, &quot;It looks as if the &quot;memory&quot; of Lumumba may contribute more to the &#x27;oneness&#x27; of the Congolese than anything Lumumba himself actually did while he was still alive.&quot;

Following the suppression of the rebellions of 1964 and 1965, most Lumumbist ideology was confined to isolated groups of intellectuals who faced repression under Mobutu&#x27;s regime. By 1966 there was little popular devotion to him outside of the political elite. Centres of Lumumba&#x27;s popularity in his lifetime underwent a gradual decline in fidelity to his person and ideas. According to Africanist Bogumil Jewsiewicki, by 1999 &quot;the only faithful surviving Lumumbist nucleus is located in Sankuru and Maniema, and its loyalty is questionable (more ethnical, regional, and sentimental than ideological and political).&quot; Lumumba&#x27;s image was unpopular in southern Kasai for years after his death, as many Baluba remained aware of the military campaign he ordered in August 1960 that resulted in violent atrocities against their people.

At least a dozen Congolese political parties have claimed to bear Lumumba&#x27;s political and spiritual heritage. Despite this, few entities have attempted or succeeded in incorporating his ideas into a comprehensible political program. Most of these parties have enjoyed little electoral support, though Gizenga&#x27;s was represented in the Congolese coalition government formed under President Joseph Kabila in 2006. Aside from student groups, Lumumbist ideals play only a minor role in current Congolese politics. Congolese presidents Mobutu, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, and Joseph Kabila all claimed to inherit Lumumba&#x27;s legacy and paid tribute to him early on in their tenures.

=== Martyrdom ===
The circumstances of Lumumba&#x27;s death have led him to often be portrayed as a martyr. While his demise led to an outburst of mass demonstrations abroad and quick creation of a martyr image internationally, the immediate reaction to his death in the Congo was not as uniform. Tetela, Songye, and Luba-Katanga peoples created folks songs of mourning for him, but these were groups which had been involved in political alliances with him and, at the time, Lumumba was unpopular in large segments of the Congolese populace, particularly in the capital, Bas-Congo, Katanga, and South Kasai. Some of his actions and the portrayal of him as a communist by his detractors had also generated disaffection in the army, civil service, labour unions, and the Catholic Church. Lumumba&#x27;s reputation as a martyr in the collective memory of the Congolese was only cemented later, partly due to the initiatives of Mobutu.

In Congolese collective memory, it is perceived that Lumumba was killed through Western machinations because he defended the Congo&#x27;s self-determination. The killing is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West. Lumumba&#x27;s determination to pursue his goals is extrapolated upon the Congolese people as their own; securing the Congo&#x27;s dignity and self-determination would thus ensure their &quot;redemption&quot; from victimisation by Western powers. Historian David Van Reybrouck wrote, &quot;In no time Lumumba became a martyr of decolonisation ... He owed this status more to the horrible end of his life than to his political successes.&quot; Journalist Michela Wrong remarked that &quot;He really did become a hero after his death, in a way that one has to wonder if he would have been such a hero if he had remained and run the country and faced all the problems that running a country as big as Congo would have inevitably brought.&quot; Drama scholar Peit Defraeya wrote, &quot;Lumumba as a dead martyr has become a more compelling figure in liberationist discourse than the controversial live politician.&quot; Historian Pedro Monaville wrote that &quot;his globally iconic status was not commensurate with his more complex legacy in [the] Congo.&quot; Cooptation of Lumumba&#x27;s legacy by Congolese presidents and state media has generated doubts in the Congolese public about his reputation.

=== Commemoration and official tributes ===
In 1961 Adoula became Prime Minister of the Congo. Shortly after assuming office he went to Stanleyville and laid a wreath of flowers at an impromptu monument established for Lumumba. After Tshombe became Prime Minister in 1964, he also went to Stanleyville and did the same. On 30 June 1966, Mobutu rehabilitated Lumumba&#x27;s image and proclaimed him a &quot;national hero&quot;. He declared a series of other measures meant to commemorate Lumumba, though few of these were ever executed aside from the release of a banknote with his visage the subsequent year. This banknote was the only paper money during Mobutu&#x27;s rule that bore the face of a leader other than the incumbent president. In following years state mention of Lumumba declined and Mobutu&#x27;s regime viewed unofficial tributes to him with suspicion. Following Laurent-Désiré Kabila&#x27;s seizure of power in the 1990s, a new line of Congolese francs was issued bearing Lumumba&#x27;s image.

In January 2003, Joseph Kabila, who succeeded his father as president, inaugurated a statue of Lumumba. In Guinea, Lumumba was featured on a coin and two regular banknotes despite not having any national ties to the country. This was an unprecedented occurrence in the modern history of national currency, as images of foreigners are normally reserved only for specially-released commemorative money. As of 2020, Lumumba has been featured on 16 different postage stamps. Many streets and public squares around the world have been named after him. The Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia in Moscow (then Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of the USSR) was renamed &quot;Patrice Lumumba Peoples&#x27; Friendship University&quot; in 1961. It was renamed again in 1992 and back in 2023.

In 2013, the planned community of Lumumbaville was named after him.

=== In popular culture ===
Lumumba is viewed as one of the &quot;fathers of independence&quot; of the Congo. The image of Lumumba appears frequently in social media and is often used as a rallying cry in demonstrations of social defiance. His figure is prevalent in art and literature, mostly outside of the Congo. He was referenced by numerous African-American writers of the American civil rights movement, especially in their works of the post-civil rights era. Malcolm X declared him &quot;the greatest black man who ever walked the African continent&quot;.

Among the most prominent works featuring him are Aimé Césaire&#x27;s 1966 play, &quot;Une saison au Congo&quot;, and Raoul Peck&#x27;s 1992 documentary and 2000 feature film, &quot;Lumumba, la mort d&#x27;un prophète&quot; and &quot;Lumumba&quot;, respectively.

There is an Italian 1968 feature film &#x27;Seduto alla sua destra&#x27; (lit. &#x27;Sitting to his right&#x27;) by Valerio Zurlini, where the last days of the character Maurice Lalubi (played by Woody Strode), based upon Patrice Lumumba, are presented as the Passion of Christ. This movie was included in the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, which was cancelled due to the events of May 68 in France.

Numerous songs and plays have been dedicated to Lumumba. Many praise his character, contrasting it with the alleged irresponsible and undisciplined nature of the Congolese people.

Congolese musicians Franco Luambo and Joseph Kabasele both wrote songs in tribute to Lumumba shortly after his death. Other musical works mentioning him include &quot;Lumumba&quot; by Miriam Makeba, &quot;Done Too Soon&quot; by Neil Diamond and &quot;Waltz for Lumumba&quot; by the Spencer Davis Group. His name is also mentioned in rap music; Arrested Development, Nas, David Banner, Black Thought, Damso, Baloji, Médine, Sammus and many others have mentioned him in their work.

In popular painting he is often paired with notions of sacrifice and redemption, even being portrayed as a messiah, with his downfall being his passion. Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu painted a series chronicling Lumumba&#x27;s life and career. Lumumba is relatively absent from Congolese writing, and he is often portrayed with only subtle or ambiguous references. Congolese authors Sony Lab&#x27;ou Tansi&#x27;s and Sylvain Bemba&#x27;s fictional &quot;Parentheses of Blood&quot; and &quot;Léopolis&quot;, respectively, both feature characters with strong similarities to Lumumba. In written tributes to Mobutu, Lumumba is usually portrayed as an adviser to the former. Writer Charles Djungu-Simba observed, &quot;Lumumba is rather considered as a vestige of the past, albeit an illustrious past&quot;. His surname is often used to identify a long drink of hot or cold chocolate and rum.

<text>Gustav Theodore Holst (born Gustavus Theodore von Holst; 21 September 1874 – 25 May 1934) was an English composer, arranger and teacher. Best known for his orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot;, he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.

There were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst&#x27;s family, and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father&#x27;s reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.

Holst&#x27;s works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of &quot;The Planets&quot; in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was an important influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from &quot;The Planets&quot; and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
====Family background====

Holst was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, &quot;née&quot; Lediard. She was of mostly British descent, daughter of a respected Cirencester solicitor; the Holst side of the family was of mixed Swedish, Latvian and German ancestry, with at least one professional musician in each of the previous three generations.

One of Holst&#x27;s great-grandfathers, Matthias Holst, born in Riga, Latvia, was of German origin; he served as composer and harp-teacher to the Imperial Russian Court in St Petersburg. Matthias&#x27;s son Gustavus, who moved to England with his parents as a child in 1802, was a composer of salon-style music and a well-known harp teacher. He appropriated the aristocratic prefix &quot;von&quot; and added it to the family name in the hope of gaining enhanced prestige and attracting pupils. 

Holst&#x27;s father, Adolph von Holst, became organist and choirmaster at All Saints&#x27; Church, Cheltenham; he also taught, and gave piano recitals. His wife, Clara, a former pupil, was a talented singer and pianist. They had two sons; Gustav&#x27;s younger brother, Emil Gottfried, became known as Ernest Cossart, a successful actor in the West End, New York and Hollywood. Clara died in February 1882, and the family moved to another house in Cheltenham, where Adolph recruited his sister Nina to help raise the boys. Gustav recognised her devotion to the family and dedicated several of his early compositions to her. In 1885 Adolph married Mary Thorley Stone, another of his pupils. They had two sons, Matthias (known as &quot;Max&quot;) and Evelyn (&quot;Thorley&quot;). Mary von Holst was absorbed in theosophy and not greatly interested in domestic matters. All four of Adolph&#x27;s sons were subject to what one biographer calls &quot;benign neglect&quot;, and Gustav in particular was &quot;not overburdened with attention or understanding, with a weak sight and a weak chest, both neglected—he was &#x27;miserable and scared&#x27;.&quot;

====Childhood and youth====
Holst was taught to play the piano and the violin; he enjoyed the former but hated the latter. At the age of twelve he took up the trombone at his father&#x27;s suggestion, thinking that playing a brass instrument might improve his asthma. Holst was educated at Cheltenham Grammar School between 1886 and 1891. He started composing in or about 1886; inspired by Macaulay&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; he began, but soon abandoned, an ambitious setting of the work for chorus and orchestra. His early compositions included piano pieces, organ voluntaries, songs, anthems and a symphony (from 1892). His main influences at this stage were Mendelssohn, Chopin, Grieg and above all Sullivan.

Adolph tried to steer his son away from composition, hoping that he would have a career as a pianist. Holst was oversensitive and miserable. His eyes were weak, but no one realized that he needed to wear spectacles. Holst&#x27;s health played a decisive part in his musical future; he had never been strong, and in addition to his asthma and poor eyesight he suffered from neuritis, which made playing the piano difficult. He said that the affected arm was &quot;like a jelly overcharged with electricity&quot;.

After Holst left school in 1891, Adolph paid for him to spend four months in Oxford studying counterpoint with George Frederick Sims, organist of Merton College. On his return, Holst obtained his first professional appointment, aged seventeen, as organist and choirmaster at Wyck Rissington, Gloucestershire. The post brought with it the conductorship of the Bourton-on-the-Water Choral Society, which offered no extra remuneration but provided valuable experience that enabled him to hone his conducting skills. In November 1891 Holst gave what was perhaps his first public performance as a pianist; he and his father played the Brahms &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; at a concert in Cheltenham. The programme for the event gives his name as &quot;Gustav&quot; rather than &quot;Gustavus&quot;; he was called by the shorter version from his early years.

===Royal College of Music===
In 1892 Holst wrote the music for an operetta in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, &quot;Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury&quot;. The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year&#x27;s expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from frugality and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.

Holst&#x27;s professors at the RCM were Frederick Sharpe (piano), William Stephenson Hoyte (organ), George Case (trombone), Georges Jacobi (instrumentation) and the director of the college, Hubert Parry (history). After preliminary lessons with W. S. Rockstro and Frederick Bridge, Holst was granted his wish to study composition with Charles Villiers Stanford.

To support himself during his studies Holst played the trombone professionally, at seaside resorts in the summer and in London theatres in the winter. His daughter and biographer, Imogen Holst, records that from his fees as a player &quot;he was able to afford the necessities of life: board and lodging, manuscript paper, and tickets for standing room in the gallery at Covent Garden Opera House on Wagner evenings&quot;. He secured an occasional engagement in symphony concerts, playing in 1897 under the baton of Richard Strauss at the Queen&#x27;s Hall.

Like many musicians of his generation, Holst came under Wagner&#x27;s spell. He had recoiled from the music of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but encouraged by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, &quot;ill-assimilated wisps of &quot;Tristan&quot; inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures.&quot; Stanford admired some of Wagner&#x27;s works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst&#x27;s sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: &quot;It won&#x27;t do, me boy; it won&#x27;t do&quot;. Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as &quot;the one man who could get any one of us out of a technical mess&quot;, but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.

In 1895, shortly after celebrating his twenty-first birthday, Holst met Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend and had more influence on Holst&#x27;s music than anybody else. Stanford emphasised the need for his students to be self-critical, but Holst and Vaughan Williams became one another&#x27;s chief critics; each would play his latest composition to the other while still working on it. Vaughan Williams later observed, &quot;What one really learns from an Academy or College is not so much from one&#x27;s official teachers as from one&#x27;s fellow-students ... [we discussed] every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;. In 1949 he wrote of their relationship, &quot;Holst declared that his music was influenced by that of his friend: the converse is certainly true.&quot;

The year 1895 was also the bicentenary of Henry Purcell, which was marked by various performances including Stanford conducting &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre; the work profoundly impressed Holst, who over twenty years later confessed to a friend that his search for &quot;the (or a) musical idiom of the English language&quot; had been inspired &quot;unconsciously&quot; by &quot;hearing the recits in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido&quot;&quot;.

Another early influence was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams&#x27;s words, &quot;It was now that Holst discovered the feeling of unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a great teacher. A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Socialist League which met at Kelmscott House in Hammersmith.&quot; At Kelmscott House, Morris&#x27;s home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris&#x27;s but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, &quot;I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according to the amount of money which their parents happen to have&quot;. Holst said, &quot;&#x27;Aristocracy in art&#x27;—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd.&quot; He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst&#x27;s tiny income.

===Professional musician===

In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year&#x27;s scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to &quot;learn by doing&quot;. Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year &quot;The Times&quot; had praised his song &quot;Light Leaves Whisper&quot;, &quot;a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling&quot;.

Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that &quot;man cannot live by composition alone&quot;; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and &quot;répétiteur&quot; with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the &quot;White Viennese Band&quot;, conducted by Stanislas Wurm.

Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for &quot;the Worm&quot; or any other light orchestra &quot;a wicked and loathsome waste of time&quot;. Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was &quot;trashy&quot; but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: &quot;To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.&quot;

With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. On 24 April 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst&#x27;s symphony &quot;The Cotswolds&quot; (Op. 8), the slow movement of which is a lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that &quot;as they were always hard up the only thing to do was to spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany&quot;.

===Composer and teacher===

While in Germany, Holst reappraised his professional life, and in 1903 he decided to abandon orchestral playing to concentrate on composition. His earnings as a composer were too little to live on, and two years later he accepted the offer of a teaching post at James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, Dulwich, which he held until 1921. He also taught at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, where among other innovations he gave the British premieres of two Bach cantatas. The two teaching posts for which he is probably best known were director of music at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, Hammersmith, from 1905 until his death, and director of music at Morley College from 1907 to 1924.

Vaughan Williams wrote of the former establishment: &quot;Here he did away with the childish sentimentality which schoolgirls were supposed to appreciate and substituted Bach and Vittoria; a splendid background for immature minds.&quot; Several of Holst&#x27;s pupils at St Paul&#x27;s went on to distinguished careers, including the soprano Joan Cross and the oboist and cor anglais player Helen Gaskell.

Of Holst&#x27;s impact on Morley College, Vaughan Williams wrote: &quot;[A] bad tradition had to be broken down. The results were at first discouraging, but soon a new spirit appeared and the music of Morley College, together with its offshoot the &#x27;Whitsuntide festival&#x27; ... became a force to be reckoned with&quot;. Before Holst&#x27;s appointment, Morley College had not treated music very seriously (Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;bad tradition&quot;), and at first Holst&#x27;s exacting demands drove many students away. He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.

According to the composer Edmund Rubbra, who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was &quot;a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of &quot;Petrushka&quot; or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams&quot;. He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student&#x27;s difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. &quot;I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon ... He frequently took away [because of] his abhorrence of unessentials.&quot;
As a composer Holst was frequently inspired by literature. He set poetry by Thomas Hardy and Robert Bridges and, a particular influence, Walt Whitman, whose words he set in &quot;Dirge for Two Veterans&quot; and &quot;The Mystic Trumpeter&quot; (1904). He wrote an orchestral &quot;Walt Whitman Overture&quot; in 1899. While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had read some of Max Müller&#x27;s books, which inspired in him a keen interest in Sanskrit texts, particularly the Rig Veda hymns. He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing, and decided to make his own translations, despite his lack of skills as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at University College, London, to study the language.

Imogen commented on his translations: &quot;He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem naïve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be &#x27;clear and dignified&#x27; and that would &#x27;lead the listener into another world&#x27;&quot;. His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included &quot;Sita&quot; (1899–1906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher Tito Ricordi); but which was not performed until October 2024 in Saarbrücken. &quot;Savitri&quot; (1908), a chamber opera based on a tale from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;; four groups of &quot;Hymns from the Rig Veda&quot; (1908–14); and two texts originally by Kālidāsa: &quot;Two Eastern Pictures&quot; (1909–10) and &quot;The Cloud Messenger&quot; (a setting of the &quot;Meghadūta&quot;, 1910, premiered in 1913).

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, British musical circles had experienced a new interest in national folk music. Some composers, such as Sullivan and Elgar, remained indifferent, but Parry, Stanford, Stainer and Alexander Mackenzie were founding members of the Folk-Song Society. Parry considered that by recovering English folk song, English composers would find an authentic national voice; he commented, &quot;in true folk-songs there is no sham, no got-up glitter, and no vulgarity&quot;. Vaughan Williams was an early and enthusiastic convert to this cause, going round the English countryside collecting and noting down folk songs. These had an influence on Holst. Though not as passionate on the subject as his friend, he incorporated a number of folk melodies in his own compositions and made several arrangements of folk songs collected by others. The &quot;Somerset Rhapsody&quot; (1906–07), was written at the suggestion of the folk-song collector Cecil Sharp and made use of tunes that Sharp had noted down. Holst described its performance at the Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1910 as &quot;my first real success&quot;. A few years later Holst became excited by another musical renaissance—the rediscovery of English madrigal composers. Weelkes was his favourite of all the Tudor composers, but Byrd also meant much to him.
Holst was a keen rambler. He walked extensively in England, Italy, France and Algeria. In 1908 he travelled to Algeria on medical advice as a treatment for asthma and the depression that he suffered after his opera &quot;Sita&quot; failed to win the Ricordi prize. This trip inspired the suite &quot;Beni Mora&quot;, which incorporated music he heard in the Algerian streets. Vaughan Williams wrote of this exotic work, &quot;if it had been played in Paris rather than London it would have given its composer a European reputation, and played in Italy would probably have caused a riot.&quot;

===1910s===
In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot;. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell&#x27;s death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. &quot;The Times&quot; praised Holst and his forces for &quot;a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work&quot;.

After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work &quot;The Cloud Messenger&quot;. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite &quot;The Planets&quot;. Holst cast his friends&#x27; horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his &quot;pet vice&quot;.

In 1913, St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot; for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.
At Thaxted, Holst became friendly with the Rev Conrad Noel, known as the &quot;Red Vicar&quot;, who supported the Independent Labour Party and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church. He started an annual music festival at Whitsuntide in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School performed together with local participants.

Holst&#x27;s &quot;a cappella&quot; carol, &quot;This Have I Done for My True Love&quot;, was dedicated to Noel in recognition of his interest in the ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as &quot;The Dancing Day&quot;). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, who would become a staunch supporter of Russia&#x27;s October Revolution, demanded in a Saturday message during the service that there should be a greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst&#x27;s pupils (implicitly those from St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School) were merely &quot;camp followers&quot; caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.

===First World War===
At the outbreak of the First World War, Holst tried to enlist but was rejected as unfit for military service. He felt frustrated that he could not contribute to the war effort. His wife became a volunteer ambulance driver; Vaughan Williams went on active service to France as did Holst&#x27;s brother Emil; Holst&#x27;s friends the composers George Butterworth and Cecil Coles were killed in battle. He continued to teach and compose; he worked on &quot;The Planets&quot; and prepared his chamber opera &quot;Savitri&quot; for performance. It was first given in December 1916 by students of the London School of Opera at the Wellington Hall in St John&#x27;s Wood. It attracted no attention at the time from the main newspapers, though when professionally staged five years later it was greeted as &quot;a perfect little masterpiece.&quot; In 1917 he wrote &quot;The Hymn of Jesus&quot; for chorus and orchestra, a work which remained unperformed until after the war.

In 1918, as the war neared its end, Holst finally had the prospect of a job that offered him the chance to serve. The music section of the YMCA&#x27;s education department needed volunteers to work with British troops stationed in Europe awaiting demobilisation. Morley College and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School offered him a year&#x27;s leave of absence, but there remained one obstacle: the YMCA felt that his surname looked too German to be acceptable in such a role. He formally changed &quot;von Holst&quot; to &quot;Holst&quot; by deed poll in September 1918. He was appointed as the YMCA&#x27;s musical organiser for the Near East, based in Salonica.
Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, &quot;Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: &#x27;Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, full of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we&#x27;re going to do &quot;The Planets&quot;, and you&#x27;ve got to conduct&#x27;.&quot; There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul&#x27;s helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul&#x27;s girls learned the choral part in the last movement.

The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced &quot;The Planets&quot; to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.

Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: &quot;it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use&quot;. He returned to England in June 1919.

===Post-war===
On his return from Greece, Holst resumed his teaching and composing. In addition to his existing work he accepted a lectureship in composition at the University of Reading and joined Vaughan Williams in teaching composition at their &quot;alma mater&quot; the RCM. Inspired by Adrian Boult&#x27;s conducting classes at the RCM, Holst tried to further pioneer music education for women by proposing to the High Mistress of St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School that he should invite Boult to give classes at the school: &quot;It would be glorious if the SPGS turned out the only women conductors in the world!&quot; In his soundproof room at SPGS he composed the &quot;Ode to Death&quot;, a setting of a poem by Whitman, which according to Vaughan Williams is considered by many to be Holst&#x27;s most beautiful choral work.
Holst, in his forties, suddenly found himself in demand. The New York Philharmonic and Chicago Symphony Orchestra vied to be the first to play &quot;The Planets&quot; in the US. The success of that work was followed in 1920 by an enthusiastic reception for &quot;The Hymn of Jesus&quot;, described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;one of the most brilliant and one of the most sincere pieces of choral and orchestral expression heard for some years.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;undoubtedly the most strikingly original choral work which has been produced in this country for many years.&quot;

To his surprise and dismay Holst was becoming famous. Celebrity was something wholly foreign to his nature. As the music scholar Byron Adams puts it, &quot;he struggled for the rest of his life to extricate himself from the web of garish publicity, public incomprehension and professional envy woven about him by this unsought-for success.&quot; He turned down honours and awards proffered to him, and refused to grant interviews or sign autographs.

Holst&#x27;s comic opera &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot; (1923) was widely seen as a satire of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, though Holst firmly denied it. The piece, with Maggie Teyte in the leading soprano role and Eugene Goossens conducting, was enthusiastically received at its premiere in the Royal Opera House. At a concert in Reading in 1923, Holst slipped and fell, suffering concussion. He seemed to make a good recovery, and he felt up to accepting an invitation to the US, lecturing and conducting at the University of Michigan. After he returned he found himself more and more in demand, to conduct, prepare his earlier works for publication, and, as before, to teach. The strain caused by these demands on him was too great; on doctor&#x27;s orders he cancelled all professional engagements during 1924, and retreated to Thaxted. In 1925 he resumed his work at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, but did not return to any of his other posts.

===Later years===
Holst&#x27;s productivity as a composer benefited almost at once from his release from other work. His works from this period include the &quot;Choral Symphony&quot; to words by Keats (a &quot;Second Choral Symphony&quot; to words by George Meredith exists only in fragments). A short Shakespearian opera, &quot;At the Boar&#x27;s Head&quot;, followed; neither had the immediate popular appeal of &quot;A Moorside Suite&quot; for brass band of 1928.

In 1927 Holst was commissioned by the New York Symphony Orchestra to write a symphony. Instead, he wrote an orchestral piece &quot;Egdon Heath&quot;, inspired by Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex. It was first performed in February 1928, a month after Hardy&#x27;s death, at a memorial concert. By this time the public&#x27;s brief enthusiasm for everything Holstian was waning, and the piece was not well received in New York. Olin Downes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that &quot;the new score seemed long and undistinguished&quot;. The day after the American performance, Holst conducted the City of Birmingham Orchestra in the British premiere. &quot;The Times&quot; acknowledged the bleakness of the work but allowed that it matched Hardy&#x27;s grim view of the world: &quot;&quot;Egdon Heath&quot; is not likely to be popular, but it says what the composer wants to say, whether we like it or not, and truth is one aspect of duty.&quot; Holst had been distressed by hostile reviews of some of his earlier works, but he was indifferent to critical opinion of &quot;Egdon Heath&quot;, which he regarded as, in Adams&#x27;s phrase, his &quot;most perfectly realized composition&quot;.

Towards the end of his life Holst wrote the &quot;Choral Fantasia&quot; (1930) and he was commissioned by the BBC to write a piece for military band; the resulting prelude and scherzo &quot;Hammersmith&quot; was a tribute to the place where he had spent most of his life. The composer and critic Colin Matthews considers the work &quot;as uncompromising in its way as &quot;Egdon Heath&quot;, discovering, in the words of Imogen Holst, &#x27;in the middle of an over-crowded London ... the same tranquillity that he had found in the solitude of Egdon Heath&#x27;&quot;. The work was unlucky in being premiered at a concert that also featured the London premiere of Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, by which it was somewhat overshadowed.

Holst wrote a score for a British film, &quot;The Bells&quot; (1931), and was amused to be recruited as an extra in a crowd scene. Both film and score are now lost. He wrote a &quot;jazz band piece&quot; that Imogen later arranged for orchestra as &quot;Capriccio&quot;. Having composed operas throughout his life with varying success, Holst found for his last opera, &quot;The Wandering Scholar&quot;, what Matthews calls &quot;the right medium for his oblique sense of humour, writing with economy and directness&quot;.

Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for the first six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a duodenal ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the &quot;Brook Green Suite&quot;, in March 1934.

Holst died in London on 25 May 1934, at the age of 59, of heart failure following an operation on his ulcer. His ashes were interred at Chichester Cathedral in Sussex, close to the memorial to Thomas Weelkes, his favourite Tudor composer. Bishop George Bell gave the memorial oration at the funeral, and Vaughan Williams conducted music by Holst and himself.

==Music==
===Style===
Holst&#x27;s absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with &quot;The Planets&quot;, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst&#x27;s characteristic &quot;sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass&quot;, while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.

Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; &quot;He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose&quot;. Kennedy has surmised that Holst&#x27;s economy of style was in part a product of the composer&#x27;s poor health: &quot;the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far&quot;. However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance &quot;a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible&quot;.

===Early works===
Although Holst wrote a large number of works—particularly songs—during his student days and early adulthood, almost everything he wrote before 1904 he later classified as derivative &quot;early horrors&quot;. Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an &quot;instinctive orchestral flair&quot;. Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst. Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the &quot;Elegy&quot; movement in &quot;The Cotswold Symphony&quot; (1899–1900) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works, and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father&#x27;s real self in the 1899 &quot;Suite de ballet&quot; and the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; of 1900. She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine voice in his setting of Whitman&#x27;s verses, &quot;The Mystic Trumpeter&quot; (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in &quot;The Planets&quot; are briefly anticipated. In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality—the use of two keys simultaneously.

===Experimental years===
At the beginning of the 20th century, according to Matthews, it appeared that Holst might follow Schoenberg into late Romanticism. Instead, as Holst recognised afterwards, his encounter with Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; prompted his searching for a &quot;musical idiom of the English language&quot;; the folksong revival became a further catalyst for Holst to seek inspiration from other sources during the first decade or so of the new century.

====Indian period====
Holst&#x27;s interest in Indian mythology, shared by many of his contemporaries, first became musically evident in the opera &quot;Sita&quot; (1901–06). During the opera&#x27;s long gestation, Holst worked on other Indian-themed pieces. These included &quot;Maya&quot; (1901) for violin and piano, regarded by the composer and writer Raymond Head as &quot;an insipid salon-piece whose musical language is dangerously close to Stephen Adams&quot;. Then, through Vaughan Williams, Holst discovered and became an admirer of the music of Ravel, whom he considered a &quot;model of purity&quot; on the level with Haydn, another composer he greatly admired.

The combined influence of Ravel, Hindu spiritualism and English folk tunes enabled Holst to get beyond the once all-consuming influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss and to forge his own style. Imogen Holst has acknowledged Holst&#x27;s own suggestion (written to Vaughan Williams): &quot;[O]ne ought to follow Wagner until he leads you to fresh things&quot;. She notes that although much of his grand opera, &quot;Sita&quot;, is &quot;&#x27;good old Wagnerian bawling&#x27; ... towards the end a change comes over the music, and the beautifully calm phrases of the hidden chorus representing the Voice of the Earth are in Holst&#x27;s own language.&quot;

According to Rubbra, the publication in 1911 of Holst&#x27;s Rig Veda Hymns was a landmark event in the composer&#x27;s development: &quot;Before this, Holst&#x27;s music had, indeed, shown the clarity of utterance which has always been his characteristic, but harmonically there was little to single him out as an important figure in modern music.&quot; Dickinson describes these vedic settings as pictorial rather than religious; although the quality is variable the sacred texts clearly &quot;touched vital springs in the composer&#x27;s imagination&quot;. While the music of Holst&#x27;s Indian verse settings remained generally western in character, in some of the vedic settings he experimented with Indian &quot;raga&quot; (scales).

The chamber opera &quot;Savitri&quot; (1908) is written for three solo voices, a small hidden female chorus, and an instrumental combination of two flutes, a cor anglais and a double string quartet. The music critic John Warrack comments on the &quot;extraordinary expressive subtlety&quot; with which Holst deploys the sparse forces: &quot;... [T]he two unaccompanied vocal lines opening the work skilfully convey the relationship between Death, steadily advancing through the forest, and Savitri, her frightened answers fluttering round him, unable to escape his harmonic pull.&quot; Head describes the work as unique in its time for its compact intimacy, and considers it Holst&#x27;s most successful attempt to end the domination of Wagnerian chromaticism in his music. Dickinson considers it a significant step, &quot;not towards opera, but towards an idiomatic pursuit of [Holst&#x27;s] vision&quot;. Of the Kālidāsa texts, Dickinson dismisses &quot;The Cloud Messenger&quot; (1910–12) as an &quot;accumulation of desultory incidents, opportunistic dramatic episodes and ecstatic outpourings&quot; which illustrate the composer&#x27;s creative confusion during that period; the &quot;Two Eastern Pictures&quot; (1911), in Dickinson&#x27;s view, provide &quot;a more memorable final impression of Kālidāsa&quot;.

====Folksong and other influences====
Holst&#x27;s settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite &quot;A Somerset Rhapsody&quot; (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work&#x27;s kinship with Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Norfolk Rhapsody&quot;, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst&#x27;s composition &quot;rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection&quot;. Imogen acknowledges that Holst&#x27;s discovery of English folksongs &quot;transformed his orchestral writing&quot;, and that the composition of &quot;A Somerset Rhapsody&quot; did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the &quot;Two Songs without Words&quot; of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy &quot;Songs of the West&quot;, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow.

In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the &quot;Beni Mora&quot; suite of 1908 the composer&#x27;s most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as &quot;the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire&quot;. Also in 1911 he wrote &quot;Hecuba&#x27;s Lament&quot;, a setting of Gilbert Murray&#x27;s translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba&#x27;s defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with plainsong; the same year saw the enduringly popular &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot; (a &quot;gay but retrogressive&quot; piece according to Dickinson), and the failure of his large scale orchestral work &quot;Phantastes&quot;.

===Full flowering===
====&quot;The Planets&quot;====
Holst conceived the idea of &quot;The Planets&quot; in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology, and also from his determination, despite the failure of &quot;Phantastes&quot;, to produce a large-scale orchestral work. The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Fünf Orchesterstücke&quot;, and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; or &quot;La mer&quot;. Holst began composing &quot;The Planets&quot; in 1914; the movements appeared not quite in their final sequence; &quot;Mars&quot; was the first to be written, followed by &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot;. &quot;Saturn&quot;, &quot;Uranus&quot; and &quot;Neptune&quot; were all composed during 1915, and &quot;Mercury&quot; was completed in 1916.

Each planet is represented with a distinct character; Dickinson observes that &quot;no planet borrows colour from another&quot;. In &quot;Mars&quot;, a persistent, uneven rhythmic cell consisting of five beats, combined with trumpet calls and harmonic dissonance provides battle music which Short asserts is unique in its expression of violence and sheer terror, &quot;... Holst&#x27;s intention being to portray the reality of warfare rather than to glorify deeds of heroism&quot;. In &quot;Venus&quot;, Holst incorporated music from an abandoned vocal work, &quot;A Vigil of Pentecost&quot;, to provide the opening; the prevalent mood within the movement is of peaceful resignation and nostalgia. &quot;Mercury&quot; is dominated by uneven metres and rapid changes of theme, to represent the speedy flight of the winged messenger. &quot;Jupiter&quot; is renowned for its central melody, &quot;Thaxted&quot;, in Dickinson&#x27;s view &quot;a fantastic relaxation in which many retain a far from sneaking delight&quot;. Dickinson and other critics have decried the later use of the tune in the patriotic hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;—despite Holst&#x27;s full complicity.

For &quot;Saturn&quot;, Holst again used a previously composed vocal piece, &quot;Dirge and Hymeneal&quot;, as the basis for the movement, where repeated chords represent the relentless approach of old age. &quot;Uranus&quot;, which follows, has elements of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and Dukas&#x27;s &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, in its depiction of the magician who &quot;disappears in a whiff of smoke as the sonic impetus of the movement diminishes from fff to ppp in the space of a few bars&quot;. &quot;Neptune&quot;, the final movement, concludes with a wordless female chorus gradually receding, an effect which Warrack likens to &quot;unresolved timelessness ... never ending, since space does not end, but drifting away into eternal silence&quot;. Apart from his concession with &quot;I Vow to Thee...&quot;&#x27;, Holst insisted on the unity of the whole work, and opposed the performance of individual movements. Nevertheless, Imogen wrote that the piece had &quot;suffered from being quoted in snippets as background music&quot;.

====Maturity====

During and after the composition of &quot;The Planets&quot;, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the &quot;Six Choral Folksongs&quot; of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which &quot;Swansea Town&quot;, with its &quot;sophisticated tone&quot;, is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as &quot;a limited form of art&quot; in which &quot;mannerisms are almost inevitable&quot;; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst&#x27;s set at least equal to Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Five English Folk Songs&quot; of 1913.

Holst&#x27;s first major work after &quot;The Planets&quot; was &quot;The Hymn of Jesus&quot;, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the &quot;Hymn&quot;: &quot;At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s&quot;. Matthews has written that the &quot;Hymn&quot;″s &quot;ecstatic&quot; quality is matched in English music &quot;perhaps only by Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Vision of Saint Augustine&quot;&quot;; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and &quot;explosive chordal dislocations&quot;.

In the &quot;Ode to Death&quot; (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an &quot;abrupt volte-face&quot; after the life-enhancing spirituality of the &quot;Hymn&quot;. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the &quot;Ode&quot; expressed Holst&#x27;s private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst&#x27;s finest work to that date.

The influential critic Ernest Newman considered &quot;The Perfect Fool&quot; &quot;the best of modern British operas&quot;, but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a brilliant puzzle&quot;—put it outside the operatic mainstream. Only the ballet music from the opera, which &quot;The Times&quot; called &quot;the most brilliant thing in a work glittering with brilliant moments&quot;, has been regularly performed since 1923. Holst&#x27;s libretto attracted much criticism, although Edwin Evans remarked on the rare treat in opera of being able to hear the words being sung.

===Later works===

Before his enforced rest in 1924, Holst demonstrated a new interest in counterpoint, in his &quot;Fugal Overture&quot; of 1922 for full orchestra and the neo-classical&quot; Fugal Concerto&quot; of 1923, for flute, oboe and strings. In his final decade he mixed song settings and minor pieces with major works and occasional new departures; the 1925 &quot;Terzetto&quot; for flute, viola and oboe, each instrument playing in a different key, is cited by Imogen as Holst&#x27;s only successful chamber work. Of the &quot;Choral Symphony&quot; completed in 1924, Matthews writes that, after several movements of real quality, the finale is a rambling anticlimax. Holst&#x27;s penultimate opera, &quot;At the Boar&#x27;s Head&quot; (1924), is based on tavern scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Parts 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. The music, which is largely derived from old English melodies gleaned from Cecil Sharp and other collections, has pace and verve; the contemporary critic Harvey Grace discounted the lack of originality, a facet which he said &quot;can be shown no less convincingly by a composer&#x27;s handling of material than by its invention&quot;.

&quot;Egdon Heath&quot; (1927) was Holst&#x27;s first major orchestral work after &quot;The Planets&quot;. Matthews summarises the music as &quot;elusive and unpredictable [with] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody [for strings], a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe.&quot; The mysterious dance towards the end is, says Matthews, &quot;the strangest moment in a strange work&quot;. Richard Greene in &quot;Music &amp; Letters&quot; describes the piece as &quot;a larghetto dance in a siciliano rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody&quot;, but lacking the power of &quot;The Planets&quot; and, at times, monotonous to the listener. A more popular success was &quot;A Moorside Suite&quot; for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst&#x27;s unmistakable imprint, &quot;from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of &quot;Saturn&quot;&quot;. &#x27;A Moorside Suite&#x27; has undergone major revisionism in the article &#x27;Symphony Within: rehearing Holst&#x27;s &#x27;A Moorside Suite&#x27; by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of &#x27;The Musical Times&#x27;. As with &#x27;Egdon Heath&#x27; – commissioned as a symphony – the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.

After this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with &quot;The Wandering Scholar&quot; (1929–30), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as &quot;Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind&quot;; Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: &quot;Do you think there&#x27;s a &quot;little&quot; bit too much in the opera?&quot; Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.

Holst composed few large-scale works in his final years. &quot;A Choral Fantasia&quot; of 1930 was written for the Three Choirs Festival at Gloucester; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, &quot;knows something of the &#x27;colossal and mysterious&#x27; loneliness of &quot;Egdon Heath&quot;&quot;. Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst&#x27;s remaining works were for small forces; the eight &quot;Canons&quot; of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen&#x27;s view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The &quot;Brook Green Suite&quot; (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul&#x27;s School, was a late companion piece to the &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot;. The &quot;Lyric Movement&quot; for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for Lionel Tertis. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists. Robin Hull, in &quot;Penguin Music Magazine&quot;, praised the work&#x27;s &quot;clear beauty—impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer&quot;; in Dickinson&#x27;s view, however, it remains &quot;a frail creation&quot;. Holst&#x27;s final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst&#x27;s earlier music—&quot;a summing up of Holst&#x27;s orchestral art&quot;, according to Short. Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.

==Recordings==
Holst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the Columbia company he recorded &quot;Beni Mora&quot;, the &quot;Marching Song&quot; and the complete &quot;Planets&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1922, using the acoustic process. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women&#x27;s voices at the end of &quot;Neptune&quot;, and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound. With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot; and &quot;Country Song&quot; in 1925. Columbia&#x27;s main rival, HMV, issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by Albert Coates. When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded &quot;The Planets&quot; for Columbia in 1926.

In the early LP era little of Holst&#x27;s music was available on disc. Only six of his works are listed in the 1955 issue of &quot;The Record Guide&quot;: &quot;The Planets&quot; (recordings under Boult on HMV and Nixa, and another under Sir Malcolm Sargent on Decca); the &quot;Perfect Fool&quot; ballet music; the &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Suite&quot;; and three short choral pieces. In the stereo LP and CD eras numerous recordings of &quot;The Planets&quot; were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; contained seven pages of listings of Holst&#x27;s works on CD. Of the operas, &quot;Savitri&quot;, &quot;The Wandering Scholar&quot;, and &quot;At the Boar&#x27;s Head&quot; have been recorded.

==Legacy==

Warrack emphasises that Holst acquired an instinctive understanding—perhaps more so than any English composer—of the importance of folksong. In it he found &quot;a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language&quot;. Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he influenced both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as &quot;the greatest influence on my music&quot;, although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst&#x27;s &quot;most significant artistic successor&quot;, both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst&#x27;s music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: &quot;Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision&quot;. Kennedy observes that &quot;a new generation of listeners ... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett&quot;. Holst&#x27;s pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst&#x27;s economy of style: &quot;With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone&quot;.

Short cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and Benjamin Britten, and suggests that Holst&#x27;s influence may have been felt further afield. Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer&#x27;s duty to provide music for practical purposes—festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, &quot;many people who may never have heard any of [Holst&#x27;s] major works ... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol &#x27;In the Bleak Midwinter&#x27;&quot;.

On 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death. It is inscribed with words from the text of &quot;The Hymn of Jesus&quot;: &quot;The heavenly spheres make music for us&quot;. In April 2011 a BBC television documentary, &quot;Holst: In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;, charted Holst&#x27;s life with particular reference to his support for socialism and the cause of working people. Holst&#x27;s birthplace, 4 Pittville Terrace (later known as 4 Clarence Road) in Pittville, Cheltenham, is now a museum, the Holst Victorian House, and is open to visitors.

<text>Irina Anatolyevna Privalova (; born 22 November 1968) is a Russian Olympic gold medallist athlete.
Her Summer Olympics debut was in 1992 in the sprint events, where she won two medals— a bronze in the 100 m and running the anchor leg in the 4x100 team, a silver — and came fourth in the 200, representing the Unified Team. With three European individual championships and three individual world medals, Irina Privalova had been a formidable competitor during most of the 1990s (see Sprints) but had not yet won an outdoor international event gold medal (as an individual athlete, she had won relay gold in 1993).

In 2000, she switched to the 400 m hurdles discipline winning the gold medal in 53.02 s (see 400 m Hurdles) and a bronze in the 4 x 400 m relay team for Russia.

Irina Privalova is currently the world indoor record holder in the 50 m (5.96 s) and 60 m (6.92 s) sprints (See World Indoor Records). She has also been the world indoor champion at the 60 m (7.02 s in 1991), 200 m (22.15 s in 1993), and 400 m (50.23 s in 1995) events – the first athlete to win titles, indoors or outdoors, at three different distances.

Privalova achieved her best time (10.77 s) in the 100 m in 1994 – the fastest time for nine years.

In 2008, aged 39, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m at Russian championships in attempting to qualify for her fourth Olympics. She had tried moving to the 800 m to qualify for the 2004 Olympics.

In 2020, Privalova stood for the presidency of the Russian Athletics Federation. She failed to win but became vice-president. She later was called to stand-in as acting president when the elected president moved to a government agency (See Russian Athletic Federation Presidency).

== Sprints ==
Privalova came to international recognition in 1991 at the World Indoor Championships that year. Racing as Irina Privalova-Sergeyeva, in the 60 m she defeated the great Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey who reached the final undefeated in 82 successive races.
Ottey had her revenge in the 200 m with Privalova coming second, Ottey equalling the world record in her victory.

At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, racing as Irina Privalova, she won a bronze medal in the 100 m. The race was incredibly tight – Gail Devers won in 10.82 s, Juliet Cuthbert was second in 10.83 s, and Privalova third in 10.84 s. Privalova also came fourth in the 200 m.

At the 1993 World Indoor Championships, Privalova narrowly lost to Gail Devers in the 60 m, 6.95 s to 6.97 s, but won the 200 m title (in 22.15 s, then the second fastest time ever; she want faster in 1995 at 22.10 s, second fastest time ever to the world record of 21.87 s).

In the 1993 World Athletics Championships, Privalova won her only gold medal at a world championship in the 4 × 100 m relay. She narrowly held off the United States&#x27;s Gail Devers on the anchor leg – both teams recording a championship record time of 41.49 s.

In 1994, in August at the European Championships, for Russia she won gold in the 100 and 200 m and silver in the 4 × 100 m relay; in September, at the 1994 IAAF World Cup, representing Europe, she won the 100 m and 400 m, and came third in the 200m.

In 1995, Privalova moved up to the 400 m for the World Indoor Championships that year where she won in her first major race over the distance – she had not even contested the Russian championships at that distance.

Her campaign at the 1996 Olympics was curtailed by injury. She was eliminated at the semi-final stage in the 100 m, did not start the 200 m, but was part of the Russian team that came fourth in the 4 × 100 m relay.

In 1997, Privalova suffered a torn muscle in the final of 60 m at the World Indoor Championships. She was out for 18 months but returned to win the 200 m at the European Championships in 1998. In the individual events she camoe fourth in the 100 m and won bronze in the 200 m.

In 1998, at the European Championships, Privalova found a time of 10.83 s was only good enough for silver in 100 m, being defeated by Christine Arron&#x27;s European record winning time of 10.73 s. However, she successfully defended her European title in the 200 m and also won Silver in the 4 × 100 m relay.

In 1999, her World Championships ended prematurely when she had to withdraw from all her events after completing the first round of the 100 m. She did not compete again until the 2000 indoor season.

== 400 m Hurdles ==

In 2000, Privalova switched to the 400 m hurdles as her main event targeting the 2000 Olympics. This followed a year out of the sport with injury, forcing her to miss the 1999 World Championships.

She worked on the switch with her coach and husband, Vladimir Paraschuk. Paraschuk chose the 400 m hurdles because it was an event that reduced the risk of injury, was within Privalova&#x27;s capabilities as an existing 400 m runner, and it had at the time a comparative lack of formidable competitors. In addition, she had tried athletics multi-events so had had some experience with hurdling.

She achieved Olympic gold after running only 6 races previous to arriving at the games.

Injury and motherhood forced her retirement after 2000 and so she was never able to train to try the challenge of breaking the 400 m hurdles world record: in 2001, she suffered a knee ligament injury and then gave birth in December 2001 to her second child, forcing her to miss the 2002 season.

In 2004, she attempted a switch to 800 m to attempt to qualify for the Olympics that year but failed in her attempt. She had already stopped racing the 60 m (&#x27;her favourite event&#x27;) to avoid injuries and was using the 800 m as part of her training schedule.

== Russian Athletics Federation Presidency ==

In 2020, Privalova stood for the presidency of the Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF). She was chosen as first vice-president after coming third in the vote.

In February 2021, the winner Peter Ivanov relinquished his authority until December 2022 to take up a position with a government agency with Privalova taking charge.

== World Indoor Records ==

Privalova achieved world record times indoors on six occasions:
* 6.05 s for the 50 m sprint in Moscow on 2 February 1993.
* 6.04 s for the 50 m sprint in Grenoble on 7 February 1993.
* 6.03 s for the 50 m sprint in Moscow on 1 February 1994.
* 5.96 s for the 50 m sprint in Madrid on 9 February 1995.
* 6.92 s for the 60 m sprint in Madrid on 11 February 1993.
* 6.92 s for the 60 m sprint in Madrid on 9 February 1995.

She also two other times that would have been records but were not ratified due to faults with the timing:
* 6.00 s for the 50 m sprint in Moscow on 2 February 1993 – photo-finish device was not lined up correctly.
* 5.99 s for the 50 m sprint in Vienna on 6 February 1994 – time recorded during a 60 m race.

In addition, she shares the world&#x27;s best time for the unofficial distance (for record purposes) of 300 m. Her time of 35.45 s was achieved on 17 January 1993 in Moscow (it was equalled by Shaunae Miller-Uibo in 2018).

== Personal life ==

Privalova originally competed under her married name of Sergeyeva. Her first pregnancy forced her to miss the 1988 Olympics. After a separation and divorce, she competed under her maiden name of Privalova.

Privalova married her coach, Vladimir Paraschuk, and in 2000 they lived in Moscow with sons from previous marriages. Paraschuk was also, at that time, coach of track and field at Moscow State University from which Privalova has a degree in journalism (graduated in 1995). Under the tutelage of Paraschuk, Privalova trained alone, using the somewhat spartan facilities of the university, rather than attending a sports institute like most of her compatriots.

In 2008, she is described as the mother of three children: Alexei, aged 20; Maria, aged 6; and Katya, then 2 years old.

== Accolades and awards ==

In 1994, Privalova was awarded European Athlete of the Year trophy for women.

In 2001, she was awarded the Silver Order of Merit by the IAAF (World Athletics) for an &#x27;exceptional contribution to the world athletics movement&#x27;.

== World Rankings ==
Privalova was ranked among the best in the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events in the 1990s, then again later in the 400 m hurdles when she switched to that event in 2000. This is according to the votes of the experts of Track and Field News.

<text>The Planets, Op. 32, is a seven-movement orchestral suite by the English composer Gustav Holst, written between 1914 and 1917. In the last movement the orchestra is joined by a wordless female chorus. Each movement of the suite is named after a planet of the Solar System and its supposed astrological character.

The premiere of &quot;The Planets&quot; was at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, London, on 29 September 1918, conducted by Holst&#x27;s friend Adrian Boult before an invited audience of about 250 people. Three concerts at which movements from the suite were played were given in 1919 and early 1920. The first complete performance at a public concert was given at the Queen&#x27;s Hall on 15 November 1920 by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Albert Coates.

The innovative nature of Holst&#x27;s music caused some initial hostility among a minority of critics, but the suite quickly became and has remained popular, influential and widely performed. The composer conducted two recordings of the work, and it has been recorded at least 80 times subsequently by conductors, choirs and orchestras from the UK and internationally.

==Background and composition==
&quot;The Planets&quot; was composed over nearly three years, between 1914 and 1917. The work had its origins in March and April 1913, when Gustav Holst and his friend and benefactor Balfour Gardiner holidayed in Spain with the composer Arnold Bax and his brother, the author Clifford Bax. A discussion about astrology piqued Holst&#x27;s interest in the subject. Clifford Bax later commented that Holst became &quot;a remarkably skilled interpreter of horoscopes&quot;. Shortly after the holiday Holst wrote to a friend: &quot;I only study things that suggest music to me. That&#x27;s why I worried at Sanskrit. Then recently the character of each planet suggested lots to me, and I have been studying astrology fairly closely&quot;. He told Clifford Bax in 1926 that &quot;The Planets&quot;:
Imogen Holst, the composer&#x27;s daughter, wrote that her father had difficulty with large-scale orchestral structures such as symphonies, and the idea of a suite with a separate character for each movement was an inspiration to him. Holst&#x27;s biographer Michael Short and the musicologist Richard Greene both think it likely that another inspiration for the composer to write a suite for large orchestra was the example of Schoenberg&#x27;s Five Pieces for Orchestra. That suite had been performed in London in 1912 and again in 1914; Holst was at one of the performances, and he is known to have owned a copy of the score.

Holst described &quot;The Planets&quot; as &quot;a series of mood pictures&quot;, acting as &quot;foils to one another&quot;, with &quot;very little contrast in any one of them&quot;. Short writes that some of the characteristics the composer attributed to the planets may have been suggested by Alan Leo&#x27;s booklet &quot;What Is a Horoscope?&quot;, which he was reading at the time. Holst took the title of two movements – &quot;Mercury, the Winged Messenger&quot; and &quot;Neptune, the Mystic&quot; – from Leo&#x27;s books. But although astrology was Holst&#x27;s starting point, he arranged the planets to suit his own plan:

In an early sketch for the suite Holst listed Mercury as &quot;no. 1&quot;, which Greene suggests raises the possibility that the composer&#x27;s first idea was simply to depict the planets in the obvious order, from nearest the sun to the farthest. &quot;However, opening with the more disturbing character of Mars allows a more dramatic and compelling working out of the musical material&quot;.

Holst had a heavy workload as head of music at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, Hammersmith, and director of music at Morley College, and had limited time for composing. Imogen Holst wrote, &quot;Weekends and holidays were the only times when he could really get on with his own work, which is why it took him over two years to finish &quot;The Planets&quot;. She added that Holst&#x27;s chronic neuritis in his right arm was troubling him considerably and he would have found it impossible to complete the 198 pages of the large full score without the help of two colleagues at St Paul&#x27;s, Vally Lasker and Nora Day, whom he called his &quot;scribes&quot;.

The first movement to be written was Mars in mid-1914, followed by Venus and Jupiter in the latter part of the year, Saturn and Uranus in mid-1915, Neptune later in 1915 and Mercury in early 1916. Holst completed the orchestration during 1917.

==First performances==
The premiere of &quot;The Planets&quot;, conducted at Holst&#x27;s request by Adrian Boult, was held at short notice on 29 September 1918, during the last weeks of the First World War, in the Queen&#x27;s Hall with the financial support of Gardiner. It was hastily rehearsed; the musicians of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra first saw the complicated music only two hours before the performance, and the choir for Neptune was recruited from Holst&#x27;s students at Morley College and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. It was a comparatively intimate affair, attended by around 250 invited associates, but Holst regarded it as the public premiere, inscribing Boult&#x27;s copy of the score, &quot;This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused the Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.&quot;

At a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at the Queen&#x27;s Hall on 27 February 1919 conducted by Boult, five of the seven movements were played in the order Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter. It was Boult&#x27;s decision not to play all seven movements at this concert. Although Holst would have liked the suite to be played complete, Boult&#x27;s view was that when the public were being presented with a completely new language of this kind, &quot;half an hour of it was as much as they could take in&quot;. Imogen Holst recalled that her father &quot;hated incomplete performances of &quot;The Planets&quot;, though on several occasions he had to agree to conduct three or four movements at Queen&#x27;s Hall concerts. He particularly disliked having to finish with Jupiter, to make a &#x27;happy ending&#x27;, for, as he himself said, &#x27;in the real world the end is not happy at all&#x27;&quot;.

At a Queen&#x27;s Hall concert on 22 November 1919, Holst conducted Venus, Mercury and Jupiter. There was another incomplete public performance, in Birmingham, on 10 October 1920, with five movements (Mars, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter), conducted by the composer.
The first complete performance of the suite at a public concert was on 15 November 1920; the London Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Albert Coates. The first complete performance conducted by the composer was on 13 October 1923, with the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra.

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for a large orchestra. Holst&#x27;s fellow composer Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote in 1920, &quot;Holst uses a very large orchestra in the &quot;Planets&quot; not to make his score look impressive, but because he needs the extra tone colour and knows how to use it&quot;. The score calls for the following instrumentation. The movements vary in the combinations of instruments used.
*Woodwinds: four flutes (third doubling first piccolo and fourth doubling second piccolo and &quot;bass flute in G&quot;, actually an alto flute), three oboes (third doubling bass oboe), one cor anglais, three clarinets in B and A, one bass clarinet in B, three bassoons, one contrabassoon
*Brass: six horns in F, four trumpets in C, two trombones, one bass trombone, one tenor tuba in B (often played on a euphonium), one tuba
*Percussion: six timpani (two players); triangle, snare drum, tambourine, cymbals, bass drum, gong, tubular bells, glockenspiel, xylophone
*Keyboards: organ, celesta
*Strings: two harps, violins i, ii, violas, cellos, double basses (Low C appears in the score)

In Neptune, two three-part women&#x27;s choruses (each comprising two soprano sections and one alto section) located in an adjoining room which is to be screened from the audience are added.

==Structure==

===1. Mars, the Bringer of War===
Mars is marked allegro and is in a relentless ostinato for most of its duration. It opens quietly, the first two bars played by percussion, harp and &quot;col legno&quot; strings. The music builds to a quadruple-forte, dissonant climax. Although Mars is often thought to portray the horrors of mechanised warfare, it was completed before the First World War started. The composer Colin Matthews writes that for Holst, Mars would have been &quot;an experiment in rhythm and clashing keys&quot;, and its violence in performance &quot;may have surprised him as much as it galvanised its first audiences&quot;. Short comments, &quot;harmonic dissonances abound, often resulting from clashes between moving chords and static pedal-points&quot;, which he compares to a similar effect at the end of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot;, and adds that although battle music had been written before, notably by Richard Strauss in &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;, &quot;it had never expressed such violence and sheer terror&quot;.

===2. Venus, the Bringer of Peace===

The second movement begins adagio in . According to Imogen Holst, Venus &quot;has to try and bring the right answer to Mars&quot;. The movement opens with a solo horn theme answered quietly by the flutes and oboes. A second theme is given to solo violin. The music proceeds tranquilly with oscillating chords from flutes and harps, with decoration from the celesta. Between the opening adagio and the central largo there is a flowing andante section in with a violin melody (solo then tutti) accompanied by gentle syncopation in the woodwind. The oboe solo in the central largo is one of the last romantic melodies Holst allowed himself before turning to a more austere manner in later works. Leo called the planet &quot;the most fortunate star under which to be born&quot;; Short calls Holst&#x27;s Venus &quot;one of the most sublime evocations of peace in music&quot;.

===3. Mercury, the Winged Messenger===

Mercury is in and is marked vivace throughout. The composer R. O. Morris thought it the nearest of the movements to &quot;the domain of programme music pure and simple ... it is essentially pictorial in idea. Mercury is a mere activity whose character is not defined&quot;. This movement, the last of the seven to be written, contains Holst&#x27;s first experiments with bitonality. He juxtaposes melodic fragments in B major and E major, in a fast-moving scherzo. Solo violin, high-pitched harp, flute and glockenspiel are prominently featured. It is the shortest of the seven movements, typically taking between and 4 minutes in performance.

===4. Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity===

In this movement Holst portrays Jupiter&#x27;s supposedly characteristic &quot;abundance of life and vitality&quot; with music that is buoyant and exuberant. Nobility and generosity are allegedly characteristics of those born under Jupiter, and in the slower middle section Holst provides a broad tune embodying those traits. In the view of Imogen Holst, it has been compromised by its later use as the melody for a solemn patriotic hymn, &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;; the musicologist Lewis Foreman comments that the composer did not think of it in those terms, as shown by his own recordings of the movement. The opening section of the movement is marked allegro giocoso, in time. The second theme, at the same tempo, is in time, as is the broad melody of the middle section, marked andante maestoso, which Holst marks to be taken at half the speed of the opening section. The opening section returns and after a reappearance of the maestoso tune – its expected final cadence unresolved, as in its first appearance – the movement ends with a triple forte quaver chord for the full orchestra.

===5. Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age===

Saturn was Holst&#x27;s favourite movement of the suite. Matthews describes it as &quot;a slow processional which rises to a frightening climax before fading away as if into the outer reaches of space&quot;. The movement opens as a quiet adagio in and the basic pace remains slow throughout, with short bursts of animato in the first part and a switch to andante in in the later section. Apart from the timpani no percussion is used in this movement except for tubular bells at climactic points. At the beginning, flutes, bassoons and harps play a theme suggesting a ticking clock. A solemn melody is introduced by the trombones (Holst&#x27;s own main instrument) and taken up by the full orchestra. A development of the ticking theme leads to a clangorous triple forte climax, after which the music dies away and ends quietly.

===6. Uranus, the Magician===

Matthews describes the character of the movement as that of &quot;a clumsy dance, which gradually gets more and more out of hand (not unlike Dukas&#x27;s &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;) until, with what seems like a magic wand, all is abruptly swept away into the far distance&quot;. The movement, which begins with what Short calls &quot;a tremendous four-note brass motif&quot;, is marked allegro in . The music proceeds in &quot;a series of merry pranks&quot; with occasional interjections in , building to a quadruple forte climax with a prominent organ glissando, after which the music suddenly drops to a pianissimo lento before alternating quick and slow sections bring the movement to its pianissimo conclusion.

===7. Neptune, the Mystic===

The music of the last movement is quiet throughout, in a swaying, irregular metre, opening with flutes joined by piccolo and oboes, with harps and celesta prominent later. Holst makes much use of dissonance in this movement. Before the premiere his colleague Geoffrey Toye said that a bar where the brass play chords of E minor and G minor together was &quot;going to sound frightful&quot;. Holst agreed, and said it had made him shudder when he wrote it down but, &quot;What are you to do when they come like that?&quot; As the movement develops, the orchestra is joined by an offstage female chorus singing a soft wordless line: this was unusual in orchestral works at the time, although Debussy had used the same device in his &quot;Nocturnes&quot; (1900). The orchestra falls silent and the unaccompanied voices bring the work to a pianissimo conclusion in an uncertain tonality, as a door between the singers and the auditorium is gradually closed.

==Reception==

Imogen Holst wrote of the 1918 premiere under Boult:
When the music was first introduced to the general public in February 1919, critical opinion was divided. Greene prints a summary of reviews of the first four public performances of the suite (or movements from it) in February and November 1919 and October and November 1920. Positive reviews are recorded in 28 of the 37 papers, magazines and journals cited. A small minority of reviewers were particularly hostile, among them those of &quot;The Globe&quot; (&quot;Noisy and pretentious)&quot;; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (&quot;Pompous, noisy and unalluring&quot;), and &quot;The Times&quot; (&quot;a great disappointment … elaborately contrived and painful to hear&quot;). The critic in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; wrote that Holst evidently regarded the planets &quot;as objectionable nuisances that he would oust from our orbit if he could&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; rapidly changed its mind; in July 1919 it called Holst the most intriguing of his compeers and commented, &quot;&quot;The Planets&quot; still leaves us gasping&quot;; after hearing Holst conduct three of the movements in November 1919 the paper&#x27;s critic declared the piece &quot;the first music by an Englishman we have heard for some time which is neither conventional nor negligible&quot;, and by the time of Holst&#x27;s death in 1934 the paper&#x27;s assessment of the piece was &quot;Holst&#x27;s greatest work&quot;:
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, too, quickly changed its line. In 1920 its new music critic, Ernest Newman, said that Holst could do &quot;easily, without a fuss&quot; what some other composers could only do &quot;with an effort and a smirk&quot;, and that in &quot;The Planets&quot; he showed &quot;one of the subtlest and most original minds of our time. It begins working at a musical problem where most other minds would leave off&quot;. Newman compared Holst&#x27;s harmonic innovations to those of Stravinsky, to the latter&#x27;s disadvantage, and expressed none of the reservations that qualified his admiration of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot;.

==Recordings==

There have been at least 80 commercial recordings of &quot;The Planets&quot;. Holst conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first two recorded performances: the first was an acoustic recording made in sessions between September 1922 and November 1923; the second was made in 1926 using the new electrical recording process. Holst&#x27;s tempi are in general faster than those of most of his successors on record. This may have been due to the need to fit the music on 78 rpm discs, although later 78 versions are slower. Holst&#x27;s later recording is quicker than the acoustic version, possibly because the electrical process required wider grooves, reducing the available playing time. Other, slower, recordings from the 78 era include those conducted by Leopold Stokowski (1943) and Sir Adrian Boult (1945). Recordings from the LP age are also typically longer than the composer&#x27;s, but from the digital era a 2010 recording by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Jurowski is quicker than Holst&#x27;s acoustic version and comes close to matching his 1926 speeds, and in two movements (Venus and Uranus) surpasses them. There were no commercial recordings of the work in the 1930s; timings are given below of a recording representing each subsequent decade up to the 2020s:

==Additions, adaptations and influences==
There have been many adaptations of the suite, and several attempts to add an eighth planet – Pluto – in the time between its discovery in 1930 and its downgrading to &quot;dwarf planet&quot; in 2006. The most prominent of these was Matthews&#x27;s 2000 composition, &quot;Pluto, the Renewer&quot;, commissioned by the Hallé Orchestra. Dedicated posthumously to Imogen Holst, it was first performed in Manchester on 11 May 2000, with Kent Nagano conducting. Matthews changed the ending of Neptune slightly so that the movement would segue into Pluto. Matthews&#x27;s Pluto has been recorded, coupled with Holst&#x27;s suite, on at least four occasions. Others who have produced versions of Pluto for &quot;The Planets&quot; include Leonard Bernstein and Jun Nagao.

The suite has been adapted for numerous instruments and instrumental combinations, including organ, synthesiser, brass band, and jazz orchestra. Holst used the melody of the central section of &quot;Jupiter&quot; for a setting (&quot;Thaxted&quot;) of the hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; in 1921.

&quot;The Planets&quot; has been taken as an influence by various rock bands, and for film scores such as those for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. There have been numerous references to the suite in popular culture, from films to television and computer games.

<text>In computing, NaN (), standing for Not a Number, is a particular value of a numeric data type (often a floating-point number) which is undefined as a number, such as the result of 0/0. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities such as infinities.

In mathematics, the result of is typically not defined as a number and may therefore be represented by NaN in computing systems.

The square root of a negative number is not a real number, and is therefore also represented by NaN in compliant computing systems. NaNs may also be used to represent missing values in computations.

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed &quot;quiet NaNs&quot; and &quot;signaling NaNs&quot;. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values. Signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic.

== Floating point ==

In floating-point calculations, NaN is not the same as infinity, although both are typically handled as special cases in floating-point representations of real numbers as well as in floating-point operations. An invalid operation is also not the same as an arithmetic overflow (which would return an infinity or the largest finite number in magnitude) or an arithmetic underflow (which would return the smallest normal number in magnitude, a subnormal number, or zero).

In the IEEE 754 binary interchange formats, NaNs are encoded with the exponent field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the trailing significand field (to make them distinct from infinity values); this allows the definition of multiple distinct NaN values, depending on which bits are set in the trailing significand field, but also on the value of the leading sign bit (but applications are not required to provide distinct semantics for those distinct NaN values).

For example, an IEEE 754 single precision (32-bit) NaN would be encoded as

where &quot;s&quot; is the sign (most often ignored in applications) and the &quot;x&quot; sequence represents a non-zero number (the value zero encodes infinities). In practice, the most significant bit from &quot;x&quot; is used to determine the type of NaN: &quot;quiet NaN&quot; or &quot;signaling NaN&quot; (see details in Encoding). The remaining bits encode a &quot;payload&quot; (most often ignored in applications).

Floating-point operations other than ordered comparisons normally propagate a quiet NaN (&quot;qNaN&quot;). Most floating-point operations on a signaling NaN (&quot;sNaN&quot;) signal the invalid-operation exception; the default exception action is then the same as for qNaN operands and they produce a qNaN if producing a floating-point result.

The propagation of quiet NaNs through arithmetic operations allows errors to be detected at the end of a sequence of operations without extensive testing during intermediate stages. For example, if one starts with a NaN and adds 1 five times in a row, each addition results in a NaN, but there is no need to check each calculation because one can just note that the final result is NaN. However, depending on the language and the function, NaNs can silently be removed from a chain of calculations where one calculation in the chain would give a constant result for all other floating-point values. For example, the calculation &quot;x&quot;0 may produce the result 1, even where &quot;x&quot; is NaN, so checking only the final result would obscure the fact that a calculation before the &quot;x&quot;0 resulted in a NaN. In general, then, a later test for a set &quot;invalid&quot; flag is needed to detect all cases where NaNs are introduced (see Function definition below for further details).

In section 6.2 of the old IEEE 754-2008 standard, there are two anomalous functions (the and functions, which return the maximum and the minimum, respectively, of two operands that are expected to be numbers) that favor numbers — if just one of the operands is a NaN then the value of the other operand is returned. The IEEE 754-2019 revision has replaced these functions as they are not associative (when a signaling NaN appears in an operand).

=== Comparison with NaN ===
Comparisons are specified by the IEEE 754 standard to take into account possible NaN operands. When comparing two real numbers, or extended real numbers (as in the IEEE 754 floating-point formats), the first number may be either less than, equal to, or greater than the second number. This gives three possible relations. But when at least one operand of a comparison is NaN, this trichotomy does not apply, and a fourth relation is needed: &quot;unordered&quot;. In particular, two NaN values compare as unordered, not as equal.

As specified, the predicates associated with the &lt;, ≤, =, ≥, &gt; mathematical symbols (or equivalent notation in programming languages) return false on an unordered relation. So, for instance, is not logically equivalent to : on unordered, i.e. when &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; is NaN, the former returns true while the latter returns false. However, ≠ is defined as the negation of =, thus it returns true on unordered.

From these rules, comparing &quot;x&quot; with itself, or , can be used to test whether &quot;x&quot; is NaN or non-NaN.

The comparison predicates are either signaling or non-signaling on quiet NaN operands; the signaling versions signal the invalid-operation exception for such comparisons (i.e., by default, this just sets the corresponding status flag in addition to the behavior of the non-signaling versions). The equality and inequality predicates are non-signaling. The other standard comparison predicates associated with the above mathematical symbols are all signaling if they receive a NaN operand. The standard also provides non-signaling versions of these other predicates. The predicate codice_1 determines whether a value is a NaN and never signals an exception, even if &quot;x&quot; is a signaling NaN.

The IEEE floating-point standard requires that &quot;NaN ≠ NaN&quot; hold. In contrast, the 2022 private standard of posit arithmetic has a similar concept, NaR (Not a Real), where &quot;NaR = NaR&quot; holds.

=== Operations generating NaN ===
There are three kinds of operations that can return NaN:

* Most operations with at least one NaN operand.
* Indeterminate forms:
** The divisions and .
** The multiplications and .
** Remainder when is an infinity or is zero.
** The additions , and equivalent subtractions and .
** The standard has alternative functions for powers:
*** The standard function and the integer exponent function define , , and as .
*** The function defines all three indeterminate forms as invalid operations and so returns NaN.
* Real operations with complex results, for example:
** The square root of a negative number.
** The logarithm of a negative number.
** The inverse sine or inverse cosine of a number that is less than −1 or greater than 1.

NaNs may also be explicitly assigned to variables, typically as a representation for missing values. Prior to the IEEE standard, programmers often used a special value (such as −99999999) to represent undefined or missing values, but there was no guarantee that they would be handled consistently or correctly.

NaNs are not necessarily generated in all the above cases. If an operation can produce an exception condition and traps are not masked then the operation will cause a trap instead. If an operand is a quiet NaN, and there is also no signaling NaN operand, then there is no exception condition and the result is a quiet NaN. Explicit assignments will not cause an exception even for signaling NaNs.

=== Quiet NaN ===
In general, quiet NaNs, or qNaNs, do not raise any additional exceptions, as they propagate through most operations. But the invalid-operation exception is signaled by some operations that do not return a floating-point value, such as format conversions or certain comparison operations.

=== Signaling NaN ===
Signaling NaNs, or sNaNs, are special forms of a NaN that, when consumed by most operations, should raise the invalid operation exception and then, if appropriate, be &quot;quieted&quot; into a qNaN that may then propagate. They were introduced in IEEE 754. There have been several ideas for how these might be used:

* Filling uninitialized memory with signaling NaNs would produce the invalid operation exception if the data is used before it is initialized
* Using an sNaN as a placeholder for a more complicated object, such as:
** A representation of a number that has underflowed
** A representation of a number that has overflowed
** Number in a higher precision format
** A complex number
When encountered, a trap handler could decode the sNaN and return an index to the computed result. In practice, this approach is faced with many complications. The treatment of the sign bit of NaNs for some simple operations (such as absolute value) is different from that for arithmetic operations. Traps are not required by the standard.

=== Payload operations ===
IEEE 754-2019 recommends the operations &quot;getPayload&quot;, &quot;setPayload&quot;, and &quot;setPayloadSignaling&quot; be implemented, standardizing the access to payloads to streamline application use. According to the IEEE 754-2019 background document, this recommendation should be interpreted as &quot;required for new implementations, with reservation for backward compatibility&quot;.

=== Encoding ===
In IEEE 754 interchange formats, NaNs are identified by specific, pre-defined bit patterns unique to NaNs. The sign bit does not matter. For the binary formats, NaNs are represented with the exponent field filled with ones (like infinity values), and some non-zero number in the trailing significand field (to make them distinct from infinity values). The original IEEE 754 standard from 1985 (IEEE 754-1985) only described binary floating-point formats, and did not specify how the signaling/quiet state was to be tagged. In practice, the most significant bit of the trailing significand field determined whether a NaN is signaling or quiet. Two different implementations, with reversed meanings, resulted:
* most processors (including those of the Intel and AMD&#x27;s x86 family, the Motorola 68000 family, the AIM PowerPC family, the ARM family, the Sun SPARC family, and optionally new MIPS processors) set the signaling/quiet bit to non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and to zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an flag;
* in NaNs generated by the PA-RISC and old MIPS processors, the signaling/quiet bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling. Thus, on these processors, the bit represents an flag.
The former choice has been preferred as it allows the implementation to quiet a signaling NaN by just setting the signaling/quiet bit to 1. The reverse is not possible with the latter choice because setting the signaling/quiet bit to 0 could yield an infinity.

The 2008 and 2019 revisions of the IEEE 754 standard make formal requirements and recommendations for the encoding of the signaling/quiet state.
* For binary interchange formats, the most significant bit of the trailing significand field is exclusively used to distinguish between quiet and signaling NaNs. (This requirement has been added in the 2019 revision.) Moreover, it should be an flag. That is, this bit is non-zero if the NaN is quiet, and zero if the NaN is signaling.
* For decimal interchange formats, whether binary or decimal encoded, a NaN is identified by having the top five bits of the combination field after the sign bit set to ones. The sixth bit of the field is the flag. That is, this bit is zero if the NaN is quiet, and non-zero if the NaN is signaling.

For IEEE 754-2008 conformance, the meaning of the signaling/quiet bit in recent MIPS processors is now configurable via the NAN2008 field of the FCSR register. This support is optional in MIPS Release 3 and required in Release 5.

The state of the remaining bits of the trailing significand field are not defined by the standard. These bits encode a value called the &#x27;payload&#x27; of the NaN. For the binary formats, the encoding is unspecified. For the decimal formats, the usual encoding of unsigned integers is used. If an operation has a single NaN input and propagates it to the output, the result NaN&#x27;s payload should be that of the input NaN (this is not always possible for binary formats when the signaling/quiet state is encoded by an flag, as explained above). If there are multiple NaN inputs, the result NaN&#x27;s payload should be from one of the input NaNs; the standard does not specify which.

=== Canonical NaN ===

A number of systems have the concept of a &quot;canonical NaN&quot;, where one specific NaN value is chosen to be the only possible qNaN generated by floating-point operations not having a NaN input. The value is usually chosen to be a quiet NaN with an all-zero payload and an arbitrarily-defined sign bit.
* On RISC-V, most floating-point operations only ever generate the canonical NaN, even if a NaN is given as the operand (the payload is not propagated). ARM can enable a &quot;default NaN&quot; mode for this behavior. WebAssembly has the same behavior, though it allows two canonical values.
* A number of languages do not distinguish among different NaN values, without requiring their implementations to force a certain NaN value. ECMAScript (JavaScript) treats all NaN as if they are the same value. Java has the same treatment &quot;for the most part&quot;.

Using a limited amount of NaN representations allows the system to use other possible NaN values for non-arithmetic purposes, the most important being &quot;NaN-boxing&quot;, i.e. using the payload for arbitrary data. (This concept of &quot;canonical NaN&quot; is not the same as the concept of a &quot;canonical encoding&quot; in IEEE 754.)

== Function definition ==
There are differences of opinion about the proper definition for the result of a numeric function that receives a quiet NaN as input. One view is that the NaN should propagate to the output of the function in all cases to propagate the indication of an error. Another view, and the one taken by the ISO C99 and IEEE 754-2008 standards in general, is that if the function has multiple arguments and the output is uniquely determined by all the non-NaN inputs (including infinity), then that value should be the result. Thus for example the value returned by and is +∞.

The problem is particularly acute for the exponentiation function The expressions 00, ∞0 and 1∞ are considered indeterminate forms when they occur as limits (just like ∞ × 0), and the question of whether zero to the zero power should be defined as 1 has divided opinion.

If the output is considered as undefined when a parameter is undefined, then should produce a qNaN. However, math libraries have typically returned 1 for for any real number &quot;y&quot;, and even when &quot;y&quot; is an infinity. Similarly, they produce 1 for even when &quot;x&quot; is 0 or an infinity. The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard says that and should both return 1 since they return 1 whatever else is used instead of quiet NaN. Moreover, ISO C99, and later IEEE 754-2008, chose to specify instead of qNaN; the reason of this choice is given in the C rationale: &quot;Generally, C99 eschews a NaN result where a numerical value is useful. ... The result of is +∞, because all large positive floating-point values are even integers.&quot;

To satisfy those wishing a more strict interpretation of how the power function should act, the 2008 standard defines two additional power functions: where the exponent must be an integer, and which returns a NaN whenever a parameter is a NaN or the exponentiation would give an indeterminate form.

== Integer NaN ==
Most fixed-size integer formats cannot explicitly indicate invalid data. In such a case, when converting NaN to an integer type, the IEEE 754 standard requires that the invalid-operation exception be signaled. For example in Java, such operations throw instances of . In C, they lead to undefined behavior, but if annex F is supported, the operation yields an &quot;invalid&quot; floating-point exception (as required by the IEEE standard) and an unspecified value.

Perl&#x27;s package uses &quot;NaN&quot; for the result of strings that do not represent valid integers.

&gt; perl -mMath::BigInt -e &quot;print Math::BigInt-&gt;new(&#x27;foo&#x27;)&quot;
NaN
== Display ==
Different operating systems and programming languages may have different string representations of NaN.

 nan (C, C++, Python)
 NaN (ECMAScript, Rust, C#, Julia). 
 NaN% 
 NAN (C, C++, Rust)
 NaNQ (IBM XL and AIX: Fortran, C++ proposal n2290)
 NaNS (ditto)
 qNaN
 sNaN
 1.#SNAN (Excel)
 1.#QNAN (Excel)
 -1.#IND (Excel)
 +nan.0 (Scheme)

Since, in practice, encoded NaNs have a sign, a quiet/signaling bit and optional &#x27;diagnostic information&#x27; (sometimes called a &quot;payload&quot;), these will occasionally be found in string representations of NaNs, too. Some examples are:

* For the C and C++ languages, the sign bit is always shown by the standard-library functions (e.g. ) when present. There is no standard display of the payload nor of the signaling status, but a quiet NaN value of a specific payload may either be constructed by providing the string codice_2 to a number-parsing function (e.g. ) or by providing the &quot;char-sequence&quot; string to (or for sNaN), both interpreted in an implementation-defined manner.
** GCC and LLVM provides built-in implementations of and . They parse the &quot;char-sequence&quot; as an integer for (or a differently-sized equivalent) with its detection of integer bases.
** The GNU C Library&#x27;s float-parser uses the &quot;char-sequence&quot; string in &quot;some unspecified fashion&quot;. In practice, this parsing has been equivalent to GCC/LLVM&#x27;s for up to 64 bits of payload.
** Newlib does not implement parsing, but accepts a hexadecimal format without prefix.
** musl does not implement any payload parsing.

Not all languages admit the existence of multiple NaNs. For example, ECMAScript only uses one NaN value throughout.

<doc id="49246" wikidata="Q252962" url="?curid=49246" title="Biological determinism">
<text>Biological determinism, also known as genetic determinism, is the belief that human behaviour is directly controlled by an individual&#x27;s genes or some component of their physiology, generally at the expense of the role of the environment, whether in embryonic development or in learning. Genetic reductionism is a similar concept, but it is distinct from genetic determinism in that the former refers to the level of understanding, while the latter refers to the supposed causal role of genes. Biological determinism has been associated with movements in science and society including eugenics, scientific racism, and the debates around the heritability of IQ, the basis of sexual orientation, and evolutionary foundations of cooperation in sociobiology.

In 1892, the German evolutionary biologist August Weismann proposed in his germ plasm theory that heritable information is transmitted only via germ cells, which he thought contained determinants (genes). The English polymath Francis Galton, supposing that undesirable traits such as club foot and criminality were inherited, advocated eugenics, aiming to prevent supposedly defective people from breeding. The American physician Samuel George Morton and the French physician Paul Broca attempted to relate the cranial capacity (internal skull volume) to skin colour, intending to show that white people were superior. Other workers such as the American psychologists H. H. Goddard and Robert Yerkes attempted to measure people&#x27;s intelligence and to show that the resulting scores were heritable, again to demonstrate the supposed superiority of people with white skin.

Galton popularized the phrase nature and nurture, later often used to characterize the heated debate over whether genes or the environment determined human behaviour. Scientists such as behavioural geneticists now see it as obvious that both factors are essential, and that they are intertwined, especially through the mechanisms of epigenetics. The American biologist E. O. Wilson, who founded the discipline of sociobiology based on observations of animals such as social insects, controversially suggested that its explanations of social behaviour might apply to humans.

== History ==

=== Germ plasm ===

In 1892, the Austrian biologist August Weismann proposed that multicellular organisms consist of two separate types of cell: somatic cells, which carry out the body&#x27;s ordinary functions, and germ cells, which transmit heritable information. He called the material that carried the information, now identified as DNA, the germ plasm, and individual components of it, now called genes, determinants which controlled the organism. Weismann argued that there is a one-way transfer of information from the germ cells to somatic cells, so that nothing acquired by the body during an organism&#x27;s life can affect the germ plasm and the next generation. This effectively denied that Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics) was a possible mechanism of evolution. The modern equivalent of the theory, expressed at molecular rather than cellular level, is the central dogma of molecular biology.

===Eugenics===

Early ideas of biological determinism centred on the inheritance of undesirable traits, whether physical such as club foot or cleft palate, or psychological such as alcoholism, bipolar disorder and criminality. The belief that such traits were inherited led to an attempt to solve the problem with the eugenics movement. This was led by a follower of Darwin, Francis Galton (1822–1911), who advocated forcibly reducing breeding among people with those traits. By the 1920s, many U.S. states enacted laws permitting the compulsory sterilization of people considered genetically unfit, including inmates of prisons and psychiatric hospitals. This was followed by similar laws in Germany, and throughout the Western world, in the 1930s.

=== Scientific racism ===


Under the influence of determinist beliefs, the American craniologist Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), and later the French anthropologist Paul Broca (1824–1880), attempted to measure the cranial capacities (internal skull volumes) of people of different skin colours, intending to show that whites were superior to the rest, with larger brains. All the supposed proofs from such studies were invalidated by methodological flaws. The results were used to justify slavery, and to oppose women&#x27;s suffrage.

=== Heritability of IQ ===

Alfred Binet (1857–1911) designed tests specifically to measure performance, not innate ability. From the late 19th century, the American school, led by researchers such as H. H. Goddard (1866–1957), Lewis Terman (1877–1956), and Robert Yerkes (1876–1956), transformed these tests into tools for measuring inherited mental ability. They attempted to measure people&#x27;s intelligence with IQ tests, to demonstrate that the resulting scores were heritable, and so to conclude that people with white skin were superior to the rest. It proved impossible to design culture-independent tests and to carry out testing in a fair way given that people came from different backgrounds, or were newly arrived immigrants, or were illiterate. The results were used to oppose immigration of people from southern and eastern Europe to the USA.

=== Human sexual orientation ===

Human sexual orientation, which ranges over a continuum from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex, is caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental influences. There is considerably more evidence for biological causes of sexual orientation than social factors, especially for males.

=== Sociobiology ===

Sociobiology emerged with E. O. Wilson&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;&quot;. The existence of a putative altruism gene has been debated; the evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton proposed &quot;genes underlying altruism&quot; in 1964, while the biologist Graham J. Thompson and colleagues identified the genes OXTR, CD38, COMT, DRD4, DRD5, IGF2, GABRB2 as candidates &quot;affecting altruism&quot;. The geneticist Steve Jones argues that altruistic behaviour like &quot;loving our neighbour&quot; is built into the human genome, with the proviso that neighbour means member of &quot;our tribe&quot;, someone who shares many genes with the altruist, and that the behaviour can thus be explained by kin selection. Evolutionary biologists such as Jones have argued that genes that did not lead to selfish behaviour would die out compared to genes that did, because the selfish genes would favour themselves. However, the mathematician George Constable and colleagues have argued that altruism can be an evolutionarily stable strategy, making organisms better able to survive random catastrophes.

== Nature versus nurture debate ==

The belief in biological determinism was matched in the 20th century by a blank slate denial of any possible influence of genes on human behaviour, leading to a long and heated debate about &quot;nature and nurture&quot;. By the 21st century, many scientists had come to feel that the dichotomy made no sense. They noted that genes are expressed within an environment, in particular that of prenatal development, and that gene expression is continuously influenced by the environment through mechanisms such as epigenetics. Epigenetics provides evidence that human behaviours or physiology can be decided by interactions between genes and environments. For example, monozygotic twins usually have exactly identical genomes. Scientists have focused on comparison studies of such twins for evaluating the heritability of genes and the roles of epigenetics in divergences and similarities between monozygotic twins, and have found that epigenetics plays an important part in human behaviours, including the stress response.

<doc id="49248" wikidata="Q958904" url="?curid=49248" title="Byron White">
<text>Byron Raymond &quot;Whizzer&quot; White (June 8, 1917 – April 15, 2002) was an American lawyer, jurist, and professional football player who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1962 until 1993. By his retirement, he was the Supreme Court&#x27;s only sitting Democrat and the last-living member of the progressive Warren Court.

Born and raised in a small homestead in Wellington, Colorado, White distinguished himself as a student athlete who came from a background of poor farmhands to become a consensus All-American halfback for the Colorado Buffaloes. After being the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 1937, he was selected in the 1938 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates for the National Football League (NFL). He led the league in rushing yards during his rookie season. White graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder as class valedictorian, attaining a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. After World War II forced him to return to the United States, he matriculated at Yale Law School, played for the Detroit Lions in the 1940 and 1941 seasons while still enrolled, and served as an officer for the United States Navy in the Pacific Theatre.

White graduated from law school with honors in 1946 and clerked for Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson. He eschewed work for a white-shoe firm and returned to Colorado in order to enter private practice in Denver as a transactional attorney. Minor work as the Colorado state chair of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign led to him being unexpectedly tapped in 1961 for a position as U.S. Deputy Attorney General. He was successfully nominated by Kennedy to the Supreme Court the next year, becoming the Court&#x27;s first justice from Colorado.

White espoused a pragmatic and non-doctrinaire judicial approach which strengthened the powers of the federal government, advocated for the desegregation of public schools, and upheld the use of affirmative action. Though expected to be a reliably liberal justice, he was by contrast a vociferous opponent of substantive due process, penning dissents in both &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. White wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (upholding the ability for states to restrict homosexual conduct) and dissented in &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot; (against the ability for the government to restrict racial discrimination in private schools) and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;. Due to his unwillingness to align with either the liberal or conservative blocs, White was largely oriented with the Court&#x27;s center.

==Early life and education==
White was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, on June 8, 1917. His father, A. Albert White, managed a local lumber company. His mother, Maude Elizabeth (Burger), was the daughter of German immigrants. He had one older brother, Clayton &quot;Sam&quot; Samuel White. Neither parent graduated high school, which was not unusual for farming communities at the time, but they instilled in their sons a heavy emphasis on education and took active roles in the local community. White and his brother were raised in the nearby town of Wellington where they attended the local high school. As a young student, White worked odd jobs to support his family during the town&#x27;s decline in the 1920s; these included roles in harvesting beets, shoveling coal, and hard construction work among other forms of manual labor. In his junior year, he and his brother rented out land and spent long hours in the fields, during which time White adopted a nearly lifelong habit of smoking.

Sam, four years White&#x27;s senior, became an accomplished student and athlete that graduated as valedictorian, earning a scholarship to study at the University of Colorado, where he was later elected by the university to become a Rhodes Scholar. Whereas Sam was a gregarious and socially active child, White was described as a taciturn boy who &quot;was very quiet, measuring every single word, showing no emotion, and revealing nothing.&quot;

White excelled academically in high school, graduating in 1934 as the class valedictorian with the highest grades in the school&#x27;s history. He studied diligently in order to attain a scholarship to attend college, later describing his philosophy in Wellington as &quot;do your work and don&#x27;t be late for dinner.&quot; White followed his brother&#x27;s footsteps in attending the University of Colorado Boulder on the scholarship offered to all Colorado high school valedictorians, intending to go to medical school and major in chemistry. Though he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity on campus, he stuck to a strict routine of working and studying with little to no social life. However, he would become a star athlete after playing as an All-American halfback for the Colorado Buffaloes football team, winning a series of victories to become among the most acclaimed players in the country.

In 1935, Sam White was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University. After news of his brother&#x27;s success became a local sensation, White saw his brother as an inspiration and felt pressured to achieve the scholarship himself. He served as student body president his senior year, switched his major to the humanities, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian from the University of Colorado in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. In his last year, the Colorado Buffaloes went undefeated, and White&#x27;s status as a football star earned him the moniker &quot;Whizzer White&quot; by the student newspaper. After months of study, White also attained the Rhodes Scholarship, deferring it for a year to play professional football before attending Hertford College.

=== Oxford ===
On January 3, 1939, White departed to England aboard the SS &quot;Europa&quot;, arriving in Southampton on January 9 harassed by reporters wishing to see a &quot;Yank at Oxford.&quot; Upon moving into Hertford College with the intent of studying law, he befriended the future mathematician George Piranian and was assigned with C. H. S. Fifoot as a tutor. White spent his days at Oxford tirelessly studying from day until night, becoming &quot;the only Rhodes scholar who ever worked fourteen hours a day on his studies.&quot; During one Easter vacation, he became acquainted with Joseph P. Kennedy and future U.S. president John F. Kennedy as their father, Joseph Kennedy, was the U.S. ambassador to London. In the period of political upheaval just before the Second World War, Oxford students—Rhodes scholars especially—took an active role in international politics, with many American Rhodes scholars beckoning President Roosevelt to take action against Spanish nationalists. White, however, remained closed in the affairs of politics, rarely speaking out and becoming estranged from other students; he prioritized his studies and physique above all else.

Following the end of a term, White spent a summer vacation touring France and Germany, settling down in Munich in order to study the German language and Roman law. He unexpectedly reunited with John F. Kennedy, who was on his own tour of Europe with Torbert Macdonald, and on one occasion the three were heckled by a mob who recognized their English license plates. As the oncoming war made it impossible for students to continue studying abroad, White left the country to return to Oxford in late August 1939, choosing to leave the university in order to continue his legal education at Yale Law School.

=== Law school ===
Upon enrolling at Yale, White continued his previous routine of studying fourteen hours a day, taking breaks only to exercise in the gymnasium where he would frequent the basketball courts, often clashing against Yale halfback Clint Frank in pick-up games. Despite attempts by the New York Giants and other NFL teams to get him to sign back into football, White publicly repudiated his football career, telling a local newspaper that &quot;my football playing days are over. I&#x27;m started on a law career.&quot;

At the time, Yale was home to a number of legal realists who rebuked &quot;Lochner&quot; and substantive due process, and were generally scholars with an expertise in legal fields outside of constitutional law. Two of such realists—Myres S. McDougal and Arthur Corbin—had a significant influence on White early in law school. Future justice Potter Stewart, one year ahead of him at the university, remembered White as &quot;a serious-minded, scholarly, and rather taciturn (except when he found himself engaged in lively colloquy with J. W. Moore in his class on Procedure), and extremely likable young man with steel-rimmed eyeglasses.&quot;

White earned the highest grades in his first-year class and was subsequently awarded the Edgar M. Cullen Prize, an award given to the highest-achieving first-year student. During the summer, he returned to Colorado and attended summer school at the University of Colorado Law School, got an appendectomy, and became a waiter at his old fraternity. White would turn down an offer to join the editorship of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, instead taking a leave of absence to promptly return to professional football as a member of the Detroit Lions.

=== Professional football ===
White came into the National Football League with the then-Pirates in the summer of 1938 as a widely-heralded college star. The $15,800 contract he had signed made White the NFL&#x27;s highest-paid player. About his first game, one Pittsburgh journalist said he &quot;looked better as an individual than the Pirates did as a team&quot;. Despite leading the NFL in rushing yards in 1938, White did not appear for the 1939 season. He would reappear for the Detroit Lions in 1940 and would again top the world of &quot;postgraduate football&quot; with a league-leading performance. 

White played a total of three NFL seasons — 33 games in all. He led the league in rushing twice during that short interval, and was elected the NFL&#x27;s first team All-Pro right halfback in 1940.

=== World War II ===
At the end of 1941 Lions season, White returned to Yale to await a call to serve in the U.S. Navy after the Attack on Pearl Harbor; in May 1942, he was assigned to naval intelligence and spent weeks training at Dartmouth College and in New York City. His original intention was to join the Marine Corps, but was kept out due to being colorblind.

In July 1943, White was stationed at Nouméa, New Caledonia, tasked with protecting Guadalcanal and Tulagi; he narrowly missed being assigned with John F. Kennedy, his former acquaintance who had also been stationed at Tulagi before being reassigned to the Russell Islands. During World War II, White served as an intelligence officer in the Navy, and was stationed in the Pacific Theatre. He wrote the intelligence report on the sinking of future President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot;. For his service, White was awarded two Bronze Star medals, and was honorably discharged as a lieutenant commander in 1945.

==Legal career==

After his military service, White returned to Yale Law School, graduating in 1946 ranked first in his class with a Bachelor of Laws degree, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and membership in the Order of the Coif. White served as a law clerk to Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1946 to 1947, then returned to Colorado and entered private practice in Denver with the law firm now known as Davis Graham &amp; Stubbs. This was a time in which the Denver economy flourished, and White rendered legal service to the business community. White was for the most part a transactional attorney; he drafted contracts and advised insolvent companies, and he argued the occasional case in court.

During the 1960 presidential election, White used his status as a football star to aid him as chair of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign in Colorado. White had first met the candidate when White was a Rhodes scholar and Kennedy&#x27;s father, Joseph Kennedy, was Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. During the Kennedy administration, White served as United States Deputy Attorney General, the number two man in the Justice Department, under Robert F. Kennedy. He took the lead in protecting the Freedom Riders in 1961, negotiating with Alabama Governor John Malcolm Patterson.

==Supreme Court==

On April 3, 1962, President Kennedy nominated White to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, succeeding Charles Evans Whittaker. The president said of White—a longtime friend of his—that &quot;he has excelled at everything. And I know that he will excel on the highest court in the land.&quot; White was confirmed on April 11, 1962, by a voice vote. He took the judicial oath of office on April 16, 1962, and served until June 28, 1993. His Supreme Court tenure was the fourth-longest of the 20th century.

Upon the request of Vice President-Elect Al Gore, White administered the oath of office on January 20, 1993, to Gore. It was the only time White administered an oath of office to a vice president. During his service on the high court, White wrote 994 opinions. He was fierce in questioning attorneys in court, and his votes and opinions on the bench reflect an ideology that has been notoriously difficult for popular journalists and legal scholars alike to pin down. He was seen as a disappointment by some Kennedy supporters who wished he had joined the more liberal wing of the court in its opinions on &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

White often took a narrow, fact-specific view of cases before the Court and generally refused to make broad pronouncements on constitutional doctrine or adhere to a specific judicial philosophy, preferring what he viewed as a practical approach to the law. In the tradition of the New Deal, White frequently supported a broad view and expansion of governmental powers. He consistently voted against creating constitutional restrictions on the police, dissenting in the landmark 1966 case &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;. In that dissent, he said that aggressive police practices enhance the individual rights of law-abiding citizens. His jurisprudence has sometimes been praised for adhering to the doctrine of judicial restraint.

===Substantive due process doctrine===
Frequently a critic of the doctrine of &quot;substantive due process&quot;, which involves the judiciary reading substantive content into the term &quot;liberty&quot; in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, White&#x27;s first published opinion as a Supreme Court Justice was a joint dissent with Justice Clark in &quot;Robinson v. California&quot; (1962), foreshadowing his career-long distaste for the doctrine. In &quot;Robinson&quot;, he criticized the remainder of the Court&#x27;s unprecedented expansion of the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition of &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; to strike down a California law providing for civil commitment of drug addicts. He argued that the Court was &quot;imposing its own philosophical predilections&quot; on the state in this exercise of judicial power, although its historic &quot;allergy to substantive due process&quot; would never permit it to strike down a state&#x27;s economic regulatory law in such a manner.

In the same vein, he dissented in the controversial 1973 case &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. White voted to strike down a state ban on contraceptives in the 1965 case of &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, although he did not join the majority opinion, which famously asserted a &quot;right of privacy&quot; on the basis of the &quot;penumbras&quot; of the Bill of Rights. White and Justice William Rehnquist were the only dissenters from the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe&quot;, though White&#x27;s dissent used stronger language, suggesting that &quot;Roe&quot; was &quot;an exercise in raw judicial power&quot; and criticizing the decision for &quot;interposing a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life.&quot; White, who usually adhered firmly to the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, remained a critic of &quot;Roe&quot; throughout his term on the bench and frequently voted to uphold laws restricting abortion, including in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; in 1992.

White explained his general views on the validity of substantive due process at length in his dissent in &quot;Moore v. City of East Cleveland&quot; (1977):

The Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the design of the Constitution. Realizing that the present construction of the Due Process Clause represents a major judicial gloss on its terms, as well as on the anticipation of the Framers, and that much of the underpinning for the broad, substantive application of the Clause disappeared in the conflict between the Executive and the Judiciary in the 1930s and 1940s, the Court should be extremely reluctant to breathe still further substantive content into the Due Process clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a State or city to promote its welfare. Whenever the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the governance of the country without express constitutional authority.

White parted company with Rehnquist in strongly supporting the Supreme Court decisions striking down laws that discriminated on the basis of sex, agreeing with Justice William J. Brennan in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Frontiero v. Richardson&quot; that such laws should be subject to strict scrutiny. Only three justices joined Brennan&#x27;s plurality opinion in &quot;Frontiero&quot;; later gender discrimination cases would be subjected to intermediate scrutiny (see &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot;). In &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, White joined Brennan and Marshall in dissent arguing that male-only Selective Service registration was unconstitutional.

White wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; (1986), which upheld Georgia&#x27;s anti-sodomy law against a substantive due process attack:

The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution... There should be, therefore, great resistance to ... redefining the category of rights deemed to be fundamental. Otherwise, the Judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional authority.

White&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bowers&quot; typified his fact-specific, deferential style, treating the issue in that case as presenting only the question of whether homosexuals had a fundamental right to privacy, even though the statute in &quot;Bowers&quot; potentially applied to heterosexual sodomy. Georgia, however, conceded during oral argument that the law would be inapplicable to married couples under the precedent set forth in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;. A year after White&#x27;s death, &quot;Bowers&quot; was overruled in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003).

===Death penalty===

White took a middle course on the issue of the death penalty: he was one of five justices who voted in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972) to strike down several state capital punishment statutes, voicing concern over the arbitrary way in which the death penalty was administered. The Furman decision ended capital punishment in the U.S. until the court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; (1976). In that case, White voted to uphold Georgia&#x27;s new capital punishment law.

White accepted the position that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution required that all punishments be &quot;proportional&quot; to the crime; thus, in &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; (1977), he wrote the opinion that invalidated the death penalty for rape of a 16-year-old married girl. His first reported Supreme Court decision was a dissent in &quot;Robinson v. California&quot; (1962), in which he criticized the Court for extending the reach of the Eighth Amendment. In &quot;Robinson&quot; the Court for the first time expanded the constitutional prohibition of &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot; from examining the nature of the punishment imposed and whether it was an uncommon punishment − as, for example, in the cases of flogging, branding, banishment, or electrocution − to deciding whether any punishment at all was appropriate for the defendant&#x27;s conduct. White said: &quot;If this case involved economic regulation, the present Court&#x27;s allergy to substantive due process would surely save the statute and prevent the Court from imposing its own philosophical predilections upon state legislatures or Congress.&quot; Consistent with his view in &quot;Robinson&quot;, White thought that imposing the death penalty on minors was constitutional, and he was one of the three dissenters in &quot;Thompson v. Oklahoma&quot; (1988), a decision that declared that the death penalty as applied to offenders below 16 years of age was unconstitutional as a cruel and unusual punishment.

===Abortion===
Along with Justice William Rehnquist, White dissented in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (the dissenting decision was in the companion case, &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;), castigating the majority for holding that the U.S. Constitution &quot;values the convenience, whim or caprice of the putative mother more than the life or potential life of the fetus.&quot;

===Civil rights===

White consistently supported the Court&#x27;s post-&quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; attempts to fully desegregate public schools, even through the controversial line of forced busing cases. He voted to uphold affirmative action remedies to racial inequality in an education setting in the famous &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; case of 1978. Though White voted to uphold federal affirmative action programs in cases such as &quot;Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC&quot;, 497 U.S. 547 (1990) (later overruled by &quot;Adarand Constructors v. Peña&quot;, 515 U.S. 200 (1995)), he voted to strike down an affirmative action plan regarding state contracts in &quot;Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.&quot; (1989).

White dissented in &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot; (1976), which held that federal law prohibited private schools from discriminating on the basis of race. He argued that the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (popularly known as the &quot;Ku Klux Klan Act&quot;) indicated that the Act was not designed to prohibit private racial discrimination but only state-sponsored racial discrimination (as had been held in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot; of 1883). White was concerned about the potential far-reaching impact of holding private racial discrimination illegal, which if taken to its logical conclusion might ban many varied forms of voluntary self-segregation, including social and advocacy groups that limited their membership to blacks: &quot;Whether such conduct should be condoned or not, whites and blacks will undoubtedly choose to form a variety of associational relationships pursuant to contracts which exclude members of the other race. Social clubs, black and white, and associations designed to further the interests of blacks or whites are but two examples&quot;. &quot;Runyon&quot; was essentially overruled by 1989&#x27;s &quot;Patterson v. McLean Credit Union&quot;, which itself was superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

===Relationships with other justices===
White said he was most comfortable on Rehnquist&#x27;s court. He once said of Earl Warren, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t exactly in his circle.&quot; On the Burger Court, the chief justice often assigned important criminal procedure and individual rights opinions to White because of his frequently conservative views on these questions.

===Court operations and retirement===
White frequently urged the Supreme Court to consider cases when federal appeals courts were in conflict on issues of federal law, believing that resolving such was a primary role of the Supreme Court. Thus, White voted to grant certiorari more often than many of his colleagues; he also wrote numerous opinions dissenting from denials of certiorari. After White (along with fellow Justice Harry Blackmun, who also often voted for liberal grants of certiorari) retired, the number of cases heard each session of the Court declined steeply.

White disliked the politics of Supreme Court appointments, but had great faith in representative democracy, responding to complaints about politicians and mediocrity in government with exhortations to &quot;get more involved and help fix it.&quot; He retired in 1993, during Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, saying that &quot;someone else should be permitted to have a like experience.&quot; When he retired, White had been the only Democrat on the Court. Clinton nominated (and the Senate approved) Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and a former Columbia University law professor, to succeed him.

==Later years and death==
After retiring from the Supreme Court, White occasionally sat with lower federal courts. He maintained chambers in the federal courthouse in Denver until shortly before his death. He also served for the Commission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of Appeals.

White died of pneumonia on April 15, 2002, at the age of 84. He was the last living Justice to have served on the Warren Court, and the last justice appointed by Kennedy; he died the day before the fortieth anniversary of his swearing in as a Justice. From his death until the retirement of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 2006, there were no living former justices.

His remains are interred at All Souls Walk at St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Denver.

Then-Chief Justice Rehnquist said White &quot;came as close as anyone I have known to meriting Matthew Arnold&#x27;s description of Sophocles: &#x27;He saw life steadily and he saw it whole.&#x27; All of us who served with him will miss him.&quot;

==Personal life==
White first met his wife Marion Stearns (1921–2009), the daughter of the president of the University of Colorado, when she was in high school and he was a college football player. During World War II, Marion served in the WAVES while her future husband was a Navy intelligence officer. They married in 1946 and had two children: a son named Charles Byron (Barney) and a daughter named Nancy.

His older brother Clayton Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; White (1912–2004) was also a high school valedictorian and Rhodes Scholar. He later became a physician and medical researcher, particularly on the effects of atomic bomb blasts.

==Awards and honors==
The NFL Players Association gives the Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White NFL Man of the Year Award to one player each year for his charity work. Michael McCrary, who was involved in &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot;, grew up to be a professional football player and won the award in 2000.
The federal courthouse in Denver that houses the Tenth Circuit is named after White.

White was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1952.

White was made an honorary fellow of Hertford College, Oxford.

White was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003 by President George W. Bush.

White was inducted into the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Hall of Fame on July 14, 2007, in addition to being a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the University of Colorado&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame, where he is enshrined as &quot;The Greatest Buff Ever&quot;.

<text>Dili (Portuguese and Tetum: &quot;Díli&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Timor-Leste. It lies on the northern coast of the island of Timor, in a small area of flat land hemmed in by mountains. The climate is tropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The city has served as the economic hub and chief port of what is now Timor-Leste since its designation as the capital of Portuguese Timor in 1769. It also serves as the capital of the Dili Municipality, which includes some rural subdivisions in addition to the urban ones that make up the city itself. Dili&#x27;s growing population is relatively youthful, being mostly of working age. The local language is Tetum; however, residents include many internal migrants from other areas of the country.

The initial settlement was situated in what is now the old quarter in the eastern side of the city. Centuries of Portuguese rule were interrupted in World War II, when Dili became the site of a battle between Allied and Japanese forces. The damaged city returned to Portuguese control following the war. In 1975, a civil war between Timorese political parties broke out, leading to a declaration of independence and a subsequent invasion by Indonesia. Under Indonesian rule infrastructure in the city was developed, with landmarks such as the Immaculate Conception Cathedral and &quot;Cristo Rei of Dili&quot; being built during this time. The city expanded as its population grew to over 100,000 people.

Resistance to Indonesian rule faced violent repression, and a massacre in Dili led to international pressure culminating in an independence referendum. Following a vote for independence violence erupted in the city, destroying huge amounts of its infrastructure and leading to an exodus of refugees. A period of United Nations rule followed, during which international agencies began the reconstruction of the city. Dili became the capital of an independent Timor-Leste in 2002. A period of violence in 2006 saw another period of infrastructure damage and population displacement. In 2009 the government launched the &quot;City of Peace&quot; campaign to reduce tensions. As the population has continued to grow and the original site of the city has filled up, the urban area has expanded into coastal areas to the east and west of the main city.

Infrastructure in Dili continues to be developed. The city was the first location in Timor-Leste to see 24 hours of electricity, although its water infrastructure remains relatively limited. Education levels are higher than the national average, and the country&#x27;s universities are located in the city. An international port and airport lie within the city limits. Most economic activity comes from the tertiary sector and public employment. To further build the economy, the government is developing the tourism potential of the city, focusing on cultural, environmental, and historical attractions.

==History==

===Initial Portuguese settlement===

Dili has played a central role in the history of Timor-Leste. However, early records about Timor, especially before the 1700s, are sparse. The tumultuous history of the city has resulted in a great deal of information being lost; archives in the city were destroyed in 1779, 1890, 1975, and 1999.

The island of Timor was possibly known as a source for sandalwood in the 15th century. The first recorded Portuguese voyage to the island from Portuguese Malacca occurred in 1516, returning with sandalwood. In 1521, sandalwood was left out of a list of products under royal monopoly, leaving most trade with Timor in the hands of private enterprises. Portuguese and Spanish interest in the island increased in the 1520s, with regular trade established by 1524. In the late 1500s, administrative officials began to be appointed to nearby Solor with jurisdiction over that island and Timor, signifying increasing state interest in Portuguese activities there.

The Netherlands began to compete for control of the island in 1613, especially in the west. A rebellion in 1629 forced the Portuguese off the island for three years. In 1641, a number of kings in Timor converted to Catholicism while seeking Portuguese protection. This introduced a political dimension to Portuguese influence, which had previously been primarily economic. Timor became administratively separated from Solor in 1646, although the exact administrative structure is unknown. It received its first dedicated governor in 1702, who resided in Lifau. This reflected the growing importance of Timor compared to nearby Flores. 1749 saw Dutch military forces take control over large portions of the island, broadly reflecting current borders.

In 1769, as Lifau came under the increasing influence of powerful local families collectively known as the Topasses, the Portuguese governor António José Teles de Meneses moved the administration and 1,200 people east to establish a new capital. It was originally intended that the administration be set up at Vemasse further east, but perhaps because of the favourable geography, a settlement was established at Dili instead. This was at the time part of the Motael kingdom, whose leader was friendly with the Portuguese authorities. The governor occupied an existing fortified structure, and with the assistance of the Motael leader began to construct a new settlement. The area surrounding the settlement was wetlands fed by rivers from the mountains, and proved conducive to rice cultivation. A wall was built to separate the coastal city from wetlands to its south. The initial settlement was divided between three populations, one mainly Portuguese, one of Mestiços and locals from other Portuguese colonies (which became Bidau), and one for troops from a kingdom thought to be in Flores. 
From 1788 to 1790, a civil war broke out between the governor in Dili and an official based in Manatuto, which was resolved upon the arrival of a new governor. In response to Dutch provocations, a permanent military force was established in 1818. Some Europeans settled in Lahane to the south, beyond the wetland area. Significant construction was undertaken under governor , who arrived in 1834 and rebuilt the settlement along a grid. This saw expansion along the coast, but also southwards as the wetlands between the original city and Lahane were channelised and drained. A road extended to Lahane and Dare. The rebuilding saw the settlement being centred on its port, with the immediate port area containing trade facilities, church buildings, military buildings, government buildings, the residence of the governor and his deputy, a residence for a representative of the Motael kingdom, and a residence for the Queen of Manatuto. Of these, only the church and the Finance Deputy&#x27;s house used masonry. To the east of this core was Bidau and a Chinese settlement, to the west was the main settlement of the Motael kingdom.

In 1844 Timor, along with Macau and Solor, was removed from the jurisdiction of Portuguese India, with the three areas becoming a new Portuguese province. A few years later in 1850, Portuguese Timor was removed from the jurisdiction of the governor of Macau, before being returned to the jurisdiction of Portuguese India in 1856. When English naturalist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace visited in the 1860s, he wrote that the governor&#x27;s house was &quot;merely a low whitewashed cottage&quot;, and that all other buildings appeared to be mud and thatch. At the time swamps and mudflats surrounded the town, which did not extend to the mountains surrounding it. More permanent buildings of one or two stories were constructed throughout the late 19th century. A new church building was built in 1877.
A revolt to the east led to the city being isolated in 1861; however, the revolt was defeated by the Portuguese and their Timorese allies. In 1863, Dili was declared a city (although the news may not have arrived to the city until the next year), and East Timor became directly subordinate to the Lisbon government. In 1866 the territory was again put under the jurisdiction of Macau. An 1887 mutiny in Dili led to the death of the governor at the time. The territory was separated from Macau for the last time in 1896, again coming directly under the jurisdiction of Lisbon, and becoming a full province in 1909. Another notable revolt took place in the years after the 1910 republican revolution in Portugal. The republican government downgraded the status of its overseas provinces to colonies. A civil government was established in 1913.
Permanent structures in Portuguese style continued to be constructed into the 20th century. A new town hall was built from 1912 to 1915. The main church was demolished in 1933, and a new cathedral opened in its place in 1937. (This cathedral was later destroyed by Allied bombing in the Second World War.) Four distinct residential districts developed around the city core. Bidau was the largest, and Benamauc joined it on the eastern side. Caicole developed to the south between the city and Lahane. Colmera developed as a commercial area to the west with a large number of Muslim traders. Motael continued to develop, becoming the site of the city&#x27;s lighthouse. Motael Church began to be built in 1901. Inland to the southwest, a Chinese cemetery was established, and beyond that a military area known as Taibesse. Lahane also saw significant development in the early 20th century, with its east and west side separated by a river. As the administrative structures developed, Dili became part of the Dili municipality in 1940, the first municipal administration to be created. At the time the municipality was larger, including what is now the Aileu Municipality.

===Destruction, reconstruction, and Indonesian rule===

During World War II, Portugal and its colonies remained neutral, but the Allies saw East Timor as a potential target for Japanese invasion. Upon the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Australian and Dutch troops were sent to Dili despite Portuguese objections. In response, the Japanese invaded Dili as part of a two-pronged invasion of Timor. The city had been mostly abandoned prior to the invasion, and allied forces retreated further into the island. The Japanese left the Portuguese governor nominally in position, but took over administration. Much of Dili was destroyed during the war, from the initial Japanese invasion and from later allied bombings. Japanese forces on the island of Timor surrendered to Australian forces at the end of the war. Following the surrender, an Australian official travelled to Dili where on 23 September 1945 he informed the Portuguese governor of the Japanese surrender.
Following the Second World War, Dili covered what today is the old core of the city, within the sucos of Acadiru Hun, Bemori, Bidau Lecidere, Caicoli, Colmera, Culu Hun, Gricenfor, Motael, and Santa Cruz. Portuguese Timor became a full part of Following the initial post-war reconstruction of Dili&#x27;s immediately critical infrastructure, an urban plan was developed in 1951 covering urban layout, road development, zoning, and building regulations. The plan envisioned separate neighbourhoods for Europeans, mestiços, Chinese, Arabs, and Timorese, and assumed there would be further rural-urban migration. Both this plan and later revisions in 1968 and 1972 assumed that the Timorese population would live on the edges of the city yet work near the centre. This plan was not completed, and the city remained under-developed, with low density and where property outside of the central area was still built on with flimsy materials and used for subsistence cultivation. The second five-year development plan, which ran from 1959 to 1964, saw the reconstruction of the Port of Dili and a small amount of transport infrastructure. 

A 1950 census found that the population of Dili was about 6,000 people, half &#x27;civilised&#x27; (considered by Portuguese authorities to have sufficiently adopted Portuguese culture), including &quot;Mestiço&quot;, &#x27;civilised&#x27; natives, Europeans, and other foreigners such as Goans and those from Portugal&#x27;s African colonies. This was slightly over 1% of the total population of the colony. The 1960 census recorded the population of Dili to be about 7,000 people. By 1970, the urban population reached around 17,000. The city did not extend far beyond the area surrounding the port, and the population did not exceed 30,000 before 1975. 
Portuguese Timor became a full part of Portugal in 1951, although despite being made citizens of Portugal this did not bring the locals any political power. Governance remained in the control of Lisbon. The Portuguese Overseas Organic Law of 1963 created the first Legislative Council of the territory, which was given some of the powers formerly held by the governor. It also theoretically extended voting rights to the &#x27;uncivilised&#x27;, although property and tax requirements meant most were still unable to vote.

The 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal created immediate change in East Timor, with new political parties forming with the goal of independence from Portugal. Relationships between these new parties was fractious. Some, particularly the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT), advocated union with Indonesia. On 11 August 1975, the UDT initiated a coup. UDT control was limited outside of Dili, and on 20 August the opposing Fretilin party began its attempt to seize the city. Some houses were set on fire to assist the defence; however, after some days Fretilin succeeded in taking control of the city. The last Portuguese governor fled Dili for Atauro Island on 26 August, as the civil war continued. On 28 November, Fretilin declared independence in a ceremony in Dili. On 7 December, Indonesia landed paratroopers in the city and amphibious forces to its west, as part of an invasion of East Timor, leading many to flee the city.
This invasion brought the territory under Indonesian rule. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia annexed East Timor, which it designated its 27th province. Indonesia continued to administer the territory from Dili, continuing formerly Portuguese use of places such as the Balide Comarca prison and Lahane Hospital. Despite Indonesian attempts to restrict rural-urban migration, the population of Dili continued to grow, reaching 80,000 people in 1985, and over 100,000 in 1999, and economic growth for the territory remained centred in Dili. Part of the internal migration was due to people fleeing the continuing conflict in rural areas. Indonesia developed the city&#x27;s infrastructure, partly as an attempt to win over the population. Structures and monuments built during this time include the Immaculate Conception Cathedral, the Integration Statue commemorating the end of Portuguese rule, and the &quot;Cristo Rei of Dili&quot;. Nonetheless, many in the city continued to support the Fretilin-led resistance, providing a communications link between the rebels and the rest of the world, and setting up safe houses in the city. Others who supported Indonesian rule became informants, known as &quot;mau&#x27;hu&quot;. By the 1990s, urban sprawl had taken up much of the available flat land around the original settlement.

In the 1980s, resistance to Indonesian rule grew among youth in the city. Nonetheless, towards the end of the decade Indonesia began allowing foreign tourists access to the city, with the entire province previously being restricted. A visit by Pope John Paul II in 1989 was interrupted by independence activists. On 12 November 1991, Indonesian forces were filmed shooting at a funeral procession. This led to global condemnation of Indonesia&#x27;s rule in East Timor, increasing pressure for East Timorese self-determination. The 1997 Asian financial crisis along with a drought related to an El Niño event led to profound food insecurity, worse for Dili than any other city in Indonesia. The crisis also precipitated the resignation of Indonesian President Suharto, whose successor, B. J. Habibie, soon approved a referendum on East Timorese independence. Outbreaks of violence from pro-Indonesian militia occurred throughout the country in the months leading up to the vote. In August 1999, East Timor voted for independence.

The vote led to a period of extreme violence, as pro-Indonesian militia were unchecked by the Indonesian military that was meant to be providing security. On 4 September, when the result was announced, Indonesian police began to leave Dili. In the first 48 hours, international media organisations present in the city reported 145 deaths. Most foreigners were evacuated. Violence continued for several days, causing significant damage to infrastructure and housing in the city. Administrative buildings were looted, and much of the city was destroyed by fire. 120,000 people became refugees. International pressure grew for an international peacekeeping force to replace the Indonesian military, which Indonesia agreed to on 12 September. On 14 September, the UN evacuated refugees that had been sheltering in its Dili compound to Australia. The Australian-led International Force East Timor arrived on 20 September.

===Growth under UN rule and independence===

Dili continued to grow under UN rule. As Indonesian infrastructure investment outside of Dili was not replicated by the UN government, leaving it to deteriorate, population growth was driven in part due to internal migration from these areas to the city. Housing left abandoned by Indonesians in 1999 was occupied by squatters. This was most common in the western areas of the city. Most inward migration during this period was from eastern areas of the country. Population growth combined with a poor economy led to an increase of urban poverty and unemployment, especially amongst youth. This was despite the city reaping 80% of the economic benefits of reconstruction efforts; 65% of direct jobs created by the UN were in Dili, a figure that rose to 80% when including indirect jobs.

Following the beginning of UN rule, the population of Dili grew by over 10% annually. This was a result of both rural-urban migration, and a baby boom driven by the country having the highest fertility rate in the world. By 2004, the population had reached 173,541 people, with unemployment at 26.9% overall, and 43.4% for men aged 15–29. Around half of employment for these young men was informal. In 2005 a new urban master plan was developed by a group based in the Faculty of Architecture of the Technical University of Lisbon. Issues with food security reoccurred periodically throughout the early years of independence. From 1990 to 2014, agricultural use of the flat land around Dili is thought to have decreased by around 40%, replaced by horticulture and aquaculture in the east and by urban areas in the west. Wetlands have also further decreased, drained and built upon.

By 2006, Dili produced half of the country&#x27;s non-oil GDP. It was also receiving two-thirds of government expenditure, and 80% of goods and services. However, economic benefits were distributed unequally. 1999 saw the end of Indonesian subsidises of core food products, which alongside infrastructure destruction led to rapid inflation. Under UN rule, the use of the US dollar and the purchasing power of international organisations led to price increases. Together, these factors led to extremely high costs of living. Electricity cost four times as much as it did in Indonesia, averaging $15 per household. Telecommunications and petrol similarly grew in price compared to Indonesia. By 2006 Dili had the eighth-highest living costs of any city in Asia, despite the country&#x27;s having Asia&#x27;s lowest GDP. At this point, the city had around 300 youth groups, some of which were involved in the informal economy. These groups, driven by unemployment, were often connected to former guerrillas and current politicians. Many developed identities reflecting the regional origins of their members, especially with regards to the broad distinction between those from the east and those from the west.

In April 2006, disputes within the military between a leadership mostly from the east of the country and soldiers mostly from the west spilled over into street violence in Dili. Disputes over housing, again mostly between groups from the east and west, contributed to property destruction. Most of the 150,000 people displaced were from Dili, including about half of the city&#x27;s residents. Around 72,000 people ended up in camps, while 80,000 fled to rural areas. Rice prices in the city increased by half by October 2006, and then almost doubled again by February 2007. Foreign military intervention was needed to restore order.

A National Recovery Strategy was put in place following the 2007 national election to return these people. In 2008, around 30,000 people displaced from Dili remained in camps, while 70,000 continued to live with friends or family. Continuing unrest led to the attempted assassinations of the country&#x27;s president and prime minister. By 2009 most displaced people had returned to the city, and the camps were officially closed by the end of the year. However, some community tensions remained. In a couple of areas, there were two or three fights a week between opposing youth groups. Nonetheless, large-scale violence did not return. Mediation teams were utilised to assist in the resettlement of some displaced people to their previous homes.

In May 2009, the year-long &quot;Dili City of Peace&quot; campaign was launched by Jose Ramos-Horta. The initiative was created to build unity and prevent violence, with the 2006 East Timorese crisis in mind. The campaign included dialogues between different sectors of Timorese society, a cycling tour, a Dili marathon, and a reforestation initiative. Focusing the peace campaign on Dili reflects the influence it has on the entire country, with the government expecting its impacts would extend beyond the city itself. The &quot;Latelek&quot; (Bridge) Project was instituted from 2010 to 2012 by some organs of the Catholic Church to improve community cohesion, reintegrating previously displaced individuals with those who had remained. Other programs were initiated by the government and NGOs to tackle issues such as skills development, youth engagement, and women&#x27;s empowerment. Some sucos developed community laws to reduce violence.

The development of the city since independence has led to many sites being replaced or repurposed. In 2009 the area around the Indonesian-built Integration Monument was redesignated as the 5 May Park, the date upon which it was agreed East Timor could hold its independence referendum. A 1960s hotel, Hotel Turismo, which had been a site of independence activities, was demolished in 2010 and rebuilt. The former Dili regency police headquarters has been demolished and replaced by the cultural centre of the Indonesian embassy. By 2010 the municipal population reached 234,026 people, of which 210,250 lived in urban areas. In 2018 the population reached 281,000 people. During a period of COVID-19 restrictions, the city was hit by the worst flood in 50 years in April 2021.

==Geography==

Dili lies on the northern coast of the island of Timor, which is among the eastern Lesser Sunda Islands and lies in the UTC+9 timezone. Offshore is the Ombai Strait of the Savu Sea. To the south is the central mountain range running through Timor, which extends north to the coast on the west and east surrounding the core city. The underlying ground is predominately limestone and marine clay.

The precise location of the city is around 8°35′S, 125°36′E. The city lies mostly within the larger Dili Municipality, whose total area was when including Atauro Island, north of Dili, which was formerly part of the municipality before becoming a separate municipality on 1 January 2022. The municipalities bordering Dili are Aileu, Liquiçá, and Manatuto. The municipality contains 31 sucos, divided into 241 aldeias. The urban area of the city of Dili extends through four of the Dili Municipality&#x27;s Administrative Posts, Cristo Rei, Dom Aleixo, Nain Feto, and Vera Cruz. 18 sucos within these are considered urban, and this urban area is perhaps large. The wider urban area extends west into the Tibar suco of the Bazartete Administrative Post in the Liquiçá Municipality. The combined area of all sucos within the urban region is , however this includes terrain considered too steep for habitation, with only perhaps 37%, or , flat enough for development. As of 2014, only 25.5% of the total area was developed.
The main city lies within an area of flat lowlands of less than 100m altitude, mostly between 0 and 60m, and a slope under 15 degrees. This includes an alluvial plain, and a number of beaches line the coast. The soil underneath this plain is quaternary alluvium. The distance between the sea and the mountains reaches a maximum width of only , and the surrounding mountains slope near the city at angles of 20 degrees or higher. On either side of the core urban area are mountain ridges extending from the southern range to the coast, leading to urban development spilling over onto areas of flat land on the other sides of these spurs. Tibar lies on the opposite site of the western range, while Hera lies on the opposite side of the eastern range. Another spur encloses Hera on its east.

The Comoro River flows through the western side of the city, while the Bemorl and Benmauc Rivers join together in the East. The Maloa river lies between these. The Maucau river flows through Tibar, while the Akanunu and Mota Kiik rivers flow through Hera. The Comoro is the largest, with a drainage basin extending inland to a point where the mountains are high. The water level within these rivers differs greatly between the dry and wet seasons. Parts of the city are considered to face drought hazards and flooding risk from rivers, issues related to climate change. Within the main city of Dili (although not in Hera or Tibar), rivers have reinforced to contain a once-in-25-year flood. Small-scale flooding occurs in a minority of houses a few times each year, and reports of land subsidence are found throughout the city. The Maloa river is the most commonly flooded. Landslides have previously caused damage and loss of life. The area is thought to face earthquake and tsunami risks, although no major events have occurred. Air pollution is considered an increasing issue, with contributors including forest fires, wood-fuelled cooking, and vehicles.

===Ecology===

The landscape around Dili naturally supports dry deciduous forests. Common tree species include &quot;Sterculia foetida&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum teysmanii&quot;, and &quot;Aleurites moluccana&quot;. &quot;Eucalyptus alba&quot; is found in rocky areas, and palm and acacia trees are also found. The eucalyptus trees often serve as firewood, while nuts from &quot;A. moluccana&quot; are sometimes burnt to produce lighting. Trees found within urban areas include &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot;, &quot;Albizia julibrissin&quot;, &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot;, and a variety of fruit trees. While forests around the city have been damaged by harvesting for construction and firewood, the national government aims to reforest these areas. Large wildlife in these forests includes monkeys.

Mangrove species found along the coastline include the near-threatened &quot;Ceriops decandra&quot;. Coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and intertidal mudflats are also present. The coral reefs off Dili appear to be locally sheltered from the average sea surface temperature rise from climate change. However, they face some degradation from human activities. The seagrass beds support dugongs and sea turtles, while dolphins and whales are found offshore.

There are three protected biodiversity areas within Dili: Behau, Cristo Rei Protected Area, and Tasitolu. The Cristo Rei Protected Area lies on the mountains separating central Dili and Hera. The Tasitolu area lies near the border of the Dili and Liquiçá municipalities, and covers land and some coastal waters. It is being developed as a recreational site and holy area. The large Behau protected area covers much of the sea off eastern Dili, as well as coastal areas in Hera and to the east. Behau is the most recently proposed of the three areas, and the government is considering abolishing it and replacing it with smaller areas. BirdLife International has identified Cristo Rei Protected Area and Tastitolu as falling within Important Bird Areas. Development can occur in these areas with the approval of the national government. Near-threatened bird species found in these protected areas include the black cuckoo-dove, the pink-headed imperial pigeon, and the Timor sparrow.

===Climate===

Dili has a rather dry tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;). A rainy season lasts from November to April and a dry season from May to October. Rainfall is highest in December, averaging between 2005 and 2013, and lowest in August, averaging over the same time period. The overall average is annually, although there is significant variation between years.

Mean temperatures average around . This changes by throughout the day, from minimums at around to maximums at over . There are larger temperature changes during the dry season. Climate change is shifting weather patterns, and may exacerbate extreme weather events. The highest single recorded temperature in the city up to 2013 was in November 2011, while the lowest has been in August 2013.

===Buildings and monuments===

The old quarter of the city lies within what is now the city&#x27;s eastern half. The original Portuguese settlement occurred in a grid parallel to the shore, and the city has extended along this east-west axis. The older parts of the city are the most densely built up, with little available land. The western portion of the city is the location of the airport and has the most recent urban growth. Most infrastructure was destroyed in 1999, including 68,000 homes. Following rebuilding as of 2010, 71.6% of houses have concrete or brick walls. In Hera however, just over 50% of houses were mostly wooden as of 2014.

Land rights remain complicated and unresolved as a result of the 2006 crisis, with returns of former residents to the capital having been carried out on an ad-hoc basis. There are disputes between residents who claim land was taken from them by previous regimes, and the national government that has created what is seen as an expansive definition of state land. Developing a formal property system and land register is a key development goal. Those living in houses with this mixed ownership history, perhaps up to 50% of all residents, face heightened risk of eviction.

Important government buildings which form the core of the city are clustered around the Port of Dili. The outskirts of the city are the most recently developed, and grew organically without much urban planning. The central core (Bairro Central) contains most administrative buildings, and has the most buildings constructed with masonry. It retains many buildings that reflect Portuguese-era architecture. To the east of the central government area is the old Chinese area, which still retains a number of Chinese-influenced buildings.

Portuguese-era buildings are most common in the Motael, Gricenfor, and Bidau Lecidere sucos, often stretched along the main road running through the old part of the city, the . The main government complex is located at the Largo Infante Dom Henrique, next to the seafront. This location was part of the 1951 urban plan. The primary building here is the Government Palace, consists of three two-story buildings connected by a single arcade which were built at different periods between 1953 and 1969. 
Another old building is the former Market Hall.

The government has identified a number of heritage buildings in the city, especially in the old quarter. New buildings are being built to house cultural institutions. The Museum and Cultural Centre of Timor-Leste is tasked with hosting the country&#x27;s cultural artefacts. The National Library of Timor-Leste is intended to serve as both a library and a national archive.
Notable churches include the Motael Church, the oldest in the country, which became associated with resistance to Indonesian rule. The Immaculate Conception Cathedral was built with the intention of being the largest church in Southeast Asia. The Cristo Rei of Dili is a tall statue of Jesus situated on top of a globe at the end of the eastern Fatucama peninsula. It is positioned at the end of a Stations of the Cross pathway including over 500 steps. It was a present from the government of Indonesia during occupation for the 20th anniversary of East Timor&#x27;s integration into Indonesia. Its height reflects the symbolism of East Timor being Indonesia&#x27;s 27th province at the time of the monument&#x27;s construction in 1996.

The Integration Monument commemorates the Indonesian annexation of the territory in 1976. It takes the shape of a statue of an East Timorese warrior in traditional dress breaking the chains round his wrists, deliberate chosen to associate traditional Timorese identity with Indonesian rule. The monument has not been demolished, but is instead now regarded as representing the struggle against both periods of foreign rule.

The National Stadium has two seating stands, one on either side, with grass banks providing space for other spectators. It has a capacity of around 9,000 people. It is often used to host association football, the most popular sport in the country, although infrastructure issues mean the national team must sometimes play home games in other countries. In the past it has been used to host refugees and distribute aid.

==Administration==

Dili is the administrative centre of the Dili Municipality, serving as both the municipal and national capital. Dili itself does not not have a city government, but is governed centrally by the Dili Municipality, along with the Hera and Metinaro areas. The current president of the Dili Municipality Authority is Gregório da Cunha Saldanha, sworn in on 1 March 2024. The municipality has an elected mayor and council. 

Timor-Leste&#x27;s municipalities are divided into administrative posts, and each of these is divided into sucos. The central city of Dili is spread over four of the six administrative posts within Dili municipality: Cristo Rei, Dom Aleixo, Nain Feto, and Vera Cruz. The Hera suco is the easternmost suco of Cristo Rei. Tibar, to the west of the main city, is the easternmost suco of the Bazartete Administrative Post in the Liquiçá Municipality.

Each suco has a &quot;chefe&quot;. Those in Dili have less influence over community land than those elsewhere, however their elected status gives them greater authority in other areas. Each also has a head office. Municipal and national government buildings are concentrated in the city centre, mainly in the sucos of Caicori, Colmera, and Gricenfor. Sucos, administrative posts, and municipalities are all tasked with setting up a Disaster Management Committee. These are responsible for planning, public awareness, and disaster response. The borders of sucos, and the aldeias within them, are often undefined. Reasons for this include the history of displacement, and taboo over formal demarcation.

Land registration is difficult due to the city&#x27;s tumultuous history, and legal ownership is often unclear. It is thought that in 1999 existing land records were taken from Dili to Indonesia. The new government attempted to set up a system of rent, charging a small fee of $10 a month for those occupying state property. However, in many cases even this could not be paid. In 2003 the national government legislated that all previous state property, as well as abandoned properties, belonged to the state. It also set up a system of registration based on occupation. Residents can claim land they live in, if there are no objections from others. The 2006 crisis put an end to attempts to enforce rent. Evictions from state property are rare. A cadastral survey began in 2008. As of 2014, 70% of the land in Dili had been surveyed, although this information is not public. Despite this lack of information, most in the city claim ownership of their homes, with 90% of homes considered owned by an individual or by a family. Land valuation is often unclear.

The sucos within the four administrative posts in the western Dili Municipality that form the core city are as follows:

Cristo Rei
* Balibar
* Becora
* Bidau Santana
* Camea
* Culuhun
* Hera
* Metiaut

Dom Aleixo
* Bairro Pite
* Comoro
* Fatuhada
* Kampung Alor

Nain Feto
* Acadiruhun
* Bemori
* Bidau Lecidere
* Gricenfor
* Lahane Oriental
* Santa Cruz

Vera Cruz
* Caicoli
* Colmera
* Dare
* Lahane Ocidental
* Mascarenhas
* Motael
* Vila Verde

==Economy==

The economic situation in Dili is substantially better than that of the rest of the country, and most wealth is concentrated there. Almost all of the sucos of Dili are among those with the country&#x27;s highest living standards and the greatest access to public services. The Dili district as a whole has a higher significantly higher living standard than any other part of the country, and while poverty rates within the sucos of the municipality as a whole range from 8 to 80%, every suco within the city proper was ranked within the highest level of living standards. 57.8% of those in the capital are among those with relatively high levels of wealth, as opposed to 8.7% in rural areas.

In 2004 18,331 people were working in the agricultural sector, 1,885 in resources and manufacturing, 5,027 in hospitality, 3,183 in finance, real estate, and logistics, 6,520 in government services and security, 879 in home industries, 6,354 for international diplomatic bodies, and 2,142 unknown. By 2010, the tertiary sector employed 44% of those working, with government employment providing around 25% of jobs. The primary sector is slightly smaller than the government in terms of employment, while the secondary sector remains small. The working age population grew by almost 50% from 2004 to 2010, while unemployment declined from 26.9% to 17.4%. Nonetheless, youth unemployment in the municipality stood at 58% in 2007, above the national average of 43%. The capital attracts younger and educated individuals from the rest of the country.
The city lies within the government&#x27;s &quot;Northern Regional Development Corridor&quot;, which stretches along the coast from the Indonesia border to Baucau. Within this, it is part of the smaller &quot;Dili-Tibar-Hera&quot; area in which the government plans to develop the service sector. The city is also part of what is designated the central tourism zone. Sites related to important historical events are promoted, as well as eco-tourism. Whale watching is possible off the coast, and there are many scuba diving sites near the city. Some tourism and industrial complexes are being developed within the metropolitan area. There is a large informal economy that includes some of the officially unemployed residents.

Tourism numbers increased from 14,000 to 51,000 from 2006 to 2013. Half of visitors arriving at Dili&#x27;s airport come from three countries: Australia, Indonesia, and Portugal. Near the beginning of UN rule, there were at least 9 hotels with 550 rooms. As of 2012, there were at least 14 hotels in the city. Most hotels are run by local companies, with few international chains present. Nightly rates are relatively high for the region, partially due to a lack of sufficient tourists to benefit from economies of scale. Important hotels include Hotel Timor and Hotel Dili.

Most large investments come from the public sector, although there is a growing small-scale private sector. The Dili municipality is responsible for around 40% of the country&#x27;s fish production, most of which is consumed domestically. The country&#x27;s three significant commercial banks operate primarily in Dili.

The Port of Dili is the country&#x27;s largest. It handles the majority of international shipping. There are regular ships to Darwin (Australia), Kota Kinabalu (Malaysia), Surabaya (Indonesia), and Singapore, and less frequent shipping to and from other Indonesian ports. As of 2011, the port processed 200,000 tonnes of goods annually, which had increased by 20% each year for the previous six years. 80% of the goods processed are imports.

==Demographics==

The 2022 census found the population of the municipality was 324,269, of which 82.4% were urban. The municipality had the largest overall population and the highest growth rate since 2015, although average household size decreased from 6.4 to 5.7. The city contains almost twice as many dwellings as all other urban areas in the country combined. The municipality is the most densely populated in the country at 1,425 people per square kilometre, eight times denser than the second most densely populated municipality. and Dom Aleixo with 166 thousand people remained the country&#x27;s most populous administrative post. By 2030, the population of the municipality is predicted to reach around 580,000.

The gender ratio in 2022 was around 103 men for every 100 women, in line with the national average. The dependency ratio of 51 dependents for every 100 economically active individuals is much lower than elsewhere in the country, likely due to the in-migration of younger adults. Every other municipality in the country shows a net negative in-migration rate, leading Dili to gain 36.9% of its population through this in-migration. The literacy rate for those 10 and over was 89.6%. Only 5.4% of dwellings had piped water, a toilet, a bath or shower, and a kitchen.

Due to limited space, a small number of people settled in hilly and mountainous areas starting around 1990, especially in southern areas near the national highway. However, due to properties being abandoned following the independence vote, much settlement in the 21st century has been into these vacated areas. Population density tends to be higher in areas of unplanned settlement than in planned neighbourhoods.

The primary local language is Tetum, which was promoted during Portuguese rule and has become an official language of the country. Speakers from the other languages of Timor-Leste are present in the city, where the official language of Portuguese and the working languages of English and Indonesian are also spoken. A dialect of Malay-based creole called Dili Malay is spoken by perhaps 1,000 residents with ancestral links to Alor Island. Migration into the city has led to clustering of incoming migrants into areas with others of similar backgrounds.
==Education==

Education is more common in Dili Municipality than elsewhere in the country. The attendance rate at primary schools increased from 37% in 2004 to 73% in 2010. As of 2010, 86% of those five or older in the municipality had attended primary school, equivalent to the literacy rate. Within the metropolitan area, education rates are highest in Nain Feto and Vera Cruz, where 88% are either attending or have attended primary school. These are followed by Dom Alexio at 87%, and Cristo Rei at 81%. Tibar, lying outside of Dili Municipality, has the lowest at 75%.

As of 2013, there were 108 schools in Dili, Hera, and Tibar, including primary, secondary, and specialist schools. Of these, 61 were public and 47 private. This equated to 4.8 schools per 10,000 people. In 2011, 43% of students in the Dili municipality studied in private schools. Many private schools are run by the Catholic Church, for example, Don Bosco Training Center, including 32% of all schools in the Dili Municipality.
Seventy-six per cent of the country&#x27;s university students study in the municipality. This is responsible for some of the internal migration to the city. The National University of Timor-Leste created a &quot;University City&quot; master plan to develop the Hera area.
==Infrastructure==
Up to 70% of the country&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed in 1999, including almost the entire electrical grid, and much of the water infrastructure. Dili&#x27;s airport and port were rehabilitated in the six years following this, along with electricity and telecommunications. The rapid population growth of the city has put a strain on some of its infrastructure services. Pre-independence laws prohibiting building within of water bodies are not enforced, with population growth leading to structures such as housing being built in flood-prone areas, including along dry river beds and canals.

===Utilities===

====Electricity====

In the early years of UN rule, electricity was provided by the Comoro power station, which has a 16 MW diesel generator. By 2004, there were 23,000 connections in the city creating a demand of 12.5 MW. At the time, Dili was the only location in Timor-Leste with 24-hour electricity. Electricity demand peaked from 19:00 to 22:00. By 2009, Comoro was producing 32 MW, and by the year after that 92.3% of Dili&#x27;s households used electricity for lighting purposes. Cooking remained carried out using firewood by 66.2% of households, with electricity being used by just 10.1%. Non-payment of electricity bills has caused some funding problems. In 2011, only 40% of commercial recipients of electricity paid their electricity bills.

In November 2011, the diesel generators at the new Hera Power Station became operational, producing 119 MW. This replaced the operations of the Comoro station, with Hera able to produce electricity using 17% less fuel. A new substation was created to supply Dili, and transmission lines link Dili to other cities and towns along the northern coast, part of a ring surrounding the country. As of 2016, Dili&#x27;s peak power demand reached 42.11 MW. The development of electricity infrastructure since independence has significantly reduced electricity costs, which moved from 249c per kilowatt-hour in 2002 to 5c per kilowatt-hour in 2014.

====Telecommunications====

Telecommunications activity in the country is primarily carried out using mobile phones, with most of the country&#x27;s 3000 landlines found in Dili and used mainly for government and business. There are no submarine communications cables connecting to the country, so internet access is supplied via satellites. This is expensive, and internet usage nationally was only just above 1% in 2016. The government has approved the installation of the Timor-Leste South submarine Cable (TLSSC), connecting to Darwin in Australia, as well as another cable connecting to the Indonesian island of Alor. As of 2020, there were 3 telecommunications companies in the country: Telemor, Telkomcel, and Timor Telecom.

====Water and sanitation====

Access to clean water and sanitation is an issue for some households. Over $250 million was invested by the UN and other organisations to build Dili&#x27;s water infrastructure. Existing water sources and transportation infrastructure are considered sufficient to meet the immediate needs of the city, although work continues to improve quality and reliability. In 2007, 25% of residents received 24 hours of water. As of 2013, while 36% of households were connected to the water supply system, half Dili received less than six hours of water a day. Furthermore, water quality was irregular, with boiling advised. By 2015, it remained the case that less than 30% of those in Dili had access to a continuous water supply. In 2018, water remained available on average from 4 to 8 hours.

Water is managed by the National Directorate of Water and Sanitation Services (Dirasaun Nasional Sistema Agua no Saneamentu/DNSAS), which derives 60% of water supplies from groundwater. This groundwater extraction began in the 1980s, and accelerated after independence. Private entities also pump water from the aquifer without regulation. Despite the inconsistency of supply, 91% of those in urban areas have some access to safe drinking water, with sources including pumps, public taps, and wells and boreholes. Some households have tanks installed to alleviate the impact of service interruptions. Half of the city&#x27;s water comes from a local aquifer, and there are four water treatment plants at the southern edges of the city. Water tariffs were put in place in 2004, but were removed in 2006 following the 2006 East Timorese crisis. By 2010 of water was pumped from the aquifer each day, almost as fast as the aquifer could refill. Trials for water tariff re-introduction began in 2013. Increasing usage has led to the aquifer, the Dili Groundwater Basin, being unable to match demand during the dry season. An increasing number of wells has increased demand, while development altering drainage patterns has limited recharge rates. The aquifer is constrained by the ocean on one side and mountains on the others. Downstream areas also face saltwater intrusion.

Dili is the location of the country&#x27;s water testing laboratory, and thus its water quality is regularly monitored. The lack of manufacturing in the city is thought to have limited potential water pollution. However, pollution risks emerge from the common discharge of untreated household water, and leakage from latrine pits into the soil and relatively high water table. Water stores in households, as well as from some wells, has been found to have bacteriological contamination. As of 2010, only 16% of households emptied their latrine pits. Hera and Tibar lack water treatment plants, with residents relying on boreholes and delivery by water trucks. As of 2010, daily demand was 32,000 m3 in Dili proper, 520 m3 in Hera, and 220 m3 in Tibar.
Drainage infrastructure is insufficient to handle the wet season, with drains often being blocked and resultant flooding being common. This creates property damage and health concerns. Thirty-six water channels lie within the city in addition to its rivers. These often collect rainwater; however, the growing urbanisation of the city is reducing infiltration capacity, worsening flood risks. There is no city-wide sewerage system. As of 2010, only 30.3% of households had access to a sceptic tank. The most common sewage disposal system was pit latrines, which were used by 50.7% of households. Among households with toilets, 97% were flushed through the manual pouring of water. Wastewater is often collected from some areas by trucks. Some wastewater is treated in ponds in Tasitolu. Dili also has one of the country&#x27;s two septage treatment facilities. A Sanitation and Drainage Masterplan was created for the city in 2012, envisioning the creation of eight wastewater treatment systems in the city by 2025.

As of 2014, Dili produces 108 tons of solid waste per day, over half of which is biodegradable. The government-funded waste collection system covers Cristo Rei, Dom Aleixo, Nain Feto, and Vera Cruz, with waste being collected by a mixture of government trucks and private trucks contracted by the government. Collected waste is disposed in a landfill in Tibar, which was established during the Indonesian period. Metal collected by waste pickers is sold to Malaysia and Singapore for recycling, while some biodegradable waste is composted by a private company. Some waste is burnt. Waste collection schedules are variable, with some areas receiving daily collection and some receiving none. Collection is less frequent in Hera and Tibar than in Dili proper.

There are 14 hospitals around the Dili metropolitan area, nine in Dom Aleixo, three in Vera Cruz, one in Cristo Rei (in Hera), and one in Tibar. Dom Aleixo also has two health centres, with Cristo Rei having one health centre in Dili proper, and Nain Feto also having a health centre. The National Hospital of Timor-Leste is located in Dili, catering to primary and secondary health care. A specialist hospital is planned to be constructed by 2030 to deal with diseases, such as cancer, that are currently treated outside of the country.

===Transport===

====Land====

As of 2015, Dili Municipality had of roads, of which half were classified as National, District, or Urban. The roads heading into and out of Dili to the East and West carry over 1,000 non-motorbike vehicles daily. In addition to the Eastern and Western national roads, a third national road extends south from the city. Within Dili, there is rising congestion. Poor road quality is the most common cause of accidents and delays. Many roads are unpaved, and within the old quarter, streets are often one-way. The only four lane roads in the city are National Road A01 and Banana Road. As of 2016, there were four roundabouts and 11 intersections with traffic lights. Few routes travel along the east-west axis, and for most of the time since independence there was only one vehicular crossing across the Comoro river. This bridge was expanded from two lanes to four lanes in June 2013. The two-lane Hinode Bridge was opened upriver in September 2018, connecting Banana road to National Road No 03. It is expected that this bridge will also be expanded to four lanes in the future.

The usual form of public transportation within the city is the minibus, which are operated by private companies that purchase route franchises from the government. Each vehicle usually has a capacity of ten people. There are no formal schedules and few official bus stops. Fares are cheap, at $0.25. Dili is also served by a fleet of air-conditioned blue taxis, whose drivers are expected to speak Tetum and English.

Street names are in Portuguese, as are many official signs labelling locations. Tetum is used for more informational signage. English and Indonesian are rare in official signage, but are more common elsewhere. Chinese is used on some informal signage, while non-Tetum Timorese languages are not used. Even under Indonesian rule, during which the use of Portuguese was banned, Portuguese street names like &quot;Avenida Marechal Carmona&quot; remained unchanged, although they were prefixed with the Indonesian word &quot;Jalan&quot; or &#x27;road&#x27;.

====Sea====

The Port of Dili has a total berth length of . Depths alongside the berth range from to . This port was previously the only international cargo reception port in the country, but its capacity is insufficient to meet import needs. The Tibar Bay Port was thus planned to handle all cargo shipping, leaving the current Dili port to become a dedicated ferry terminal. Tibar Bay Port was expected to be built starting in 2015, and scheduled for opening in 2020. On 3 June 2016 the government signed a Public-private partnership agreement with Bolloré, giving the company a 30-year least on the new port. A construction tender was awarded to the China Harbour Engineering Company in December 2017. Construction began on 30 August 2019, with completion scheduled for August 2021. As of December 2020 construction was 42% complete, with delays including Chinese workers returning to China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The port was then expected to open in April 2022. The port received its first ships on 30 September that year, and was officially inaugurated on 30 November 2022.

A dry port has been created from the main Port of Dili, and there is a naval port in Hera. Cargo operations in Dili Port halted from 1 October 2022. A twice-weekly ferry service operates between Dili and Oecusse, and a ferry travels between Dili and Atauro once a week. The Dili Port serves as the main link for these locations with the rest of the country. These ferries deposit people and vehicles onto a slipway, rather than a dedicated berthing.

====Air====

The Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, named after independence leader Nicolau Lobato, is located in the city. It serves regular flights to Darwin (Australia), Denpasar (Indonesia), and Singapore. In 2014, it served 198,080 passengers and 172 tons of cargo. It has one runway, which is long and wide, lying above mean sea level. A lack of runway lighting prevents night-time landings, so the airport operates from 6 am to 6 pm. The passenger terminals were originally domestic terminals during the Indonesian period, leaving them ill-designed to handle international customs and immigration. Due to the size of the runway, only medium-sized planes such as the A310 and the B737 can be accommodated, and there is limited space for aircraft parking. The runway is constrained by the sea and the Comoro river, although there are plans to extend the runway through land reclamation and/or by bridging the river. A new international terminal is also planned. Despite this, it is thought the airport may be able to handle capacity requirement until 2030.

This is the only functioning international airport in Timor-Leste, though there are airstrips in Baucau, Suai and Oecusse used for domestic flights. Until recently, Dili&#x27;s airport runway has been unable to accommodate aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 or C-130 Hercules, but in January 2008, the Portuguese charter airline EuroAtlantic Airways operated a direct flight from Lisbon using a Boeing 757, carrying 140 members of the Guarda Nacional Republicana.

==Culture==
Within the city, cultural difference exist not only between different ethnolinguistic groups, but between more established residents of the city, and recent immigrants who retain different cultural practices. Legal traditions reflecting Portuguese and Indonesian rule do not always align with customary practices, such as in the recognition of marriages. Those who migrate internally into Dili retain cultural and identity links to their rural areas of origin, which are passed down through generations. Urban residents often return to rural areas for traditional ceremonies, especially during the dry season, and elections.

Local communities have important traditional houses, as well as sacred natural areas including specific trees, rocks, and wells, as well as a number of &quot;Uma Lulik&quot; (sacred houses). As in the rest of the country, village chiefs continue to have some influence in Dili&#x27;s communities. However, with suco populations being more diverse in Dili than in rural areas, suco chief power is not as established or effective. Community links are instead more common at aldeia levels, or even established through religious or economic links instead. New arrivals often settle near those from the same area of origin, leading Dili&#x27;s urban population to have formed into a patchwork of different communities. Migration back and forth from Dili to rural areas is not uncommon. Furthermore, while rural sucos are often somewhat culturally homogenous and linked by family relationship, these administrative boundaries do not map with the cultural settlement patterns of modern Dili.

There is some more homogeneity at the aldeia level due to families settling near relatives, although this is also not consistent. Aldeia nearer the outskirts, or in areas formerly populated by Indonesian civil servants, are both more densely populated and particularly heterogenous both ethnolinguistically and socioeconomically. In diverse aldeias, smaller communities sometimes develop with their own informal leadership. Some urban areas exhibit occupational or status-based segregation. Core urban areas are dominated by relatively wealthy families, often those that were considered mestiços or assimilados under Portuguese rule. Some aldeias mostly consist of those of foreign descent, or of transient students.

Dili contains a number of local and often youth collectivities. While sometimes described as gangs, many function more as social collectivities integrated into their local community. Such groups have a long history, many forming as an act of resistance against Indonesian rule. Some street art continues to reflect a theme of resistance. The composition of these groups often reflects areas of rural origin, and the broader East-West divide that exists within the country.

The national government has crafted a culture policy that includes the provision of cultural facilities in Dili and aims to have the city reflect diverse cultural influences. The development of cultural facilities has included the building up of cultural institutions such as libraries and museums, and the development of audio-visual multimedia centres through which information will be more accessible. The &quot;City of Peace&quot; campaign seeks to maintain stability in the capital by bringing youth together for common discussions and by promoting a shared sense of national pride. Large events in which locals can work together on shared goals and security services are given roles are important parts of this campaign. One important event is the Dili &quot;City of Peace&quot; marathon, first held in June 2010, following which it became an annual event. This includes a full marathon, a half marathon, and a seven-kilometre &quot;Run for Peace&quot;.

Dili had no cinema until 2011, when one opened in a new shopping centre known as Timor Plaza. The country&#x27;s first locally produced feature film, &quot;Beatriz&#x27;s War&quot;, was released a couple of years later. In 2019, the city hosted the first Dili International Film Festival, which was repeated in 2020. Radio is very popular, and the city has 13 FM radio stations.

<text>In topology, Urysohn&#x27;s lemma is a lemma that states that a topological space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed subsets can be separated by a continuous function.

Urysohn&#x27;s lemma is commonly used to construct continuous functions with various properties on normal spaces. It is widely applicable since all metric spaces and all compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. The lemma is generalised by (and usually used in the proof of) the Tietze extension theorem.

The lemma is named after the mathematician Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn.

==Discussion==

Two subsets formula_1 and formula_2 of a topological space formula_3 are said to be separated by neighbourhoods if there are neighbourhoods formula_4 of formula_1 and formula_6 of formula_2 that are disjoint. In particular formula_1 and formula_2 are necessarily disjoint.

Two plain subsets formula_1 and formula_2 are said to be separated by a continuous function if there exists a continuous function formula_12 from formula_3 into the unit interval formula_14 such that formula_15 for all formula_16 and formula_17 for all formula_18 Any such function is called a Urysohn function for formula_1 and formula_20 In particular formula_1 and formula_2 are necessarily disjoint.

It follows that if two subsets formula_1 and formula_2 are separated by a function then so are their closures. Also it follows that if two subsets formula_1 and formula_2 are separated by a function then formula_1 and formula_2 are separated by neighbourhoods.

A normal space is a topological space in which any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighbourhoods. Urysohn&#x27;s lemma states that a topological space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function.

The sets formula_1 and formula_2 need not be precisely separated by formula_31, i.e., it is not necessary and guaranteed that formula_32 and formula_33 for formula_34 outside formula_1 and formula_20 A topological space formula_3 in which every two disjoint closed subsets formula_1 and formula_2 are precisely separated by a continuous function is perfectly normal.

Urysohn&#x27;s lemma has led to the formulation of other topological properties such as the &#x27;Tychonoff property&#x27; and &#x27;completely Hausdorff spaces&#x27;. For example, a corollary of the lemma is that normal T1 spaces are Tychonoff.

==Formal statement==

A topological space formula_3 is normal if and only if, for any two non-empty closed disjoint subsets formula_1 and formula_2 of formula_43 there exists a continuous map formula_12 such that formula_45 and formula_46

==Proof sketch==

The proof proceeds by repeatedly applying the following alternate characterization of normality. If formula_3 is a normal space, formula_48 is an open subset of formula_3, and formula_50 is closed, then there exists an open formula_4 and a closed formula_6 such that formula_53. 

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be disjoint closed subsets of formula_3. The main idea of the proof is to repeatedly apply this characterization of normality to formula_1 and formula_58, continuing with the new sets built on every step. 

The sets we build are indexed by dyadic fractions. For every dyadic fraction formula_59, we construct an open subset formula_60 and a closed subset formula_61 of formula_3 such that:
* formula_63 and formula_64 for all formula_65,
* formula_66 for all formula_65,
* For formula_68, formula_69.
Intuitively, the sets formula_60 and formula_61 expand outwards in layers from formula_1:

: formula_73

This construction proceeds by mathematical induction. For the base step, we define two extra sets formula_74 and formula_75. 

Now assume that formula_76 and that the sets formula_77 and formula_78 have already been constructed for formula_79. Note that this is vacuously satisfied for formula_80. Since formula_3 is normal, for any formula_82, we can find an open set and a closed set such that

: formula_83

The above three conditions are then verified.

Once we have these sets, we define formula_84 if formula_85 for any formula_65; otherwise formula_87 for every formula_88, where formula_89 denotes the infimum. Using the fact that the dyadic rationals are dense, it is then not too hard to show that formula_31 is continuous and has the property formula_91 and formula_92 This step requires the formula_61 sets in order to work.

<doc id="49256" wikidata="Q935310" url="?curid=49256" title="Age of Earth">
<text>The age of Earth is estimated to be 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years This age may represent the age of Earth&#x27;s accretion, or core formation, or of the material from which Earth formed. This dating is based on evidence from radiometric age-dating of meteorite material and is consistent with the radiometric ages of the oldest-known terrestrial material and lunar samples.

Following the development of radiometric age-dating in the early 20th century, measurements of lead in uranium-rich minerals showed that some were in excess of a billion years old. The oldest such minerals analyzed to date—small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia—are at least 4.404 billion years old. Calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions—the oldest known solid constituents within meteorites that are formed within the Solar System—are 4.567 billion years old, giving a lower limit for the age of the Solar System.

It is hypothesised that the accretion of Earth began soon after the formation of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions and the meteorites. Because the time this accretion process took is not yet known, and predictions from different accretion models range from a few million up to about 100 million years, the difference between the age of Earth and of the oldest rocks is difficult to determine. It is also difficult to determine the exact age of the oldest rocks on Earth, exposed at the surface, as they are aggregates of minerals of possibly different ages.

== Development of modern geologic concepts ==


Studies of strata—the layering of rocks and soil—gave naturalists an appreciation that Earth may have been through many changes during its existence. These layers often contained fossilized remains of unknown creatures, leading some to interpret a progression of organisms from layer to layer.

Nicolas Steno in the 17th century was one of the first naturalists to appreciate the connection between fossil remains and strata. His observations led him to formulate important stratigraphic concepts (i.e., the &quot;law of superposition&quot; and the &quot;principle of original horizontality&quot;). In the 1790s, William Smith hypothesized that if two layers of rock at widely differing locations contained similar fossils, then it was very plausible that the layers were the same age. Smith&#x27;s nephew and student, John Phillips, later calculated by such means that Earth was about 96 million years old.

In the mid-18th century, the naturalist Mikhail Lomonosov suggested that Earth had been created separately from, and several hundred thousand years before, the rest of the universe. Lomonosov&#x27;s ideas were mostly speculative. In 1779 the Comte du Buffon tried to obtain a value for the age of Earth using an experiment: he created a small globe that resembled Earth in composition and then measured its rate of cooling. This led him to estimate that Earth was about 75,000 years old.

Other naturalists used these hypotheses to construct a history of Earth, though their timelines were inexact as they did not know how long it took to lay down stratigraphic layers. In 1830, geologist Charles Lyell, developing ideas found in James Hutton&#x27;s works, popularized the concept that the features of Earth were in perpetual change, eroding and reforming continuously, and the rate of this change was roughly constant. This was a challenge to the traditional view, which saw the history of Earth as dominated by intermittent catastrophes. Many naturalists were influenced by Lyell to become &quot;uniformitarians&quot; who believed that changes were constant and uniform.

==Early calculations==

In 1862, the physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin published calculations that fixed the age of Earth at between 20 million and 400 million years. He assumed that Earth had formed as a completely molten object, and determined the amount of time it would take for the near-surface temperature gradient to decrease to its present value. His calculations did not account for heat produced via radioactive decay (a then unknown process) or, more significantly, convection inside Earth, which allows the temperature in the upper mantle to remain high much longer, maintaining a high thermal gradient in the crust much longer. Even more constraining were Thomson&#x27;s estimates of the age of the Sun, which were based on estimates of its thermal output and a theory that the Sun obtains its energy from gravitational collapse; Thomson estimated that the Sun is about 20 million years old.
Geologists such as Lyell had difficulty accepting such a short age for Earth. For biologists, even 100 million years seemed much too short to be plausible. In Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution, the process of random heritable variation with cumulative selection requires great durations of time, and Darwin stated that Thomson&#x27;s estimates did not appear to provide enough time. According to modern biology, the total evolutionary history from the beginning of life to today has taken place since 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, the amount of time which passed since the last universal ancestor of all living organisms as shown by geological dating.

In a lecture in 1869, Darwin&#x27;s great advocate, Thomas Henry Huxley, attacked Thomson&#x27;s calculations, suggesting they appeared precise in themselves but were based on faulty assumptions. The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (in 1856) and astronomer Simon Newcomb (in 1892) contributed their own calculations of 22 and 18 million years, respectively, to the debate: they independently calculated the amount of time it would take for the Sun to condense down to its current diameter and brightness from the nebula of gas and dust from which it was born. Their values were consistent with Thomson&#x27;s calculations. However, they assumed that the Sun was only glowing from the heat of its gravitational contraction. The process of solar nuclear fusion was not yet known to science.

In 1892, Thomson was ennobled as Lord Kelvin in appreciation of his many scientific accomplishments. In 1895 John Perry challenged Kelvin&#x27;s figure on the basis of his assumptions on conductivity, and Oliver Heaviside entered the dialogue, considering it &quot;a vehicle to display the ability of his operator method to solve problems of astonishing complexity.&quot; Other scientists backed up Kelvin&#x27;s figures. Darwin&#x27;s son, the astronomer George H. Darwin, proposed that Earth and Moon had broken apart in their early days when they were both molten. He calculated the amount of time it would have taken for tidal friction to give Earth its current 24-hour day. His value of 56 million years was additional evidence that Thomson was on the right track. The last estimate Kelvin gave, in 1897, was: &quot;that it was more than 20 and less than 40 million year old, and probably much nearer 20 than 40&quot;. In 1899 and 1900, John Joly calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated salt from erosion processes and determined that the oceans were about 80 to 100 million years old.

==Radiometric dating==
===Overview===
By their chemical nature, rock minerals contain certain elements and not others; but in rocks containing radioactive isotopes, the process of radioactive decay generates exotic elements over time. By measuring the concentration of the stable end product of the decay, coupled with knowledge of the half life and initial concentration of the decaying element, the age of the rock can be calculated. Typical radioactive end products are argon from decay of potassium-40, and lead from decay of uranium and thorium. If the rock becomes molten, as happens in Earth&#x27;s mantle, such nonradioactive end products typically escape or are redistributed. Thus the age of the oldest terrestrial rock gives a minimum for the age of Earth, assuming that no rock has been intact for longer than Earth itself.

===Convective mantle and radioactivity===
The discovery of radioactivity introduced another factor in the calculation. After Henri Becquerel&#x27;s initial discovery in 1896, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium in 1898; and in 1903, Pierre Curie and Albert Laborde announced that radium produces enough heat to melt its own weight in ice in less than an hour. Geologists quickly realized that this upset the assumptions underlying most calculations of the age of Earth. These had assumed that the original heat of Earth and the Sun had dissipated steadily into space, but radioactive decay meant that this heat had been continually replenished. George Darwin and John Joly were the first to point this out, in 1903.

===Invention of radiometric dating===
Radioactivity, which had overthrown the old calculations, yielded a bonus by providing a basis for new calculations, in the form of radiometric dating.

Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy jointly had continued their work on radioactive materials and concluded that radioactivity was caused by a spontaneous transmutation of atomic elements. In radioactive decay, an element breaks down into another, lighter element, releasing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation in the process. They also determined that a particular isotope of a radioactive element decays into another element at a distinctive rate. This rate is given in terms of a &quot;half-life&quot;, or the amount of time it takes half of a mass of that radioactive material to break down into its &quot;decay product&quot;.

Some radioactive materials have short half-lives; some have long half-lives. Uranium and thorium have long half-lives and so persist in Earth&#x27;s crust, but radioactive elements with short half-lives have generally disappeared. This suggested that it might be possible to measure the age of Earth by determining the relative proportions of radioactive materials in geological samples. In reality, radioactive elements do not always decay into nonradioactive (&quot;stable&quot;) elements directly, instead, decaying into other radioactive elements that have their own half-lives and so on, until they reach a stable element. These &quot;decay chains&quot;, such as the uranium-radium and thorium series, were known within a few years of the discovery of radioactivity and provided a basis for constructing techniques of radiometric dating.

The pioneers of radioactivity were chemist Bertram B. Boltwood and physicist Rutherford. Boltwood had conducted studies of radioactive materials as a consultant, and when Rutherford lectured at Yale in 1904, Boltwood was inspired to describe the relationships between elements in various decay series. Late in 1904, Rutherford took the first step toward radiometric dating by suggesting that the alpha particles released by radioactive decay could be trapped in a rocky material as helium atoms. At the time, Rutherford was only guessing at the relationship between alpha particles and helium atoms, but he would prove the connection four years later.

Soddy and Sir William Ramsay had just determined the rate at which radium produces alpha particles, and Rutherford proposed that he could determine the age of a rock sample by measuring its concentration of helium. He dated a rock in his possession to an age of 40 million years by this technique. Rutherford wrote of addressing a meeting of the Royal Institution in 1904:

Rutherford assumed that the rate of decay of radium as determined by Ramsay and Soddy was accurate and that helium did not escape from the sample over time. Rutherford&#x27;s scheme was inaccurate, but it was a useful first step. Boltwood focused on the end products of decay series. In 1905, he suggested that lead was the final stable product of the decay of radium. It was already known that radium was an intermediate product of the decay of uranium. Rutherford joined in, outlining a decay process in which radium emitted five alpha particles through various intermediate products to end up with lead, and speculated that the radium–lead decay chain could be used to date rock samples. Boltwood did the legwork and by the end of 1905 had provided dates for 26 separate rock samples, ranging from 92 to 570 million years. He did not publish these results, which was fortunate because they were flawed by measurement errors and poor estimates of the half-life of radium. Boltwood refined his work and finally published the results in 1907.

Boltwood&#x27;s paper pointed out that samples taken from comparable layers of strata had similar lead-to-uranium ratios, and that samples from older layers had a higher proportion of lead, except where there was evidence that lead had leached out of the sample. His studies were flawed by the fact that the decay series of thorium was not understood, which led to incorrect results for samples that contained both uranium and thorium. However, his calculations were far more accurate than any that had been performed to that time. Refinements in the technique would later give ages for Boltwood&#x27;s 26 samples of 410 million to 2.2 billion years.

===Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating===
Although Boltwood published his paper in a prominent geological journal, the geological community had little interest in radioactivity. Boltwood gave up work on radiometric dating and went on to investigate other decay series. Rutherford remained mildly curious about the issue of the age of Earth but did little work on it.

Robert Strutt tinkered with Rutherford&#x27;s helium method until 1910 and then ceased. However, Strutt&#x27;s student Arthur Holmes became interested in radiometric dating and continued to work on it after everyone else had given up. Holmes focused on lead dating because he regarded the helium method as unpromising. He performed measurements on rock samples and concluded in 1911 that the oldest (a sample from Ceylon) was about 1.6 billion years old. These calculations were not particularly trustworthy. For example, he assumed that the samples had contained only uranium and no lead when they were formed.

More important research was published in 1913. It showed that elements generally exist in multiple variants with different masses, or &quot;isotopes&quot;. In the 1930s, isotopes would be shown to have nuclei with differing numbers of the neutral particles known as &quot;neutrons&quot;. In that same year, other research was published establishing the rules for radioactive decay, allowing more precise identification of decay series.

Many geologists felt these new discoveries made radiometric dating so complicated as to be worthless. Holmes felt that they gave him tools to improve his techniques, and he plodded ahead with his research, publishing before and after the First World War. His work was generally ignored until the 1920s, though in 1917 Joseph Barrell, a professor of geology at Yale, redrew geological history as it was understood at the time to conform to Holmes&#x27;s findings in radiometric dating. Barrell&#x27;s research determined that the layers of strata had not all been laid down at the same rate, and so current rates of geological change could not be used to provide accurate timelines of the history of Earth.

Holmes&#x27; persistence finally began to pay off in 1921, when the speakers at the yearly meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science came to a rough consensus that Earth was a few billion years old and that radiometric dating was credible. Holmes published &quot;The Age of the Earth, an Introduction to Geological Ideas&quot; in 1927 in which he presented a range of 1.6 to 3.0 billion years. No great push to embrace radiometric dating followed, however, and the die-hards in the geological community stubbornly resisted. They had never cared for attempts by physicists to intrude in their domain, and had successfully ignored them so far. The growing weight of evidence finally tilted the balance in 1931, when the National Research Council of the US National Academy of Sciences decided to resolve the question of the age of Earth by appointing a committee to investigate. 

Holmes, being one of the few people who was trained in radiometric dating techniques, was a committee member and in fact wrote most of the final report. Thus, Holmes&#x27; report concluded that radioactive dating was the only reliable means of pinning down a geologic time scale. Questions of bias were deflected by the great and exacting detail of the report. It described the methods used, the care with which measurements were made, and their error bars and limitations.

===Modern radiometric dating===
Radiometric dating continues to be the predominant way scientists date geologic time scales. Techniques for radioactive dating have been tested and fine-tuned on an ongoing basis since the 1960s. Forty or so different dating techniques have been utilized to date, working on a wide variety of materials. Dates for the same sample using these different techniques are in very close agreement on the age of the material. Possible contamination problems do exist, but they have been studied and dealt with by careful investigation, leading to sample preparation procedures being minimized to limit the chance of contamination.

====Use of meteorites====
An age of 4.55 ± 0.07 billion years, very close to today&#x27;s accepted age, was determined by Clair Cameron Patterson using uranium–lead isotope dating (specifically lead–lead dating) on several meteorites including the Canyon Diablo meteorite and published in 1956. The quoted age of Earth is derived, in part, from the Canyon Diablo meteorite for several important reasons and is built upon a modern understanding of cosmochemistry built up over decades of research.
Most geological samples from Earth are unable to give a direct date of the formation of Earth from the solar nebula because Earth has undergone differentiation into the core, mantle, and crust, and this has then undergone a long history of mixing and unmixing of these sample reservoirs by plate tectonics, weathering and hydrothermal circulation.

All of these processes may adversely affect isotopic dating mechanisms because the sample cannot always be assumed to have remained as a closed system, by which it is meant that either the parent or daughter nuclide (a species of atom characterised by the number of neutrons and protons an atom contains) or an intermediate daughter nuclide may have been partially removed from the sample, which will skew the resulting isotopic date. To mitigate this effect it is usual to date several minerals in the same sample, to provide an isochron. Alternatively, more than one dating system may be used on a sample to check the date.

Some meteorites are furthermore considered to represent the primitive material from which the accreting solar disk was formed. Some have behaved as closed systems (for some isotopic systems) soon after the solar disk and the planets formed. To date, these assumptions are supported by much scientific observation and repeated isotopic dates, and it is certainly a more robust hypothesis than that which assumes a terrestrial rock has retained its original composition.

Nevertheless, ancient Archaean lead ores of galena have been used to date the formation of Earth as these represent the earliest formed lead-only minerals on the planet and record the earliest homogeneous lead–lead isotope systems on the planet. These have returned age dates of 4.54 billion years with a precision of as little as 1% margin for error.

Statistics for several meteorites that have undergone isochron dating are as follows:

====Canyon Diablo meteorite====
The Canyon Diablo meteorite was used because it is both large and representative of a particularly rare type of meteorite that contains sulfide minerals (particularly troilite, FeS), metallic nickel-iron alloys, plus silicate minerals. This is important because the presence of the three mineral phases allows investigation of isotopic dates using samples that provide a great separation in concentrations between parent and daughter nuclides. This is particularly true of uranium and lead. Lead is strongly chalcophilic and is found in the sulfide at a much greater concentration than in the silicate, versus uranium. Because of this segregation in the parent and daughter nuclides during the formation of the meteorite, this allowed a much more precise date of the formation of the solar disk and hence the planets than ever before.

The age determined from the Canyon Diablo meteorite has been confirmed by hundreds of other age determinations, from both terrestrial samples and other meteorites. The meteorite samples, however, show a spread from 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago. This is interpreted as the duration of formation of the solar nebula and its collapse into the solar disk to form the Sun and the planets. This 50 million year time span allows for accretion of the planets from the original solar dust and meteorites.

The Moon, as another extraterrestrial body that has not undergone plate tectonics and that has no atmosphere, provides quite precise age dates from the samples returned from the Apollo missions. Rocks returned from the Moon have been dated at a maximum of 4.51 billion years old. Martian meteorites that have landed upon Earth have also been dated to around 4.5 billion years old by lead–lead dating. Lunar samples, since they have not been disturbed by weathering, plate tectonics or material moved by organisms, can also provide dating by direct electron microscope examination of cosmic ray tracks. The accumulation of dislocations generated by high energy cosmic ray particle impacts provides another confirmation of the isotopic dates. Cosmic ray dating is only useful on material that has not been melted, since melting erases the crystalline structure of the material, and wipes away the tracks left by the particles.

<text>Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) is a digital radio standard for broadcasting digital audio radio services in many countries around the world, defined, supported, marketed and promoted by the WorldDAB organisation. The standard is dominant in Europe and is also used in Australia, and in parts of Africa and Asia; as of 2022, 55 countries are actively running DAB broadcasts.

DAB was the result of a European research project and first publicly rolled out in 1995, with consumer-grade DAB receivers appearing at the start of this millennium. Initially it was expected in many countries that existing FM services would switch over to DAB, although the take up of DAB has been much slower than expected. , Norway is the first country to have implemented a national FM radio switch-off, with others to follow in the next years. In recent years, DAB has become the most popular radio listening platform in Norway, Switzerland and the UK, and has become a requirement for all new cars sold in the EU since 2021.

The original version of DAB used the MP2 audio codec; an upgraded version of the system was later developed and released named DAB+ which uses the HE-AAC v2 (AAC+) audio codec and is more robust and efficient. DAB is not forward compatible with DAB+. Today the majority of DAB broadcasts around the world are using the upgraded DAB+ standard, with only the UK, Romania, Brunei, and the Philippines still using a significant number of legacy DAB broadcasts.

DAB is generally more efficient in its use of spectrum than analogue FM radio, and thus can offer more radio services for the same given bandwidth. The broadcaster can select any desired sound quality, from high-fidelity signals for music to low-fidelity signals for talk radio, in which case the sound quality can be noticeably inferior to analog FM. High-fidelity equates to a high bit rate and higher transmission cost. DAB is more robust with regard to noise and multipath fading for mobile listening, although DAB reception quality degrades rapidly when the signal strength falls below a critical threshold (as is normal for digital broadcasts), whereas FM reception quality degrades slowly with the decreasing signal, providing more effective coverage over a larger area. DAB+ is a &quot;green&quot; platform and can bring up to 85 percent energy consumption savings compared to FM broadcasting (but analog tuners are more efficient than digital ones, and DRM+ has been recommended for small scale transmissions).

Similar terrestrial digital radio standards are HD Radio, ISDB-Tb, DRM, and the related DMB.

==History and development==
The DAB standard was initiated as a European research project called Eureka-147 in the 1980s. DAB has been under development since 1981 at the (IRT). The first DAB demonstrations were held in 1985 at the WARC-ORB in Geneva, and in 1988 the first DAB transmissions were made in Germany. Later, DAB was developed as a research project for the European Union (EUREKA), which started in 1987 on an initiative by a consortium formed in 1986. The MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (&quot;MP2&quot;) codec was created as part of the EU147 project. DAB was the first standard based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique, which since then has become one of the most popular transmission schemes for modern wideband digital communication systems.

A choice of audio codec, modulation and error-correction coding schemes and first trial broadcasts were made in 1990. Public demonstrations were made in 1993 in the United Kingdom. The protocol specification was finalized in 1993 and adopted by the ITU-R standardization body in 1994, the European community in 1995 and by ETSI in 1997. Pilot broadcasts were launched in 1995: the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) launched the first DAB channel in the world on 1 June 1995 (NRK Klassisk), and the BBC and Swedish Radio (SR) launched their first broadcasts later in September while in Germany a pilot broadcast started in Bavaria in October 1995. In the UK, commercial stations started broadcasting in November 1999.

For various reasons such as high receiver costs and limited reception, adoption of DAB had initially been slow, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark. In the UK, DAB radio receivers were high selling and 10% of households owned a DAB radio as of 2005, helped by local manufacturers creating affordable receivers such as the Pure Evoke. In countries where DAB did not take off, efforts were made in later years to &quot;re-launch&quot; it using the newer DAB+ standard: it started gaining traction throughout the 2010s and finally took off in countries like France by 2019. DAB adoption in automobiles became increasingly common during this time, and by 2016 it was standard in most cars sold in the UK, Norway and Switzerland.

In October 2005, the World DMB Forum instructed its Technical Committee to carry out the work needed to adopt the AAC+ audio codec and stronger error correction coding. The AAC+ audio coding standard uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio data compression algorithm. This work led to the launch of the DAB+ system.

Trials for DAB-IP were held in London in 2006, as &quot;BT Movio&quot;. It competed with DVB-H and MediaFLO which were also under testing.

By 2006, 500 million people worldwide were in the coverage area of DAB broadcasts, although by this time sales of receivers had only taken off in the United Kingdom (UK) and Denmark. In 2006 there were approximately 1,000 DAB stations in operation worldwide. As of 2018, over 68 million devices have been sold worldwide, and over 2,270 DAB services are on air.

In October 2018, the WorldDAB organisation introduced an all-new logo for DAB (specifically DAB+) to replace the previous logo that had been in use since before DAB&#x27;s initial launch in 1995.

===DAB+===

The term &quot;DAB&quot; most commonly refers both to a specific DAB standard using the MP2 audio codec, but can sometimes refer to a whole family of DAB-related standards, such as DAB+, DMB, and DAB-IP.

WorldDAB, the organisation in charge of the DAB standards, announced DAB+, a major upgrade to the DAB standard in 2006, when the HE-AAC v2 audio codec (also known as eAAC+) was adopted. AAC+ uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) algorithm. The new standard, which is called DAB+, has also adopted the MPEG Surround audio format and stronger error correction coding in the form of Reed–Solomon coding. DAB+ has been standardised as European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) TS 102 563.

As DAB is not forward compatible with DAB+, older DAB receivers cannot receive DAB+ broadcasts. However, DAB receivers that were capable of receiving the new DAB+ standard after a firmware upgrade were being sold as early as July 2007. Generally, if a receiver is DAB+ compatible, there will be a sign on the product packaging.

DAB+ broadcasts have launched in several countries like Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong (now terminated), Italy, Malta, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Belgium (October 2017), the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Malta was the first country to launch DAB+ in Europe in October 2008. South Africa began a DAB+ technical pilot in November 2014 on channel 13F in Band 3. If DAB+ stations launch in established DAB countries, they can transmit alongside existing DAB stations that use the older MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio format, and most existing DAB stations are expected to continue broadcasting until the vast majority of receivers support DAB+.

In the UK, DAB+ launched in January 2016 following a trial period starting September 2014. Ofcom published a consultation for a new national multiplex containing a mix of DAB and DAB+ services, with the intention of moving all services to DAB+ in the long term. In February 2016, the new national network Sound Digital launched with three DAB+ stations. In August 2021 the BBC started its first regular domestic broadcast of DAB+ in the Channel Islands and followed later with the start of local broadcasts in December 2021 in Cumbria and north Lancashire. Classic FM changed from DAB to DAB+ on 1 January 2024.

===DMB===

Digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) and DAB-IP are both suitable for mobile radio and TV because they support MPEG 4 AVC and WMV9 respectively as video codecs. However, a DMB video subchannel can easily be added to any DAB transmission, as it was designed to be carried on a DAB subchannel. DMB broadcasts in South Korea carry conventional MPEG 1 Layer II DAB audio services alongside their DMB video services.

, DMB is currently broadcast in Norway, South Korea, and Thailand.

==Countries using DAB==
Fifty-five countries provide regular or trial DAB(+) broadcasts. In spectrum management, the bands that are allocated for public DAB services, are abbreviated with T-DAB.

In the European Union, &quot;the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) entered into force on 20 December 2018, with transposition into national legislation by Member States required by 21 December 2020. The Directive applies to all EU member states regardless of the status of DAB+ in each country. 
This means that since the end of 2020, across all EU countries, all radios in new cars must be capable of receiving and reproducing digital terrestrial radio.&quot;

Following the European Union&#x27;s obligation in 2020 to include DAB+ receivers in new cars, Belgium has stopped all sales of analogue radio receivers from 1 January 2023. Thus, consumers are no longer able to purchase AM or FM receivers for domestic use. &quot;The obligation to incorporate DAB+ for new cars and domestic radio receivers is a nice step ahead in the digitisation of our radio landscape,&quot; commented Benjamin Dalle, the Flemish media minister.

===FM to DAB(+) radio transition===

====Norway====
Norway was the first country to announce a complete switch-off of national FM radio stations. The switch-off started on 11 January 2017 and ended on 13 December 2017. The 2017 switch-off did not affect some local and regional radio stations. They can continue to transmit on FM until 2027.

The timetable for the closure of FM signals in 2017 were as follows:
* 11 January in Nordland (all radio)
* 8 February in Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal (NRK Radio)
* 21 April in Trøndelag and Møre og Romsdal (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 26 April in Telemark, Buskerud, Hedmark and Oppland (NRK)
* 16 June in Telemark, Buskerud, Hedmark and Oppland (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 21 June in Sogn og Fjordane, Hordaland, Rogaland and Agder (NRK)
* 15 September in Sogn og Fjordane, Hordaland, Rogaland and Agder (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 20 September in Østfold, Vestfold, Oslo and Akershus (NRK)
* 8 December in Østfold, Vestfold, Oslo and Akershus (P4, Radio Norge and local radio)
* 13 December in Troms and Finnmark (all radio)

====Switzerland====
SRG SSR, Switzerland&#x27;s public-service broadcaster, had shut down its FM transmission infrastructure on 31 December 2024. The corporation concluded that maintaining FM broadcasts along with DAB+ and Internet streaming was no longer cost-effective, as due to widespread adoption of DAB+ the share of the public relying exclusively on FM was under ten percent and decreasing. All other FM broadcasters in the country must shut down or convert to DAB+ by 31 December 2026.

====Other countries====
* The small island country, Malta was the first European country to roll out a DAB+ network and services have been on-air since 2008. It covers 100% of the population.
*In Italy, Rai Radio is proposing the country to begin switching off FM transmitters starting in 2025 with the goal of being all digital and shuttering FM broadcasting entirely in 2030. In the northern region of Italy&#x27;s South Tyrol - Alto Adige, the broadcaster RAS has started switching FM services off.
*&quot;The government of Denmark has proposed a closure of FM broadcasting two years after more than half of radio listening is digital.&quot;
*In Sweden, &quot;the regulator MPRT has been commissioned by the Swedish government to review the conditions for commercial radio in the longer term (Ku 2021/01993). In dialogue with relevant actors, including the industry, the authority plans to analyse the need for any changes in the regulations for licensing with the aim of submitting a final report to the Ministry of Culture by December 2022.&quot; As of August 2023, DAB signals are only broadcast in the greater Stockholm-Uppsala region, Göteborg, Malmö, Luleå, and Piteå, with no known plans from any of the 3 broadcast licence companies to extend coverage to other regions. Parts of Helsingborg receives signals from Denmark, while Strömstad receives signals from Norway.
*In the United Kingdom, the government agreed with the Digital Radio and Audio Review&#x27;s main conclusion that there should be no formal switch-off of analogue radio services before 2030 at the earliest, and notes that the ongoing decline of analogue listening makes it appropriate to consider updating elements of the legislative framework to support a smooth transition of services away from analogue in due course. Government also agreed that government and industry should look at this again in 2026.
*In Poland, following consultations the KRRiT has adopted a position on the end of analogue radio broadcasting &quot;no earlier than 31 December 2026 and no later than 31 December 2030&quot;.
*In the Netherlands, the expectations are about official switch off of FM radio between 2027 and 2032.
*Belgium has also expressed readiness to switch to DAB broadcasting: &quot;Flemish Minister of Media Benjamin Dalle expects that the final shutdown of the FM frequencies, the so-called &#x27;switch off&#x27;, will take place between 2028 and 2031. According to him, the VRT must be a forerunner in the digitisation of the radio landscape. For example, if the &#x27;switch off&#x27; does not come on January 1, 2028, it may be an option, according to Dalle, to fully digitise one of the VRT channels.&quot;
*Moldova will abandon FM radio and switch to digital radio, according to an announcement made by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development.
*Germany has not yet reached an agreement for full digital terrestrial radio transition, instead the country intensely invests in DAB+ transmission sites development and simultaneous DAB+/FM broadcasting. Speculations of a possible switch off is in 2033. The national broadcaster &quot;Deutschlandradio&quot; has already started switching off its FM transmitions in some regions as of July 2024.
*In the Czech Republic, the situation is similar as in Germany: plans are for simultaneous DAB+/FM broadcasting.
*In Estonia, radio stations with Levira&#x27;s support started testing digital radio frequencies in November 2022. &quot;One of our objectives for the coming year is to create the necessary technical conditions for the development of digital radio,&quot; said Oliver Gailan, head of the communications department of the country&#x27;s consumer protection and technical regulatory authority, the TTJA.
*In Haute-Vienne, a department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in southwest-central France, since 6 December 2022, the Groupement de radios associatives libres en Limousin (Gral), has swapped the traditional FM broadcasting for DAB+.

===Countries where FM to DAB(+) radio transition is cancelled/postponed===
Whilst many countries have expected a shift to digital audio broadcasting, a few have moved in the opposite direction following unsuccessful trials.

*Canada conducted trials of DAB in L-band in major cities. However the success of satellite digital radio and lack of L-band DAB receivers led to the analogue switch-off being abandoned. Canada subsequently adopted HD Radio as used in the neighbouring United States instead of DAB.
*Finland abandoned DAB in 2005.
*Hong Kong announced the termination of DAB in March 2017.
*Portugal announced the termination of DAB in April 2011.
* In Korea, the transmission of MBC 11FM was stopped in 2015 and the DAB channel was switched to T-DMB V-Radio.
* DAB in Ireland was confined from 2017 to state broadcaster RTÉ Radio&#x27;s multiplex, which was switched off in March 2021, after a survey showed 77% of adults listen to radio via FM, compared with 8% via digital means, of which 0.5% via DAB. RTÉ&#x27;s service began in 2006, after trials in 1998 and 2001. A commercial multiplex was trialled in 2007–8 and licensed, including DAB+, from 2010 to 2017, but the licensee did not renew because of lack of takeup by broadcasters.
*Hungary announced the termination of DAB+ on 5 September 2020, 12 years after its start.
*Romania switched off DAB broadcast in September 2021 due to lack of interest both from broadcasters and listeners, low availability of receivers, low number of listeners and higher acceptance and interest in internet radio and FM. Romania started DAB broadcast in 2004, in the DAB format, did not adopt DAB+, and ever since the interest was low. It was only available in Bucharest, only public stations were available, although some private stations made some trials. DAB listeners were still in lower counts. Availability of DAB radios in stores was (and still is) low, and, despite the fact that some stores were offering DAB receivers, the interest remains limited (both because of lack of interest, higher price than an ordinary FM receiver and people are willing to pay the higher price for an internet device), most preferring internet radios or combined systems (devices with both FM and internet, although many such devices also have DAB capability, which is now rendered useless).
*Sweden The Swedish government postponed the transition to DAB in 2016, following a report from the National Audit Office which criticized the benefits for the listeners compared to continued FM-transmissions paired other digital transmission techniques (4G, Internet) and the strength of FM-radio as a simple and reliable source for emergency/crisis information. Limited transmissions continue in Stockholm, Göteborg, Malmö and Luleå
*New Zealand started a DAB+ trial with transmitters broadcasting on Band III in Auckland and Wellington in 2006. Uptake for the service was very low, and the trial ended in 2018.

==Technology==
===Bands and modes===
DAB uses a wide-bandwidth broadcast technology and typically spectra have been allocated for it in Band III (174–240 MHz) and L band (1.452–1.492 GHz), although the scheme allows for operation between 30 and 300 MHz. The US military has reserved L-Band in the USA only, blocking its use for other purposes in America, and the United States has reached an agreement with Canada to restrict L-Band DAB to terrestrial broadcast to avoid interference.

; Current mode:
* Mode I for Band III, Earth

In January 2017, an updated DAB specification (2.1.1) removed Modes II, III and IV, leaving only Mode I.
; Former modes:
* Mode II for L-Band, Earth and satellite
* Mode III for frequencies below 3 GHz, Earth and satellite
* Mode IV for L-Band, Earth and satellite

===Protocol stack===
From an OSI model protocol stack viewpoint, the technologies used on DAB inhabit the following layers: the audio codec inhabits the presentation layer. Below that is the data link layer, in charge of statistical time-division multiplexing and frame synchronization. Finally, the physical layer contains the error-correction coding, OFDM modulation, and dealing with the over-the-air transmission and reception of data. Some aspects of these are described below.

====Audio codec====
DAB initially only used the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio codec, which is often referred to as &quot;MP2&quot; because of the ubiquitous MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III).

The newer DAB+ standard adopted the LC-AAC and HE-AAC, including its version 2 audio codecs, commonly known as &quot;AAC&quot;, &quot;AAC+&quot; or &quot;aacPlus&quot;. AAC+ uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) algorithm, and is approximately three times more efficient than MP2, which means that broadcasters using DAB+ are able to provide far higher audio quality or far more stations than they could with DAB, or a combination of both higher audio quality and more stations.

One of the most important decisions regarding the design of a digital radio broadcasting system is the choice of which audio codec to use because the efficiency of the audio codec determines how many radio stations can be carried on a fixed capacity multiplex at a given level of audio quality.

====Error-correction coding====
Error-correction coding (ECC) is an important technology for a digital communication system because it determines how robust the reception will be for a given signal strength – stronger ECC will provide a more robust reception than a weaker form.

The old version of DAB uses punctured convolutional coding for its ECC. The coding scheme uses unequal error protection (UEP), which means that parts of the audio bit-stream that are more susceptible to errors causing audible disturbances are provided with more protection (i.e. a lower code rate) and vice versa. However, the UEP scheme used on DAB results in a grey area in between the user experiencing good reception quality and no reception at all, as opposed to the situation with most other wireless digital communication systems that have a sharp &quot;digital cliff&quot;, where the signal rapidly becomes unusable if the signal strength drops below a certain threshold. When DAB listeners receive a signal in this intermediate strength area they experience a &quot;burbling&quot; sound which interrupts the playback of the audio.

The DAB+ standard incorporates Reed–Solomon ECC as an &quot;inner layer&quot; of coding that is placed around the byte interleaved audio frame but inside the &quot;outer layer&quot; of convolutional coding used by the original DAB system, although on DAB+ the convolutional coding uses equal error protection (EEP) rather than UEP since each bit is equally important in DAB+. This combination of Reed–Solomon coding as the inner layer of coding, followed by an outer layer of convolutional coding – so-called &quot;concatenated coding&quot; – became a popular ECC scheme in the 1990s, and NASA adopted it for its deep-space missions. One slight difference between the concatenated coding used by the DAB+ system and that used on most other systems is that it uses a rectangular byte interleaver rather than Forney interleaving in order to provide a greater interleaver depth, which increases the distance over which error bursts will be spread out in the bit-stream, which in turn will allow the Reed–Solomon error decoder to correct a higher proportion of errors.

The ECC used on DAB+ is far stronger than is used on DAB, which, with all else being equal (i.e., if the transmission powers remained the same), would translate into people who currently experience reception difficulties on DAB receiving a much more robust signal with DAB+ transmissions. It also has a far steeper &quot;digital cliff&quot;, and listening tests have shown that people prefer this when the signal strength is low compared to the shallower digital cliff on DAB.

====Modulation====
Immunity to fading and inter-symbol interference (caused by multipath propagation) is achieved without equalization by means of the OFDM and DQPSK modulation techniques. For details, see the OFDM system comparison table.

Using values for Transmission Mode I (TM I), the OFDM modulation consists of 1,536 subcarriers that are transmitted in parallel. The useful part of the OFDM symbol period is 1.0 ms, which results in the OFDM subcarriers each having a bandwidth of 1 kHz due to the inverse relationship between these two parameters, and the overall OFDM channel bandwidth is 1.537 MHz. The OFDM guard interval for TM I is 0.246 ms, which means that the overall OFDM symbol duration is 1.246 ms. The guard interval duration also determines the maximum separation between transmitters that are part of the same single-frequency network (SFN), which is approximately 74 km for TM I.

====Single-frequency networks====
OFDM allows the use of single-frequency networks (SFN), which means that a network of transmitters can provide coverage to a large area – up to the size of a country – where all transmitters use the same transmission frequency block. Transmitters that are part of an SFN need to be very accurately synchronised with other transmitters in the network, which requires the transmitters to use very accurate clocks.

When a receiver receives a signal that has been transmitted from the different transmitters that are part of an SFN, the signals from the different transmitters will typically have different delays, but to OFDM they will appear to simply be different multipaths of the same signal. Reception difficulties can arise, however, when the relative delay of multipaths exceeds the OFDM guard interval duration, and there are frequent reports of reception difficulties due to this issue when propagation conditions change, such as when there&#x27;s high pressure, as signals travel farther than usual, and thus the signals are likely to arrive with a relative delay that is greater than the OFDM guard interval.

Low power &quot;gap-filler&quot; transmitters can be added to an SFN as and when desired in order to improve reception quality, although the way SFNs have been implemented in the UK up to now they have tended to consist of higher power transmitters being installed at main transmitter sites in order to keep costs down.

====Bit rates====
An ensemble has a maximum bit rate that can be carried, but this depends on which error protection level is used. However, all DAB multiplexes can carry a total of 864 &quot;capacity units&quot;. The number of capacity units, or CU, that a certain bit-rate level requires depends on the amount of error correction added to the transmission, as described above. In the UK, most services transmit using &#x27;protection level three&#x27;, which provides an average ECC code rate of approximately , equating to a maximum bit rate per multiplex of 1,184 kbit/s.

===Services and ensembles===
Various different services are embedded into one ensemble (which is also typically called a multiplex). These services can include:
* Primary services, like main radio stations
* Secondary services, like additional sports commentaries
* Data services
** Electronic Programme Guide (EPG)
** Collections of HTML pages and digital images (known as &#x27;broadcast websites&#x27;)
** Slideshows, which may be synchronised with audio broadcasts. For example, a police appeal could be broadcast with the e-fit of a suspect or CCTV footage.
** Video
** Java platform applications
** IP tunnelling
** Other raw data

==DAB and AM/FM compared==

Traditionally, radio programmes were broadcast on different frequencies via AM and FM, and the radio had to be tuned into each frequency as needed. This used up a comparatively large amount of spectrum for a relatively small number of stations, limiting listening choice. DAB is a digital radio broadcasting system that, through the application of multiplexing and compression, combines multiple audio streams onto a relatively narrow band centred on a single broadcast frequency called a DAB ensemble.

Within an overall target bit rate for the DAB ensemble, individual stations can be allocated different bit rates. The number of channels within a DAB ensemble can be increased by lowering average bit rates, but at the expense of the quality of streams. Error correction under the DAB standard makes the signal more robust but reduces the total bit rate available for streams.

===FM HD Radio versus DAB===
DAB broadcasts a single multiplex that is approximately 1.5 MHz wide (≈1,000 kilobits per second). That multiplex is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9 and 12 programs. In contrast, FM HD Radio adds its digital carriers to the traditional 270 kilohertz-wide analog channels, with capability of up to 300 kbit/s per station (pure digital mode). The full bandwidth of the hybrid mode approaches 400 kHz.

The first generation DAB uses the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) audio codec, which has less efficient compression than newer codecs. The typical bitrate for DAB stereo programs is only 128 kbit/s or less and as a result most radio stations on DAB have a lower sound quality than FM, prompting complaints from listeners. As with DAB+ or T-DMB in Europe, FM HD Radio uses a codec based upon the MPEG-4 HE-AAC standard.

HD Radio is a proprietary system from iBiquity Digital Corporation, a subsidiary of DTS, Inc. since 2015, which is itself owned by Xperi Corporation since 2016. DAB is an open standard deposited at ETSI.

===Use of frequency spectrum and transmitter sites===
DAB can give substantially higher spectral efficiency, measured in programmes per MHz and per transmitter site, than analogue systems. In many places, this has led to an increase in the number of stations available to listeners, especially outside of the major urban areas. This can be further improved with DAB+ which uses a much more efficient codec, allowing a lower bitrate per channel with little to no loss in quality. If some stations transmit in mono, their bitrate can be reduced compared to stereo broadcasts, further improving the efficiency.

Numerical example: Analog FM requires 0.2 MHz per programme. The frequency reuse factor in most countries is approximately 15 for stereo transmissions (with lesser factors for mono FM networks), meaning (in the case of stereo FM) that only one out of 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2 MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536 MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26 MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26 MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25 MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.

Note the above capacity improvement may not always be achieved at the L-band frequencies, since these are more sensitive to obstacles than the VHF band II frequencies, and may cause shadow fading for hilly terrain and for indoor communication. The number of transmitter sites or the transmission power required for full coverage of a country may be rather high at these frequencies, to avoid the system becoming noise limited rather than limited by co-channel interference.

==Sound quality==

The original objectives of converting to digital transmission were to enable higher audio fidelity, more stations and more resistance to noise, co-channel interference and multipath than in analogue FM radio. The improved sound quality is achieved by using CRC and FEC technology, which improves the transmission performance of digital signals. However, many countries in implementing DAB on stereo radio stations use compression to such a degree that it produces lower sound quality than that received from FM broadcasts. This is because of the bit rate levels being too low for the MPEG Layer 2 audio codec to provide high fidelity audio quality.

The BBC Research &amp; Development department states that at least 192 kbit/s is necessary for a high fidelity stereo broadcast:

When the BBC reduced the bit-rate of transmission of its classical music station Radio 3 from 192 kbit/s to 160 kbit/s in July 2006, the resulting degradation of audio quality prompted a number of complaints to the corporation. The BBC later announced that following this testing of new equipment, it would resume the previous practice of transmitting Radio 3 at 192 kbit/s whenever there were no other demands on bandwidth. (For comparison, BBC Radio 3 and all other BBC radio stations are streamed online using AAC at 320 kbit/s, described as &#x27;HD&#x27;, on BBC Radio iPlayer after a period when it was available at two different bit rates.)

Despite the above, a survey in 2007 of DAB listeners (including mobile) has shown most find DAB to have equal or better sound quality than FM.

By 2019, some stations had upgraded to DAB+ but rather than improving sound quality, they instead reduced it to 32 kbit/s or 64 kbit/s, often in mono.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
===Benefits of DAB===
====Improved features for users====
DAB devices perform band-scans over the entire frequency range, presenting all stations from a single list for the user to select from.

DAB is capable of providing metadata alongside the audio stream. Metadata allows visual information, text and graphics - such as the station name and logo, presenter, song title and album artwork - to be displayed while a station is playing. Radio stations can provide the metadata to augment the listening experience, particularly on car receivers which have large display panels.

DAB can carry &quot;radiotext&quot; (in DAB terminology, &quot;Dynamic Label Segment&quot;, or DLS) from the station giving real-time information such as song titles, music type and news or traffic updates, of up to 128 characters in length. This is similar to a feature of FM called RDS, which enables a radiotext of up to 64 characters.

The DAB transmission contains a local time of day and so a device may use this to automatically correct its internal clock when travelling between time zones and when changing to or from Daylight Saving.

====More stations====
DAB is not more bandwidth efficient than analogue measured in programmes per MHz of a specific transmitter (the so-called link spectral efficiency), but it is less susceptible to co-channel interference (cross talk), which makes it possible to reduce the reuse distance, i.e. use the same radio frequency channel more densely. The system spectral efficiency (the average number of radio programmes per MHz and transmitter) is a factor three more efficient than analogue FM for local radio stations. For national and regional radio networks, the efficiency is improved by more than an order of magnitude due to the use of SFNs. In that case, adjacent transmitters use the same frequency.

In certain areas – particularly rural areas – the introduction of DAB gives radio listeners a greater choice of radio stations. For instance, in Southern Norway, radio listeners experienced an increase in available stations from 6 to 21 when DAB was introduced in November 2006.

====Reception quality====
The DAB standard integrates features to reduce the negative consequences of multipath fading and signal noise, which afflict existing analogue systems.

Also, as DAB transmits digital audio, there is no hiss with a weak signal, which can happen on FM. However, radios in the fringe of a DAB signal can experience a &quot;bubbling mud&quot; sound interrupting the audio or the audio cutting out altogether.

Due to sensitivity to Doppler shift in combination with multipath propagation, DAB reception range (but not audio quality) is reduced when travelling speeds of more than 120 to 200 km/h, depending on carrier frequency.

====Variable bandwidth====
Mono talk radio, news and weather channels and other non-music programs need significantly less bandwidth than a typical music radio station, which allows DAB to carry these programmes at lower bit rates, leaving more bandwidth to be used for other programs.

However, this led to the situation where some stations are being broadcast in mono; see &quot;&quot; for more details.

====Transmission costs====
DAB transmitters are inevitably more expensive than their FM counterparts. DAB uses higher frequencies than FM and therefore there may be a need to compensate with more transmitters to achieve the same coverage as a single FM transmitter. DAB is commonly transmitted by a different company from the broadcaster who then sells the capacity to a number of radio stations. This shared cost can work out cheaper than operating an individual FM transmitter.

This efficiency originates from the ability a DAB network has in broadcasting more channels per transmitter/network. One network can broadcast 6–10 channels (with MP2 audio codec) or 10–18 channels (with HE AAC codec). Hence, it is thought that the replacement of FM-radios and FM-transmitters with new DAB-radios and DAB-transmitters will not cost any more compared with new FM facilities. It is also argued that the power consumption will be lower for stations transmitted on a single DAB multiplex compared with individual analog transmitters.

Once applied, one operator has claimed that DAB transmission is as low as one-nineteenth of the cost of FM transmission.

===Disadvantages of DAB===

====Reception quality====
The reception quality during the early stage of deployment of DAB was poor even for people who live well within the coverage area. The reason for this is that DAB uses weak error correction coding, so that when there are a lot of errors with the received data not enough of the errors can be corrected and a &quot;bubbling mud&quot; sound occurs. In some cases a complete loss of signal can happen. This situation has been improved upon in the newer DAB+ version that uses stronger error correction coding and as additional transmitters are built.

As with other digital systems, when the signal is weak or suffers severe interference, it will not work at all. DAB reception may also be a problem for receivers when the wanted signal is adjacent to a stronger one. This was a particular issue for early and low cost receivers.

====Audio quality====
Up to the mid-2010s, a common complaint by listeners is that broadcasters &#x27;squeeze in&#x27; more stations per ensemble than recommended by:
*Minimizing the bit-rate, to the lowest level of sound-quality that listeners are willing to tolerate, such as 112 kbit/s for stereo and even 48 kbit/s for mono speech radio (LBC 1152 and the Voice of Russia are examples).
*Having few digital channels broadcasting in stereo.

====Signal delay====
The nature of a single-frequency network (SFN) is such that the transmitters in a network must broadcast the same signal at the same time. To achieve synchronization, the broadcaster must counter any differences in propagation time incurred by the different methods and distances involved in carrying the signal from the multiplexer to the different transmitters. This is done by applying a delay to the incoming signal at the transmitter based on a timestamp generated at the multiplexer, created taking into account the maximum likely propagation time, with a generous added margin for safety. Delays in the audio encoder and the receiver due to digital processing (e.g. deinterleaving) add to the overall delay perceived by the listener. The signal is delayed, usually by around 1 to 4 seconds and can be considerably longer for DAB+. This has disadvantages:
*DAB radios are out of step with live events, so the experience of listening to live commentaries on events being watched is impaired;
*Listeners using a combination of analogue (AM or FM) and DAB radios (e.g. in different rooms of a house) will hear a mixture when both receivers are within earshot.

Time signals, on the contrary, are not a problem in a well-defined network with a fixed delay. The DAB multiplexer adds the proper offset to the distributed time information. The time information is also independent from the (possibly varying) audio decoding delay in receivers since the time is not embedded inside the audio frames. This means that built in clocks in receivers can be precisely correct.

====Transmission costs====
DAB can provide savings for networks of several stations. The original development of DAB was driven by national network operators with a number of channels to transmit from multiple sites. However, for individual stations such as small community or local stations which traditionally operate their own FM transmitter on their own building the cost of DAB transmission will be much higher than analog. Operating a DAB transmitter for a single station is not an efficient use of spectrum or power. With that said, this can be solved to some degree by combining multiple local stations in one DAB/DAB+ mux, similar to what is done on DVB-T/DVB-T2 with local TV stations.

====Coverage====
Household receiver penetration rates. :
Although FM coverage still exceeds DAB coverage in most countries implementing any kind of DAB services, a number of countries moving to digital switchover have undergone significant DAB network rollouts; as of 2022, the following coverages were given by WorldDAB:

====Compatibility====
In 2006 tests began using the much improved HE-AAC codec for DAB+. Hardly any of the receivers made before 2008 support the newer codec, however, making them partially obsolete once DAB+ broadcasts begin and completely obsolete once all MP2 encoded stations are gone. Most new receivers are both DAB and DAB+ compatible; however, the issue is exacerbated by some manufacturers disabling the DAB+ features on otherwise compatible radios to save on licensing fees when sold in countries without current DAB+ broadcasts.

====Power requirements====

As DAB requires digital signal processing techniques to convert from the received digitally encoded signal to the analogue audio content, the complexity of the electronic circuitry required to do this is higher. This translates into needing more power to effect this conversion than compared to an analogue FM to audio conversion, meaning that portable receiving equipment will have a much shorter battery life, and require higher power (and hence more bulk). This means that they use more energy than analogue Band II VHF receivers. However, thanks to increased integration (radio-on-chip), DAB receiver power usage has been reduced dramatically, making portable receivers far more usable.

<doc id="49260" wikidata="Q2514" url="?curid=49260" title="Willy Brandt">
<text>Willy Brandt (; born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm; 18 December 1913 – 8 October 1992) was a German politician and statesman who was leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) from 1964 to 1987 and served as the chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his efforts to strengthen cooperation in Western Europe through the EEC and to achieve reconciliation between West Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe. He was the first Social Democratic chancellor since 1930.

Fleeing to Norway and then Sweden during the Nazi regime and working as a left-wing journalist, he took the name Willy Brandt as a pseudonym to avoid detection by Nazi agents, and then formally adopted the name in 1948. Brandt earned initial fame as governing mayor of West Berlin. He served as the foreign minister and as the vice chancellor in Kurt Georg Kiesinger&#x27;s cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969.

As chancellor, he maintained West Germany&#x27;s close alignment with the United States and focused on strengthening European integration in Western Europe, while launching the new policy of &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe. Brandt was controversial on both the right wing, for his &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;, and on the left wing, for his support of American policies, including his silence on the Vietnam War that he broke only in 1973, and right-wing authoritarian regimes. The Brandt Report became a recognised measure for describing the general North–South divide in world economics and politics between an affluent North and a poor South. Brandt was also known for his fierce anti-communist policies at the domestic level, culminating in the &quot;Radikalenerlass&quot; (Anti-Radical Decree) in 1972.
In 1970, while visiting a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising crushed by the Germans, Brandt unexpectedly knelt and meditated in silence, a moment remembered as the &quot;Kniefall von Warschau&quot;.

Brandt resigned as chancellor in 1974, after Günter Guillaume, one of his closest aides, was exposed as an agent of the Stasi, the East German secret service. Brandt died from colon cancer in 1992, aged 78.

== Early life and World War II ==
Willy Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm in the Free City of Lübeck (German Empire) on 18 December 1913. His mother was Martha Frahm (1894–1969) a single parent, who worked as a cashier for a department store. His father was a teacher from Hamburg named John Heinrich Möller (1887–1958) whom Brandt never met. As his mother worked six days a week, he was mainly brought up by his mother&#x27;s stepfather, Ludwig Frahm (1875–1935). He joined the &quot;Socialist Youth&quot; in 1929 and at age 16 became a full member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1930 despite the age minimum normally being 18. He also wrote for the &quot;Volksbote&quot;, a local Social Democrat daily, under editor-in-chief Julius Leber, who would have a &quot;decisive influence&quot; on him.

He, along with half the youth-wing of the Lübeck SPD, left the party to join the more left wing Socialist Workers Party (SAP) in October 1931, which was allied to the POUM in Spain and, more significant to Brandt, had close ties with the Norwegian Labour Party. His break with Leber and the SPD lost him promised financial support for university studies and his job at the &quot;Volksbote&quot;. After passing his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1932 at &quot;Johanneum zu Lübeck&quot;, he took work at the shipbroker and ship&#x27;s agent F.H. Bertling. In 1933 he left Germany for Norway to escape Nazi persecution. It was at this time that he adopted the pseudonym Willy Brandt to avoid detection by Nazi agents. In 1934, he took part in the founding of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations, and was elected to its secretariat. Willy Brandt became one of Wilhelm Reich’s subjects for his experiments on the electrophysiology of pleasure and anxiety.

Brandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, disguised as a Norwegian student named Gunnar Gaasland. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from Lübeck in a marriage of convenience to protect her from deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Brandt worked in Spain as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for Norwegian citizenship. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but his real identity was not uncovered as he wore a Norwegian uniform. Upon his release, he escaped to neutral Sweden. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, where he lived until the end of the war. He lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at Bommersvik College about problems experienced by the social democrats in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries at the start of the Second World War. In exile in Norway and Sweden, he learned Norwegian and Swedish. He spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.

In late 1946, Brandt returned to Berlin, working for the Norwegian government. In 1948, he re-joined the SPD and became a German citizen again, formally adopting the pseudonym Willy Brandt as his legal name. In 2021, it became known that Brandt served as a paid informant for the US Counterintelligence Corps from 1948 to 1952. He supplied reports on circumstances in the GDR, including the situation of East German authorities and industries, as well as Soviet troops. According to Thomas Boghardt, Brandt and SPD man Hans E. Hirschfeld received 200,000 German Mark from the Americans in 1950 for promoting his political career, after both had met with the Americans at the German CIA headquarters in Frankfurt. Both were sworn to &quot;secrecy&quot;. The Americans wanted to strengthen the SPD over the Communists in Berlin. Over the next two years, Hirschfeld received a further 106,000 Marks. Even after the end of his informant activities, he is said to have remained in contact with US intelligence.

== Early political career ==

Brandt was elected to the West German Bundestag (the federal parliament) in the 1949 West German federal election as a SPD delegate from West Berlin, serving there until 1957. Concurrently, he was elected as an SPD representative to the Abgeordnetenhaus (the state-level parliament) of West Berlin in the 1950 West Berlin state election, and served there through 1971. In the 1969 West German federal election he was again elected to the Bundestag, but as a delegate from North Rhine-Westphalia, and remained in the Bundestag as a delegate from that state until his death in 1992.

In 1950, Brandt, while a member of the Bundestag and the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Berliner Stadtblatt&quot;, received a secret payment of about 170,000 Deutsche Mark from the U.S. government ().

From October 1957 to 1966, Willy Brandt served as Governing Mayor of West Berlin, during a period of increasing tension in East–West relations that led to the construction of the Berlin Wall. In his first year as mayor of Berlin, he also served as the president of the Bundesrat in Bonn. He was an outspoken critic of Soviet repression of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising and of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1958 proposal that Berlin receive the status of a &quot;free city&quot;. He was supported by the influential publisher Axel Springer.

As mayor of West Berlin, Brandt accomplished much in the way of urban development. New hotels, office-blocks, and flats were constructed, while both Schloss Charlottenburg and the Reichstag building were restored. Sections of the &quot;Stadtring&quot; Bundesautobahn 100 inner city motorway were opened, while a major housing programme was carried out, with roughly 20,000 new dwellings built each year during his time in office.

At the start of 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy saw Brandt as a figure destined for high office in West Germany and was hoping he would replace Konrad Adenauer as chancellor following elections later that year. Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the White House a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country&#x27;s leader. For the president, Brandt stood for Germany&#x27;s future and for overcoming traditional Cold War thinking.

The diplomatic snub strained relations between Kennedy and Adenauer further during an especially tense time for Berlin. However, following the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, Brandt was disappointed and angry with Kennedy. Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting &quot;Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action.&quot; He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable &quot;to arouse doubts about the ability of the three Allied Powers to react and their determination&quot; and he called the situation &quot;a state of accomplished extortion&quot;. Kennedy was furious, but managed to defuse the tension by sending his vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, to Berlin. In June 1963, Brandt figured prominently in the staging of Kennedy&#x27;s triumphant visit to West Berlin.

Brandt became the chairman of the SPD in 1964, Brandt was the SPD candidate for the chancellorship in 1961, but he lost to Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s conservative Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU). In 1965, Brandt ran again, but lost to the popular Ludwig Erhard. Erhard&#x27;s government was short-lived, however, and in 1966 a grand coalition between the SPD and CDU was formed, with Brandt serving as foreign minister and as the 5th Vice Chancellor of Germany.

== Chancellor ==
In the 1969 elections, again with Brandt as the leading candidate, the SPD became stronger, and after three weeks of negotiations, the SPD formed a coalition government with the smaller Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP). Brandt was elected chancellor.

=== Foreign policy ===
As chancellor, Brandt developed his &quot;(Neue) Ostpolitik&quot; (&quot;new eastern policy&quot;) by stages. He was active in creating a degree of rapprochement with East Germany, and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern Bloc (communist) countries.

Brandt introduced his Ostpolitik gradually starting in 1967 with the establishment of diplomatic relations with Romania and making a trade agreement with Czechoslovakia. In 1968 he restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. However the August 1968, Kremlin-controlled invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact was a profound disappointment. He condemned the invasion and put Ostpolitik on hold while he negotiated a coalition with the Free Democrats. In late 1969 he indicated his readiness to meet with East German leadership on the basis of equality, without preconditions. He also expressed an eagerness to meet with the USSR and Poland to resolve frontier questions that had remained unsettled since 1945. He met with the East German premier Willi Stoph in 1970.

Brandt made a six-point proposal that would involve two separate German states that respected each other&#x27;s territorial integrity and settle disputes peacefully. They would cooperate as neighbors and the rights of the Four Powers in Berlin would be respected by both of them, and finally that the situation around Berlin would be improved. No agreements were reached at first but talks continued. In 1970 he signed a treaty with the Soviet Union which normalised relations and recognized existing national boundaries. The treaty with Poland in December 1970 accepted the current boundaries, which had long been in dispute. During a visit to a monument to the German occupation-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, he unexpectedly, and apparently spontaneously, knelt (Kniefall von Warschau), honoring the victims. This was met with a strong positive reaction worldwide, but was highly controversial in the German public at the time.

The Berlin question was settled in 1971 to West Germany&#x27;s satisfaction. The crowning step came with the Basic Treaty with East Germany. The status quo was legitimized, relations were formalized on the basis of equality, and both Germanies joined the United Nations in 1973. Brandt became the first German chancellor to address the United Nations General Assembly.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine in the U.S. named Brandt as its Man of the Year for 1970, stating, &quot;Willy Brandt is in effect seeking to end World War II by bringing about a fresh relationship between East and West. He is trying to accept the real situation in Europe, which has lasted for 25 years, but he is also trying to bring about a new reality in his bold approach to the Soviet Union and the East Bloc.&quot; President Richard Nixon also was pushing détente on behalf of the United States. The Nixon policies amounted to co-opting Brandt&#x27;s Ostpolitik.

In 1971, Brandt received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in improving relations with East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. Brandt negotiated a peace treaty with Poland, and agreements on the boundaries between the two countries, signifying the official and long-delayed end of World War II. Brandt negotiated parallel treaties and agreements with Czechoslovakia.

In West Germany, Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Neue Ostpolitik&quot; was extremely controversial, dividing the populace into two camps. One camp embraced all of the conservative parties, and most notably those West German residents and their families who had been driven west (&quot;die Heimatvertriebenen&quot;) by Stalinist ethnic cleansing from Historical Eastern Germany, especially the part that was given to Poland as a consequence of the end of the war; western Czechoslovakia (the Sudetenland); and the rest of Eastern Europe, such as in Romania. These groups of displaced Germans and their descendants loudly voiced their opposition to Brandt&#x27;s policy, calling it &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;high treason&quot;.
A different camp supported and encouraged Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Neue Ostpolitik&quot; as aiming at &quot;change through rapprochement&quot; (&quot;Wandel durch Annäherung&quot;), encouraging change through a policy of engagement with the (communist) Eastern Bloc, rather than trying to isolate these countries diplomatically and commercially. Brandt&#x27;s supporters claim that the policy did help to break down the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s &quot;siege mentality&quot; and also helped to increase its awareness of the contradictions in its brand of socialism/communism, which – together with other events – eventually led to the downfall of Eastern European communism.

=== Domestic policies ===

==== Brandt&#x27;s popularity ====
Brandt&#x27;s predecessor as chancellor, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, had been a member of the Nazi party, and was a more old-fashioned conservative-liberal intellectual. Brandt, having fought the Nazis and having faced down communist Eastern Germany during several crises while he was the mayor of Berlin, became a controversial, but credible, figure in several different factions. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kiesinger&#x27;s grand coalition cabinet, Brandt helped to gain further international approval for Western Germany, and he laid the foundation stones for his future &quot;Neue Ostpolitik&quot;. There was a wide public-opinion gap between Kiesinger and Brandt in the West German polls.

Both men had come to their own terms with the new baby boomer lifestyles. Kiesinger considered them to be &quot;a shameful crowd of long-haired drop-outs who needed a bath and someone to discipline them&quot;. On the other hand, Brandt needed a while to get into contact with, and to earn credibility among, the &quot;Ausserparlamentarische Opposition&quot; (APO) (&quot;the extra-parliamentary opposition&quot;). The students questioned West German society in general, seeking social, legal, and political reforms. The unrest led to a renaissance of right-wing parties in some of the Bundeslands&#x27; (German states under the Bundesrepublik) Parliaments.

Brandt, however, represented a figure of change, and he followed a course of social, legal, and political reforms. In 1969, Brandt gained a small majority by forming a coalition with the FDP. In his first speech before the Bundestag as the chancellor, Brandt set forth his political course of reforms ending the speech with his famous words, &quot;Wir wollen mehr Demokratie wagen&quot; (literally: &quot;Let&#x27;s dare more democracy&quot;, or more figuratively, &quot;We want to take a chance on more Democracy&quot;). This speech made Brandt, as well as the Social Democratic Party, popular among most of the students and other young West German baby-boomers who dreamed of a country that would be more open and more colorful than the frugal and still somewhat-authoritarian Bundesrepublik that had been built after World War II. However, Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Neue Ostpolitik&quot; lost him a large part of the German refugee voters from East Germany, who had been significantly pro-SPD in the postwar years.

=== Chancellor of domestic reform ===
Although Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a &quot;Kanzler der inneren Reformen&quot; (&#x27;Chancellor of domestic reform&#x27;). According to the historian David Childs, &quot;Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon&quot;. Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes. As noted by the journalist and historian Marion Dönhoff,

&quot;People were seized by a completely new feeling about life. A mania for large scale reforms spread like wildfire, affecting schools, universities, the administration, family legislation. In the autumn of 1970 Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski of the SPD declared, &#x27;Every week more than three plans for reform come up for decision in cabinet and in the Assembly.&#x27;&quot;

Federal spending rose significantly under Brandt; increasing by an average of 12% per year between 1970 and 1974, with most of the additional spending allocated to transport, education and welfare. During Brandt&#x27;s time in office, social expenditure rose from one quarter to a third of GDP.

According to Helmut Schmidt, Willy Brandt&#x27;s domestic reform programme had accomplished more than any previous programme for a comparable period. Levels of social expenditure were increased, with more funds allocated towards housing, transportation, schools, and communication, and substantial federal benefits were provided for farmers. Various measures were introduced to extend health care coverage, while federal aid to sports organisations was increased. A number of social reforms were instituted whilst the welfare state was significantly expanded (with total public spending on social programs nearly doubling between 1969 and 1975), with health, housing, and social welfare legislation bringing about welcome improvements, and by the end of the Brandt Chancellorship West Germany had one of the most advanced systems of welfare in the world.

Substantial increases were made in social security benefits such as injury and sickness benefits, pensions, unemployment benefits, housing allowances, basic subsistence aid allowances, and family allowances and living allowances. In the government&#x27;s first budget, sickness benefits were increased by 9.3%, pensions for war widows by 25%, pensions for the war wounded by 16%, and retirement pensions by 5%. Numerically, pensions went up by 6.4% (1970), 5.5% (1971), 9.5% (1972), 11.4% (1973), and 11.2% (1974). Adjusted for changes in the annual price index, pensions went up in real terms by 3.1% (1970), 0.3% (1971), 3.9% (1972), 4.4% (1973), and 4.2% (1974). Between 1972 and 1974, the purchasing power of pensioners went up by 19%. In 1970, war pensions were increased by 16%. War victim&#x27;s pensions went up by 5.5% in January 1971, and by 6.3% in January 1972. By 1972, war pensions for orphans and parents had gone up by around 40%, and for widows by around 50%. Between 1970 and 1972, the &quot;Landabgaberente&quot; (land transfer pension) went up by 55%. Between 1969 and 1974, the average real standard rate of income support rose (in 1991 prices) from around 300 DM to around 400 DM. Between 1970 and 1974, unemployment benefits rose from around 300 euros to around 400 euros per month, and unemployment assistance from just under 200 euros per month to just under 400 euros per month. In 2001 prices, the average standard social assistance benefit level rose from around 200 euros per month in 1969 to over 250 euros per month in 1974. During most of Brandt&#x27;s years as chancellor, the majority of benefits increased as a percentage of average net earnings.

In 1970, seagoing pilots became retrospectively insurable, and gained full social security as members of the Non-Manual Workers Insurance Institute. That same year, a special regulation came into force for District Master Chimney Sweeps, making them fully insurable under the Craftsman&#x27;s Insurance Scheme. An increase was made in tax-free allowances for children, which enabled 1,000,000 families to claim an allowance for the second child, compared to 300,000 families previously. The Second Modification and Supplementation Law (1970) increased the allowance for the third child from DM 50 to DM 60, raised the income-limit for the second child allowance from DM 7,800 to DM 13,200; subsequently increased to DM 15,000 by the third modification law (December 1971), DM 16,800 by the fourth modification law (November 1973), and to DM 18,360 by the fifth modification law (December 1973). A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and disabled persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives. From 1971, special subventions were provided to enable young farmers to quit farming &quot;and facilitate their entry into the non-agricultural pension system by means of back payments&quot;.

==== Social assistance ====
The Third Modification Law (1974) extended individual entitlements to social assistance by means of higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the disabled, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established.

Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases were made in the pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance allowances for participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special allowances for refugees from East Germany.

There was determined, by statutory regulation issued in February 1970, the category of persons most seriously disabled &quot;to whom, with regard to maintenance aid, an increased demand (50% of the appropriate rate) is being conceded, and, within the scope of relief in special living conditions: a higher rate of nursing aid&quot;. In 1971, the retirement age for miners was lowered to 50. An April 1972 law providing for &quot;promotion of social aid services&quot; aimed to remedy, through various beneficial measures (particularly in the field of national insurance and working conditions), the staff-shortage suffered by social establishments in their medico-social, educational and other work. A bill to harmonize re-education benefit and another bill relating to severely disabled persons became law in May and September 1972 respectively. In 1972, winter payments for construction workers were introduced.

To assist family planning and marriage and family guidance, the government allocated DM 2,232,000 in 1973 for the payment and for the basic and further training of staff. A special effort was also made in 1973 to organize the recreation of disabled persons, with a holiday guide for the disabled issued with the aid of the Federal Ministry of Family and Youth Affairs and Health in order to help them find suitable holiday accommodation for themselves and their families. From 1972 to 1973, the total amount of individual aids granted by Guarantee Fund for the integration of young immigrants increased from 17 million DM to 26 million DM. Under a law passed in April 1974, the protection hitherto granted to the victims of war or industrial accidents for the purpose of their occupational and social reintegration was extended to all disabled persons, whatever the cause of their disability, provided that their capacity to work had been reduced by at least 50%.

==== Health care ====
In the field of health care, various measures were introduced to improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief, while a contributory medical service for 23 million panel patients was introduced. Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution, while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out, as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment. The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the wage level (1970) and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced. In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued. That same year, compulsory health insurance was extended to the self-employed. In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.

Pupils, students and children in kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers&#x27; Sickness Insurance Law (1972) introduced compulsory sickness insurance for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers&#x27; pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance. Participation in employer&#x27;s health insurance was extended to four million employees. A Development Law of December 1970 made it possible for all employees voluntarily to become members of the statutory sickness insurance. The level of income for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their sickness insurance from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of sickness insurance benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.

The Hospital Financing Law (1972) secured the supply of hospitals and reduced the cost of hospital care, &quot;defined the financing of hospital investment as a public responsibility, single states to issue plans for hospital development, and the federal government to bear the cost of hospital investment covered in the plans, rates for hospital care thus based on running costs alone, hospitals to ensure that public subsidies together with insurance fund payments for patients cover total costs&quot;. The Benefit Improvement Law (1973) made entitlement to hospital care legally binding (entitlements already enjoyed in practice), abolished time limits for hospital care, introduced entitlement to household assistance under specific conditions, and also introduced entitlement to leave of absence from work and cash benefits in the event of a child&#x27;s illness. In 1971, to encourage the growth of registered family holiday centres, the Federal Government granted subsidies for the building and appointing of 28 of these centres at a total cost of 8 million DM. Free preliminary investigations were introduced for 2.5 million children up until the age of 4 for the early detection and correction of developmental disorders, and health research was expanded. Federal grants were increased, especially for the Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, while a Federal Institute for Sport Science was set up, together with the Institute for Social Medicine and Epidemiology in Berlin. In addition, funding for new rehabilitation facilities was increased.

==== Retirement ====
The Pension Reform Law (1972) guaranteed all retirees a minimum pension regardless of their contributions and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings. The 1972 pension reforms improved eligibility conditions and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population. The income replacement rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a &quot;retirement window&quot; ranging between 63 and 65 for employees who had worked for at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65. The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the pension benefit fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum wage benefit. According to one study, the 1972 pension reform &quot;enhanced&quot; the reduction of poverty in old age.

Voluntary retirement at 63 with no deductions in the level of benefits was introduced, together with the index-linking of war victim&#x27;s pensions to wage increases. Guaranteed minimum pension benefits for all West Germans were introduced, along with automatic pension increases for war widows (1970). Fixed minimum rates for women in receipt of very low pensions were also introduced, together with equal treatment for war widows. Improvements in pension provision were made for women and the self-employed, a new minimum pension for workers with at least twenty-five years&#x27; insurance was introduced, faster pension indexation was implemented, with the annual adjustment of pensions brought forward by six months, and the Seventh Modification Law (1973) linked the indexation of farmers&#x27; pensions to the indexation of the general pension insurance scheme.

A new pension for &quot;severely handicapped&quot; persons was introduced in 1972, along with occupational injury annuities and a special pension for long-standing insurant from the age of 63 and a pension due to &quot;limited earning capacity&quot; from the age of 62. In addition, a special pension benefit was introduced for workers aged 60 and above after unemployment. Under the Severely Handicapped Persons Act of April 1974, a seriously disabled person could retire early on an old age pension at the age of 62 years, provided that he &quot;complied with the other provisions of the legislation on pension insurance&quot;.

==== Education ====
In education, the Brandt Administration sought to widen educational opportunities for all West Germans. The government presided over an increase in the number of teachers, generous public stipends were introduced for students to cover their living costs, and West German universities were converted from elite schools into mass institutions. The school leaving age was raised to 16, and spending on research and education was increased by nearly 300% between 1970 and 1974. Working through a planning committee set up for the &quot;joint task&quot; of university development, the Federal Government started to make investment costs in 1971. Fees for higher or further education were abolished, while a considerable increase in the number of higher education institutions took place. A much needed school and college construction program was carried out, together with the introduction of postgraduate support for highly qualified graduates, providing them with the opportunity to earn their doctorates or undertake research studies. A law on individual promotion of vocational training came into force in October 1971, which provided for financial grants for attendance at further general or technical teaching establishments from the second year of studies at higher technical schools, academies and higher education establishments, training centres of second degree, or certain courses of television teaching. Grants were also made in certain cases for attendance at training centres located outside the Federal Republic.

The education budget was doubled from 3% to 6%, while an expansion of secondary education took place. The number of university students went up from 100,000 to 650,000, 30,000 more places were created in the schools, and an additional 1 billion marks was allocated for new school buildings. In addition, the provision of scholarships was expanded, with the 1970 programme providing for, in the words of one observer, &quot;5,000 new scholarships for graduates, and double that number were being awarded three years later&quot;. Grants were introduced for pupils from lower income groups to stay on at school, together with grants for those going into any kind of higher or further education. Increases were also made in educational allowances, as well as spending on science. In 1972, the government allocated 2.1 million DM in grants to promote marriage and family education. Under the Approbationsordnung (medical education profession act) of 1970, the subject of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy at German universities became a compulsory subject for medical students, and that same year education of clinical and biomedical engineers was introduced. The Brandt Administration also introduced enabling legislation for the introduction of comprehensives, but left it to the Lander &quot;to introduce them at their discretion&quot;. While the more left-wing Lander &quot;rapidly began to do so&quot;, other Lander found &quot;all sorts of pretexts for delaying the scheme&quot;. By the mid-1980s, Berlin had 25 comprehensives while Bavaria only had 1, and in most Lander comprehensives were still viewed as &quot;merely experimental&quot;.

==== Housing and urban development ====
In the field of housing, various measures were carried out to benefit householders, such as in improving the rights of tenants and increasing rental assistance. According to the Rent Subsidies Act (Wohngeldgesetz) of 1970, &quot;low-income tenants and owners of accommodations are supported with rents and burdens subsidies&quot;. The determination of the income of families taken into consideration for housing allowances was simplified, and increased levels of protection and support for low-income tenants and householders were introduced which led to a drop in the number of eviction notices. By 1974, three times as much was paid out in rent subsidies as in 1969, and nearly one and a half million households received rental assistance. Increases were made in public housing subsidies, as characterised by a 36% increase in the social housing budget in 1970 and by the introduction of a programme for the construction of 200,000 public housing units (1971). From 1970 to 1971, an 18.1% increase in building permits for social housing units was made. Other reforms aimed at improving tenants&#x27; rights included protection against conversion of rental housing into condominiums, the prohibition of the misappropriation of living space, new regulation of the apartment broker system, and a fee scale for engineers and architects. In addition, the income limits for eligibility for social housing were raised and adapted in order of general income trends.

A loose form of rent regulation was introduced under the name of &quot;Vergleichmieten&quot; (comparable rents), together with the provision of &quot;for family-friendly housing&quot; freight or rent subsidies to owners of apartments or houses whose ceiling had been adapted to increased expenses or incomes (1970). In addition, a law for the creation of property for workers was passed, under which a married worker would normally keep up to 95% of his pay, and graded tax remission for married wage-earners applied up to a wage of 48,000 marks, which indicated the economic prosperity of West Germany at that time. The Town Planning Act (1971) encouraged the preservation of historical heritage and helped open up the way to the future of many German cities, while the Urban Renewal Act (1971) helped the states to restore their inner cities and to develop new neighbourhoods. In addition, Guidelines of December 1972 on the usage of federal funds in assisting social housing construction laid down that a certain standard needed to be observed when building homes for severely disabled persons.

The Second Housing Allowance Law of December 1970 simplified the administration of housing allowances and extended entitlements, increased the income limit to 9,600 DM per year plus 2,400 DM for each family member, raised the general deduction on income to determine reckonable income from 15% to 20%, allowance rates listed in tables replacing complicated calculation procedure based on &quot;bearable rent burdens&quot;. The Housing Construction Modification Law (1971) increased the income-limit for access to low rent apartments under the social housing programme from 9,000 DM to 12,000 DM per annum plus 3,000 DM (instead of 2,400) for each family member. The law also introduced special subsidies to reduce the debt burden for builders not surpassing the regular income-limit by more than 40%. Under a 1973 law, the limits were increased to 1,000 DM plus 9,000 DM and 4,200 DM for additional family members. The Rent Improvement Law (1971) strengthened the position of tenants. Under this legislation, notice was to be ruled illegal &quot;where appropriate substitute accommodation not available; landlords obliged to specify reasons for notice&quot;, whilst the Eviction Protection Law (1971) established tenant protection against rent rises and notice. The notice was only lawful if in the &quot;justified interest of the landlord&quot;. Under this law, higher rents were not recognised as &quot;justified interest&quot;. The Second Eviction Protection Law (1972) made the tenant protection introduced under the Eviction Protection Law of 1971 permanent. Under this new law, the notice was only lawful where the landlord proved justified personal interest in the apartment. In addition, rent increases were only lawful if not above normal comparable rents in the same area.

Directives on the housing of foreign workers came into force in April 1971. These directives imposed certain requirements for space, hygiene, safety, and amenities in the accommodation offered by employers. That same year, the Federal Government granted a sum of 17 million DM to the Länder for the improvement and modernization of housing built before 21 June 1948. In addition, according to a 1971 regulation of the Board of the Federal Labour Office, &quot;construction of workers&#x27; hostels qualified for government financial support under certain conditions&quot;. The &quot;German Council for town development&quot;, which was set up by virtue of Article 89 of a law to foster urban building, was partly aimed at planning a favourable environment for families (such as the provision of playgrounds). In 1971, the Federal Labour Office made available DM 425 million in the form of loans to provide 157 293 beds in 2 494 hostels. A year later, the Federal Government (Bund), the Lander and the Federal Labour Office promoted the construction of dwellings for migrant workers. They set aside 10 million DM for this purpose, which allowed the financing of 1650 family dwellings that year.

Development measures were begun in 1972 with federal financial aid granted to the Lander for improvement measures relating to towns and villages, and in the 1972 budget, DM 50 million was earmarked, i.e. a third of the total cost of some 300 schemes. A council for urban development was formed in May 1972 with the purpose of promoting future work and measures in the field of urban renovation. In 1973, the government provided assistance of DM 28 million for the modernisation of old dwellings. New rules were introduced regarding improvements in the law relating to rented property, and control of the rise in rents and protection against cancellation of leases also safeguarded the rights of migrant workers in the sphere of housing. A law of July 1973 fixed the fundamental and minimum requirements regarding workers&#x27; dwellings, mainly concerning space, ventilation and lighting, protection against damp, heat and noise, power and heating facilities and sanitary installations.

==== Civil, family, and animal rights ====
In regards to civil rights, the Brandt Administration introduced a broad range of socially liberal reforms aimed at making West Germany a more open society. Greater legal rights for women were introduced, as exemplified by the standardisation of pensions, divorce laws, regulations governing use of surnames, and the introduction of measures to bring more women into politics. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, the age of eligibility for political office was lowered to 21, and the age of majority was lowered to 18 in March 1974. The Third Law for the Liberalization of the Penal Code (1970) liberalised &quot;the right to political demonstration&quot;, while equal rights were granted to illegitimate children that same year. A 1971 amendment to a federal civil service reform bill enabled fathers to apply for part-time civil service work. In 1971, corporal punishment was banned in schools, and that same year a new Highway Code was introduced. In 1973, a measure was introduced that facilitated the adoption of young children by reducing the minimum age for adoptive parents from 35 to 25.

A women&#x27;s policy machinery at the national level was established in 1972 while amnesty was guaranteed in minor offences connected with demonstrations. From 1970 onwards, parents as well as landlords were no longer legally prohibited &quot;to give or rent rooms or flats to unmarried couples or to allow them to stay overnight&quot;. In October 1972, the legal aid system was improved with the compensation paid to private lawyers for legal services to the poor increased. The Bausparkassen Act of 1972 placed all bausparkassen (building societies) under the supervision of the Federal Banking Supervisory Office from January 1974 onwards, and confined them &quot;to the contract saving business and related activities&quot;. The Animal Protection Act, passed in 1972, introduced various safeguards for animals such as not permitting the causing of pain, injury, or suffering to an animal without justification, and limiting experiments to the minimum number of animals necessary. In 1971, rules were introduced making it possible for former guestworkers &quot;to receive an unlimited residence permit after a five-year stay&quot;.

==== Military ====
A number of reforms were also carried out to the armed forces, as characterised by a reduction in basic military training from 18 to 15 months, a reorganisation of education and training, and personnel and procurement procedures. Education for the troops was improved, a personnel reshuffle of top management in the Bundeswehr was carried out, academic education was mandated for officers beyond their basic military training, and a new recruiting policy for Bundeswehr personnel was introduced with the intention of building an army that reflected West Germany&#x27;s pluralistic society. Defense Minister Helmut Schmidt led the development of the first Joint Service Regulation ZDv 10/1 (Assistance for Innere Fuehrung, classified: restricted), which revitalized the concept of Innere Fuehrung while also affirming the value of the &quot;citizen in uniform&quot;. According to one study, as a result of this reform, &quot;a strong civil mindset displaced the formerly dominant military mindset&quot;, and forced the Bundeswehr&#x27;s elder generation to accept a new type of soldier envisioned by Schmidt. In addition, the Federal Cost of Moving Act increased the relocation allowance (with effect from 1 November 1973), with the basic allowances raised by DM 50 and DM 100 respectively, while extra allowances for families were raised to a uniform amount of 125 DM.

In 1970, the Armed Forces Vocational Schools and the Vocational Advancement Organization extended their services for the first time to conscripts, &quot;so far as military duty permitted&quot;. New enlistment bonuses were authorized and previous bonus schemes were improved, and new pay regulations were introduced that improved the financial situation of military personnel and civil servants. In July 1973, the 3rd Amendment to the Civilian Service Act came into force; &quot;a prerequisite for the creation of additional civilian service places for recognized conscientious objectors&quot;. The amendment provided that men recognized as conscientious objectors while performing military service should immediately be transferred to a civilian service assignment. The maximum amount for servicemen enlisting for at least 12 years was increased from DM 6,000 to DM 9,000, and from October 1971 onwards, long-term personnel were paid grants towards the cost &#x27;of attending educational institutes of the &quot;second educational route&quot; or participating in state-recognized general education courses provided by private correspondence schools and the &quot;television college&quot;&#x27;. In 1972, two Bundeswehr universities were established; a reform which, according to one historian, &quot;fought against the closed nature of the military and guaranteed that officers would be better able to successfully interact with the civilian world&quot;. From April 1973, the general maintenance payments under the Law amending the Maintenance Security Act and the Workplace Protection Act were increased, while increases were also made in the special allowance (Christmas bonus) for conscripts, together with the dismissal allowance. The expense allowance for troops on duty-related absence from place of employment was improved, together with travel subsidies and provisions for military service damaged soldiers and their families. In addition, the position of non-commissioned officers was improved.

==== Consumers&#x27; and workers&#x27; rights ====

Legislation aimed at safeguarding consumers was also implemented under the Brandt Administration. The consumer&#x27;s right of withdrawal in case of hire purchase was strengthened in March 1974, and fixed prices for branded products were abolished by law in January that same year, which meant that manufacturers&#x27; recommended prices were not binding for retailers. In addition, a progressive anticartel law was passed. The Law on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution and Penalties, passed in March 1971, provided for standardized compensation in certain situations. In addition, the budget for communications was increased.

In terms of working conditions, a number of reforms were introduced aimed at strengthening the rights of workers both at home and in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of incapacity for work, while maternity leave was increased. Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness. In 1970 all employees unfit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably employed persons) were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer&#x27;s supplement and sick pay were only made from the day on which the doctor certified unfitness for work. In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work. A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.

Improvements were also made in income and work conditions for home workers, accident insurance was extended to non-working adults, and the Border Zone Assistance Act (1971) increased levels of assistance to the declining zonal peripheral area. The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts. A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90 dB( A) may be exceeded at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal noise protection devices. A matching fund program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.

A ministerial order of January 1970 extended protection in cases of partial unemployment to home workers, while an ordinance of August 1970 fixed the conditions of health necessary for service in the merchant navy. A general provision of October 1970 determined in detail the circumstances in which the competent authority must take action on the basis of the act on the technical means of work. The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as &quot;rules of the art&quot;. In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the &quot;Lander&quot; to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers&#x27; Association on the evaluation of work station noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved.

By a decree of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its designated tasks included the promotion of industrial protection, accident prevention on the journey to and from work and accident prevention in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research. A regulation was issued in 1972 which permitted for the first time the employment of women as drivers of trams, omnibuses and lorries, while further regulations laid down new provisions for lifts and work with compressed air. The Factory Constitution Law (1971) strengthened the rights of individual employees &quot;to be informed and to be heard on matters concerning their place of work&quot;. The Works Council was provided with greater authority while trade unions were given the right of entry into the factory &quot;provided they informed the employer of their intention to do so&quot;, while a law was passed to encourage wider share ownership by workers and other rank-and-file employees. The Industrial Relations Law (1972) and the Personnel Representation Act (1974) broadened the rights of employees in matters which immediately affected their places of work, while also improving the possibilities for codetermination on operations committees, together with access of trade unions to companies.

The Works Constitution Act of 1972 required in cases of collective dismissal at an establishment normally employing more than twenty employees that management and the works council must negotiate a social plan that stipulates compensation for workers who lose their jobs. In cases where the two parties could not agree on a social plan, the law provided for binding arbitration. In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights on issues such as working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and short-time work. Legislation was passed which acknowledged for the first time the presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils.

A law of January 1972 on the organization of labour in enterprises significantly extended the works council&#x27;s right of cooperation and co-management in the matter of vocational training. That same year, the Safety Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany was transformed into a public Federal Agency (Bundesanstalt) with significantly enlarged powers, in the context of which special emphasis would be placed on its new task of promoting and coordinating research in the area of accident prevention. New provisions were introduced for the rehabilitation of severely disabled people (&quot;Schwerbehinderte&quot;) and accident victims. The Severely Disabled Persons Act of April 1974 obliged all employers with more than fifteen employees to ensure that 6% of their workforce consisted of people officially recognised as being severely disabled. Employers who failed to do so were assessed 100 DM per month for every job falling before the required quota. These compensatory payments were used to &quot;subsidise the adaptation of workplaces to the requirements of those who were severely handicapped&quot;.

A law passed in January 1974, designed to protect members of the supervisory boards of companies who are undergoing training, was aimed at ensuring that the representatives of young workers and youthful members of works councils still undergoing training could perform their duties with greater independence and without fear of disadvantageous consequences for their future careers. On request, workers&#x27; representatives on completion of their training courses had to have an employment relationship of unlimited duration. In the field of transport, the Municipal Transportation Finance Law of 1971 established federal guidelines for subsidies to municipal governments, while the Federal Transport Plan of 1973 provided a framework for all transport, including public transport. In addition, the Severely Handicapped Persons Act of April 1974 extended the welfare and promotional obligations of the employer, and provided a right to extra holiday consisting of six working days.

==== Environment ====
A federal environmental programme was established in 1971, and in 1972 laws were passed to regulate garbage elimination and air pollution via emission. Matching grants covering 90% of infrastructure development were allocated to local communities, which led to a dramatic increase in the number of public swimming pools and other facilities of consumptive infrastructure throughout West Germany. The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a Foreign Tax Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion. In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways. In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline, and in 1972 DDT was banned. The Federal Emissions Control Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.

In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.

Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for Protection against Aircraft Noise of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air traffic system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called &quot;Lärmschutzzonen&quot; (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet aircraft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, the representation of the German Federal States.

==== Economy ====
Under the Brandt Administration, West Germany attained a lower rate of inflation than in other industrialised countries at that time, while a rise in the standard of living took place, helped by the floating and revaluation of the mark. This was characterised by the real incomes of employees increasing more sharply than incomes from entrepreneurial work, with the proportion of employees&#x27; incomes in the overall national income rising from 65% to 70% between 1969 and 1973, while the proportion of income from entrepreneurial work and property fell over that same period from just under 35% to 30%. In addition, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty (based on various definitions) fell between 1969 and 1973. According to one estimate, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty fell from 9.7% to 8.9% between 1969 and 1973, and from 20.2% to 14.0% according to another estimate. According to another estimate, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty during this period fell from 2.7% to 1.4%.

=== 1972 crisis ===
Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; led to a meltdown of the narrow majority Brandt&#x27;s coalition enjoyed in the &quot;Bundestag&quot;. In October 1970, FDP deputies Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and Siegfried Zoglmann crossed the floor to join the CDU. On 23 February 1972, SPD deputy Herbert Hupka, who was also leader of the &quot;Bund der Vertriebenen&quot;, joined the CDU in disagreement with Brandt&#x27;s reconciliatory efforts towards the east. On 23 April 1972, Wilhelm Helms (FDP) left the coalition. The FDP politicians Knud von Kühlmann-Stumm and Gerhard Kienbaum also declared that they would vote against Brandt, completing the loss of Brandt&#x27;s majority. On 24 April 1972 a constructive vote of no confidence was proposed, to be voted on three days later. In the event this motion passed, CDU leader Rainer Barzel would have replaced Brandt as chancellor.

On paper, the opposition now had 250 votes; just one over the 249 needed to oust Brandt. Even Brandt himself believed he was finished, and a number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt&#x27;s expected defeat on the floor of the Bundestag. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the motion failed: Barzel got only 247 votes out of 260 votes cast, two short of what he needed to become Chancellor. There were also 10 votes against the motion and three invalid ballots. Most SPD and FDP deputies abstained, which had the same effect as voting for Brandt.

=== New elections ===

Though Brandt remained chancellor, he had lost his majority. Subsequent initiatives in parliament, most notably on the budget, failed. Because of this stalemate, the Bundestag was dissolved and new elections were called. During the 1972 campaign, many popular West German artists, intellectuals, writers, actors and professors supported Brandt and the SPD. Among them were Günter Grass, Walter Jens, and even the soccer player Paul Breitner. Brandt&#x27;s &quot;&quot; as well as his reformist domestic policies were popular with parts of the young generation and he led the SPD to its best-ever federal election result in late 1972.

However, the &#x27;, Brandt&#x27;s landslide win, was the beginning of the end; and Brandt&#x27;s role in government started to decline. Many of his reforms met with resistance from state governments, dominated by CDU/CSU. The spirit of reformist optimism was cut short by the 1973 oil crisis and the major public services strike 1974, which gave Germany&#x27;s trade unions, led by Heinz Kluncker, a big wage increase but reduced Brandt&#x27;s financial leeway for further reforms. Brandt was said to be more a dreamer than a manager and was personally haunted by depression. To counter any notions about being sympathetic to Communism or soft on left-wing extremists, Brandt implemented tough legislation that barred &quot;radicals&quot; from public service (&#x27;).

=== Guillaume affair ===
Around 1973, West German security organizations received information that one of Brandt&#x27;s personal assistants, Günter Guillaume, was a spy for the East German intelligence services. Brandt was asked to continue working as usual, and he agreed to do so, even taking a private vacation with Guillaume. Guillaume was arrested on 24 April 1974, and many blamed Brandt for having a communist spy in his inner circle.

Brandt resigned from his position as chancellor on 6 May 1974, but he remained a member of the Bundestag and chairman of the Social Democrats until 1987.
This espionage affair is widely considered to have been just the trigger for Brandt&#x27;s resignation, not the fundamental cause. As Brandt himself later said, &quot;I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the affair [the Guillaume espionage scandal] going on at the time.&quot;
Brandt was dogged by scandals about serial adultery, and reportedly also struggled with alcohol and depression. There was also the economic fallout on West Germany of the 1973 oil crisis, which may seem to have given enough stress to finish off Brandt as the Chancellor.

Guillaume had been an espionage agent for East Germany, who was supervised by Markus Wolf, the head of the
Main Directorate for Reconnaissance (&quot;Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung&quot; or HVA—the foreign intelligence service) of the East German Ministry for State Security. Wolf stated after the reunification that the resignation of Brandt had never been intended, and that the planting and handling of Guillaume had been one of the biggest mistakes of the East German secret services.

Brandt was succeeded as the Chancellor of the Bundesrepublik by his fellow Social Democrat, Helmut Schmidt. For the rest of his life, Brandt remained suspicious that his fellow Social Democrat (and longtime rival) Herbert Wehner had been scheming for Brandt&#x27;s downfall. However, there is scant evidence to corroborate this suspicion.

== Post-Chancellorship ==

After his term as the Chancellor, Brandt retained his seat in the Bundestag, and he remained the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party through 1987. Beginning in 1987, Brandt stepped down to become the Honorary Chairman of the party. Brandt was also a member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1983.

=== Socialist International ===

For sixteen years (1976–92), Brandt was the president of the Socialist International. During that period, the number of Socialist International&#x27;s mainly European member parties grew until there were more than a hundred socialist, social democratic, and labour political parties around the world. For the first seven years, this growth in SI membership had been prompted by the efforts of the Socialist International&#x27;s Secretary-General, the Swede Bernt Carlsson. However, in early 1983, a dispute arose about what Carlsson perceived as the SI president&#x27;s authoritarian approach. Carlsson then rebuked Brandt saying: &quot;this is a Socialist International – not a German International&quot;.

Next, against some vocal opposition, Brandt decided to move the next Socialist International Congress from Sydney, Australia to Portugal. Following this SI Congress in April 1983, Brandt retaliated against Carlsson by forcing him to step down from his position. However, the Austrian Chancellor, Bruno Kreisky, argued on behalf of Brandt: &quot;It is a question of whether it is better to be pure or to have greater numbers&quot;.
Carlsson was succeeded by the Finn Pentti Väänänen as Secretary General of the Socialist International.

During Brandt&#x27;s presidency, the SI developed activities and dialogue on a number of International issues. This concerned the East–West conflict and arms race, on which the SI held high-level consultations with the leaderships of the United States and the Soviet Union, and on Afghanistan after 1979. The SI met with President Jimmy Carter and Vice Presidents Walter Mondale and George Bush, and with the CPSU Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev and Soviet Head of State Andrei Gromyko. The SI also developed active contacts to promote dialogue concerning regional conflicts. Those included the Middle East, where they helped to build contacts between Israel and the PLO, and also in Southern Africa and Central America.

=== Brandt Report ===
In 1977, Brandt was appointed as the chairman of the Independent Commission for International Developmental Issues. This produced a report in 1980, which called for drastic changes in the global attitude towards development in the Third World. This became known as the Brandt Report.
=== Reunification ===

In October 1979, Brandt met with the East German dissident, Rudolf Bahro, who had written &quot;The Alternative&quot;. Bahro and his supporters were attacked by the East German state security organization Stasi, headed by Erich Mielke, for his writings, which had laid the theoretical foundation of a left-wing opposition to the ruling SED party and its dependent allies, and which promoted new and changed parties. All of this is now described as &quot;change from within&quot;. Brandt had asked for Bahro&#x27;s release, and Brandt welcomed Bahro&#x27;s theories, which advanced the debate within his own Social Democratic Party.

On 11 September 1988, Brandt described the hope for German reunification as a delusion. In late 1989, Brandt became one of the first leftwing leaders in West Germany to publicly favor a quick reunification of Germany, instead of some sort of two-state federation or other kind of interim arrangement. Brandt&#x27;s public statement &quot;Now grows together what belongs together&quot;, was widely quoted in those days.

=== Hostages in Iraq ===
One of Brandt&#x27;s last public appearances was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held by Saddam Hussein, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Brandt secured the release of a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.

== Death and legacy ==
Brandt died of colon cancer at his home in Unkel, a town on the River Rhine, on 8 October 1992, at the age of 78. He was given a state funeral and was buried at the cemetery at Zehlendorf in Berlin.

The Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt Foundation was established in 1994. It serves to honor the memory of Brandt&#x27;s political accomplishments and his commitment to peace, freedom and democracy. The foundation runs two permanent exhibitions: one in Berlin, and the other in Lübeck, where Brandt was born. Other works of the foundation include oversight of Brandt&#x27;s papers, speeches and letters (the Berlin Edition), historical research as well as organizing lectures and international conferences.

In 1997, a park in Stockholm was named in Brandt&#x27;s honor. It is close to where he lived during his exile in Sweden 1941–1945.

When the SPD moved its headquarters from Bonn back to Berlin in the mid-1990s, the new headquarters was named the &quot;Willy Brandt Haus&quot;. One of the buildings of the European Parliament in Brussels was named after him in 2008.

On 6 December 2000, a memorial to Brandt and &quot;Warschauer Kniefall&quot; was unveiled in Warsaw, Poland.

German artist Johannes Heisig painted several portraits of Brandt of which one was unveiled as part of an honoring event at German Historical Institute Washington, DC on 18 March 2003. Spokesmen amongst others were former German Federal Minister Egon Bahr and former U.S. Secretary of state Henry Kissinger.

In 2009, the Willy-Brandt-Memorial was opened up in Nuremberg at the Willy-Brandt Square. It was created by the artist Josef Tabachnyk.

In 2009, the University of Erfurt renamed its graduate school of public administration as the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy. A private German-language secondary school in Warsaw, Poland, is also named after Brandt.

The main boulevard at the north entrance of the Montenegrin capital Podgorica was named Willy Brandt Boulevard in 2011.

Brandt also has an unusual memorial in Hammersmith in London, United Kingdom. In 1963, when he was mayor of West Berlin, Brandt travelled to Hammersmith with a street lamp from West Berlin, and presented it to the mayor of Hammersmith to mark its twinning with Neukölln. The lamp now stands on the wall of Westcott Lodge, facing Furnival Gardens, with a commemorative plaque below it.

Although Brandt had only served five years in office as Chancellor of Germany, he remains as one of the most popular politicians in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which opened in late 2020, is also named in his honor.

== Brandt&#x27;s family ==

From 1941 until 1948, Brandt was married to Anna Carlotta Thorkildsen (the daughter of a Norwegian father and a German-American mother). They had a daughter, Ninja Brandt (born in 1940). After Brandt and Thorkildsen were divorced in 1948, Brandt married the Norwegian-born German writer Rut Hansen in the same year. Hansen and Brandt had three sons: (born in 1948), (born in 1951) and Matthias Brandt (born in 1961). After 32 years of marriage, Willy Brandt and Rut Hansen Brandt divorced in 1980, and from the day that they were divorced they never saw each other again. On 9 December 1983, Brandt married (born in 1946).

<doc id="49261" wikidata="Q3376073" url="?curid=49261" title="Corporate personhood">
<text>Corporate personhood or juridical personality is the legal notion that a juridical person such as a corporation, separately from its associated human beings (like owners, managers, or employees), has at least some of the legal rights and responsibilities enjoyed by natural persons. In most countries, a corporation has the same rights as a natural person to hold property, enter into contracts, and to sue or be sued.

Granting non-human entities personhood is a Western concept applied to corporations.

==Early history==

Ancient Indian society used legal personhood for political, social, and economic purposes. As early as 800 BC, legal personhood was granted to guild-like &quot;śreṇī&quot; that operated in the public interest. The late Roman Republic granted legal personhood to municipalities, public works companies that managed public services, and voluntary associations (&quot;collegia&quot;) such as the early Catholic Church. The diverse collegia had different rights and responsibilities that were independent of the individual members. Some collegia resembled later medieval guilds and were allowed to advance the needs of a trade as a whole, but collegia were otherwise barred from enriching their members.

In the Middle Ages, juridical persons were chartered either as corporations or as foundations in order to facilitate collective perpetual ownership of assets beyond the founders&#x27; lifespans, and to avoid their fragmentation and disintegration resulting from personal property inheritance laws. Later on, incorporation was advocated as an efficient and secure mode of economic development: advantages over existing partnership structures included the corporation&#x27;s continuing existence if a member died; the ability to act without unanimity; and limited liability. The word &quot;corporation&quot; itself derives from the Latin &quot;corpus&quot; (&quot;body&quot;), and juridical personhood is often assumed in medieval writings; by the Renaissance period, European jurists routinely held that churches and universities chartered by the government could gain property, enter into contracts, sue, and be sued, independent of its members. The government (or the Pope) granted religious organizations &quot;the power of perpetual succession&quot;: church property would not revert to the local lord, nor be taxed, upon the death of church members. Some town charters explicitly granted medieval towns the right of self-governance. Commercial endeavors were not among the entities incorporated in the medieval era, and even risky trading companies were originally run as common-law partnerships rather than corporations; the incorporation of the East India Company monopoly in 1600 broke new ground, and by the end of the century, commercial ventures frequently sought incorporation in Europe and the Americas. By the 19th century, the direction of British and American corporate law had diverged; British law of this period (such as the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856) appeared to focus more on corporations that more closely resembled traditional joint ventures, while American law was driven by the need to manage a more diverse corporate landscape.

==Country specific laws==
===India===

Under Indian law the corporate, managing bodies, etc. and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of the &quot;legal person&quot;. In court cases regarding corporate, the shareholders are not responsible for the company&#x27;s debts but the company itself being a &quot;legal person&quot; is liable to repay those debts or be sued for the non-repayment of debts. The non-human entities given the &quot;legal person&quot; status by the law &quot;have rights and co-relative duties; they can sue and be sued, can possess and transfer property&quot;. Since these non-human entities are &quot;voiceless&quot; they are legally represented &quot;through guardians and representatives&quot; to claim their legal rights and to fulfill their legal duties and responsibilities. Specific non-human entities given the status of &quot;legal person&quot; include &quot;corporate personality, body politic, charitable unions etc.&quot;, as well as trust estates, deity, temples, churches, mosques, hospitals, universities, colleges, banks, railways, municipalities, and gram panchayats (village councils), rivers, all animals and birds.

===In the United States===

In a U.S. historical context, the phrase &quot;corporate personhood&quot; refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to juridical persons including corporations. A headnote issued by the court reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.&quot; claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&quot; (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the company&#x27;s owners&#x27; free exercise of sincerely held religious beliefs.

U.S. courts have extended certain constitutional protections to corporations under various rationales. An early perspective, variously known as &#x27;contractual&#x27;, &#x27;associate&#x27;, or &#x27;aggregate&#x27; theory, holds that owners of property have certain constitutional protections, even when the property is held via a corporation rather than directly under the owner&#x27;s own name. Corporate attorney John Norton Pomeroy argued in the 1880s that &quot;Statutes violating their prohibitions in dealing with corporations must necessarily infringe upon the rights of natural persons. In applying and enforcing these constitutional guaranties, corporations cannot be separated from the natural persons who compose them.&quot;

Similarly, proponents might argue a juridical person can be a device for exercising shareholders&#x27; rights to free speech. Under this perspective, such constitutional rights might also extend to other associations of people, even where the association does not take on the formal legal form of a corporation. A second perspective, known as the &#x27;real entity&#x27; or &#x27;natural entity&#x27; view, shifts the presumption of corporate regulation against the states.

The dominant view from the 1920s to the 1980s, championed by philosopher John Dewey, asserted that such perspectives are often overgeneralizations, and that the decision to grant corporate rights in a given sphere should be governed by the consequences of doing so. The 1980s saw an explosion of economic analyses, with a corporation often viewed as a nexus of contracts and as an economic agent appointed to act on behalf of its shareholders.

Some rulings combine multiple perspectives; the majority opinion in &quot;Citizens United&quot; argued both from an &#x27;association&#x27; perspective (&quot;if the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted... it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form&quot;) and from a &#x27;natural entity&#x27; perspective (&quot;the worth of speech &#x27;does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual).

Treating juridical persons as having legal rights allows corporations to sue and to be sued, provides a single entity for easier taxation and regulation, simplifies complex transactions that would otherwise involve, in the case of large corporations, thousands of people, and protects the individual rights of the shareholders as well as the right of association.

Generally, corporations are not able to claim constitutional protections that would not otherwise be available to persons acting as a group. For example, the Supreme Court has not recognized a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for a corporation, since the right can be exercised only on an individual basis. In &quot;United States v. Sourapas and Crest Beverage Company&quot;, &quot;[a]ppellants [suggested] the use of the word &#x27;taxpayer&#x27; several times in the regulations requires the fifth-amendment self-incrimination warning be given to a corporation.&quot; The Court did not agree. Likewise, corporations and organizations do not have privacy rights under the Privacy Act of 1974, since the statute refers to any &quot;individual,&quot; which it defines as &quot;a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.&quot;

Since the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; in 2010, upholding the rights of corporations to make unlimited political expenditures under the First Amendment, there have been several calls for a Constitutional amendment to abolish corporate personhood. The &quot;Citizens United&quot; majority opinion makes no reference to corporate personhood or the Fourteenth Amendment, but rather argues that political speech rights do not depend on the identity of the speaker, which could be a person or an association of people.

Individual shareholders cannot generally sue over the deprivation of a corporation&#x27;s rights; only the board of directors has the standing to assert a corporation&#x27;s constitutional rights in court.

====Historical background in the United States====

During the colonial era, British corporations were chartered by the crown to do business in North America. This practice continued in the early United States. They were often granted monopolies as part of the chartering process. For example, the controversial Bank Bill of 1791 chartered a 20-year corporate monopoly for the First Bank of the United States. Although the Federal government has from time to time chartered corporations, the general chartering of corporations has been left to the states. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, corporations began to be chartered in greater numbers by the states, under general laws allowing for incorporation at the initiative of citizens, rather than through specific acts of the legislature.

The degree of permissible government interference in corporate affairs was controversial from the earliest days of the nation. In 1790, John Marshall, a private attorney and a veteran of the Continental Army, represented the board of the College of William and Mary, in litigation that required him to defend the corporation&#x27;s right to reorganize itself and in the process remove professors, &quot;The Rev John Bracken v. The Visitors of Wm &amp; Mary College&quot; (7 Va. 573; 1790 Supreme Court of Virginia). The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that the original Crown charter provided the authority for the corporation&#x27;s Board of Visitors to make changes including the reorganization.

As the 19th century matured, manufacturing in the U.S. became more complex as the Industrial Revolution generated new inventions and business processes. The favored form for large businesses became the corporation because the corporation provided a mechanism to raise the large amounts of investment capital large business required, especially for capital intensive yet risky projects such as railroads.

Following the reasoning of the Dartmouth College case and other precedents (see below), corporations could exercise the rights of their shareholders and these shareholders were entitled to some of the legal protections against arbitrary state action. Their cause was strengthened by the adoption of general incorporation statutes in the states in the late 19th century, most notably in New Jersey and Delaware, which allowed anyone to form corporations without any particular government grant or authorization, and thus without the government-granted monopolies that had been common in charters granted by the Crown or by acts of the legislature (see Delaware General Corporation Law). In &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot; (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied to corporations. Since then the doctrine has been repeatedly reaffirmed in case law.

====Case law in the United States====

In 1818, the United States Supreme Court decided &quot;Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; – 17 U.S. 518 (1819), writing: &quot;The opinion of the Court, after mature deliberation, is that this corporate charter is a contract, the obligation of which cannot be impaired without violating the Constitution of the United States. This opinion appears to us to be equally supported by reason, and by the former decisions of this Court.&quot; Beginning with this opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court has continuously recognized corporations as having the same rights as natural persons to contract and to enforce contracts.

Seven years after the Dartmouth College opinion, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. Town of Pawlet&quot; (1823), in which an English corporation dedicated to missionary work, with land in the U.S., sought to protect its rights to the land under colonial-era grants against an effort by the state of Vermont to revoke the grants. Justice Joseph Story, writing for the court, explicitly extended the same protections to corporate-owned property as it would have to property owned by natural persons. Seven years later, Chief Justice Marshall stated: &quot;The great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men.&quot;

In the 1886 case &quot;Santa Clara v. Southern Pacific&quot; – 118 U.S. 394 (1886), Chief Justice Waite of the Supreme Court orally directed the lawyers that the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause guarantees constitutional protections to corporations in addition to natural persons, and the oral argument should focus on other issues in the case. In the Santa Clara case the court reporter, Bancroft Davis, noted in the headnote to the opinion that the Chief Justice, Morrison Waite, began oral argument by stating, &quot;The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.&quot; While the headnote is not part of the Court&#x27;s opinion and thus not precedent, two years later, in &quot;Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania&quot; – 125 U.S. 181 (1888), the Court clearly affirmed the doctrine, holding, &quot;Under the designation of &#x27;person&#x27; there is no doubt that a private corporation is included [in the Fourteenth Amendment]. Such corporations are merely associations of individuals united for a special purpose and permitted to do business under a particular name and have a succession of members without dissolution.&quot; This doctrine has been reaffirmed by the Court many times since.

The 14th Amendment does not insulate corporations from all government regulation, any more than it relieves individuals from all regulatory obligations. Thus, for example, in &quot;Northwestern Nat Life Ins. Co. v. Riggs&quot; (203 U.S. 243 (1906)), the Court accepted that corporations are for legal purposes &quot;persons&quot;, but still ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment was not a bar to many state laws which effectively limited a corporation&#x27;s right to contract business as it pleased. However, this was not because corporations were not protected under the Fourteenth Amendment—rather, the Court&#x27;s ruling was that the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit the type of regulation at issue, whether of a corporation or of sole proprietorship or partnership.

====Legislation in the United States====

Federal statutes that refer to &quot;persons&quot; generally include both natural and juridical ones, unless a different definition is given. This general rule of interpretation is specified in Title 1, section 1 of the U.S. Code, known as the Dictionary Act, which states:
In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise—

the words &quot;person&quot; and &quot;whoever&quot; include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals;
This federal statute has many consequences. For example, a corporation may enter contracts, sue and be sued, and be held liable under both civil and criminal law. Because the corporation is legally considered the &quot;person&quot;, individual shareholders are not legally responsible for the corporation&#x27;s debts and damages. Similarly, individual employees, managers, and directors are liable for their own malfeasance or lawbreaking while acting on behalf of the corporation, but are not generally liable for the corporation&#x27;s actions. 

Among the most frequently discussed and controversial consequences of corporate personhood in the United States is the extension of a limited subset of the same constitutional rights.

Corporations as juridical persons have always been able to perform commercial activities, similar to a person acting as a sole proprietor, such as entering into a contract or owning property. Therefore, corporations have always had a &quot;juridical personality&quot; for the purposes of conducting business while shielding individual shareholders from personal liability (i.e. protecting personal assets which were not invested in the corporation).

Ralph Nader, Phil Radford and others have argued that a strict originalist philosophy should reject the doctrine of corporate personhood under the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed, Chief Justice William Rehnquist repeatedly criticized the Court&#x27;s invention of corporate constitutional &quot;rights&quot;, most famously in his dissenting opinion in the 1978 case &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot;; though, in &quot;Bellotti&quot;, Rehnquist&#x27;s objections are based on his &quot;views of the limited application of the First Amendment to the States&quot; and not on whether corporations qualify as &quot;persons&quot; under the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, these justices&#x27; rulings have continued to affirm the assumption of corporate personhood, as the Waite court did, and Justice Rehnquist himself eventually endorsed the right of corporations to spend in elections (the majority view in &quot;Bellotti&quot;) in his dissenting opinion in &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot;.

====Corporate political spending====
A central point of debate in recent years has been what role corporate money plays and should play in democratic politics. This is part of the larger debate on campaign finance reform and the role which money may play in politics.

In the United States, legal milestones in this debate include:
* Tillman Act of 1907, banned corporate political contributions to national campaigns.
* Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, campaign financing legislation.
* 1974 Amendments to Federal Election Campaign Act provided for first comprehensive system of regulation, including limitations on the size of contributions and expenditures and prohibitions on certain entities from contributing or spending, disclosure, creation of the Federal Election Commission as a regulatory agency, and government funding of presidential campaigns. 
* &quot;Buckley v. Valeo,&quot; 424 U.S. 1 (1976) upheld limits on campaign contributions, but held that spending money to influence elections is protected speech by the First Amendment.
* &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot; (1978) upheld the rights of corporations to spend money in non-candidate elections (i.e. ballot initiatives and referendums).
* &quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot; (1990) upheld the right of the state of Michigan to prohibit corporations from using money from their corporate treasuries to support or oppose candidates in elections, noting: &quot;[c]orporate wealth can unfairly influence elections.&quot;
* Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (McCain–Feingold), banned corporate funding of issue advocacy ads which mentioned candidates close to an election.
* &quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot; (2003), substantially upheld McCain–Feingold.
* &quot;Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.&quot; (2007) weakened McCain–Feingold, but upheld core of McConnell.
* &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,&quot; 558 U.S. 844 (2010): the Supreme Court of the United States held that corporate funding of independent broadcasts of films about political subjects when there is an upcoming election cannot be limited under the First Amendment, overruling &quot;Austin&quot; (1990) and partly overruling &quot;McConnell&quot; (2003).
* &quot;Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Attorney General of Montana&quot; (2012). U.S. Supreme Court summary reversal of a decision by the Montana Supreme Court holding that &quot;Citizens United&quot; did not preclude a Montana state law prohibiting corporate spending in elections.

The corporate personhood aspect of the campaign finance debate turns on &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; (1976) and &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; (2010): &quot;Buckley&quot; ruled that political spending is protected by the First Amendment right to free speech, while &quot;Citizens United&quot; ruled that corporate political spending is protected, holding that corporations have a First Amendment right to free speech because they are &quot;associations of citizens&quot; and hold the collected rights of the individual citizens who constitute them.

<doc id="49263" wikidata="Q790453" url="?curid=49263" title="Lake Baringo">
<text>Lake Baringo is, after Lake Turkana, the most northern of the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes, with a surface area of and an elevation of . The lake is fed by several rivers: the Molo, Perkerra and Ol Arabel. It has no obvious outlet; the waters are assumed to seep through lake sediments into the faulted volcanic bedrock. It is one of the two freshwater lakes in the Rift Valley in Kenya, the other being Lake Naivasha.

The lake is in a remote hot and dusty area with over 470 species of birds, occasionally including migrating flamingos. A Goliath heronry is located on a rocky islet in the lake known as Gibraltar.

The existence of Lake Baringo was first reported in Europe by Ludwig Krapf and J. Rebmann, German missionaries stationed at Mombasa, about 1850; in J. H. Speke’s map of the Nile sources (1863) Baringo is confused with Kavirondo Gulf of Victoria Nyanza; it figures in Sir H. M. Stanley’s map (1877) as a large sheet of water N.E. of Victoria Nyanza. Joseph Thomson, in his journey through the Masai country in 1883, was the European to see the lake and to correct the exaggerated notions as to its size. Native tradition, however, asserts that the lake formerly covered a much larger area.

==Description==
The lake is part of the East African Rift system. The Tugen Hills, an uplifted fault block of volcanic and metamorphic rocks, lies west of the lake. The Laikipia Escarpment lies to the east.

Water flows into the lake from the Mau Hills and Tugen Hills. It is a critical habitat and refuge for more than 500 species of birds and fauna, some of the migratory waterbird species being significant regionally and globally. The lake also provides a habitat for seven fresh water fish species. One, &quot;Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis&quot; (a Nile tilapia subspecies), is endemic to the lake. Lake fishing is important to local social and economic development. Additionally the area is a habitat for many species of animals including the hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus amphibius&quot;), Nile crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot;) and many other mammals, amphibians, reptiles and the invertebrate communities.

While stocks of Nile tilapia in the lake are now low, the decline of this species has been mirrored by the success of another, the marbled lungfish (&quot;Protopterus aethiopicus&quot;) which was introduced to the lake in 1974 and which now provides the majority of fish from the lake. Water levels have been reduced by droughts and over-irrigation. The lake is commonly turbid with sediment, partly due to intense soil erosion in the catchment area, especially on the Loboi Plain south of the lake.

A characteristic of the country in the neighbourhood of the lake are the &quot;hills&quot; of the termites (white ants). They are hollow columns 10 to 12 ft. high and from 1 ft. to 18 in. broad. The greater kudu, almost unknown elsewhere in East Africa, inhabits the flanks of the Laikipia escarpment to the east of the lake and comes to the foot-hills around Baringo to feed.

A recent study showed that there were both positive and negative relationships between some water quality parameters and the prevalence of recovered parasites. &quot;O. niloticus baringoensis&quot; from Lake Baringo also recorded high parasite prevalence and this calls for sensitization of the public on the risks that may arise from the consumption of undercooked infected fish.

The lake has several small islands, the largest being Ol Kokwe Island. Ol Kokwe, an extinct volcanic centre related to Korosi volcano north of the lake, has several hot springs and fumaroles, some of which have precipitated sulfur deposits. A group of hot springs discharge along the shoreline at Soro near the northeastern corner of the island.

Several important archaeological and palaeontological sites, some of which have yielded fossil hominoids and hominins, are present in the Miocene to Pleistocene sedimentary sequences of the Tugen Hills.

The main town near the lake is Marigat, while smaller settlements include Kampi ya Samaki and Loruk. The area is increasingly visited by tourists and is situated at the southern end of a region of Kenya inhabited largely by pastoralist ethnic groups including Il Chamus, Rendille, Turkana and Kalenjin. Accommodation, (hotels, self-catering cottages and camping sites) as well as boating services are available at and near Kampi-Ya-Samaki on the western shore, as well as on several of the islands in the lake.

A Kenyan Government report in 2021 estimated that the surface area of Lake Baringo had increased by over 100% to 268 square kilometres over the period 2010–2020. Lakeside villages were flooded and people displaced. There have also been increases in animal populations such as crocodiles, along with interactions between these animals and people.

<doc id="49266" wikidata="Q152802" url="?curid=49266" title="Buchenwald concentration camp">
<text>Buchenwald (; &#x27;beech forest&#x27;) was a German Nazi concentration camp established on Ettersberg hill near Weimar, Germany, in July 1937. It was one of the first and the largest of the concentration camps within the Altreich (Old Reich) territories. Many actual or suspected communists were among the first internees.

Prisoners came from all over Europe and the Soviet Union, and included Jews, Poles, and other Slavs, the mentally ill, and physically disabled, political prisoners, Romani people, Freemasons, and prisoners of war. There were also ordinary criminals and those perceived as sexual deviants by the Nazi regime. All prisoners worked primarily as forced labor in local armaments factories. The insufficient food and poor conditions, as well as deliberate executions, led to 56,545 deaths at Buchenwald of the 280,000 prisoners who passed through the camp and its 139 subcamps. 

The camp gained notoriety when it was liberated by the United States Army in April 1945; Allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower visited one of its subcamps.

From August 1945 to March 1950, the camp was used by the Soviet occupation authorities as an internment camp, NKVD special camp Nr. 2, where 28,455 prisoners were held and 7,113 of whom died. Today the remains of Buchenwald serve as a memorial and permanent exhibition and museum.

==Establishment==

The &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) established Buchenwald concentration camp at the beginning of July 1937. The camp was to be named Ettersberg, after the hill in Thuringia upon whose north slope the camp was established. The proposed name was deemed inappropriate because it carried associations with several important figures in German culture, especially Enlightenment writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who had lived in Weimar. Instead the camp was to be named Buchenwald, in reference to the beech forest in the area. However, Holocaust researcher wrote that SS leaders chose the site of the camp precisely to erase the cultural legacy of the area. After the area of the camp was cleared of trees, only one large oak remained, supposedly one of Goethe&#x27;s Oaks.

The camp, designed to hold 8,000 prisoners, was intended to replace several smaller concentration camps nearby, including , Sachsenburg, and Lichtenburg. Compared to these camps, Buchenwald had a greater potential to profit the SS because the nearby clay deposits could be made into bricks by the forced labor of prisoners. The first prisoners arrived on 15 July 1937, and had to clear the area of trees and build the camp&#x27;s structures. By September, the population had risen to 2,400 following transfers from Bad Sulza, Sachsenburg, and Lichtenburg.

On the camp&#x27;s main gate, the motto &quot;Jedem das Seine&quot; (English: &quot;To each his own&quot;), was inscribed. The SS interpreted this to mean the &quot;master race&quot; had a right to humiliate and destroy others. It was designed by Buchenwald prisoner and Bauhaus architect Franz Ehrlich, who used a Bauhaus typeface for it, even though Bauhaus was seen as degenerate art by the National Socialists and was prohibited. This defiance however went unnoticed by the SS.

==Command structure==
===Organization===
Buchenwald&#x27;s first commandant was SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Karl-Otto Koch, who ran the camp from 1 August 1937 to July 1941. His second wife, Ilse Koch, became notorious as &quot;Die Hexe von Buchenwald&quot; (&quot;the witch of Buchenwald&quot;) for her cruelty and brutality. In February 1940 Koch had an indoor riding hall built by the prisoners who died by the dozen due to the harsh conditions of the construction site. The hall was built inside the camp, near the canteen, so that oftentimes Ilse Koch could be seen riding in the morning to the beat of the prisoner orchestra. Koch himself was eventually imprisoned at Buchenwald by the Nazi authorities for incitement to murder. The charges were lodged by Prince Waldeck and Morgen, to which were later added charges of corruption, embezzlement, black market dealings, and exploitation of the camp workers for personal gain. Other camp officials were charged, including Ilse Koch. The trial resulted in Karl Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS; he was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945, one week before American troops arrived. Ilse Koch was acquitted by the SS court and released. However, she was rearrested by American occupation authorities in June 1945, and chosen as one of 31 Buchenwald defendants to stand trial before a Military Commission Court at Dachau. The life sentence imposed by the Dachau court was reduced to four years upon review. Upon her release from U.S. custody in October 1949, she was arrested by West German authorities, tried at Augsburg, and again sentenced to life imprisonment; she committed suicide in Aichach (Bavaria) prison in September 1967. The second commandant of the camp, between 1942 and 1945, was Hermann Pister (1942–1945). He was tried in 1947 (Dachau Trials) and sentenced to death, but on 28 September 1948 he died in Landsberg Prison of a heart attack.

===Female prisoners and overseers===

The number of women held in Buchenwald was somewhere between 500 and 1,000. The first female inmates were twenty political prisoners who were accompanied by a female SS guard (&quot;Aufseherin&quot;); these women were brought to Buchenwald from Ravensbrück in 1941 and forced into sexual slavery at the camp&#x27;s brothel. The SS later fired the SS woman on duty in the brothel for corruption; her position was taken over by &quot;brothel mothers&quot; as ordered by SS chief Heinrich Himmler.

The majority of women prisoners, however, arrived in 1944 and 1945 from other camps, mainly Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, and Bergen Belsen. Only one barracks was set aside for them; this was overseen by the female block leader (&quot;Blockführerin&quot;) Franziska Hoengesberg, who came from Essen when it was evacuated. All the women prisoners were later shipped out to one of Buchenwald&#x27;s many female satellite camps in Sömmerda, Buttelstedt, Mühlhausen, Gotha, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Lippstadt, Weimar, Magdeburg, and Penig, to name a few. No female guards were permanently stationed at Buchenwald.

Contrary to popular opinion, the notorious &quot;Bitch of Buchenwald&quot; Ilse Koch never served in any official capacity at the camp, nor ever acted as guard. In total, however, more than 530 women served as guards in the vast Buchenwald system of subcamps and external commands across Germany. Only 22 women served/trained in Buchenwald, compared to over 15,500 men.

===Subcamps===

About 136 subcamps and satellite commandos belonged to Buchenwald concentration camp.

In 1942, the SS began to use its forced labor supply for armaments production. Because it was more economical to rent out prisoners to private firms, subcamps were set up near factories which had a demand for prisoner labor. Private firms paid the SS between 4 and 6 Reichsmarks per day per prisoner, resulting in an estimated 95,758,843 Reichsmarks in revenue for the SS between June 1943 and February 1945. So the subcamps of Buchenwald were mainly used for armament production and other fabrications and are considered labour camps. Conditions were worse than at the main camp, with prisoners provided insufficient food and inadequate shelter.

==Allied POWs==
Although it was highly unusual for German authorities to send Western Allied POWs to concentration camps, Buchenwald held a group of 168 aviators for two months. These men were from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica. They all arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.

All these airmen were in aircraft that had crashed in occupied France. Two explanations are given for them being sent to a concentration camp: first, that they had managed to make contact with the French Resistance, some were disguised as civilians, and they were carrying false papers when caught; they were therefore categorized by the Germans as spies, which meant their rights under the Geneva Convention were not respected. The second explanation is that they had been categorised as &quot;Terrorflieger&quot; (&quot;terror aviators&quot;). The aviators were initially held in Gestapo prisons and headquarters in France. In April or August 1944, they and other Gestapo prisoners were packed into covered goods wagons and sent to Buchenwald. The journey took five days, during which they received very little food or water.

==Victims==

===Causes of death===
A primary cause of death was illness due to harsh camp conditions. Like all concentration camps, prisoners at Buchenwald were deliberately kept in a state of starvation, many while performing grueling forced labor, making consequent illnesses prevalent. Malnourished and suffering from disease, many were literally &quot;worked to death&quot; under the &quot;Vernichtung durch Arbeit&quot; policy (extermination through labor), as inmates only had the choice between slave labor or inevitable execution. Many inmates were killed by human experimentation or fell victim to arbitrary acts perpetrated by the SS guards. Other prisoners were simply murdered, primarily by shooting and hanging. As part of Action 14f13, prisoners deemed too weak or sick to work were sent to Sonnenstein Killing Facility, where they were murdered with carbon monoxide gas.

Walter Gerhard Martin Sommer was an SS-&quot;Hauptscharführer&quot; who served as a guard at the concentration camps of Dachau and Buchenwald. Known as the &quot;Hangman of Buchenwald&quot;, he was considered a depraved sadist who reportedly ordered Otto Neururer and Mathias Spanlang, two Austrian priests, to be crucified upside-down. Sommer was especially infamous for hanging prisoners from trees by their wrists, which had been tied behind their backs (a torture technique known as strappado) in the &quot;singing forest&quot;, so named because of the screams which emanated from this wooded area.

Summary executions of Soviet POWs were also carried out at Buchenwald. At least 1,000 men were selected in 1941–42 by a task force of three Dresden Gestapo officers and sent to the camp for immediate liquidation by a gunshot to the back of the neck, the infamous &quot;Genickschuss&quot;.

The camp was also a site of large-scale trials for vaccines against epidemic typhus in 1942 and 1943. In all 729 inmates were used as test subjects, of whom 154 died. Other &quot;experimentation&quot; occurred at Buchenwald on a smaller scale. One such experiment aimed at determining the precise fatal dose of a poison of the alkaloid group; according to the testimony of one doctor, four Soviet POWs were administered the poison, and when it proved not to be fatal they were &quot;strangled in the crematorium&quot; and subsequently &quot;dissected&quot;. Among various other experiments was one which, in order to test the effectiveness of a balm for wounds from incendiary bombs, involved inflicting &quot;very severe&quot; white phosphorus burns on inmates. When challenged at trial over the nature of this testing, and particularly over the fact that the testing was designed in some cases to cause death and only to measure the time which elapsed until death was caused, one Nazi doctor&#x27;s defence was that, although a doctor, he was a &quot;legally appointed executioner&quot;.

===Number of deaths===

The SS left behind accounts of the number of prisoners and people coming to and leaving the camp, categorizing those leaving them by release, transfer, or death. These accounts are one of the sources of estimates for the number of deaths in Buchenwald. According to SS documents, 33,462 died. These documents were not, however, necessarily accurate: Among those executed before 1944, many were listed as &quot;transferred to the Gestapo&quot;. Furthermore, from 1941, Soviet POWs were executed in mass killings. Arriving prisoners selected for execution were not entered into the camp register and therefore were not among the 33,462 dead listed.

One former Buchenwald prisoner, Armin Walter, calculated the number of executions by the number of shootings in the spine at the base of the head. His job at Buchenwald was to set up and care for a radio installation at the facility where people were executed; he counted the numbers, which arrived by telex, and hid the information. He says that 8,483 Soviet prisoners of war were shot in this manner.

According to the same source, the total number of deaths at Buchenwald is estimated at 56,545. This number is the sum of:
* Deaths according to material left behind by the SS: 33,462
* Executions by shooting: 8,483
* Executions by hanging (estimate): 1,100
* Deaths during evacuation transports (estimate): 13,500

This total (56,545) corresponds to a death rate of 24 percent, assuming that the number of persons passing through the camp according to documents left by the SS, 240,000 prisoners, is accurate.

==Liberation==


In April 1945 an Alsos Mission team was searching for a German nuclear physicist near Weimar, eastern Germany. Taking a side road through woods to avoid German forces, they struck a ghastly smell from a clearing, and saw a barbed wire enclosure with a few pathetic figures and piles of corpses. Before continuing their mission they broke secrecy protocol to radio a request for the Army to send medical help. A group of survivors had just taken control of the camp from the few remaining Nazi guards. The four-man team was under linguist Hugh Montgomery and included Corporal Rick Carrier. Montgomery recalled the survivors made a final request: &quot;Please give the guards to us, and we’ll take care of them ... And I’m sure they did&quot;. Montgomery later joined the CIA, and took part in Operation Gold in Berlin.

On 4 April 1945 the U.S. 89th Infantry Division overran Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald.

Buchenwald was partially evacuated by the Germans from 6 to 11 April 1945. In the days before the arrival of the American army, thousands of the prisoners were forcibly evacuated 
on foot.
Thanks in large part to the efforts of Polish engineer (and short-wave radio-amateur, his pre-war callsign was SP2BD) Gwidon Damazyn, an inmate since March 1941, a secret short-wave transmitter and small generator were built and hidden in the prisoners&#x27; movie room. On 8 April at noon, Damazyn and Russian prisoner Konstantin Ivanovich Leonov sent the Morse code message prepared by leaders of the prisoners&#x27; underground resistance (supposedly Walter Bartel and Harry Kuhn):

The text was repeated several times in English, German, and Russian. Damazyn sent the English and German transmissions, while Leonov sent the Russian version. Three minutes after the last transmission sent by Damazyn, the headquarters of the U.S. Third Army responded:

According to Teofil Witek, a fellow Polish prisoner who witnessed the transmissions, Damazyn fainted after receiving the message.
As American forces closed in, Gestapo headquarters at Weimar telephoned the camp administration to announce that it was sending explosives to blow up any evidence of the camp, including its inmates. The Gestapo did not know that the administrators had already fled. A prisoner answered the phone and informed headquarters that explosives would not be needed, as the camp had already been blown up, which was not true.

A detachment of troops of the U.S. 9th Armored Infantry Battalion, from the 6th Armored Division, part of the U.S. Third Army, and under the command of Captain Frederic Keffer, arrived at Buchenwald on 11 April 1945 at 3:15 p.m. (now the permanent time of the clock at the entrance gate). The soldiers were given a hero&#x27;s welcome, with the emaciated survivors finding the strength to toss some liberators into the air in celebration.

Later in the day, elements of the U.S. 83rd Infantry Division overran Langenstein, one of a number of smaller camps comprising the Buchenwald complex. There, the division liberated over 21,000 prisoners, ordered the mayor of Langenstein to send food and water to the camp, and hurried medical supplies forward from the 20th Field Hospital.

Third Army Headquarters sent elements of the 80th Infantry Division to take control of the camp on the morning of Thursday 12 April 1945. Several journalists arrived on the same day, perhaps with the 80th, including Edward R. Murrow, whose radio report of his arrival and reception was broadcast on CBS and became one of his most famous:

===Civilian tour===
After Patton toured the camp, he ordered the mayor of Weimar to bring 1,000 citizens to Buchenwald; these were to be predominantly men of military age from the middle and upper classes. The Germans had to walk roundtrip under armed American guard and were shown the crematorium and other evidence of Nazi atrocities. The Americans wanted to ensure that the German people would take responsibility for Nazi crimes, instead of dismissing them as atrocity propaganda. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower also invited two groups of Americans to tour the camp in mid-April 1945; journalists and editors from some of the principal U.S. publications, and then a dozen members of the Congress from both the House and the Senate, led by Senate Majority Leader Alben W. Barkley.

War correspondent Osmar White reported that above the crematorium door was a verse beginning &#x27;Worms shall not devour me, but flames consume this body. I always loved the heat and light…&#x27;.

==Aftermath==
===Buchenwald trial===

Thirty SS perpetrators at Buchenwald were tried before a US military tribunal in 1947, including Higher SS and Police Leader Josias Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont, who oversaw the SS district that Buchenwald was located in, and many of the doctors responsible for Nazi human experimentation. Almost all of the defendants were convicted, and 22 were sentenced to death. However, only nine death sentences were carried out, and by the mid-1950s, all perpetrators had been freed except for Ilse Koch, who was tried by a West German court and given a life sentence. Additional perpetrators were tried before German courts during the 1960s.

===The site===

Between August 1945 and 1 March 1950, Buchenwald was the site of NKVD special camp Nr. 2, where the Soviet secret police imprisoned former Nazis and anti-communist dissidents. According to Soviet records, 28,455 people were detained, 7,113 of whom died. After the NKVD camp closed, much of the camp was razed, while signs were erected to provide a Soviet interpretation of the camp&#x27;s legacy. The first monument to victims was erected by Buchenwald inmates days after the initial liberation. It was made of wood and only intended to be temporary. A second monument to commemorate the dead was erected in 1958 by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) government near the mass graves. It was inaugurated on 14 September 1958 by GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl. Inside the camp, there is a stainless steel monument on the spot where the first, temporary monument stood. Its surface is maintained at , the temperature of human skin, all year round.

The three National Memorials of the GDR, built next to or on the sites of the former concentration camps Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Ravensbrück, played a central role in the GDR&#x27;s remembrance policy under Erich Honecker. They were controlled by the Ministry of Culture and thus by the government. According to their statute, these memorials served as places of identification and legitimisation of the GDR. The political instrumentalisation of these memorials, especially for the current needs of the GDR, became particularly clear during the major celebrations of the liberation of the concentration camps, as historian Anne-Kathleen Tillack-Graf analysis in her thesis about the official party newspaper .

Today the Buchenwald camp site serves as a Holocaust memorial. It has a museum with permanent exhibitions about the history of the camp. It is managed by Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, which also looks after the camp memorial at Mittelbau-Dora.

===Literature===

Survivors who have written about their camp experiences include Jorge Semprún, who in &quot;Quel beau dimanche!&quot; describes conversations involving Goethe and Léon Blum, and Ernst Wiechert, whose &quot;Der Totenwald&quot; was written in 1939 but not published until 1945, and which likewise involved Goethe. Scholars have investigated how camp inmates used art to help deal with their circumstances, and according to Theodor Ziolkowski writers often did so by turning to Goethe. Artist Léon Delarbre sketched, besides other scenes of camp life, the Goethe Oak, under which he used to sit and write. One of the few prisoners who escaped from the camp, the Belgian Edmond Vandievoet, recounted his experiences in a book whose English title is &quot;I escaped from a Nazi Death Camp&quot; [Editions Jourdan, 2015]. In his work &quot;Night&quot;, Elie Wiesel talks about his stay in Buchenwald, including his father&#x27;s death. Jacques Lusseyran, a leader in the underground resistance to the German occupation of France, was eventually sent to Buchenwald after being arrested, and described his time there in his autobiography.

===Visit from President Obama and Chancellor Merkel===

On 5 June 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Buchenwald after a tour of Dresden Castle and Church of Our Lady. During the visit they were accompanied by Elie Wiesel and Bertrand Herz, both survivors of the camp. , the director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation and honorary professor of University of Jena, guided the four guests through the remainder of the site of the camp. During the visit Wiesel, who together with Herz were sent to the Little camp as 16-year-old boys, said, &quot;if these trees could talk.&quot; His statement marked the irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horrors that took place within the camp. President Obama mentioned during his visit that he had heard stories as a child from his great uncle, who was part of the 89th Infantry Division, the first Americans to reach the camp at Ohrdruf, one of Buchenwald&#x27;s satellites. Obama was the first sitting US President to visit the Buchenwald concentration camp.

<text>Tove Marika Jansson (; 9 August 1914 – 27 June 2001) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish author, novelist, painter, illustrator and comic strip author. Brought up by artistic parents, Jansson studied art from 1930 to 1938 in Helsinki, Stockholm, and Paris. She held her first solo art exhibition in 1943. Over the same period, she penned short stories and articles for publication, and subsequently drew illustrations for book covers, advertisements, and postcards. She continued her work as an artist and writer for the rest of her life.

Jansson wrote the &quot;Moomin&quot; novel series for children, starting with the 1945 &quot;The Moomins and the Great Flood&quot;. The following two books, &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot; and &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot;, published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, were highly successful, and sales of the first book increased correspondingly. For her work as a children&#x27;s author she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966; among her many later awards was the Selma Lagerlöf Prize in 1992. Her Moomin stories have been adapted for the theatre, the cinema, and as an opera.

She held a solo exhibition of paintings in 1955, and five more between 1960 and 1970. She carried out several commissions for murals in public buildings around Finland between 1945 and 1984. She created the illustrations both for her own books and for classics including &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. 

Starting with the semi-autobiographical (&quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) in 1968, Jansson wrote six novels, including the admired (&quot;The Summer Book&quot;), and five short story collections for adults.

== Early life ==

Tove Jansson was born in Helsinki, in the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire at the time. Her family, part of the Swedish-speaking minority of Finland, was an artistic one: her father, Viktor Jansson, was a sculptor, and her mother, Signe Hammarsten-Jansson, was a Swedish-born graphic designer and illustrator. Tove&#x27;s siblings also became artists: Per Olov Jansson became a photographer and Lars Jansson an author and cartoonist. Whilst their home was in Helsinki, the family spent many of their summers in a rented cottage on one of the islands of Pellinki near Porvoo, east of Helsinki; The Söderskär Lighthouse island off Porvoo in the Gulf of Finland may have helped to inspire her later books, such as &quot;Moominpappa at Sea&quot;.

Jansson went to Finland&#x27;s first co-educational school, in Helsinki. She then studied at Konstfack (University College of Arts, Crafts and Design), in Stockholm in 1930–1933, the Graphic School of the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in 1933–1937, and finally at and in Paris in 1938. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1943.

At age 14, Jansson wrote and illustrated her first picture book (&quot;Sara and Pelle and Neptune&#x27;s Children&quot;). It was not published until 1933. She also sold drawings that were published in magazines in the 1920s.

In the 1930s Jansson made several trips to other European countries. She drew from these for her short stories and articles, which she also illustrated, and which were also published in magazines, periodicals and daily papers. During this period, Jansson also designed many book covers, adverts and postcards. Following her mother&#x27;s example, she drew illustrations for &quot;Garm&quot;, a Finnish-Swedish political and satirical magazine.

== Work ==

=== Moomins ===

Jansson is principally known as the author of the Moomin books. Jansson created the Moomintrolls, a family who are white, round and smooth in appearance, with large snouts that make them vaguely resemble hippopotamuses. She first drew a deliberately ugly creature as a caricature of Immanuel Kant, the philosopher; a kinder version became the Moomintroll. The first book, &quot;The Moomins and the Great Flood&quot;, was published in 1945. Although the primary characters are Moominmamma and Moomintroll, most of the principal characters of later stories were only introduced in the next book, so &quot;The Moomins and the Great Flood&quot; is frequently considered a forerunner to the main series. The book was not a success, but the next two installments in the Moomin series, &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot; (1946) and &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot; (1948), brought Jansson some fame.

The style of the Moomin books changed as time went by. The first books, written starting during the Second World War, up to &quot;Moominland Midwinter&quot; (1957), are adventure stories that include floods, comets and supernatural events. &quot;The Moomins and the Great Flood&quot; deals with Moominmamma and Moomintroll&#x27;s flight through a dark and scary forest, where they encounter various dangers. In &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot;, a comet nearly destroys the Moominvalley. Some critics have considered this an allegory of nuclear weapons. &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot; deals with adventures brought on by the discovery of a magician&#x27;s hat. &quot;The Exploits of Moominpappa&quot; (1950) tells the story of Moominpappa&#x27;s adventurous youth and cheerfully parodies the genre of memoir. Finally, &quot;Moominsummer Madness&quot; (&quot;Farlig midsommar&quot;, 1955) is set in a theatre: the Moomins explore the empty building and perform Moominpappa&#x27;s melodrama. 

&quot;Moominland Midwinter&quot; marks a turning point in the series. Jansson described it as a book about “what it is like when things get difficult”: the story focuses on Moomintroll, who wakes up in the middle of the winter (Moomins hibernate from November to April), and has to cope with the strange and unfriendly world he finds. The short story collection &quot;Tales from Moominvalley&quot; (1962) and the novels &quot;Moominpappa at Sea&quot; (1965) and &quot;Moominvalley in November&quot; (1970) are serious and psychologically searching books, far removed from the light-heartedness and cheerful humor of &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot;. &quot;Moominvalley in November&quot;, in which the Moomin family themselves never appear, is especially sombre in tone, possibly in consequence of the death of Jansson&#x27;s mother during the year that it was written. Because of this, it has been described as being a &quot;textbook on letting go, being a mature orphan, existing spiritually alone&quot;. Following this book, Jansson stated that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t go back and find that happy Moominvalley again&quot; and so decided to stop writing the Moomin books.

In addition to the Moomin novels and short stories, Tove Jansson wrote and illustrated four picture books: &quot;The Book about Moomin, Mymble and Little My&quot; (1952), &quot;Who will Comfort Toffle?&quot; (1960), &quot;The Dangerous Journey&quot; (1977) and &quot;An Unwanted Guest&quot; (1980). As the Moomins&#x27; fame grew, two of the original novels, &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot; and &quot;The Exploits of Moominpappa&quot;, were revised by Jansson and republished.
Critics have interpreted various Moomin characters as being inspired by real people, especially members of the author&#x27;s family and close friends, and Jansson spoke in interviews about the backgrounds of, and possible models for, her characters. The personality of Tuulikki Pietilä, Jansson&#x27;s partner, inspired the character Too-Ticky in &quot;Moominland Midwinter&quot;, while Moomintroll and Little My have been seen as psychological self-portraits of the artist. The Moomins relate strongly to Jansson&#x27;s own family – they were bohemian and lived close to nature. Jansson remained close to her mother until her mother&#x27;s death in 1970; even after Tove had become an adult, the two often traveled together, and during her final years Signe lived with Tove part-time. Moominpappa and Moominmamma are often seen as portraits of Jansson&#x27;s parents.

=== Other writing ===
Jansson&#x27;s first foray outside children&#x27;s literature was &quot;Bildhuggarens dotter&quot; (&quot;Sculptor&#x27;s Daughter&quot;), a semi-autobiographical novel published in 1968. She went on to write five more novels for adults, including (&quot;The Summer Book&quot;) and five collections of short stories. &quot;The Summer Book&quot; is the best known of her adult fiction; it describes the summer stay on an island of a young girl and her grandmother. The girl is modelled on her niece, Sophia Jansson; the girl&#x27;s father on Sophia&#x27;s father, Lars Jansson; and the grandmother on Tove&#x27;s mother Signe.

===Wartime satire in &quot;Garm&quot; magazine===

Tove Jansson worked as an illustrator and cartoonist for the Swedish-language satirical magazine &quot;Garm&quot; from 1929 to 1953, when the magazine ceased production. One of her political cartoons achieved a brief international fame: she drew Adolf Hitler as a crying baby in diapers, surrounded by Neville Chamberlain and other great European leaders, who tried to calm the baby down by giving it slices of cake – Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. In the Second World War, during which Finland fought against the Soviet Union, part of the time cooperating with Nazi Germany, her cover illustrations for &quot;Garm&quot; lampooned both Hitler and Joseph Stalin: in one, Stalin draws his sword from his impressively long scabbard, only to find it absurdly short; in another, multiple Hitlers ransack a house, carrying away food and artworks. In &quot;The Spectator&quot;″s view, Jansson made both &quot;Hitler and Stalin appear as preposterous little figures, self-important and comic&quot;.

=== Comic strip artist ===

Her earliest comic strips were created for productions including (, 1929), (&#x27;, 1930), and (, 1933).

The figure of the Moomintroll appeared first in Jansson&#x27;s political cartoons, where it was used as a signature character near the artist&#x27;s name. This &quot;Proto-Moomin&quot;, then called Snork or Niisku, was thin and ugly, with a long, narrow nose and devilish tail. Jansson said that she had designed the Moomins in her youth: after she lost a philosophical quarrel about Immanuel Kant with one of her brothers, she drew &quot;the ugliest creature imaginable&quot; on the wall of their outhouse and wrote under it &quot;Kant&quot;. This Moomin later gained weight and a more pleasant appearance, but in the first Moomin book &quot;The Moomins and the Great Flood&quot; (originally ), the Immanuel-Kant-Moomin is still perceptible. The name &quot;Moomin&quot; comes from Tove Jansson&#x27;s uncle, Einar Hammarsten: when she was studying in Stockholm and living with her Swedish relatives, her uncle tried to stop her pilfering food by telling her that a &quot;Moomintroll&quot; lived in the kitchen closet and breathed cold air down people&#x27;s necks.

In 1952, after &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot; and &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot; had been translated into English, a British newspaper man, Charles Sutton, asked if Tove Jansson would be interested in drawing comic strips about the Moomins. Jansson accepted the offer. The comic strip &quot;Moomintroll&quot; started in the London &quot;Evening News&quot;, which had a circulation of 12 million at that time, making it the world&#x27;s largest daily newspaper. The strip spread to hundreds of other newspapers in 12 countries.

=== Painter and illustrator ===

==== Paintings ====

Although she became known first and foremost as an author, Tove Jansson considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She painted throughout her life. She exhibited during the 1930s and early 1940s, holding her first solo exhibition in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews, criticism induced Jansson to refine her style; her 1955 solo exhibition was simpler in detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 she held five more solo exhibitions. The National Biography of Finland describes Jansson as going &quot;against the conventional image of an artist with her unusually even balance between visual art and writing.&quot;

==== Murals ====

Throughout her career, Jansson created a series of commissioned murals and public works which may still be viewed in their original locations, including:

* The canteen at the factory at , Helsinki (1945)
* The Aurora Children&#x27;s Hospital in Helsinki
* The hotel at Hamina
* The &quot;Wise and Foolish Virgins&quot; altarpiece in Teuva Church (1954)
* Fairy-tale murals in schools, including the kindergarten in Pori (1984)

==== Illustrations ====

As well as illustrating her own books, Jansson illustrated Swedish translations of classics such as Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

She created a set of illustrations for the 1962 Swedish edition of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The scholar of literature Björn Sundmark states that Jansson&#x27;s work helped to define how Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth fantasy could be depicted visually. The edition with her illustrations was not reprinted for many years, even though reviewers and &quot;Tolkienists&quot; liked Jansson&#x27;s &quot;expressive&quot; images. Sundmark suggests that the reason was that in the 1960s, a new, more realistic style became the norm for fantasy art.

=== Adaptations ===

Several stage productions have been made from Jansson&#x27;s Moomin series, including a number that Jansson herself was involved in. The earliest production was a 1949 theatrical version of &quot;Comet in Moominland&quot; performed at Åbo Svenska Teater. In the early 1950s, Jansson collaborated on Moomin-themed children&#x27;s plays with Vivica Bandler. In 1952, Jansson designed stage settings and dresses for &quot;Pessi and Illusia&quot;, a ballet by Ahti Sonninen () which was performed at the Finnish National Opera. By 1958, Jansson began to become directly involved in theater as Lilla Teater produced (&quot;Troll in the wings&quot;), a play with lyrics by Jansson and music composed by Erna Tauro. The production was a success, despite the actors&#x27; difficulties speaking through their bulbous &quot;Moominsnouts&quot;, and later performances were held in Sweden and Norway.

In 1974 the first Moomin opera was produced, with music composed by Ilkka Kuusisto. The Moomintrolls have been adapted to media including television animations such as the 1990 Moomin series, and feature films.

== Personal life ==

Jansson had several male lovers, including the political philosopher Atos Wirtanen, and briefly became engaged to him. He was the inspiration for the Moomin character Snufkin. However, she eventually &quot;went over to the spook side&quot; as she is said to have put it —a coded expression for homosexuality—and developed a secret love affair with the married theater director Vivica Bandler.
In 1956 Jansson met her lifelong partner, , known as &quot;Tooti&quot;. In Helsinki they lived apart but nearby, so they could meet unnoticed, but this did not resolve the problem that Jansson&#x27;s mother often came to stay. They found a partial solution by building a house on a small island in the Gulf of Finland, and staying there for the summer. Jansson&#x27;s and Pietilä&#x27;s travels and summers spent together on the Klovharu island in Pellinki have been captured on several hours of film, shot by Pietilä. Several documentaries have been made of this footage, the latest being (&quot;Haru, the lonely island&quot;) (1998) and (&quot;Tove and Tooti in Europe&quot;) (2004). The character Too-ticky, described by Sue Prideaux as &quot;a wild-haired artistic troll in a Breton sweater and a beret&quot;, was inspired by Pietilä.

Jansson died on 27 June 2001 at the age of 86. She is buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

Tuulikki Pietila died eight years later.

== Cultural legacy ==

=== Documentaries and exhibitions of her work ===

In 1968, Swedish public TV, SVT, made a documentary about Tove called &quot;Moomins and the Sea&quot; (39 min.). Jansson&#x27;s books, originally written in Swedish, have been translated into 45 languages. The Moomin Museum in Tampere displays much of Jansson&#x27;s work on the Moomins. There is a Moomin theme park named Moomin World in . In 2012, the BBC broadcast a one-hour documentary on Jansson, &quot;Moominland Tales: The Life of Tove Jansson&quot;. A Moominvalley Park opened at Hannō, Japan in 2019.

In March 2014, the Ateneum Art Museum opened a major centenary exhibition showcasing Jansson&#x27;s works as an artist, an illustrator, a political caricaturist and the creator of the Moomins. The exhibition drew nearly 300,000 visitors in six months. After Helsinki the exhibition embarked on a tour in Japan to visit five Japanese museums. 

In January 2016, a permanent Tove Jansson exhibition of murals, an oil painting, photographs and sketches opened at the Helsinki Art Museum. The two murals, &quot;Party in the Countryside&quot; and &quot;Party in the City&quot; were created for Helsinki City Hall&#x27;s restaurant. From June 2017 to September 2017, an exhibition of Jansson&#x27;s paintings, illustrations, and cartoons was held in Kunstforeningen Gammel Strand in Copenhagen in collaboration with Ateneum in Helsinki. The exhibition then moved from October 2017 to January 2018 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. This was the first major retrospective exhibition of her work in the United Kingdom.

A biopic, titled &quot;Tove&quot;, directed by Zaida Bergroth was released in October 2020.

=== Commemorations ===

Jansson was selected as the main motif in the 2004 minting of a Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 Tove Jansson and Finnish Children&#x27;s Culture commemorative coin. The obverse depicts a combination of her portrait and the skyline, an artist&#x27;s palette, a crescent and a sailing boat. The reverse features three Moomin characters. In 2014 she was again featured on a commemorative coin, this time of €20, becoming the only person other than the former Finnish president to be granted two such coins. She was featured on a €2 commemorative coin that entered general circulation in June 2014. Since 1988, Finland&#x27;s Post has released several postage stamp sets and one postal card with Moomin motifs. In 2014, Jansson herself was featured on a Finnish stamp set. In 2014 the City of Helsinki honored Jansson by renaming a park near her childhood home in &quot;Tove Jansson&#x27;s Park&quot; (, ). The city has placed a memorial plaque to Jansson at her home in Ullanlinnankatu, Helsinki.

With a new animated series, &quot;Moominvalley&quot; broadcast in 2019, Rhianna Pratchett wrote an article about the impact Jansson had had on her father, the science fiction author Terry Pratchett; he called Jansson one of the greatest children&#x27;s writers ever, and credited her writing as one of the reasons he became an author.&#x27;
