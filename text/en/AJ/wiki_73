<text>Paul Leonard Newman (January 26, 1925 – September 26, 2008) was an American actor, film director, racing car driver, philanthropist, and entrepreneur. He was the recipient of numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Silver Bear, a Cannes Film Festival Award, and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.

Born in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and raised in Shaker Heights, the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, Newman showed an interest in theater as a child and at age 10 performed in a stage production of &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; at the Cleveland Play House. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in drama and economics from Kenyon College in 1949. After touring with several summer stock companies including the Belfry Players, Newman attended the Yale School of Drama for a year before studying at the Actors Studio under Lee Strasberg. His first starring Broadway role was in William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot; in 1953.

Newman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (1986). His Oscar-nominated performances were in 
&quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1958), &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961), &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; (1981), &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1994), and &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002). He also starred in such films as &quot;Harper&quot; (1966), &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), &quot;Slap Shot&quot; (1977), and &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot; (1981). He also voiced Doc Hudson in &quot;Cars&quot; (2006).

Newman won several national championships as a driver in Sports Car Club of America road racing. He co-founded Newman&#x27;s Own, a food company that donated all posttax profits and royalties to charity. As of May 2021, these donations totaled over US$570 million. 
Newman continued to found charitable organizations such as the SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network in 1988 and the Safe Water Network in 2006. Newman was married twice and fathered six children. He was the husband of the actress Joanne Woodward.

== Early life and family ==
Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and raised in nearby Shaker Heights, the second son of Theresa Garth (&quot;née&quot; Fetzer, Fetzko, or Fetsko; ; 1894–1982) and Arthur Sigmund Newman Sr. (1893–1950), who ran a sporting goods store.

His father was Jewish, the son of Simon Newman and Hannah Cohn, Hungarian Jewish and Polish Jewish emigrants, from Hungary and Congress Poland, respectively.

Paul&#x27;s mother was a practitioner of Christian Science. She was born to a Roman Catholic family in Peticse, Zemplén county, in the Kingdom of Hungary, Austro-Hungarian Empire (modern Ptičie, Slovakia). Newman&#x27;s mother worked in his father&#x27;s store while raising Paul and his elder brother, Arthur.

Newman showed an early interest in the theater; his first role was at the age of seven, playing the court jester in a school production of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. At age 10, Newman performed at the Cleveland Play House in a production of &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;, and acted in their Curtain Pullers children&#x27;s theater program. Graduating from Shaker Heights High School in 1943, he briefly attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he was initiated into the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.

=== Navy service ===

Newman served in the United States Navy in World War II, in the Pacific theater. He enrolled in the Navy V-12 pilot training program at Yale University, but was dropped when his colorblindness was discovered. He later recounted that it was &quot;a bit more complicated&quot; than colorblindness. He also &quot;couldn&#x27;t do the mathematical things that being a pilot requires.&quot; A subsequent test found that he was not colorblind. Boot camp followed, with training as a radioman and rear gunner. He performed poorly as a gunner, and a friend from the service recounted in Newman&#x27;s posthumous memoir that his friends lied to Navy trainers so he could pass.

Qualifying in torpedo bombers in 1944, Aviation Radioman Third Class Newman was sent to Barbers Point, Hawaii. He was assigned to Pacific-based replacement torpedo squadrons VT-98, VT-99, and VT-100, responsible primarily for training replacement combat pilots and aircrewmen, with special emphasis on carrier landings. He later flew as a turret gunner in an Avenger torpedo bomber. As a radioman-gunner, his unit was assigned to the aircraft carrier , along with other replacements shortly before the Battle of Okinawa in the spring of 1945. The pilot of his aircraft had an earache and was grounded, as was his crew, including Newman. The rest of their squadron flew to the &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;. Days later, a kamikaze attack on the vessel killed several hundred crewmen and airmen, including other members of his unit.

In a 2011 interview, screenwriter Stewart Stern recounted that Newman drew on an incident from his Navy years as an &quot;emotional trigger to express the character&#x27;s trauma&quot; when acting in the 1956 film &quot;The Rack&quot;. He said that Newman thought back to an incident in which his best friend was sliced to pieces on an aircraft carrier by a plane&#x27;s propeller.

=== Education ===
After the war, Newman completed a Bachelor of Arts in drama and economics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, in 1949. Shortly after earning his degree, he joined summer stock companies, including the Belfry Players in Wisconsin and the Woodstock Players in Woodstock, Illinois. He toured with them for three months and developed his talents. He later attended the Yale School of Drama for one year, before moving to New York City to study under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Oscar Levant wrote that Newman initially was hesitant to leave New York for Hollywood, and that Newman had said, &quot;Too close to the cake. Also, no place to study.&quot; Newman arrived in New York City in 1951 with his first wife, Jackie Witte, taking up residence in the St. George section of Staten Island.

==Career==
=== 1953–1958: Early roles ===
He made his Broadway theatre debut in the original production of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot; with Kim Stanley in 1953. While working on the production, he met Joanne Woodward, an understudy. The two married in 1958. He also appeared in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; in 1955. In 1959, he was in the original Broadway production of &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; with Geraldine Page and three years later starred with Page in the film version. During this time Newman started acting in television. His first credited role was in a 1952 episode of &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; entitled &quot;Ice from Space&quot;. In the mid-1950s, he appeared twice on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Appointment with Adventure&quot; anthology series.

In February 1954, Newman appeared in a screen test with James Dean, directed by Gjon Mili, for &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955). Newman was tested for the role of Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron&#x27;s twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to Richard Davalos. That same year, as a last-minute replacement for Dean, he co-starred with Eva Marie Saint and Frank Sinatra in a live, color television broadcast of &quot;Our Town&quot;, which was a musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s stage play. After Dean&#x27;s death, Newman replaced Dean in the role of a boxer in a television adaptation of Hemingway&#x27;s story &quot;The Battler&quot;, written by A. E. Hotchner, that was broadcast live on October 18, 1955. That performance led to his breakthrough role as Rocky Graziano in the film &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; in 1956. The Dean connection had additional resonance. Newman was cast as Billy the Kid in &quot;The Left Handed Gun&quot;, which was a role originally earmarked for Dean. Additionally, Dean was originally cast to play the role of Rocky Graziano in &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;; however, with his death, Newman got the role.

Newman&#x27;s first film for Hollywood was &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954), co-starring Italian actress Pier Angeli. The film was a box-office failure, and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it. In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me.&quot; That year, he also played the lead in Arnold Laven&#x27;s &quot;The Rack&quot;. In 1957, Newman worked again with director Wise in &quot;Until They Sail&quot;. Also that year, he acted in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;The Helen Morgan Story&quot;.

=== 1958–1979: Career stardom and acclaim ===

In 1958, he starred in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; opposite Elizabeth Taylor. The film was a box-office smash, and Newman garnered his first Academy Award nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; with his future wife, Joanne Woodward, with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won Best Actor at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival for this film. He and Woodward also appeared on screen earlier in 1958 in the Playhouse 90 television play &quot;The 80 Yard Run.&quot; The couple would go on to make a total of 16 films together.

In 1959, Newman starred in &quot;The Young Philadelphians&quot;, a film that co-starred Barbara Rush, Robert Vaughn and Alexis Smith, and was directed by Vincent Sherman. He also co-starred with Woodward in the film &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys!.&quot; In 1960, he starred in &quot;Exodus&quot; and co-starred with Woodward in &quot;From the Terrace.&quot;

In 1961, he starred in Robert Rossen&#x27;s &quot;The Hustler.&quot; The film, which was based on a book of the same name by Walter Tevis, tells the story of small-time pool hustler &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson (Newman), who challenges a legendary pool player (Jackie Gleason). The film was a critical and financial hit. In the best actor category Newman won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Argentinian Film Festival, at the Academy Awards he was nominated. Stanley Kauffmann, writing for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, praised the principal cast, calling Newman &quot;first-rate&quot;.

Also that year, he co-starred with Woodward in &quot;Paris Blues.&quot;

In 1963, he starred in &quot;Hud&quot; and co-starred with Woodward in &quot;A New Kind of Love.&quot; In 1966, he starred in &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; and &quot;Harper.&quot;

In 1967, he starred in Martin Ritt&#x27;s &quot;Hombre.&quot; The film received many good reviews. Also that year, he starred in Stuart Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;. Newman was nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;&quot;Luke&quot; is the first Newman character to understand himself well enough to tell us to shove off. He&#x27;s through risking his neck to make us happy. With this film, Newman completes a cycle of five films over six years, and together they have something to say about the current status of heroism&quot;.

In 1968, Newman directed &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; starring Woodward and based on Margaret Laurence&#x27;s &quot;A Jest of God.&quot; According to Woodward, Newman didn&#x27;t like the book and had no intention of directing the film. He changed his mind when Woodward couldn&#x27;t find any other director. To do the project, the pair accepted a deferred payment. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture and won two Golden Globes including Best Director.

In 1969, Newman co-starred with Woodward in James Goldstone&#x27;s car racing film &quot;Winning.&quot; It was one of the top-grossing film that year in the US reaching the thirteenth position and grossed $14,644,335.

Also that year, he teamed up with fellow actor Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. Prior to even writing a script, scriptwriter William Goldman talked to Newman about his ideas on approaching the subject matter. Once a script was completed, actor Steve McQueen who read it called Newman suggesting that they star in it together. Newman, assuming he would play the character of Sundance, suggested that they jointly buy the intellectual property to which McQueen hesitated. It was eventually bought by producer Paul Monash, and Newman was cast as Butch, which created a title change and Redford as Sundance. Newman explained that for the scene where his character performs bicycle tricks a stuntman was hired who left director Hill unsatisfied; Newman had to perform the tricks. Furthermore, Newman explained that it was him and Goldman who developed the musical interlude. The film was a success, grossing over $15 million at the box office, and it was fourth highest-grossing film of the year. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for Best Picture as well as winning and receiving nominations in other categories.

Finally that year, along with Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier, Newman formed First Artists Production Company so actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves.

In 1970, Newman produced and co-starred with Woodward in Stuart Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;WUSA,&quot; based on Robert Stone&#x27;s novel &quot;A Hall of Mirrors.&quot; Newman and his partner John Foreman purchased the rights for $50,000. The film flopped both commercially and critically. However, Newman later said that it is &quot;the most significant film I&#x27;ve ever made and the best&quot;.
In 1971, Newman directed and starred in &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; based on Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel. Although several directors were considered, it was announced that Newman would direct. However, Richard A. Colla was signed to direct the film in May 1970. Five weeks after principal photography began, Colla left the project due to &quot;artistic differences over photographic concept&quot;, as well as a required throat operation. At the same time, Newman broke his ankle and the production shut down As co-executive producer, Newman considered replacing Colla with George Roy Hill, but Hill declined the offer, so when filming resumed two weeks later, Newman was directing. 
Also that year, Newman hosted David Winters&#x27; made-for-TV documentary &quot;Once Upon a Wheel&quot;. Winters said that at the time Newman had publicly stated he didn&#x27;t want to do television and turned it down for this reason until he pitched his vision to him. Newman, a race car enthusiast, said, &quot;The show gives me a chance to get close to a sport I&#x27;m crazy about, I love to test a car on my own, to see what I can do, but racing with 25 other guys is a whole different thing. There are so many variable, the skill demanded is tremendous.&quot; Bob Bondurant, Newman&#x27;s driving instructor who appears in the film, explained that &quot;Once Upon a Wheel&quot; was a passion project for Newman &quot;because he wanted to learn how to drive&quot;, and that he refused projects that would have paid him a much larger salary. The project marked Newman&#x27;s return to television after a decade long absence, and his first time as the lead of a program. During post-production, Winters said that Newman, who liked what he saw, gave him the idea to add some footage to sell it as a theatrical film worldwide. Upon its release, the documentary generally received good reviews for its directing, pace, photography, music, and human interest stories.

In 1972, Newman&#x27;s vehicles produced by First Artists included &quot;Pocket Money&quot; and &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot;. Also that year, Newman directed &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;, the screen version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name&quot;.&quot; It was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, and Joanne Woodward won the best actress award.

In 1973, Newman reunited with director George Roy Hill and fellow actor Robert Redford in &quot;The Sting&quot;. The film made over $68,000,000 in the North American box office, and was the highest-grossing film of 1974. For his participation, Newman received top billing, $500,000 and a percentage of the profits. The film was awarded Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

In 1974, Newman co-starred with Steve McQueen in John Guillermin&#x27;s disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. Newman plays an architect stuck in a skyscraper he designed that catches fire. Newman was paid $1,000,000 plus a percentage of the gross, and he insisted he do his own stunts. The film was a success and its North American gross was $55,000,000.

In 1975, his third film with First Artists was the &quot;Harper&quot; sequel &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;, in which Woodward appeared.

In 1977, he reunited with director Hill in the hockey sport comedy &quot;Slap Shot.&quot; At the time of its release the film received mixed reviews, many saying that it was &quot;setting a new standard in its use of obscenities&quot;. Years later on Home Video and cable showings the film gained a cult status.

=== 1980–1999 ===
In 1980, Newman directed the television screen version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;The Shadow Box&quot;. In 1981, he acted in Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;. He starred in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Verdict&quot; in 1982. The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture, and Newman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1984, Newman starred in and directed &quot;Harry &amp; Son&quot;.

In 1986, twenty-five years after &quot;The Hustler&quot;, Newman reprised his role of &quot;Fast Eddie&quot; Felson in the Martin Scorsese-directed film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, for which he finally received the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film was a commercial success although it received mixed reviews. Newman starred alongside Tom Cruise, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and John Turturro. In mid-1987, Newman sued Universal Pictures for allegedly failing to properly account for revenues from video distribution of four of his films made for Universal, and Universal owed him at least $1 million participation for the home video versions of &quot;The Sting&quot;, &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, &quot;Winning&quot; and &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;. The complaint claimed that Universal accounted for the cassette revenues in a way that improperly decreased amounts due to Newman, with the actor wanting a full accounting along with $2 million in damages.

Also in 1987, Newman directed a screen version of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; starring his wife, Joanne Woodward, John Malkovich, and Karen Allen. The film was in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a reverent record&quot; of the Williams play &quot;one watches with a kind of distant dreaminess rather than an intense emotional involvement&quot;, and cited the &quot;brilliant performances ... well defined by Newman&#x27;s direction&quot;.

In 1990, Newman co-starred with Woodward in the James Ivory film adaptation &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot; based on the Evan S. Connell novel of the same name. In 1994, Newman played alongside Tim Robbins as the character Sidney J. Mussburger in the Coen brothers comedy &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;, which received mixed reviews. Also that year, he acted in Robert Benton&#x27;s &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; earning yet another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

=== 2000–2008 ===
In 2003, Newman appeared in a Broadway revival of Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;, receiving a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination for his performance. PBS and the cable network Showtime aired a taping of the production, and Newman was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie. Newman&#x27;s last live-action movie appearance was as a conflicted mob boss in the Sam Mendes directed film &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (2002) opposite Tom Hanks, Jude Law, and Stanley Tucci. For his performance he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Although he continued to provide voice work for movies, Newman&#x27;s last live-action appearance was in the 2005 HBO mini-series &quot;Empire Falls&quot; (based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Richard Russo), in which he played the dissolute father of the protagonist, Miles Roby, and for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.

In keeping with his strong interest in car racing, he provided the voice of Doc Hudson, a retired anthropomorphic race car, in &quot;Cars&quot; (2006). This was his final role in a major feature film, as well as his only animated film role. Almost nine years after his death, he received billing as Doc Hudson in &quot;Cars 3&quot; (2017), his appearance made through the use of archive recordings. Newman retired from acting in May 2007, saying: &quot;You start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that&#x27;s pretty much a closed book for me.&quot; He came out of retirement to record narration for the 2007 documentary &quot;Dale&quot;, about the life of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, and for the 2008 documentary &quot;The Meerkats&quot;, his final film role overall.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Newman was married twice. His first marriage was to Jackie Witte from 1949 to 1958. They had a son, Scott (19501978), and two daughters, Susan (born 1953) and Stephanie Kendall (born 1954). Scott, who appeared in films including &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot; (1975), and &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; (1977) died in November 1978 from a drug overdose. Newman started the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in memory of his son. Susan is a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist, and has Broadway and screen credits, including a starring role as one of four Beatles fans in &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; (1978), and also a small role opposite her father in &quot;Slap Shot&quot;. She also received an Emmy nomination as co-producer of his telefilm, &quot;The Shadow Box&quot;.

Newman met actress Joanne Woodward in 1953, on the production of &quot;Picnic&quot; on Broadway. It was Newman&#x27;s debut; Woodward was an understudy. Shortly after filming &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; in 1957, he divorced Witte to marry Woodward. The Newmans moved to East 11th Street in Manhattan, before buying a home and raising their family in Westport, Connecticut. They were one of the first Hollywood movie star couples to choose to raise their families outside California. They remained married for 50 years until his death in 2008. Woodward has said &quot;He&#x27;s very good looking and very sexy and all of those things, but all of that goes out the window and what is finally left is, if you can make somebody laugh... And he sure does keep me laughing.&quot; Newman has attributed their relationship success to &quot;some combination of lust and respect and patience. And determination.&quot;

They had three daughters: Elinor &quot;Nell&quot; Teresa (b. 1959), Melissa &quot;Lissy&quot; Stewart (b. 1961), and Claire &quot;Clea&quot; Olivia (b. 1965). Newman was well known for his devotion to his wife and family. When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, &quot;Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?&quot; He also said that he never met anyone who had as much to lose as he did. In his profile on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go. Newman directed Nell alongside her mother in the films &quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; and &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;. Newman and Woodward also acted as mentors to Allison Janney. They met her while she was a freshman at Kenyon College during a play Newman was directing.

Film critic Shawn Levy, in his biography &quot;Paul Newman: A Life&quot; (2009), alleged that Newman had an affair in the late 1960s with divorcée Nancy Bacon, a Hollywood journalist, that lasted one and a half years. In an article in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, which stated also that Levy&#x27;s claims &quot;caused outrage&quot; and were widely considered &quot;an attempt to sully the image of a revered cinematic legend and committed philanthropist&quot;, the affair was reportedly denied by a friend of Newman&#x27;s wife, Joanne, who said she was upset by the claim. Levy criticised the tabloid newspaper, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, which had a long-standing feud with Newman, for focusing on and emphasizing this aspect of his biography.

He and Woodward were the subject of a 2022 docuseries by Ethan Hawke, &quot;The Last Movie Stars&quot;, which was broadcast on HBO Max. The docuseries was based upon tapes compiled by his friend, Stewart Stern, for a memoir that Newman abandoned but which was published in 2022 as &quot;The Extraordinary Life of An Ordinary Man.&quot; Laura Linney voiced Woodward and George Clooney voiced Newman.

=== Jewish identity ===
Even though Newman followed the pluralistic Unitarian Universalism movement as an adult, he called himself a Jew, &quot;because it&#x27;s more of a challenge&quot;. When he applied to Kenyon College after the Navy he gave his religion as &quot;Christian Scientist&quot;, but apart from that he did not deny that he was Jewish. He recounted in his posthumous memoirs having a &quot;strong sense of otherness&quot; as a youth because he was half-Jewish. His heritage &quot;got in the way of my sitting at the &#x27;A&#x27; table, which was important to me,&quot; but he received no instruction on his Jewish heritage. He only knew that &quot;if you were Jewish, some avenues were shut to you,&quot; and that &quot;hurt me and my brother a great deal.&quot; Newman deflected the pain with humor, sometimes doing Yiddish voices &quot;for laughs.&quot; He was excluded from a high school fraternity because he was Jewish, and got into a &quot;bloody fight&quot; in the Navy because a sailor used an anti-Semitic slur. A family friend recounted that the &quot;stigma&quot; of being Jewish was strong in Shaker Heights at the time. &quot;Paul didn&#x27;t seem Jewish at all, but he paid a price, he had a rough time.&quot;

After he began appearing in films, Newman made a point of not changing his name. When he was being considered for the role of Terry Malloy in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, producer Sam Spiegel asked him to &quot;get rid of &#x27;Paul Newman&#x27;&quot;. Newman&#x27;s response to Spiegel, who sometimes was credited as &quot;S.P. Eagle&quot;, was &quot;What do you want me to change it to, &#x27;S.P. Ewman&#x27;?&quot;

=== Illness and death ===
Newman was scheduled to make his professional stage directing debut with the Westport Country Playhouse&#x27;s 2008 production of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, but he stepped down on May 23, 2008, citing his health concerns.

In June 2008, it was widely reported in the press that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was receiving treatment for the condition at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. A. E. Hotchner, who partnered in the 1980s with Newman to start Newman&#x27;s Own, told the Associated Press in an interview in mid-2008 that Newman had told him about being afflicted with the disease about 18 months earlier. Newman&#x27;s spokesman told the press that the star was &quot;doing nicely&quot;, but neither confirmed nor denied that he had cancer. Newman was a heavy cigarette smoker for most of his life until he quit in 1986.

Newman died at his home in Westport, Connecticut, on the morning of September 26, 2008, at the age of 83. He was cremated after a private funeral service.

==Philanthropy==
With writer A. E. Hotchner, Newman founded Newman&#x27;s Own, a line of food products, in 1982. The brand started with salad dressing and has expanded to include pasta sauce, lemonade, popcorn, salsa, and wine, among other things. Newman established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity. He co-wrote a memoir about the subject with Hotchner, &quot;Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good&quot;. Among other awards, Newman&#x27;s Own co-sponsors the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award, a $25,000 reward designed to recognize those who protect the First Amendment as it applies to the written word.

One beneficiary of his philanthropy is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a residential summer camp for seriously ill children located in Ashford, Connecticut, which Newman co-founded in 1988. It is named after the gang in his film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), and the real-life, historic Hole-in-the-Wall outlaw hangout in the mountains of northern Wyoming. Newman&#x27;s college fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau, adopted his Connecticut Hole in the Wall camp as their &quot;national philanthropy&quot; in 1995. The original camp has expanded to become several Hole in the Wall Camps in the U.S., Ireland, France, and Israel. In 1988, Newman founded the SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network, a global family of summer camps and programs for children with serious illnesses. In 2006, Newman also co-founded Safe Water Network with John Whitehead, former chairman of Goldman Sachs, and Josh Weston, former chairman of ADP, to improve access to safe water to underserved communities around the world.

In 1983, Newman became a major donor for The Mirror Theater Ltd, alongside Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino, matching a grant from Laurance Rockefeller. Newman was inspired to invest by his connection with Lee Strasberg, as Lee&#x27;s then daughter-in-law Sabra Jones was the founder and producing artistic director of The Mirror. Paul Newman remained a friend of the company until his death and discussed at numerous times possible productions in which he could star with his wife, Joanne Woodward. In June 1999, Newman donated $250,000 to Catholic Relief Services to aid refugees in Kosovo.

On June 1, 2007, Kenyon College announced that Newman had donated $10 million to the school to establish a scholarship fund as part of the college&#x27;s $230 million fund-raising campaign. Newman and Woodward were honorary co-chairs of a previous campaign.

Newman was one of the founders of the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy (CECP). Newman was named the Most Generous Celebrity of 2008 by Givingback.org. He contributed $20,857,000 for the year of 2008 to the Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation, which distributes funds to a variety of charities.

Upon Newman&#x27;s death, the Italian newspaper (a &quot;semi-official&quot; paper of the Holy See) &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; published a notice lauding Newman&#x27;s philanthropy. It also commented that &quot;Newman was a generous heart, an actor of a dignity and style rare in Hollywood quarters.&quot;

Newman was responsible for preserving lands around Westport, Connecticut. He lobbied the state&#x27;s governor for funds for the 2011 Aspetuck Land Trust in Easton. In 2011, Paul Newman&#x27;s estate gifted land to Westport to be managed by the Aspetuck Land Trust.

==Political activism==

Newman was a lifelong Democrat, although he endorsed and voted for Independent candidate John B. Anderson in 1980, who was a liberal Republican, instead of the incumbent Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. For Newman&#x27;s support of Eugene McCarthy in 1968 (and effective use of television commercials in California) and his opposition to the Vietnam War, Newman was placed nineteenth on Richard Nixon&#x27;s enemies list, which Newman claimed was his greatest accomplishment. In 1964, he and his wife, Joanne Woodward, supported Lyndon B. Johnson for president. During the 1968 general election, Newman supported Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey and appeared in a pre-election night telethon for him. He was also described as a &quot;vocal supporter&quot; of gay rights and same-sex marriage.

Newman linked with the so-called Malibu Mafia to promote progressive issues in politics. This was a group of wealthy men in the Greater Los Angeles area who met to discuss politics. Backed by them, Newman and his wife went to Washington in 1976 to speak in favor of breaking up Big Oil into separate components. Newman supported their 1980s effort to establish a bilateral Nuclear Freeze to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the US and the Soviet Union. He said he would stand up for Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election as long as there was cold Budweiser and Nuclear Freeze involved.

In January 1995, Newman was the chief investor of a group, including the writer E.L. Doctorow and the editor Victor Navasky, that bought the progressive-left wing periodical &quot;The Nation&quot;. Newman was an occasional writer for the publication. He endorsed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He endorsed Howard Dean&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2004.

Consistent with his work for liberal causes, Newman publicly supported Ned Lamont&#x27;s candidacy in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary against Senator Joe Lieberman, and was even rumored as a candidate himself, until Lamont emerged as a credible alternative. He donated to Chris Dodd&#x27;s presidential campaign. Newman earlier donated money to Bill Richardson&#x27;s campaign for president in 2008.

Newman attended the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, and was also present at the first Earth Day event in Manhattan on April 22, 1970.

Newman was concerned about global warming and supported nuclear energy development as a solution.

==Auto racing==
Newman was an auto racing enthusiast and first became interested in motorsports (&quot;the first thing that I ever found I had any grace in&quot;) while training at the Watkins Glen Racing School for the filming of &quot;Winning&quot;, a 1969 film. According to his instructor Bob Bondurant, his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host television special &quot;Once Upon a Wheel,&quot; on the history of auto racing. Newman&#x27;s first professional event as a racer was in 1972 at Thompson International Speedway, quietly entered as &quot;P. L. Newman&quot;, by which he continued to be known in the racing community.

He was a frequent competitor in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events for the rest of the decade, eventually winning four national championships. He later drove in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans in Dick Barbour&#x27;s Porsche 935, finishing in second place. Newman reunited with Barbour in 2000 to compete in the Petit Le Mans.

From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, he drove for the &quot;Bob Sharp Racing&quot; team, racing mainly Datsuns (later rebranded as Nissans) in the Trans-Am Series. He became closely associated with the brand during the 1980s, even appearing in commercials for the brand in Japan and having a special edition of the Nissan Skyline named after him. At the age of 70 years and eight days, Newman became the oldest driver to date to be part of a winning team in a major sanctioned race, winning in his class at the 1995 24 Hours of Daytona. Among his last major races were the Baja 1000 in 2004 and the 24 Hours of Daytona once again in 2005.

During the 1976 auto racing season, Newman became interested in forming a professional auto racing team and contacted Bill Freeman, who introduced Newman to professional auto racing management, and their company specialized in Can-Am, Indy Cars, and other high-performance racing automobiles. The team was based in Santa Barbara, California, and commuted to Willow Springs International Motorsports Park for many of its testing sessions.

Their &quot;Newman Freeman Racing&quot; team was very competitive in the North American Can-Am series in its Budweiser-sponsored, Chevrolet-powered Spyder NFs. Newman and Freeman began a long and successful partnership with the Newman Freeman Racing team in the Can-Am series, which culminated in the Can-Am Team Championship trophy in 1979. Newman was associated with Freeman&#x27;s established Porsche racing team, which enabled both Newman and Freeman to compete in SCCA and IMSA racing events together, including the Sebring 12-hour endurance sports car race. This car was sponsored by Beverly Porsche/Audi. Freeman was Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s Southern Pacific National Champion during the Newman Freeman period. Later, Newman co-founded &quot;Newman/Haas Racing&quot; with Carl Haas, a Champ Car team, in 1983, going on to win eight drivers&#x27; championships under his ownership. Newman was also briefly an owner in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series when he co-founded a research and development #18 team with Hendrick Motorsports&#x27; Greg Sacks behind the wheel; the team shut down after two seasons after losing its primary sponsor. The 1996 racing season was chronicled in the IMAX film &quot;Super Speedway&quot; (1997), which Newman narrated. He was a partner in the Atlantic Championship team Newman Wachs Racing. Newman voiced Doc Hudson in &quot;Cars (2006)&quot;.

Having said he would quit &quot;when I embarrass myself&quot;, Newman competed into his 80s, winning at Lime Rock in what former co-driver Sam Posey called a &quot;brutish Corvette&quot;, which displayed his age as its number: 81. He took the pole in his last professional race, in 2007 at Watkins Glen International, and in a 2008 run at Lime Rock, arranged by friends, he reportedly still did 9/10 of his best time.

Newman was posthumously inducted into the SCCA Hall of Fame at the national convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, on February 21, 2009. Lime Rock Park&#x27;s No Name Straight was renamed Paul Newman Straight in 2022.

Newman&#x27;s racing life was chronicled in the documentary &quot;&quot; (2015).

== Awards and honors ==
Newman was nominated for an Academy Award in five different decades. In addition to awards Newman won for specific roles, he received an honorary Academy Award in 1986 for his &quot;many and memorable and compelling screen performances&quot; and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his charity work in 1994.

In 1992, Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, were recipients of Kennedy Center Honors. In 1994, the couple received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given annually by Jefferson Awards. Newman won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; and the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;.

In 1968, Newman was named Man of the Year by Harvard University&#x27;s performance group, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. The 2008 edition of &quot;Sport Movies &amp; TV – Milano International FICTS Fest&quot; was dedicated to his memory. In 2015, the U.S. Postal Service issued a &#x27;forever stamp&#x27; commemorating Newman, which went on sale on September 18, 2015. It features a 1980 photograph of Newman by photographer Steve Schapiro, accompanied by text that reads: &#x27;Actor/Philanthropist&#x27;.

Since the 1970s, Newman Day is an event celebrated at Kenyon College, Bates College, Princeton University, and some other American colleges. On Newman Day, students try to drink 24 beers in 24 hours, based on a quote attributed to Newman about there being 24 beers in a case, and 24 hours in a day, and that this is surely not a mere coincidence. In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University disassociate the event from his name, due to the fact that he did not endorse the behavior. He cited his creation in 1980 of the Scott Newman Center, &quot;dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education&quot;. Princeton disavowed any responsibility for the event, responding that Newman Day is not sponsored, endorsed, or encouraged by the university itself and is solely an unofficial event among students.

On October 26, 2017, Paul Newman&#x27;s Rolex Daytona wristwatch was auctioned in New York by Phillips Auctions for $17.5 million, making it one of the most expensive wristwatches ever sold at an auction. On September 3, 2022, Lime Rock Park, a road course in Lakeville, Connecticut, named the straight of the circuit past the Esses before The Uphill the Paul Newman Straight during the Historic Festival 40.

<text>The 22nd century BC was a century that lasted from the year 2200 BC to 2101 BC.

==Events==
*4.2-kiloyear event: A severe aridification event that probably lasts the entire 22nd century BC and causes the collapse of several Old World civilizations.
*2217 BC–2193 BC: Nomadic invasions of the Mesopotamian city of Akkad.
* c. 2200 BC: Austronesians reach the Batanes Islands of the Philippine Archipelago as part of the Austronesian Expansion. 
* c. 2218 BC: Ancient migrants from India reach Australia and mix with Indigenous Australians.
*c. 2184 BC: Possible date for the death of Pharaoh Pepi II Neferkare of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, the longest reigning monarch of history with 94 years on the throne.

<text>A programmable read-only memory (PROM) is a form of digital memory where the contents can be changed once after manufacture of the device. The data is then permanent and cannot be changed. It is one type of read-only memory (ROM). PROMs are used in digital electronic devices to store permanent data, usually low level programs such as firmware or microcode. The key difference from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM during manufacture, while with a PROM the data is programmed into them after manufacture. Thus, ROMs tend to be used only for large production runs with well-verified data. PROMs may be used where the volume required does not make a factory-programmed ROM economical, or during development of a system that may ultimately be converted to ROMs in a mass produced version. 

PROMs are manufactured blank and, depending on the technology, can be programmed at wafer, final test, or in system. Blank PROM chips are programmed by plugging them into a device called a &quot;PROM programmer&quot;. Companies can keep a supply of blank PROMs in stock, and program them at the last minute to avoid large volume commitment. These types of memories are frequently used in microcontrollers, video game consoles, mobile phones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, implantable medical devices, high-definition multimedia interfaces (HDMI) and in many other consumer and automotive electronics products. A typical PROM device is made up of an array of memory cells, each made up of a transistor, which is a bipolar transistor, connected to a fuse called a polyfuse in the emitter of the transistor. A PROM programmer is used to blow the polyfuse, programming the PROM.

== History ==
The PROM was invented in 1956 by Wen Tsing Chow, working for the Arma Division of the American Bosch Arma Corporation in Garden City, New York. The invention was conceived at the request of the United States Air Force to come up with a more flexible and secure way of storing the targeting constants in the Atlas E/F ICBM&#x27;s airborne digital computer. The patent and associated technology were held under secrecy order for several years while the Atlas E/F was the main operational missile of the United States ICBM force. The term &quot;burn&quot;, referring to the process of programming a PROM, is also in the original patent, as one of the original implementations was to literally burn the internal whiskers of diodes with a current overload to produce a circuit discontinuity. The first PROM programming machines were also developed by Arma engineers under Chow&#x27;s direction and were located in Arma&#x27;s Garden City lab and Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) headquarters.

=== One time programmable memory ===
OTP (one time programmable) memory is a special type of non-volatile memory (NVM) that permits data to be written to memory only once. Once the memory has been programmed, it retains its value upon loss of power (i.e., is non-volatile). OTP memory is used in applications where reliable and repeatable reading of data is required. Examples include boot code, encryption keys and configuration parameters for analog, sensor or display circuitry. OTP NVM is characterized, over other types of NVM like eFuse or EEPROM, by offering a low power, small area footprint memory structure. As such OTP memory finds application in products from microprocessors &amp; display drivers to Power Management ICs (PMICs).

Commercially available semiconductor antifuse-based OTP memory arrays have been around at least since 1969, with initial antifuse bit cells dependent on blowing a capacitor between crossing conductive lines. Texas Instruments developed a MOS gate oxide breakdown antifuse in 1979. A dual-gate-oxide two-transistor (2T) MOS antifuse was introduced in 1982. Early oxide breakdown technologies exhibited a variety of scaling, programming, size and manufacturing problems that prevented volume production of memory devices based on these technologies.

Another form of one-time programmable memory device uses the same semiconductor chip as an ultraviolet-erasable programmable read-only memory (UV-EPROM), but the finished device is put into an opaque package, instead of the expensive ceramic package with transparent quartz window required for erasing. These devices are programmed with the same methods as the UV EPROM parts but are less costly. Embedded controllers may be available in both field-erasable and one-time styles, allowing a cost saving in volume production without the expense and lead time of factory-programmed mask ROM chips. 

Although antifuse-based PROM has been available for decades, it wasn’t available in standard CMOS until 2001 when Kilopass Technology Inc. patented 1T, 2T, and 3.5T antifuse bit cell technologies using a standard CMOS process, enabling integration of PROM into logic CMOS chips. The first process node antifuse can be implemented in standard CMOS is 0.18 um. Since the gate oxide breakdown is less than the junction breakdown, special diffusion steps were not required to create the antifuse programming element. In 2005, a split channel antifuse device was introduced by Sidense. This split channel bit cell combines the thick (IO) and thin (gate) oxide devices into one transistor (1T) with a common polysilicon gate.

== Programming ==

A typical PROM comes with all bits reading as &quot;1&quot;. Burning a fuse bit during programming causes the bit to be read as &quot;0&quot; by &quot;blowing&quot; the fuses, which is an irreversible process. Some devices can be &quot;reprogrammed&quot; if the new data replaces &quot;1&quot;s with &quot;0&quot;s. Some CPU instruction sets (e.g. 6502) took advantage of this by defining a break (BRK) instruction with the operation code of &#x27;00&#x27;. In cases where there was an incorrect instruction, it could be &quot;reprogrammed&quot; to a BRK causing the CPU to transfer control to a patch. This would execute the correct instruction and return to the instruction after the BRK.

The bit cell is programmed by applying a high-voltage pulse not encountered during a normal operation across the gate and substrate of the thin oxide transistor (around 6V for a 2 nm thick oxide, or 30MV/cm) to break down the oxide between gate and substrate. The positive voltage on the transistor&#x27;s gate forms an inversion channel in the substrate below the gate, causing a tunneling current to flow through the oxide. The current produces additional traps in the oxide, increasing the current through the oxide and ultimately melting the oxide and forming a conductive channel from gate to substrate. The current required to form the conductive channel is around 100μA/100nm and the breakdown occurs in approximately 100μs or less.

<text>In physics, the Poynting vector (or Umov–Poynting vector) represents the directional energy flux (the energy transfer per unit area, per unit time) or &quot;power flow&quot; of an electromagnetic field. The SI unit of the Poynting vector is the watt per square metre (W/m2); kg/s3 in SI base units. It is named after its discoverer John Henry Poynting who first derived it in 1884. Nikolay Umov is also credited with formulating the concept. Oliver Heaviside also discovered it independently in the more general form that recognises the freedom of adding the curl of an arbitrary vector field to the definition. The Poynting vector is used throughout electromagnetics in conjunction with Poynting&#x27;s theorem, the continuity equation expressing conservation of electromagnetic energy, to calculate the power flow in electromagnetic fields.

==Definition==
In Poynting&#x27;s original paper and in most textbooks, the Poynting vector formula_1 is defined as the cross product
formula_2
where bold letters represent vectors and
* E is the electric field vector;
* H is the magnetic field&#x27;s auxiliary field vector or &quot;magnetizing field&quot;.
This expression is often called the &quot;Abraham form&quot; and is the most widely used. The Poynting vector is usually denoted by S or N.

In simple terms, the Poynting vector S depicts the direction and rate of transfer of energy, that is power, due to electromagnetic fields in a region of space that may or may not be empty. More rigorously, it is the quantity that must be used to make Poynting&#x27;s theorem valid. Poynting&#x27;s theorem essentially says that the difference between the electromagnetic energy entering a region and the electromagnetic energy leaving a region must equal the energy converted or dissipated in that region, that is, turned into a different form of energy (often heat). So if one accepts the validity of the Poynting vector description of electromagnetic energy transfer, then Poynting&#x27;s theorem is simply a statement of the conservation of energy.

If electromagnetic energy is not gained from or lost to other forms of energy within some region (e.g., mechanical energy, or heat), then electromagnetic energy is locally conserved within that region, yielding a continuity equation as a special case of Poynting&#x27;s theorem:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the energy density of the electromagnetic field. This frequent condition holds in the following simple example in which the Poynting vector is calculated and seen to be consistent with the usual computation of power in an electric circuit.

==Example: Power flow in a coaxial cable==
Although problems in electromagnetics with arbitrary geometries are notoriously difficult to solve, we can find a relatively simple solution in the case of power transmission through a section of coaxial cable analyzed in cylindrical coordinates as depicted in the accompanying diagram. We can take advantage of the model&#x27;s symmetry: no dependence on θ (circular symmetry) nor on &quot;Z&quot; (position along the cable). The model (and solution) can be considered simply as a DC circuit with no time dependence, but the following solution applies equally well to the transmission of radio frequency power, as long as we are considering an instant of time (during which the voltage and current don&#x27;t change), and over a sufficiently short segment of cable (much smaller than a wavelength, so that these quantities are not dependent on &quot;Z&quot;).

The coaxial cable is specified as having an inner conductor of radius &quot;R&quot;1 and an outer conductor whose inner radius is &quot;R&quot;2 (its thickness beyond &quot;R&quot;2 doesn&#x27;t affect the following analysis). In between &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2 the cable contains an ideal dielectric material of relative permittivity &quot;ε&quot;r and we assume conductors that are non-magnetic (so &quot;μ&quot; = &quot;μ&quot;0) and lossless (perfect conductors), all of which are good approximations to real-world coaxial cable in typical situations.

The center conductor is held at voltage &quot;V&quot; and draws a current &quot;I&quot; toward the right, so we expect a total power flow of &quot;P&quot; = &quot;V&quot; · &quot;I&quot; according to basic laws of electricity. By evaluating the Poynting vector, however, we are able to identify the profile of power flow in terms of the electric and magnetic fields inside the coaxial cable. The electric fields are of course zero inside of each conductor, but in between the conductors (formula_5) symmetry dictates that they are strictly in the radial direction and it can be shown (using Gauss&#x27;s law) that they must obey the following form:
formula_6
&quot;W&quot; can be evaluated by integrating the electric field from formula_7 to formula_8 which must be the negative of the voltage &quot;V&quot;:
formula_9
so that:
formula_10

The magnetic field, again by symmetry, can only be non-zero in the &quot;θ&quot; direction, that is, a vector field looping around the center conductor at every radius between &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2. &quot;Inside&quot; the conductors themselves the magnetic field may or may not be zero, but this is of no concern since the Poynting vector in these regions is zero due to the electric field&#x27;s being zero. Outside the entire coaxial cable, the magnetic field is identically zero since paths in this region enclose a net current of zero (+&quot;I&quot; in the center conductor and −&quot;I&quot; in the outer conductor), and again the electric field is zero there anyway. Using Ampère&#x27;s law in the region from &quot;R&quot;1 to &quot;R&quot;2, which encloses the current +&quot;I&quot; in the center conductor but with no contribution from the current in the outer conductor, we find at radius &quot;r&quot;:
formula_11
Now, from an electric field in the radial direction, and a tangential magnetic field, the Poynting vector, given by the cross-product of these, is only non-zero in the &quot;Z&quot; direction, along the direction of the coaxial cable itself, as we would expect. Again only a function of &quot;r&quot;, we can evaluate S(r):
formula_12
where &quot;W&quot; is given above in terms of the center conductor voltage &quot;V&quot;. The &quot;total&quot; power flowing down the coaxial cable can be computed by integrating over the entire cross section A of the cable in between the conductors:
formula_13

Substituting the earlier solution for the constant &quot;W&quot; we find:
formula_14
that is, the power given by integrating the Poynting vector over a cross section of the coaxial cable is exactly equal to the product of voltage and current as one would have computed for the power delivered using basic laws of electricity.

Other similar examples in which the &quot;P&quot; = &quot;V&quot; · &quot;I&quot; result can be analytically calculated are: the parallel-plate transmission line, using Cartesian coordinates, and the two-wire transmission line, using bipolar cylindrical coordinates.

==Other forms==
In the &quot;microscopic&quot; version of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, this definition must be replaced by a definition in terms of the electric field E and the magnetic flux density B (described later in the article).

It is also possible to combine the electric displacement field D with the magnetic flux B to get the &quot;Minkowski form&quot; of the Poynting vector, or use D and H to construct yet another version. The choice has been controversial: Pfeifer et al. summarize and to a certain extent resolve the century-long dispute between proponents of the Abraham and Minkowski forms (see Abraham–Minkowski controversy).

The Poynting vector represents the particular case of an energy flux vector for electromagnetic energy. However, any type of energy has its direction of movement in space, as well as its density, so energy flux vectors can be defined for other types of energy as well, e.g., for mechanical energy. The Umov–Poynting vector discovered by Nikolay Umov in 1874 describes energy flux in liquid and elastic media in a completely generalized view.

==Interpretation==
The Poynting vector appears in Poynting&#x27;s theorem (see that article for the derivation), an energy-conservation law:
formula_15
where Jf is the current density of free charges and &quot;u&quot; is the electromagnetic energy density for linear, nondispersive materials, given by
formula_16
where
* E is the electric field;
* D is the electric displacement field;
* B is the magnetic flux density;
* H is the magnetizing field.

The first term in the right-hand side represents the electromagnetic energy flow into a small volume, while the second term subtracts the work done by the field on free electrical currents, which thereby exits from electromagnetic energy as dissipation, heat, etc. In this definition, bound electrical currents are not included in this term and instead contribute to S and &quot;u&quot;.

For light in free space, the linear momentum density is
formula_17

For linear, nondispersive and isotropic (for simplicity) materials, the constitutive relations can be written as
formula_18
where
* &quot;ε&quot; is the permittivity of the material;
* &quot;μ&quot; is the permeability of the material.
Here &quot;ε&quot; and &quot;μ&quot; are scalar, real-valued constants independent of position, direction, and frequency.

In principle, this limits Poynting&#x27;s theorem in this form to fields in vacuum and nondispersive linear materials. A generalization to dispersive materials is possible under certain circumstances at the cost of additional terms.

One consequence of the Poynting formula is that for the electromagnetic field to do work, both magnetic and electric fields must be present. The magnetic field alone or the electric field alone cannot do any work.

==Plane waves==
In a propagating electromagnetic plane wave in an isotropic lossless medium, the instantaneous Poynting vector always points in the direction of propagation while rapidly oscillating in magnitude. This can be simply seen given that in a plane wave, the magnitude of the magnetic field H(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) is given by the magnitude of the electric field vector E(&quot;r&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) divided by &quot;η&quot;, the intrinsic impedance of the transmission medium:
formula_19
where |A| represents the vector norm of A. Since E and H are at right angles to each other, the magnitude of their cross product is the product of their magnitudes. Without loss of generality let us take &quot;X&quot; to be the direction of the electric field and &quot;Y&quot; to be the direction of the magnetic field. The instantaneous Poynting vector, given by the cross product of E and H will then be in the positive &quot;Z&quot; direction:

formula_20

Finding the time-averaged power in the plane wave then requires averaging over the wave period (the inverse frequency of the wave):
formula_21
where &quot;E&quot;rms is the root mean square (RMS) electric field amplitude. In the important case that &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is sinusoidally varying at some frequency with peak amplitude &quot;E&quot;peak, &quot;E&quot;rms is formula_22, with the average Poynting vector then given by:
formula_23
This is the most common form for the energy flux of a plane wave, since sinusoidal field amplitudes are most often expressed in terms of their peak values, and complicated problems are typically solved considering only one frequency at a time. However, the expression using &quot;E&quot;rms is totally general, applying, for instance, in the case of noise whose RMS amplitude can be measured but where the &quot;peak&quot; amplitude is meaningless. In free space the intrinsic impedance &quot;η&quot; is simply given by the impedance of free space &quot;η&quot;0 ≈377Ω. In non-magnetic dielectrics (such as all transparent materials at optical frequencies) with a specified dielectric constant &quot;ε&quot;r, or in optics with a material whose refractive index formula_24, the intrinsic impedance is found as:
formula_25

In optics, the value of radiated flux crossing a surface, thus the average Poynting vector component in the direction normal to that surface, is technically known as the irradiance, more often simply referred to as the &quot;intensity&quot; (a somewhat ambiguous term).

==Formulation in terms of microscopic fields==
The &quot;microscopic&quot; (differential) version of Maxwell&#x27;s equations admits only the fundamental fields E and B, without a built-in model of material media. Only the vacuum permittivity and permeability are used, and there is no D or H. When this model is used, the Poynting vector is defined as
formula_26
where
* &quot;μ&quot;0 is the vacuum permeability;
* E is the electric field vector;
* B is the magnetic flux.

This is actually the general expression of the Poynting vector. The corresponding form of Poynting&#x27;s theorem is
formula_27
where J is the &quot;total&quot; current density and the energy density &quot;u&quot; is given by
formula_28
where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity. It can be derived directly from Maxwell&#x27;s equations in terms of &quot;total&quot; charge and current and the Lorentz force law only.

The two alternative definitions of the Poynting &quot;vector&quot; are equal in vacuum or in non-magnetic materials, where . In all other cases, they differ in that and the corresponding &quot;u&quot; are purely radiative, since the dissipation term covers the total current, while the E × H definition has contributions from bound currents which are then excluded from the dissipation term.

Since only the microscopic fields E and B occur in the derivation of and the energy density, assumptions about any material present are avoided. The Poynting vector and theorem and expression for energy density are universally valid in vacuum and all materials.

==Time-averaged Poynting vector==

The above form for the Poynting vector represents the &quot;instantaneous&quot; power flow due to &quot;instantaneous&quot; electric and magnetic fields. More commonly, problems in electromagnetics are solved in terms of sinusoidally varying fields at a specified frequency. The results can then be applied more generally, for instance, by representing incoherent radiation as a superposition of such waves at different frequencies and with fluctuating amplitudes.

We would thus not be considering the instantaneous and used above, but rather a complex (vector) amplitude for each which describes a coherent wave&#x27;s phase (as well as amplitude) using phasor notation. These complex amplitude vectors are &quot;not&quot; functions of time, as they are understood to refer to oscillations over all time. A phasor such as is understood to signify a sinusoidally varying field whose instantaneous amplitude follows the real part of where is the (radian) frequency of the sinusoidal wave being considered.

In the time domain, it will be seen that the instantaneous power flow will be fluctuating at a frequency of 2&quot;ω&quot;. But what is normally of interest is the &quot;average&quot; power flow in which those fluctuations are not considered. In the math below, this is accomplished by integrating over a full cycle . The following quantity, still referred to as a &quot;Poynting vector&quot;, is expressed directly in terms of the phasors as:

formula_29

where ∗ denotes the complex conjugate. The time-averaged power flow (according to the instantaneous Poynting vector averaged over a full cycle, for instance) is then given by the &quot;real part&quot; of . The imaginary part is usually ignored, however, it signifies &quot;reactive power&quot; such as the interference due to a standing wave or the near field of an antenna. In a single electromagnetic plane wave (rather than a standing wave which can be described as two such waves travelling in opposite directions), and are exactly in phase, so is simply a real number according to the above definition.

The equivalence of to the time-average of the &quot;instantaneous&quot; Poynting vector can be shown as follows.

formula_30

The average of the instantaneous Poynting vector S over time is given by:
formula_31

The second term is the double-frequency component having an average value of zero, so we find:
formula_32

According to some conventions, the factor of 1/2 in the above definition may be left out. Multiplication by 1/2 is required to properly describe the power flow since the magnitudes of and refer to the &quot;peak&quot; fields of the oscillating quantities. If rather the fields are described in terms of their root mean square (RMS) values (which are each smaller by the factor formula_33), then the correct average power flow is obtained without multiplication by 1/2.

==Resistive dissipation==
If a conductor has significant resistance, then, near the surface of that conductor, the Poynting vector would be tilted toward and impinge upon the conductor. Once the Poynting vector enters the conductor, it is bent to a direction that is almost perpendicular to the surface. This is a consequence of Snell&#x27;s law and the very slow speed of light inside a conductor. The definition and computation of the speed of light in a conductor can be given. Inside the conductor, the Poynting vector represents energy flow from the electromagnetic field into the wire, producing resistive Joule heating in the wire. For a derivation that starts with Snell&#x27;s law see Reitz page 454.

==Radiation pressure==

The density of the linear momentum of the electromagnetic field is &quot;S&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2 where &quot;S&quot; is the magnitude of the Poynting vector and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in free space. The radiation pressure exerted by an electromagnetic wave on the surface of a target is given by
formula_34

==Uniqueness of the Poynting vector==
The Poynting vector occurs in Poynting&#x27;s theorem only through its divergence , that is, it is only required that the surface integral of the Poynting vector around a closed surface describe the net flow of electromagnetic energy into or out of the enclosed volume. This means that adding a solenoidal vector field (one with zero divergence) to S will result in another field that satisfies this required property of a Poynting vector field according to Poynting&#x27;s theorem. Since the divergence of any curl is zero, one can add the curl of any vector field to the Poynting vector and the resulting vector field S′ will still satisfy Poynting&#x27;s theorem.

However even though the Poynting vector was originally formulated only for the sake of Poynting&#x27;s theorem in which only its divergence appears, it turns out that the above choice of its form &quot;is&quot; unique. The following section gives an example which illustrates why it is &quot;not&quot; acceptable to add an arbitrary solenoidal field to E × H.

==Static fields==
The consideration of the Poynting vector in static fields shows the relativistic nature of the Maxwell equations and allows a better understanding of the magnetic component of the Lorentz force, . To illustrate, the accompanying picture is considered, which describes the Poynting vector in a cylindrical capacitor, which is located in an H field (pointing into the page) generated by a permanent magnet. Although there are only static electric and magnetic fields, the calculation of the Poynting vector produces a clockwise circular flow of electromagnetic energy, with no beginning or end.

While the circulating energy flow may seem unphysical, its existence is necessary to maintain conservation of angular momentum. The momentum of an electromagnetic wave in free space is equal to its power divided by &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light. Therefore, the circular flow of electromagnetic energy implies an &quot;angular&quot; momentum. If one were to connect a wire between the two plates of the charged capacitor, then there would be a Lorentz force on that wire while the capacitor is discharging due to the discharge current and the crossed magnetic field; that force would be circumferential to the central axis and thus add angular momentum to the system. That angular momentum would match the &quot;hidden&quot; angular momentum, revealed by the Poynting vector, circulating before the capacitor was discharged.

<doc id="49719" wikidata="Q1563" url="?curid=49719" title="Havana">
<text>Havana (; ) is the capital and largest city of Cuba. The heart of the La Habana Province, Havana is the country&#x27;s main port and commercial center. It is the most populous city, the largest by area, and the second largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean region. The population in 2012 was 2,106,146 inhabitants, and its area is for the capital city side and 8,475.57 km2 for the metropolitan zone. Its official population was 1,814,207 inhabitants in 2023.

Havana was founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. It served as a springboard for the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for Spanish galleons returning to Spain. King Philip III of Spain granted Havana the title of capital in 1607. Walls and forts were built to protect the city. The city is the seat of the Cuban government and various ministries, and headquarters of businesses and over 100 diplomatic offices. The governor is Reinaldo García Zapata of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). In 2009, the city/province had the third-highest income in the country.

Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado and the newer suburban districts. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa and Antares. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.

The city attracts over amillion tourists annually; (1,176,627 international tourists in 2010, a 20% increase from 2005). Old Havana was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. The city is also noted for its history, culture, architecture and monuments. As typical of Cuba, Havana experiences a tropical climate.

== Etymology ==
In 1514, Diego Velázquez founded the city San Cristóbal de la Habana, which meant &quot;Saint Christopher of the Habana&quot;. Habana was the name of the local people group. It has been theorized that the name derived from Habaguanex, who was a chief of the Native American tribe. His name is Taíno, an Arawakan language, but nothing else is known. When Habana was adapted into English, the was switched to a because of a linguistic phenomenon known as betacism, which is an assimilation of the voiced bilabial plosive and voiced labiodental fricative sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects. Usage of the word &quot;Havana&quot; in literature understandably peaked during the Spanish–American War, but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city. Havana is the prevailing name for the city found in English-language dictionaries.

== History ==

=== 16th century ===

Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de Batabanó on the banks of the Mayabeque River close to Playa Mayabeque. However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba&#x27;s south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river.

Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established two settlements on the north coast, one of them in &quot;La Chorrera&quot;, around the site of the Torreón de la Chorrera, what eventually became the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the mouth of the Almendares River. The town that became Havana originated adjacent to what was then called &quot;Puerto de Carenas&quot; (literally, &quot;Careening Port&quot;), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana&#x27;s harbor, warranted this change of location.

Pánfilo de Narváez gave Havana – the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba – its name: &quot;San Cristóbal de la Habana&quot;. The name combines &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba&#x27;s first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the &quot;Conquista&quot; of other lands.

Havana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by buccaneers, pirates, and French corsairs. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair Jacques de Sores in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities – not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive &quot;contrabando&quot; (black market) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; of Seville (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).

Ships from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city&#x27;s bay also fueled Havana&#x27;s agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.

On 20 December 1592, King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as &quot;Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies&quot; by the Spanish Crown. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.

=== 17th century ===

Havana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various Iberian architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from Canarian characteristics. During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions. The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the hospital de San Lázaro, the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.

In 1649 a fatal epidemic, brought from Cartagena in Colombia, affected a third of the population of Havana. In 1674, the works for the City Walls were started, as part of the fortification efforts. They would be completed by 1740.

By the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York City.

=== 18th century ===

During the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain&#x27;s largest and most active shipyard and only drydock in the New World.

The city was captured by the British during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The episode began on 6 June 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the Royal Navy and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years&#x27; War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.

After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas like Cartagena, Colombia a city that under the leadership of Blas de Lezo defeated a British invasion of 30,000 sailors. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of San Carlos de la Cabaña, the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after Castillo San Cristóbal (the biggest) and Castillo San Felipe del Morro both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 15 January 1796, the remains of Christopher Columbus were transported to the island from Santo Domingo. They rested there until 1898, when they were transferred to Seville&#x27;s Cathedral, after Spain&#x27;s loss of Cuba.

=== 19th century ===

As trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana&#x27;s theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the Antilles.

In 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a stretch between Havana and Bejucal, which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of Güines to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the Tacón Theatre, one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the Knights of the Golden Circle to create a &#x27;Golden Circle&#x27; with a 1200mile-radius centered on Havana. After the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.

In 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the metropolis could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish presence in the Americas.

The sinking of the U.S. battleship &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana&#x27;s harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish–American War.

=== 20th century ===

Cuba&#x27;s first presidential period under Tomás Estrada Palma from 1902 to 1906 was considered to uphold the highest standards of administrative integrity in the history of the Republic of Cuba. 

While Cuba had the highest ratio of hospital beds to population in the Caribbean, around 80% of these beds were located in the city of Havana, there was only one rural hospital and it was equipped with only 10 beds. In July 1940, during World War II, the Havana Conference was held and 21 American nations, including the host country Cuba, agreed to govern their own territories that were occupied by the Axis powers.
In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Caribbean standards, and in some cases by world standards. On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in the Americas, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure &quot;at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants&quot;, leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.

After the revolution of 1959, the new government under Fidel Castro began to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro&#x27;s abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. embargo, shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966–68, the Cuban government had nationalized all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to &quot;certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce&quot; as per law No. 1076.

In December 1982, Old Havana was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its oldest standing stone fortification system in the Americas and representation of its colonial city.

An economic downturn occurred after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the Cuban government. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe.

===21st century===

After many years of economic struggle and prohibition, the socialist government has turned to tourism for revenue and has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, a new 5-star hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry. In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists. But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.

On the night of 27 January 2019, an unusually violent and destructive tornado ripped through Havana. The tornado killed eight people and injured over 190. It was assigned an official rating of EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale by the Cuban Meteorology Institute, making this the first F4 or EF4 tornado in Cuba since 1940.

== Administration ==

The governor is Reinaldo García Zapata, he was elected on 18 January 2020.

The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer, thus Havana functions as both a city and a province of Cuba. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.

Voters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections every five years, and the Municipal Assemblies are responsible for each of the city&#x27;s boroughs. These assemblies elect the borough presidents and vice presidents, which are equivalents to mayors and vice mayors in the other provinces. There is only one political party, the Communist Party, but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates within the boroughs in turn elect members of the Provincial Council (until 2019 the Provincial Assembly), which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president appoints the Governor and Vice Governor, who serve as the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Havana and can be either elected by the council or appointed by the president with council confirmation. There are direct elections for the city&#x27;s deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People&#x27;s Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local city delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. These councils are directly responsible for the city&#x27;s neighbourhoods and wards. In addition, there is involvement of &quot;mass organizations&quot; and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People&#x27;s Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.

Havana city borders are contiguous with the Mayabeque Province on the south and east and to Artemisa Province on the west, since former La Habana Province (rural) was abolished in 2010.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Havana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the Straits of Florida, south of the Florida Keys, where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés. The Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.

There are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-meter) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of La Cabaña and El Morro, the sites of Spanish fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Castillo del Príncipe (Havana).

=== Climate ===
Havana has a tropical climate that is tempered by the island&#x27;s position in the belt of the trade winds and by the warm offshore currents. Under the Köppen climate classification, Havana has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) that closely borders on a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) and a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). Average temperatures range from in January and February to in August. The temperature seldom drops below . The lowest temperature was in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was in Bainoa, Mayabeque Province (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country. The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was Ian in 2022.

Tornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of 28 January 2019, a very rare strong EF4 tornado struck the eastern side of Havana. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195. By 4 February the death toll had increased to six, with 11 people still in critical condition.

The table lists temperature averages:

== Demography ==
By the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana. According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146. The city has an average life expectancy of 76.81 years at birth. In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with HIV/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.

Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city&#x27;s population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country&#x27;s low birth rate and high life expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.

===Ethnic breakdown===
According to the 2012 national census of Havana&#x27;s population (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term &quot;skin color&quot; instead of &quot;race&quot;).
* White: 58.4%, (Spanish descent were most common)
* &quot;Mestizo or Mulatto&quot; (mixed race): 26.4%
* Black: 15.2%
* Asian: 0.2%

As with the other Caribbean nations, there are few mestizos in Havana (and Cuba as a whole), in contrast to many other countries, because the indigenous Taíno population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in the earliest period of the Spanish conquest.

The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country&#x27;s population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure. There is a population of internal migrants to Havana nicknamed &quot;palestinos&quot; (Palestinians) (sometimes considered a racist term) who mostly hail from the eastern region of Oriente.

The city&#x27;s significant minority of Chinese, mostly of Cantonese origin, were brought in the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as well) are around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; as reported by the Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.
Between 2018, the most recent census, and the mid-Twentieth Century census of 1953, Havana&#x27;s population has grown by an estimated 87 percent, a growth rate typical of most Caribbean cities.
=== Religion ===

Roman Catholics form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río. Its patron saint is San Cristóbal (Saint Christopher), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a minor basilica, Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: Pope John Paul II (January 1998), Pope Benedict XVI (March 2012) and Pope Francis (September 2015).

The Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews, many of whom had fled Nazi persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one Orthodox, and two Conservative: one Conservative Ashkenazi and one Conservative Sephardic), Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the New York Times estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.

== Economy ==

Havana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.

The city&#x27;s economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centers in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing slave trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro&#x27;s government to spread Cuba&#x27;s industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the center of much of the nation&#x27;s industry.

The traditional sugar industry, upon which the island&#x27;s economy has been based for three centuries, is centered elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous Habanos cigars. Although the harbors of Cienfuegos and Matanzas, in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba&#x27;s primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.

In 2000, nearly 89% of the city&#x27;s officially recorded labor force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country&#x27;s highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba&#x27;s primary economic source.

Havana&#x27;s economy is still in flux, despite Raúl Castro&#x27;s embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.

=== Commerce and finance ===
After the Revolution, Cuba&#x27;s traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.

In Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the National Bank of Cuba, headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.

In the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, casinos, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.

Vedado is today Havana&#x27;s financial district, and the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area. The University of Havana is located in Vedado.

=== Tourism ===
The city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba&#x27;s proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island&#x27;s traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.

With the deterioration of Cuba – United States relations and the imposition of the trade embargo on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and Fidel Castro in particular, opposed any considerable development of tourism. In 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors to foreign capital.

Through the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as &quot;Cubanacan&quot;), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).

Havana has also been a popular health tourism destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including eye-surgery, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and orthopedics. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for retinitis pigmentosa, often known as night blindness, has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.
Havana attracts over amillion tourists annually, the Official Census for Havana reports that in 2010 the city was visited by 1,176,627 international tourists, a 20% increase from 2005.

=== Poverty and slums ===

The years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including Special Period of the 1990s. The national government does not have an official definition of poverty. The government researchers argue that &quot;poverty&quot; in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as &quot;at risk&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; using internationally accepted measures.

The generic term &quot;slum&quot; is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in &quot;solares&quot; (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns to be the &quot;precarious housing stock&quot; and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighborhoods as &quot;Atarés&quot; in Regla. People living in slums have access to the same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighborhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.

Over 9% of Havana&#x27;s population live in &quot;cuartería&quot; (&quot;solares, ciudadela&quot;), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% in refugee shelters. This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to &quot;Instituto Nacional de Vivienda&quot; (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana&#x27;s 586,768 units were considered in &quot;good&quot; condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in &quot;fair&quot; condition and 16% in &quot;poor&quot; condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, especially the highly populated districts, are in urban decay.

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===
Havana is served by José Martí International Airport. The Airport lies about south of the city center, in the municipality of Boyeros, and is the main hub for the country&#x27;s flag carrier Cubana de Aviación. The airport is Cuba&#x27;s main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.

The city is also served by Playa Baracoa Airport which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily Aerogaviota.

=== Rail ===

Havana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba – Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the Havana Suburban Railway serves the city. The main railway stations are: Central Rail Station, La Coubre Rail Station, Casablanca Station, and Estación de Tulipán.

In 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11million, but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and Santiago de Cuba, some apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches. New Chinese made and Russian made coaches for distance trains debuted in the 2010s, and some now serve suburban services.

In the 1980s there were plans for a Metro system in Havana similar to Moscow&#x27;s, as a result of the Soviet Union influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s. The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital. In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile (1.6km) of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the project was later dropped.

=== Interurban ===
An interurban line, known as the Hershey Electric Railway, built in 1917 runs from Casablanca (across the harbor from Old Havana) to Hershey and on to Matanzas.

=== Tramway ===

Havana operated a tram system until 1952, which began as a horsecar system, Ferro Carril Urbano de la Habana in 1858, merged with rival coach operator in 1863 as Empresa del Ferro-Carril Urbano y Omnibus de La Habana and later electrified in 1900 under new foreign owners as Havana Electric Railway Company. Ridership decline resulted in bankruptcy in 1950 with new owner Autobus Modernos SA abandoning the systems in favor of buses and the remaining cars were sold to Matanzas in 1952.

=== Roads ===
The city&#x27;s road network is quite extensive, and has broad avenues, main streets and major access roads to the city such as the Autopista Nacional (A1), Carretera Central and Via Blanca. The road network has been under construction and growth since the Spanish era but is undergoing a major deterioration due to low maintenance.
Motorways (autopistas) include:
* A1 – Autopista Nacional, from Havana to Santa Clara and Sancti Spiritus, with additional short sections near Santiago and Guantanamo
* A4 – Autopista Este-Oeste, from Havana to Pinar del Río
* Via Blanca, to Matanzas and Varadero
* Havana ring road (), which starts at a under the entrance to Havana Harbor
* Autopista del Mediodia, from Havana to San Antonio de los Baños
* an autopista from Havana to Melena del Sur
* an autopista from Havana to Mariel

== Education ==

The national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.

The University of Havana, located in the Vedado section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the Western Hemisphere. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría where the vast majority of today&#x27;s Cuban engineers are taught.

The Cuban National Ballet School with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.

== Landmarks and historical centers ==

== Culture ==

=== Symbols ===


The coat of arms of Havana consists of three castles that represent the three castles that defended the city: the Fuerza Castle, the Morro Castle and the Punta Castle. The key represents that Havana was the gateway to the New World. The shield, supported by an oak branch on one side and a laurel wreath on the other, symbolizes the strength of the nation, the laurel wreath, honor, and glory. These symbols represent the rights of man.
=== Architecture ===
Havana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.
The present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the Plaza del Vapor, built in 1835 by the architect of the Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba, Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of Eugenio Rayneri Piedra the architect of the El Capitolio of 1929. The Plaza del Vapor was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government. Numerous building collapses throughout the city have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance.

==== Spanish ====

Riches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key transshipment point between the new world and old world. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana (1558–1577) designed by Battista Antonelli and the Castillo del Morro (1589–1630). This sits at the entrance of Havana Bay and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.

Old Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighborhood of Centro Habana. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana&#x27;s Spanish architecture, with a diverse range of Mudéjar architecture, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Roman. The San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. The Havana cathedral (1748–1777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720–1746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751–1775).

The Iglesia del Espíritu Santo was devoted in 1638. The Espíritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs. It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity of the beautiful stone construction. The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the Spanish era it had exceptional importance, since by a Papal Bull of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of Charles III of Spain, it was declared &quot;Única Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855.&quot; (&quot;the only immune church in this city, built-in 1855.&quot;), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact. The Iglesia del Espíritu Santo&#x27;s greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration. Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the Colón Cemetery (1876) in El Vedado was built.
The Alameda de Paula was the first promenade in Cuba, designed and constructed in 1776 by Antonio Fernández Trevejo, following the instructions of the Laureano de Torres y Ayala, it was created on the site of the old Rincón refuse dump. It was an embankment with two rows of poplar trees and some benches, it became one of Havana&#x27;s most important social and cultural spaces, it was the model of the Paseo del Prado designed in 1925. It was given the name Alameda de Paula because of its proximity to the old Hospital and Iglesia of San Francisco de Paula. Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the Villa de San Cristóbal, lacking recreational sites at that time. In 1841, the stairs that gave access to the promenade were widened and several lampposts were added. In the year 2000, the Havana promenade was restored and extended until it reached the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula.

Towards the end of the 17th century, the first stone of what would be the hospital for women and the church of San Francisco de Paula was placed, the buildings were expanded in 1731 with the support and donations from the City Council and orders of the different General Captains in command of the island. In 1776, it was the most important hospital in Havana, there were several generations of famous doctors that trained here. The Presbyter of the Cathedral of Havana, don Nicolás Estévez Borges, in 1664 ordered the construction of a Hospital for Women and an adjoining church devoted to Saint Francis of Paola who was one of the founders of the Roman Catholic Order of the Minims. Both buildings were completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1730 and were rebuilt and enlarged in 1745 in the Baroque style seen today.

==== Neoclassical ====
Neoclassism was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana&#x27;s most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy &quot;Habaneros&quot; took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the &quot;Aldama Palace&quot; built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.

In 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city&#x27;s road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style.

Built in 1875, in the Reparto de las Las Murallas, (wide strip of land that remained after the city walls were demolished in 1863), it was the work of the architect Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino. Around 1880 the mansion was owned by the Count of Casa Moré. The &quot;La Flor de José Murias&quot; tobacco factory was installed in the building. Later, through the exploitation of rents, it became a tenement house. In 1951 some of its spaces were dedicated to housing. On its upper floor, the Spanish Center and the Israeli Center of Cuba had their headquarters.

The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba and the Mercado de Tacón were designed by the Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino at almost the same time, 1875 and 1876, respectively, each in a style that accommodated the particular typology (residential and commercial) thus conceiving each work with the formal element accommodating different aesthetic requirements. The property is, after the Aldama Palace, the strongest example of Cuban Neoclassicism. The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba is in the neoclassical style, perhaps only comparable in Havana – according to Alina Castellanos – to the Aldama Palace. But while the latter limits the decoration to the natural slenderness of the colonnade, in the most classical way of the Greek Parthenon, the former uses Roman and Renaissance elaborations, hence, the arcade has been projected on pillars, the building was crowned with a considerable cornice. The neoclassical decoration can also be seen in the window covers, which take alternate forms of a triangular or semicircular pediment, and glass over the door, similar to the Plaza del Vapor.
The Palacio de Aldama is a neoclassical mansion located diagonally opposite to the old Plaza del Vapor (Parque del Curita), and in front of the old Campo de Marte; present day Parque de la Fraternidad, in Havana, Cuba. Built in 1840 by the Dominican architect and engineer Manuel José Carrera, its main facade of columns spans one block on Calle Amistad between Calles Reina and Estrella.

The Royal Palm Hotel is located on the corner of San Rafael and Industria. It was inaugurated as &quot;Edificio Luis. E. del Valle&quot;, in honor of the sugar magnate who owned the building. However, it was soon sold to Canadian Wilbur E. Todgham, who turned it into the famed Royal Palm Hotel. The commercial function of the ground floor has been preserved to date, taking advantage of its excellent location on Boulevard de San Rafael. Taking into account the architectural values of this building and its socio-cultural importance within the urban landscape in which it is located, the building received a major restoration in 2000, with the support of the Provincial Council of Seville, Spain.

==== Art deco ====
The Bacardi Building (&quot;Edificio Bacardí&quot;) is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodríguez-Castells and Rafael Fernández Ruenes and completed in 1930. It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana. The building is in the art deco style that was popular internationally in the early decades of the 20th century. The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s. In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm. The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite. It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America.
Designed by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929, who in 1941 designed La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner, the López Serrano Building was the tallest residential building in Cuba until the construction of the FOCSA Building in 1956. The construction of the building was promoted by José Antonio López Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poesía.

==== Modernism ====
Known by buildings of high-quality, modernist architecture transformed much of the city. Examples are the Havana Hilton Hotel of (1958), the Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1955 by Martín Domínguez Esteban architect of the FOCSA Building in 1956, and the Edificio del Seguro Médico, Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.

Hotel Tryp Habana Libre is one of the larger hotels in Cuba, situated in Vedado, Havana. The hotel has 572 rooms in a 25-floor tower at Calle 23 (&quot;La Rampa&quot;) and Calle L. Opened in 1958 as the Habana Hilton, the hotel famously served as the residence of Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries throughout 1959, after their capture of Havana. The Habana Hilton was constructed at a cost of $24million, under the personal auspices of President Fulgencio Batista. It was built as an investment by the Caja de Retiro y Asistencia Social de los Trabajadores Gastronomicos, the pension plan of the Cuban catering workers&#x27; union, with additional financing from the Banco de Fomento Agricola e Industrial de Cuba (BANFAIC). It was operated by the American Hilton Hotels International group and was designed by the well-known Los Angeles architect Welton Becket, who had previously designed the Beverly Hilton for the chain. Becket designed the 27-story Habana Hilton in collaboration with Havana-based architects Lin Arroyo, and Gabriela Menéndez. Arroyo was the Minister of Public Works under Batista. The hotel was constructed by the Frederick Snare Corporation.

The Radiocentro CMQ Building complex is a former radio and television production facility and office building at the intersection of Calle L and La Rampa in El Vedado, Cuba. It was modeled after Raymond Hood&#x27;s 1933 Rockefeller Center in New York City. With 1,650 seats, the theater first opened on 23 December 1947, under the name Teatro Warner Radiocentro, it was owned by brothers Goar and Abel Mestre. Today the building serves as the headquarters of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (ICRT). For the construction of this building, the Havana building authorities granted a permit in 1947 amending the ordinances that were then in effect in El Vedado prohibiting the construction of buildings of more than three storeys. This statute was modified six years later to expand the construction of up to four floors because many planners and owners claimed the need to authorize them to build taller buildings in the area.

The FOCSA Building is a residential block in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. It was named after the contracting company &quot;Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, Sociedad Anónima&quot;, and the architects were Ernesto Gómez Sampera (1921–2004), Mercedes Diaz (his wife), and Martín Domínguez Esteban (1897–1970), who was the architect of the Radiocentro CMQ Building. The structural engineer was Luis Sáenz Duplace, of the firm Sáenz, Cancio &amp; Martín, and professor of engineering at the University of Havana. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H. Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers, respectively. It is located on a site bordered by Calles 17 and M and Calles 19 and N in the Vedado.
 The Edificio Focsa (1956) represents Havana&#x27;s economic dominance at the time. This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and a restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest high-strength concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame).

The Edificio del Seguro Médico is a commercial building in El Vedado, Havana. Built between 1955 and 1958, it was designed as a mixed use building for apartments and offices for the headquarters of the National Medical Insurance Company by Antonio Quintana Simonetti.

==== Cityscape ====
Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: Old Havana, Vedado, and the newer suburban districts. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana&#x27;s commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.

To the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as Vedado, has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The &quot;Capitolio Nacional&quot; building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana. Barrio Chino and the Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás, one of Cuba&#x27;s oldest cigar factories is located in the area.

A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is Marianao, one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. Miramar, located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana&#x27;s exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area. The International School of Havana is located in the Miramar neighborhood.

In the 1980s many parts of Old Havana, including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-yearmultimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.
=== Visual arts ===

The Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana is a Fine Arts museum that exhibits Cuban and international art. The museum houses one of the largest collections of paintings and sculpture from Latin America and is the largest in the Caribbean region. Under the &quot;Cuban Ministry of Culture&quot;, it occupies two locations in the vicinity of Havana&#x27;s &quot;Paseo del Prado&quot;, these are the &quot;Palace of Fine Arts&quot;, devoted to Cuban art and the &quot;Palace of the Asturian Center&quot;, dedicated to universal art. Its artistic heritage is made up of over 45,000 pieces. Since 1995 the capital hosts the headquarters of the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba in Vedado, founded by the German collectors Peter and Irene Ludwig, it is a non-governmental and non-profit organization for the dissemination and protection of Cuban art.
Notable artists associated with the city include Federico Beltrán Masses, Víctor Manuel García Valdés, and Wifredo Lam.
=== Performing arts ===

Facing Havana&#x27;s Central Park is the baroque Gran Teatro de La Habana, a prominent theater built in 1837. It is now home of the National Ballet of Cuba and the International Ballet Festival of Havana, one of the oldest in the New World. The façade of the building is adorned with a stone and marble statue. There are also sculptural pieces by Giuseppe Moretti, representing allegories depicting benevolence, education, music and theater. The principal theater is the García Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 and balconies. Glories of its rich history; the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso sang, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova danced, and the French Sarah Bernhardt acted.

Alicia Alonso was a Cuban &quot;prima ballerina assoluta&quot; and choreographer whose company became the Ballet Nacional de Cuba in 1955. Alonso was born &quot;on the outskirts&quot; of Havana in 1920 She is best known for her portrayals of Giselle and the ballet version of &quot;Carmen&quot;.

=== Radio and television ===
==== CMQ ====


CMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, Cuba, reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination. It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the RHC-Cadena Azul network.
The company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and Ángel Cambó. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of Goar Mestre. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.

Pre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast.

Regular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo&#x27;s Unión Radio TV. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa&#x27;s CMQ-TV on channel 6 on 18 December 1950. CMQ officially launched on 11 March 1951, and would become an NBC affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network. With the CMQ network, Cuba the second country in the world, only after the United States, to have a national TV network.

At the beginning of the 1950s with the transmission of the novel &quot;El Derecho de Nacer&quot;, by Felix B. Caignet, displaced the competing station, RHC Cadena Azul. It is with this leadership that the second Cuban television channel, CMQ TV, Channel 6 is born. It was initially located on Calle Monte, on the corner of Paseo del Prado. On 12 March 1948, the radio studio was moved to the Radiocentro building in La Rampa and Calle L in El Vedado.

=== Festivals ===

==== Film Festival ====

The Havana Film Festival is a Cuban festival that focuses on the promotion of Latin American filmmakers. It is also known in Spanish as &quot;Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano de La Habana,&quot; and in English as International Festival of New Latin American Cinema of Havana. It takes place every year during December in the city of Havana, Cuba.

The inaugural International Festival of New Latin American Cinema was held on 3 December 1979, and more than 600 film directors of Latin America responded to the first call made by the Cuban Institute of the Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC). Its founders the included President of ICAIC, Alfredo Guevara, and the filmmakers Julio García Espinosa and Pastor Vega.

As expressed in its founding convocation, the festival aimed to &quot;promote the regular meeting of Latin American filmmakers who with their work enrich the artistic culture of our countries (…); ensure the joint presentation of fiction films, documentaries, cartoons and current events (…), and contribute to the international diffusion and circulation of the main and most significant productions of our cinematographies&quot;.

In 2013 the Havana Film Festival announced that it was reappointing Iván Giroud as its president. Giroud had previously served as president from 1994 to 2010.

== Health ==

All Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals, local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each, which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world. However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the Soviet Union subsidies in the early 1990s and the US embargo. Nevertheless, Havana&#x27;s infant mortality rate in 2009 was 4.9 per 1,000 live births, 5.12 in the country as a whole, which is lower than many developed nations, and the lowest in the developing world. Administration of the health care system for the nation is centered largely in Havana. Hospitals in Havana are run by the national government, and citizens are assigned hospitals and clinics to which they may go for attention.

== Sports ==

Many Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favor baseball. Havana&#x27;s team in the Cuban National Series is Industriales, one of the most successful teams in the tournament. In the past, it has also been represented by Habana (in the pre-revolutionary Cuban League) as well as Metropolitanos and La Habana in the National Series.

The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one being the Estadio Latinoamericano, where Industriales play. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city. Social clubs at the beaches provide facilities for water sports and include restaurants and dance halls.

<doc id="49720" wikidata="Q46830" url="?curid=49720" title="Robert Hooke">
<text>Robert Hooke (; 18 July 16353 March 1703) was an English polymath who was active as a physicist (&quot;natural philosopher&quot;), astronomer, geologist, meteorologist and architect. He is credited as one of the first scientists to investigate living things at microscopic scale in 1665, using a compound microscope that he designed. Hooke was an impoverished scientific inquirer in young adulthood who went on to become one of the most important scientists of his time. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Hooke (as a surveyor and architect) attained wealth and esteem by performing more than half of the property line surveys and assisting with the city&#x27;s rapid reconstruction. Often vilified by writers in the centuries after his death, his reputation was restored at the end of the twentieth century and he has been called &quot;England&#x27;s Leonardo [da Vinci]&quot;.

Hooke was a Fellow of the Royal Society and from 1662, he was its first Curator of Experiments. From 1665 to 1703, he was also Professor of Geometry at Gresham College. Hooke began his scientific career as an assistant to the physical scientist Robert Boyle. Hooke built the vacuum pumps that were used in Boyle&#x27;s experiments on gas law and also conducted experiments. In 1664, Hooke identified the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. Hooke&#x27;s 1665 book &quot;Micrographia&quot;, in which he coined the term &quot;cell&quot;, encouraged microscopic investigations. Investigating optics specifically light refraction Hooke inferred a wave theory of light. His is the first-recorded hypothesis of the cause of the expansion of matter by heat, of air&#x27;s composition by small particles in constant motion that thus generate its pressure, and of heat as energy.

In physics, Hooke inferred that gravity obeys an inverse square law and arguably was the first to hypothesise such a relation in planetary motion, a principle Isaac Newton furthered and formalised in Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. Priority over this insight contributed to the rivalry between Hooke and Newton. In geology and palaeontology, Hooke originated the theory of a globe, thus disputing the Biblical view of the Earth&#x27;s age; he also hypothesised the extinction of species, and argued hills and mountains had become elevated by geological processes. By identifying fossils of extinct species, Hooke presaged the theory of biological evolution.

== Life and works ==
=== Early life ===
Much of what is known of Hooke&#x27;s early life comes from an autobiography he commenced in 1696 but never completed; Richard Waller FRS mentions it in his introduction to &quot;The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M.D. S.R.S.&quot;, which was printed in 1705. The work of Waller, along with John Ward&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Gresham Professors&quot;, and John Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot; form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of his life.

Hooke was born in 1635 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, to Cecily Gyles and the Anglican priest John Hooke, who was the curate of All Saints&#x27; Church, Freshwater. Robert was the youngest, by seven years, of four siblings (two boys and two girls); he was frail and not expected to live. Although his father gave him some instruction in English, (Latin) Grammar and Divinity, Robert&#x27;s education was largely neglected. Left to his own devices, he made little mechanical toys; seeing a brass clock dismantled, he built a wooden replica that &quot;would go&quot;.

Hooke&#x27;s father died in October 1648, leaving £40 in his will to Robert (plus another £10 held over from his grandmother). At the age of 13, he took this to London to become an apprentice to the celebrated painter Peter Lely. Hooke also had &quot;some instruction in drawing&quot; from the limner Samuel Cowper but &quot;the smell of the Oil Colours did not agree with his Constitution, increasing his Head-ache to which he was ever too much subject&quot;, and he became a pupil at Westminster School, living with its master Richard Busby. Hooke quickly mastered Latin, Greek and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;; he also learnt to play the organ and began his lifelong study of mechanics. He remained an accomplished draughtsman, as he was later to demonstrate in his drawings that illustrate the work of Robert Boyle and Hooke&#x27;s own &quot;Micrographia&quot;.

=== Oxford ===
In 1653, Hooke secured a place at Christ Church, Oxford, receiving free tuition and accommodation as an organist and a chorister, and a basic income as a servitor, despite the fact he did not officially matriculate until 1658. In 1662, Hooke was awarded a Master of Arts degree. 

While a student at Oxford, Hooke was also employed as an assistant to Dr Thomas Willis a physician, chemist and member of the Oxford Philosophical Club. The Philosophical Club had been founded by John Wilkins, Warden of Wadham College, who led this important group of scientists who went on to form the nucleus of the Royal Society. In 1659, Hooke described to the Club some elements of a method of heavier-than-air flight but concluded human muscles were insufficient to the task. Through the Club, Hooke met Seth Ward (the University&#x27;s Savilian Professor of Astronomy) and developed for Ward a mechanism that improved the regularity of pendulum clocks used for astronomical time-keeping. Hooke characterised his Oxford days as the foundation of his lifelong passion for science. The friends he made there, particularly Christopher Wren, were important to him throughout his career. Willis introduced Hooke to Robert Boyle, who the Club sought to attract to Oxford.

In 1655, Boyle moved to Oxford and Hooke became nominally his assistant but in practice his co-experimenter. Boyle had been working on gas pressures; the possibility a vacuum might exist despite Aristotle&#x27;s maxim &quot;Nature abhors a vacuum&quot; had just begun to be considered. Hooke developed an air pump for Boyle&#x27;s experiments rather than use Ralph Greatorex&#x27;s pump, which Hooke considered as &quot;too gross to perform any great matter&quot;. Hooke&#x27;s engine enabled the development of the eponymous law that was subsequently attributed to Boyle; Hooke had a particularly keen eye and was an adept mathematician, neither of which applied to Boyle. Hooke taught Boyle Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; and Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot;; it also caused them to recognise fire as a chemical reaction and not, as Aristotle taught, a fundamental element of nature.

=== Royal Society ===
According to Henry Robinson, Librarian of The Royal Society in 1935:
The Royal Society for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge by Experiment was founded in 1660 and given its Royal Charter in July 1662. On 5 November 1661, Robert Moray proposed the appointment of a curator to furnish the society with experiments, and this was unanimously passed and Hooke was named on Boyle&#x27;s recommendation. The Society did not have a reliable income to fully fund the post of Curator of Experiments but in 1664, John Cutler settled an annual gratuity of £50 on the Society to found a &quot;&quot; lectureship at Gresham College on the understanding the Society would appoint Hooke to this task. On 27 June 1664, Hooke was confirmed to the office and on 11 January 1665, he was named Curator by Office for life with an annual salary of £80, which consisting of £30 from the Society and Cutler&#x27;s £50 annuity.

In June 1663, Hooke was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). On 20 March 1665, he was also appointed Gresham Professor of Geometry. On 13 September 1667, Hooke became acting Secretary of the Society and on 19 December 1677, he was appointed its Joint Secretary.

=== Personality, relationships, health and death ===
Although John Aubrey described Hooke as a person of &quot;great virtue and goodness&quot;. much has been written about the unpleasant side of Hooke&#x27;s personality. According to his first biographer Richard Waller, Hooke was &quot;in person, but despicable&quot;, and &quot;melancholy, mistrustful, and jealous&quot;. Waller&#x27;s comments influenced other writers for more than 200 years such that many books and articlesespecially biographies of Isaac Newtonportray Hooke as a disgruntled, selfish, anti-social curmudgeon. For example, Arthur Berry said Hooke &quot;claimed credit for most of the scientific discoveries of the time&quot;. Sullivan wrote he was &quot;positively unscrupulous&quot; and had an &quot;uneasy apprehensive vanity&quot; in dealings with Newton. Manuel described Hooke as &quot;cantankerous, envious, vengeful&quot;. According to More, Hooke had both a &quot;cynical temperament&quot; and a &quot;caustic tongue&quot;. Andrade was more sympathetic but still described Hooke as &quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;suspicious&quot; and &quot;irritable&quot;. In October 1675, the Council of the Royal Society considered a motion to expel Hooke because of an attack he made on Christiaan Huygens over scientific priority in watch design but it did not pass. According to Hooke&#x27;s biographer Ellen Drake:

The publication of Hooke&#x27;s diary in 1935 revealed previously unknown details about his social and familial relationships. His biographer Margaret said: &quot;the picture which is usually painted of Hooke as a recluse is completely false&quot;. He interacted with noted artisans such as clock-maker Thomas Tompion and instrument-maker Christopher Cocks (Cox). Hooke often met Christopher Wren, with whom he shared many interests, and had a lasting friendship with John Aubrey. His diaries also make frequent reference to meetings at coffeehouses and taverns, as well as to dinners with Robert Boyle. On many occasions, Hooke took tea with his lab assistant Harry Hunt. Although he largely lived aloneapart from the servants who ran his home his niece Grace Hooke and his cousin Tom Giles lived with him for some years as children.

Hooke never married. According to his diary, Hooke had a sexual relationship with his niece Grace, after she had turned 16. Grace was in his custody since the age of 10. He also had sexual relations with several maids and housekeepers. Hooke&#x27;s biographer Stephen Inwood considers Grace to have been the love of his life, and he was devastated when she died in 1687. Inwood also mentions &quot;The age difference between him and Grace was commonplace and would not have upset his contemporaries as it does us&quot;. The incestous relationship would nevertheless have been frowned upon and tried by an ecclesiastical court had it been discovered, it was not however a capital felony after 1660.

Since childhood, Hooke suffered from migraine, tinnitus, dizziness and bouts of insomnia; he also had a spinal deformity that was consistent with a diagnosis of Scheuermann&#x27;s kyphosis, giving him in middle and later years a &quot;thin and crooked body, over-large head and protruding eyes&quot;. Approaching these in a scientific spirit, he experimented with self-medication, diligently recording symptoms, substances and effects in his diary. He regularly used sal ammoniac, emetics, laxatives and opiates, which appear to have had an increasing effect on his physical and mental health over time.

Hooke died in London on 3 March 1703, having been blind and bedridden during the last year of his life. A chest containing £8,000 in money and gold was found in his room at Gresham College. His library contained over 3,000 books in Latin, French, Italian and English. Although he had talked of leaving a generous bequest to the Royal Society, which would have given his name to a library, laboratory and lectures, no will was found and the money passed to a cousin named Elizabeth Stephens. Hooke was buried at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Bishopsgate, in the City of London but the precise location of his grave is unknown.

== Science ==
Hooke&#x27;s role at the Royal Society was to demonstrate experiments from his own methods or at the suggestion of members. Among his earliest demonstrations were discussions of the nature of air and the implosion of glass bubbles that had been sealed with enclosed hot air. He also demonstrated that a dog could be kept alive with its thorax opened, provided air was pumped in and out of its lungs. He noted the difference between venous and arterial blood, and thus demonstrated that the (&quot;food of life&quot;) and [flames] were the same thing. There were also experiments on gravity, the falling of objects, the weighing of bodies, the measurement of barometric pressure at different heights, and the movement of pendulums up to . His biographer described him as England&#x27;s first meteorologist, in her description of his essay &quot;Method for making a history of the weather&quot;. (Hooke specifies that a thermometer, a hygrometer, a wind gauge and a record sheet be used for proper weather records.) 

=== Astronomy ===

In May 1664, using a refracting telescope, Hooke observed the Great Red Spot of Jupiter for two hours as it moved across the planet&#x27;s face. In March 1665, he published his findings and from them, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini calculated the rotation period of Jupiter to be nine hours and fifty-five minutes. 

One of the most-challenging problems Hooke investigated was the measurement of the distance from Earth to a star other than the Sun. Hooke selected the star Gamma Draconis and chose the method of parallax determination. In 1669, after several months of observing, Hooke believed the desired result had been achieved. It is now known his equipment was far too imprecise to obtain an accurate measurement.

Hooke&#x27;s &quot;Micrographia&quot; contains illustrations of the Pleiades star cluster and lunar craters. He conducted experiments to investigate the formation of these craters and concluded their existence meant the Moon must have its own gravity, a radical departure from the contemporaneous Aristotelian celestial model. He also was an early observer of the rings of Saturn, and discovered one of the first-observed double-star systems Gamma Arietis in 1664.

To achieve these discoveries, Hooke needed better instruments than those that were available at the time. Accordingly, he invented three new mechanisms: the Hooke joint, a sophisticated universal joint that allowed his instruments to smoothly follow the apparent motion of the observed body; the first clockwork drive to automate the process; and a micrometer screw that allowed him to achieve a precision of ten seconds of arc. Hooke was dissatisfied with refracting telescopes so he built the first practical Gregorian telescope that used a silvered glass mirror.

=== Mechanics ===

In 1660, Hooke discovered the law of elasticity that bears his name and describes the linear variation of tension with extension in an elastic spring. Hooke first described this discovery in an anagram &quot;ceiiinosssttuv&quot;, whose solution he published in 1678 as (&quot;As the extension, so the force&quot;). His work on elasticity culminated in his development of the balance spring or hairspring, which for the first time enabled a portable timepiecea watchto keep time with reasonable accuracy. A bitter dispute between Hooke and Christiaan Huygens on the priority of this invention was to continue for centuries after the death of both but a note dated 23 June 1670 in the journals of the Royal Society, describing a demonstration of a balance-controlled watch before the Royal Society, may support Hooke&#x27;s claim to priority for the idea. Nevertheless, it is Huygens who is credited with building the first watch to use a balance spring.

Hooke&#x27;s announcement of his law of elasticity using an anagram was a method scientists, such as Hooke, Huygens and Galileo, sometimes used to establish priority for a discovery without revealing details. Hooke used mechanical analogues to understand fundamental processes such as the motion of a spherical pendulum and of a ball in a hollow cone, to demonstrate central force due to gravity, and a hanging chain net with point loads to provide the optimum shape for a dome with heavy cross on top.

Despite continuing reports to the contrary, Hooke did not influence Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s invention of the steam engine; this myth, which originated in an article in the third edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, has been found to be mistaken.

=== Gravitation ===
While many of Hooke&#x27;s contemporaries, such as Isaac Newton, believed in aether as a medium for transmitting attraction and repulsion between separated celestial bodies, Hooke argued for an attracting principle of gravitation in &quot;Micrographia&quot; (1665). In a communication to the Royal Society in 1666, he wrote:
Hooke&#x27;s 1674 Gresham lecture, &quot;An Attempt to Prove the Motion of the Earth by Observations&quot; (published 1679), said gravitation applies to &quot;all celestial bodies&quot; and restated these three propositions. 

Hooke&#x27;s statements up to 1674 make no mention, however, that an inverse square law applies or might apply to these attractions. His model of gravitation was also not yet universal, though it approached universality more closely than previous hypotheses. Hooke did not provide accompanying evidence or mathematical demonstration; he stated in 1674: &quot;Now what these several degrees [of gravitational attraction] are I have not yet experimentally verified&quot;, indicating he did not yet know what law the gravitation might follow; and about his whole proposal, he said: &quot;This I only hint at present ... having my self many other things in hand which I would first , and therefore cannot so well attend it&quot; (i.e. &quot;prosecuting this Inquiry&quot;).

In November 1679, Hooke initiated a notable exchange of letters with Newton that was published in 1960. Hooke&#x27;s ostensible purpose was to tell Newton he (Hooke) had been appointed to manage the Royal Society&#x27;s correspondence; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their research or their views about the research of others. Hooke asked Newton&#x27;s opinions about various matters. Among other items, Hooke mentioned &quot;compounding the celestial motions of the planets of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body&quot;; his &quot;hypothesis of the or causes of springinesse&quot;; a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions, which he described at length; efforts to carry out or improve national surveys; and the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge.

Newton&#x27;s reply offered &quot;a of my own&quot; about a terrestrial experiment rather than a proposal about celestial motions that might detect the Earth&#x27;s motion; the experiment would use a body suspended in air and then dropped. Hooke wanted to discern how Newton thought the falling body could experimentally reveal the Earth&#x27;s motion by its direction of deviation from the vertical but Hooke went on hypothetically to consider how its motion could continue if the solid Earth had not been in the way, on a spiral path to the centre. Hooke disagreed with Newton&#x27;s idea of the body&#x27;s continuing motion. A further short correspondence developed; towards the end of it, writing on 6 January 1680 to Newton, Hooke communicated his &quot;supposition ... that the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance from the , and Consequently that the Velocity will be in a subduplicate proportion to the Attraction and Consequently as Kepler Supposes to the Distance&quot;. (Hooke&#x27;s inference about the velocity is incorrect.)

In 1686, when the first book of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; was presented to the Royal Society, Hooke said he had given Newton the &quot;notion&quot; of &quot;the rule of the decrease of Gravity, being reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the &quot;. At the same time, according to Edmond Halley&#x27;s contemporaneous report, Hooke agreed &quot;the Demonstration of the Curves generated thereby&quot; was wholly Newton&#x27;s.

According to a 2002 assessment of the early history of the inverse square law: &quot;by the late 1660s, the assumption of an &#x27;inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance&#x27; was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons&quot;. In the 1660s, Newton had shown for planetary motion under a circular assumption, force in the radial direction had an inverse-square relation with distance from the centre. Newton, who in May 1686 was presented with Hooke&#x27;s claim to priority on the inverse square law, denied he was to be credited as author of the idea, giving reasons including the citation of prior work by others. Newton also said that, even if he had first heard of the inverse square proportion from Hooke (which Newton said he had not), he would still have some rights to it because of his mathematical developments and demonstrations. These, he said, enabled observations to be relied upon as evidence of its accuracy while according to Newton, Hooke, without mathematical demonstrations and evidence in favour of the supposition, could only guess it was approximately valid &quot;at great distances from the centre&quot;.

Newton did accept and acknowledge, in all editions of the &quot;Principia&quot;, Hooke and others had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system. Newton acknowledged Wren, Hooke and Halley in this connection in his &quot;Scholium to Proposition 4&quot; in Book1. In a letter to Halley, Newton also acknowledged his correspondence with Hooke in 1679–1680 had reawakened his dormant interest in astronomical matters but that did not mean, according to Newton, Hooke had told Newton anything new or original. Newton wrote:
Whilst Newton was primarily a pioneer in mathematical analysis and its applications, and optical experimentation, Hooke was a creative experimenter of such great range who left some of his ideas, such as those about gravitation, undeveloped. In 1759, decades after the deaths of both Newton and Hooke, Alexis Clairaut, mathematical astronomer eminent in his own right in the field of gravitational studies, reviewed Hooke&#x27;s published work on gravitation. According to Stephen Peter Rigaud, Clairaut wrote: &quot;The example of Hooke and that of Kepler [serves] to show what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated&quot;. I. Bernard Cohen said: &quot;Hooke&#x27;s claim to the inverse-square law has masked Newton&#x27;s far more fundamental debt to him, the analysis of curvilinear orbital motion. In asking for too much credit, Hooke effectively denied to himself the credit due him for a seminal idea&quot;.

=== Horology ===
Hooke made important contributions to the science of timekeeping and was intimately involved in the advances of his time; these included refinement of the pendulum as a better regulator for clocks, increased precision of clock mechanisms and the use of the balance spring to improve the timekeeping of watches. 

Galileo had observed the regularity of a pendulum and Huygens first incorporated it in a clock; in 1668, Hooke demonstrated his new device to keep a pendulum swinging regularly in unsteady conditions. His invention of a tooth-cutting machine enabled a substantial improvement in the accuracy and precision of timepieces. Waller reported the invention was, by Hooke&#x27;s death, in constant use among clock makers.

Hooke announced he conceived a way to build a marine chronometer to determine longitude. and with the help of Boyle and others, he attempted to patent it. In the process, Hooke demonstrated a pocket-watch of his own devising that was fitted with a coil spring attached to the arbour of the balance. Hooke&#x27;s refusal to accept an escape clause in the proposed exclusive contract for the use of this idea resulted in its abandonment.

Hooke developed the principle of the balance spring independently of Huygens and at least five years beforehand. Huygens published his own work in &quot;Journal de Scavans&quot; in February 1675 and built the first functioning watch to use a balance spring.

=== Microscopy ===
In 1663 and 1664, Hooke made his microscopic, and some astronomic, observations, which he collated in &quot;Micrographia&quot; in 1665. His book, which describes observations with microscopes and telescopes, as well as original work in biology, contains the earliest-recorded observation of a microorganism, the microfungus &quot;Mucor&quot;. Hooke coined the term &quot;cell&quot;, suggesting a resemblance between plant structures and honeycomb cells.The hand-crafted, leather-and-gold-tooled microscope he designed and used to make the observations for &quot;Micrographia&quot;, which Christopher Cock made for him in London, is on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. Hooke&#x27;s work developed from that of Henry Power, who published his microscopy work in &quot;Experimental Philosophy&quot; (1663); in turn, the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek went on to develop increased magnification and so reveal protozoa, blood cells and spermatozoa.

&quot;Micrographia&quot; also contains Hooke&#x27;s, or perhaps Boyle&#x27;s and Hooke&#x27;s, ideas on combustion. Hooke&#x27;s experiments led him to conclude combustion involves a component of air, a statement with which modern scientists would agree but that was not understood widely, if at all, in the seventeenth century. He also concluded respiration and combustion involve a specific and limited component of air. According to Partington, if &quot;Hooke had continued his experiments on combustion, it is probable that he would have discovered oxygen&quot;.

Samuel Pepys wrote of the book in his diary on 21 January 16: &quot;Before I went to bed I sat up till two o’clock in my chamber reading of Mr. Hooke&#x27;s Observations, the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life&quot;.

=== Palaeontology and geology ===
One of the observations in &quot;Micrographia&quot; is of fossil wood, the microscopic structure of which Hooke compared to that of ordinary wood. This led him to conclude that fossilised objects like petrified wood and fossil shells such as ammonites were the remains of living things that had been soaked in mineral-laden petrifying water. He believed that such fossils provided reliable clues about the history of life on Earth and, despite the objections of contemporary naturalists like John Raywho found the concept of extinction theologically unacceptablethat in some cases they might represent species that had become extinct through some geological disaster. In a series of lectures in 1668, Hooke proposed the then-heretical idea the Earth&#x27;s surface had been formed by volcanoes and earthquakes, and that the latter were responsible for shell fossils being found far above sea level.

In 1835, Charles Lyell, the Scottish geologist and associate of Charles Darwin, wrote of Hooke in &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;: &quot;His treatise ... is the most philosophical production of that age, in regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature&quot;.

=== Memory ===
Hooke&#x27;s scientific model of human memory was one of the first of its kind. In a 1682 lecture to the Royal Society, Hooke proposed a mechanical analogue model of human memory that bore little resemblance to the mainly philosophical models of earlier writers. This model addressed the components of encoding, memory capacity, repetition, retrieval, and forgetting – some with surprisingly modern accuracy. According to psychology professor Douglas Hintzman, Hooke&#x27;s model&#x27;s most-interesting points are that it allows for attention and other top-down influences on encoding; it uses resonance to implement parallel, cue-dependent retrieval; it explains memory for recency; it offers a single-system account of repetition and priming; and the power law of forgetting can be derived from the model&#x27;s assumption in a straightforward way.

===Other===
On 8 July 1680, Hooke observed the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. He ran a bow along the edge of a flour-covered glass plate and saw the nodal patterns emerge. In acoustics, in 1681, Hooke showed the Royal Society that musical tones can be generated using spinning brass cogs cut with teeth in particular proportions.

== Architecture ==

Robert Hooke was Surveyor to the City of London and chief assistant to Christopher Wren, in which capacities he helped Wren rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. Hooke designed the Monument to the Great Fire of London (1672), Montagu House in Bloomsbury (1674) and Bethlem Royal Hospital (1674), which became known as &quot;Bedlam&quot;. Other buildings Hooke designed include the Royal College of Physicians (1679); Aske&#x27;s Hospital (1679), Ragley Hall, Warwickshire (1680); the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Willen, Buckinghamshire (1680) and Ramsbury Manor, Wiltshire (1681). He worked on many of the London churches that were rebuilt after the fire; Hooke was generally subcontracted by Wren; from 1671 to 1696, Wren&#x27;s office paid Hooke £2,820 in fees, more than he ever earned from his Royal Society and Cutler Lectureship posts.

Wren and Hooke were both keen astronomers. The Monument to the Great Fire of London was designed to serve a scientific function as a zenith telescope for astronomical observation, though traffic vibration made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed in the construction of the spiral staircase, which has no central column, and in the observation chamber, which remains in place below ground level. He also collaborated with Wren on the design of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; Hooke determined the ideal shape of an arch is an inverted catenary and thence that a circular series of such arches makes an ideal shape for the cathedral&#x27;s dome.

In the reconstruction after the Great Fire, Hooke proposed redesigning London&#x27;s streets on a grid pattern with wide boulevards and arteries, a pattern that was later used in Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris and in many American cities, for which Wren and others also submitted proposals. The King decided both the prospective cost of building and compensation, and the need to quickly restore trade and population meant the city would be rebuilt on the original property lines. Hooke was given the task of surveying the ruins to identify foundations, street edges and property boundaries. He was closely involved with the drafting of an Act of Common Council (April 1667), which set out the process by which the original foundations would be formally recognised and certificated. According to Lisa Jardine: &quot;in the four weeks from the 4th of October, [Hooke] helped map the fire-damaged area, began compiling a Land Information System for London, and drew up building regulations for an Act of Parliament to govern the rebuilding&quot;. Stephen Inwood said: &quot;the surveyors&#x27; reports, which were generally written by Hooke, show an admirable ability to get to the nub of intricate neighbourly squabbles, and to produce a crisp and judicious recommendation from a tangle of claims and counter-claims&quot;.

Hooke also had to measure and certify land that would be compulsorily purchased for the planned road widening so compensation could be paid. In 1670, he was appointed Surveyor of the Royal Works. Hooke, together with the work of Scottish cartographer and printer John Ogilby, Hooke&#x27;s precise and detailed surveys led to production in 1677 of a large-scale map of London, the first-known to be of a specific scale (1:1200).

== Likenesses ==
No authenticated portrait of Robert Hooke exists, a situation that has sometimes been attributed to the heated conflicts between Hooke and Isaac Newton, although Hooke&#x27;s biographer Allan Chapman rejects as a myth claims Newton or his acolytes deliberately destroyed Hooke&#x27;s portrait. German antiquarian and scholar Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach visited the Royal Society in 1710 and his account of his visit mentions him being shown portraits of &quot;Boyle and Hoock&quot;, which were said to be good likenesses but, while Boyle&#x27;s portrait survives, Hooke&#x27;s has been lost. In Hooke&#x27;s time, the Royal Society met at Gresham College but within a few months of Hooke&#x27;s death Newton became the Society&#x27;s president and plans for a new meeting place were made. When the Royal Society moved to new premises in 1710, Hooke&#x27;s was the only portrait that went missing and remains so. According to Hooke&#x27;s diary, he sat for a portrait by renowned artist Mary Beale, so it is possible such a portrait did at some time exist. Conversely, Chapman draws attention to the fact that Waller&#x27;s extensively illustrated work, &quot;Posthumous works of Robert Hooke&quot;, published shortly after Hooke&#x27;s death, has no portrait of him.

Two contemporaneous, written descriptions of Hooke&#x27;s appearance have survived; his close friend John Aubrey described him in middle age and at the height of his creative powers:

Richard Waller, writing in 1705 in &quot;The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke&quot;, described the elderly Hooke:

On 3 July 1939, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a portrait, supposedly of Hooke, but when Ashley Montagu traced the source, it was found to lack a verifiable connection to Hooke. Montagu found the two contemporaneous written descriptions of Hooke&#x27;s appearance agree with one another but that neither matches the portrait in &quot;Time&quot;.

In 2003, historian Lisa Jardine conjectured that a recently discovered portrait was of Hooke, but this proposal was disproved by William B. Jensen of the University of Cincinnati who identified the subject as the Flemish scholar Jan Baptist van Helmont.

Other possible likenesses of Hooke include:
* A seal used by Hooke displays an unusual profile portrait of a man&#x27;s head, which some have said portrays Hooke.
* The engraved frontispiece to the 1728 edition of Chambers&#x27; &quot;Cyclopedia&quot; shows a drawing of a bust of Robert Hooke. The extent to which the drawing is based on a real work of art is unknown.
* A memorial window existed at St Helen&#x27;s Church, Bishopsgate, London, but it was a formulaic rendering rather than an accurate likeness. The window was destroyed in the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing.
In 2003, the amateur painter Rita Greer embarked on a project to memorialise Hooke and produce credible images of him, both painted and drawn, she believes match Aubrey&#x27;s and Waller&#x27;s the descriptions of him. Greer&#x27;s images of Hooke, which are free to use under the Free Art License, have been used for television programmes in the UK and the US, in books, magazines and for public relations.

In 2019, Larry Griffing, an associate professor in Biology at Texas A&amp;M University, proposed that a portrait by Mary Beale of an unknown sitter and referred to as &quot;Portrait of a Mathematician&quot;is actually of Hooke, noting the physical features of the sitter in the portrait match Hooke&#x27;s. The figure points to a drawing of elliptical motion that appears to match an unpublished manuscript created by him. The painting also includes an orrery depicting the same principle. According to Griffing, buildings included in the image are of Lowther Castle, now in Cumbria, and its Church of St Michael. The church was renovated under one of Hooke&#x27;s architectural commissions, which Beale would have known from her extensive body of work for the Lowther family. According to Griffing, the painting would once have been owned by the Royal Society but was abandoned when Newton, its president, moved the Society&#x27;s headquarters in 1710. Christopher Whittaker of the School of Education, University of Durham, England, has questioned Griffing&#x27;s analysis; according to Whittaker, it is more likely to be of Isaac Barrow; in a response to Whittaker, Griffing reaffirmed his deduction.

<text>In computing, a core dump, memory dump, crash dump, storage dump, system dump, or ABEND dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally. In practice, other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time, including the processor registers, which may include the program counter and stack pointer, memory management information, and other processor and operating system flags and information. A snapshot dump (or snap dump) is a memory dump requested by the computer operator or by the running program, after which the program is able to continue. Core dumps are often used to assist in diagnosing and debugging errors in computer programs.

On many operating systems, a fatal exception in a program automatically triggers a core dump. By extension, the phrase &quot;to dump core&quot; has come to mean in many cases, any fatal error, regardless of whether a record of the program memory exists. The term &quot;core dump&quot;, &quot;memory dump&quot;, or just &quot;dump&quot; has also become jargon to indicate any output of a large amount of raw data for further examination or other purposes.

== Background ==
The name comes from magnetic-core memory, the principal form of random-access memory from the 1950s to the 1970s. The name has remained long after magnetic-core technology became obsolete.

Earliest core dumps were paper printouts of the contents of memory, typically arranged in columns of octal or hexadecimal numbers (a &quot;hex dump&quot;), sometimes accompanied by their interpretations as machine language instructions, text strings, or decimal or floating-point numbers (&quot;cf.&quot; disassembler).

As memory sizes increased and post-mortem analysis utilities were developed, dumps were written to magnetic media like tape or disk.

Instead of only displaying the contents of the applicable memory, modern operating systems typically generate a file containing an image of the memory belonging to the crashed process, or the memory images of parts of the address space related to that process, along with other information such as the values of processor registers, program counter, system flags, and other information useful in determining the root cause of the crash. These files can be viewed as text, printed, or analysed with specialised tools such as elfdump on Unix and Unix-like systems, objdump and kdump on Linux, IPCS (Interactive Problem Control System) on IBM z/OS, DVF (Dump Viewing Facility) on IBM z/VM, WinDbg on Microsoft Windows, Valgrind, or other debuggers.

In some operating systems an application or operator may request a snapshot of selected storage blocks, rather than all of the storage used by the application or operating system.

== Uses ==
Core dumps can serve as useful debugging aids in several situations. On early standalone or batch-processing systems, core dumps allowed a user to debug a program without monopolizing the (very expensive) computing facility for debugging; a printout could also be more convenient than debugging using front panel switches and lights.

On shared computers, whether time-sharing, batch processing, or server systems, core dumps allow off-line debugging of the operating system, so that the system can go back into operation immediately.

Core dumps allow a user to save a crash for later or off-site analysis, or comparison with other crashes. For embedded computers, it may be impractical to support debugging on the computer itself, so analysis of a dump may take place on a different computer. Some operating systems such as early versions of Unix did not support attaching debuggers to running processes, so core dumps were necessary to run a debugger on a process&#x27;s memory contents.

Core dumps can be used to capture data freed during dynamic memory allocation and may thus be used to retrieve information from a program that is no longer running. In the absence of an interactive debugger, the core dump may be used by an assiduous programmer to determine the error from direct examination.

Snap dumps are sometimes a convenient way for applications to record quick and dirty debugging output.

== Analysis ==
A core dump generally represents the complete contents of the dumped regions of the address space of the dumped process. Depending on the operating system, the dump may contain few or no data structures to aid interpretation of the memory regions. In these systems, successful interpretation requires that the program or user trying to interpret the dump understands the structure of the program&#x27;s memory use.

A debugger can use a symbol table, if one exists, to help the programmer interpret dumps, identifying variables symbolically and displaying source code; if the symbol table is not available, less interpretation of the dump is possible, but there might still be enough possible to determine the cause of the problem. There are also special-purpose tools called dump analyzers to analyze dumps. One popular tool, available on many operating systems, is the GNU binutils&#x27; objdump.

On modern Unix-like operating systems, administrators and programmers can read core dump files using the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor library (BFD), and the GNU Debugger (gdb) and objdump that use this library. This library will supply the raw data for a given address in a memory region from a core dump; it does not know anything about variables or data structures in that memory region, so the application using the library to read the core dump will have to determine the addresses of variables and determine the layout of data structures itself, for example by using the symbol table for the program undergoing debugging.

Analysts of crash dumps from Linux systems can use kdump or the Linux Kernel Crash Dump (LKCD).

Core dumps can save the context (state) of a process at a given state for returning to it later. Systems can be made highly available by transferring core between processors, sometimes via core dump files themselves.

Core can also be dumped onto a remote host over a network (which is a security risk).

Users of IBM mainframes running z/OS can browse SVC and transaction dumps using Interactive Problem Control System (IPCS), a full screen dump reader which was originally introduced in OS/VS2 (MVS), supports user written scripts in REXX and supports point-and-shoot browsing of dumps.

== Core-dump files ==

=== Format ===

In older and simpler operating systems, each process had a contiguous address-space, so a dump file was sometimes simply a file with the sequence of bytes, digits, characters or words. On other early machines a dump file contained discrete records, each containing a storage address and the associated contents. On early machines, the dump was often written by a stand-alone dump program rather than by the application or the operating system.
The IBSYS monitor for the IBM 7090 included a System Core-Storage Dump Program that supported post-motem and snap dumps.

On the IBM System/360, the standard operating systems wrote formatted ABEND and SNAP dumps, with the addresses, registers, storage contents, etc., all converted into printable forms. Later releases added the ability to write unformatted dumps, called at that time core image dumps (also known as SVC dumps.)
In modern operating systems, a process address space may contain gaps, and it may share pages with other processes or files, so more elaborate representations are used; they may also include other information about the state of the program at the time of the dump.

In Unix-like systems, core dumps generally use the standard executable image-format:
* a.out in older versions of Unix,
* ELF in modern Linux, System V, Solaris, and BSD systems,
* Mach-O in macOS, &quot;etc.&quot;

=== Naming ===
==== OS/360 and successors ====
* In OS/360 and successors, a job may assign arbitrary data set names (DSNs) to the ddnames codice_1 and codice_2 for a formatted ABEND dump and to arbitrary ddnames for SNAP dumps, or define those ddnames as SYSOUT.
* The Damage Assessment and Repair (DAR) facility added an automatic unformatted storage dump to the dataset codice_3 at the time of failure as well as a console dump requested by the operator. A job may assign an arbitrary DSN to the ddname codice_4 for an unformatted ABEND dump, or define that ddname as SYSOUT.
* The newer transaction dump is very similar to the older SVC dump.
* The &quot;Interactive Problem Control System&quot; (IPCS), added to OS/VS2 by &quot;Selectable Unit&quot; (SU) 57 and part of every subsequent MVS release, can be used to interactively analyze storage dumps on DASD. IPCS understands the format and relationships of system control blocks, and can produce a formatted display for analysis. The current versions of IPCS allow inspection of active address spaces without first taking a storage dump and of unformaated dumps on SPOOL.

==== Unix-like ====
* Since Solaris 8, system utility codice_5 allows the name and location of core files to be configured.
* Dumps of user processes are traditionally created as codice_6. On Linux (since versions 2.4.21 and 2.6 of the Linux kernel mainline), a different name can be specified via procfs using the codice_7 configuration file; the specified name can also be a template that contains tags substituted by, for example, the executable filename, the process ID, or the reason for the dump.
* System-wide dumps on modern Unix-like systems often appear as codice_8 or codice_9.

==== Others ====
* Systems such as Microsoft Windows, which use filename extensions, may use extension codice_10; for example, core dumps may be named codice_11 or codice_12.

=== Windows memory dumps ===
Microsoft Windows supports two memory dump formats, described below.

==== Kernel-mode dumps ====
There are five types of kernel-mode dumps:
* Complete memory dump contains full physical memory for the target system.
* Kernel memory dump contains all the memory in use by the kernel at the time of the crash.
* Small memory dump contains various info such as the stop code, parameters, list of loaded device drivers, etc.
* Automatic Memory Dump (Windows 8 and later) same as Kernel memory dump, but if the paging file is both System Managed and too small to capture the Kernel memory dump, it will automatically increase the paging file to at least the size of RAM for four weeks, then reduce it to the smaller size.
* Active memory dump (Windows 10 and later) contains most of the memory in use by the kernel and user mode applications.
To analyze the Windows kernel-mode dumps Debugging Tools for Windows are used, a set that includes tools like WinDbg &amp; DumpChk.

==== User-mode memory dumps ====
User-mode memory dump, also known as &quot;minidump&quot;, is a memory dump of a single process. It contains selected data records: full or partial (filtered) process memory; list of the threads with their call stacks and state (such as registers or TEB); information about handles to the kernel objects; list of loaded and unloaded libraries. Full list of options available in codice_13 enum.

== Space missions ==
The NASA Voyager program was probably the first craft to routinely utilize the core dump feature in the Deep Space segment. The core dump feature is a mandatory telemetry feature for the Deep Space segment as it has been proven to minimize system diagnostic costs. The Voyager craft uses routine core dumps to spot memory damage from cosmic ray events.

Space Mission core dump systems are mostly based on existing toolkits for the target CPU or subsystem. However, over the duration of a mission the core dump subsystem may be substantially modified or enhanced for the specific needs of the mission.

<doc id="49723" wikidata="Q1192029" url="?curid=49723" title="Reserved word">
<text>In a programming language, a reserved word (sometimes known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used by a programmer as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is &quot;reserved from use&quot;. In brief, an &quot;identifier&quot; starts with a letter, which is followed by any sequence of letters and digits (in some languages underline &#x27;_&#x27; is treated as a letter!).

In an imperative programming language and in many object-oriented programming languages, apart from assignments and subroutine calls, keywords are often used to identify a particular statement, e.g. if, while, do, for, etc. Many languages treat keywords as reserved words, including Ada, C, C++, COBOL, Java, and Pascal. The number of reserved words varies widely from one language to another: C has about 30 while COBOL has about 400.

Note that a few languages do not have any reserved words. Fortran and PL/I identify keywords by context, while Algol 60 and Algol 68 generally use stropping to distinguish keywords from programmer-defined identifiers, e.g. codice_1 or codice_2 or codice_3is a keyword distinct from identifier codice_4.

Most programming languages have a standard library (or libraries), e.g. mathematical functions sin, cos, etc. The names provided by a library are not reserved, and can be redefined by a programmer if the library functionality is not required.

==Distinction==
When using an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to develop a program, the IDE will generally highlight reserved words by displaying them in a different colour. In some IDEs, comments may also be highlighted (in yet another colour). This makes it easy for a programmer to notice unexpected use of a reserved word and/or failure to terminate a comment correctly.

There may be reserved words which are not keywords. For example, in Java, codice_5 and codice_6 are reserved words used as Boolean (logical) literals. As another example, in Pascal, codice_7 and codice_8 are reserved words used as operators (integer division and remainder).

There may also be reserved words which have no defined meaning. For example, in Java, codice_9 and codice_10 are listed as reserved words, but are not otherwise mentioned in the Java syntax rules.

A keyword such as if or while is used during syntax analysis to determine what sort of statement is being considered. Such analysis is much simpler if keywords are either reserved or stropped. Consider the complexity of using contextual analysis in Fortran 77 to distinguish:
 IF (B) l1,l2 ! two-way branch, where B is a boolean/logical expression 
 IF (N) l1,l2,l3 ! three-way branch, where N is a numeric expression
 IF (B) THEN ! start conditional block
 IF (B) THEN = 3.1 ! conditional assignment to variable THEN
 IF (B) X = 10 ! single conditional statement
 IF (B) GOTO l4 ! conditional jump
 IF (N) = 2 ! assignment to a subscripted variable named IF
PL/I can also allow some apparently confusing constructions:
 IF IF = THEN THEN ... /* (the second codice_11 and the first codice_12 are variables */

==Advantages==

Programs may be more readable as compared with a programming language which uses stropping.

It is easier for an IDE to highlight keywords, without having to do a contextual analysis to determine which words are actually keywords (see Fortran examples in previous section).

A compiler can be faster, since it can quickly determine if a word is a keyword, without having to do a contextual analysis over the whole of an arbitrarily long statement.
==Disadvantages==
A programming language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a (possibly long) list of reserved words to memorize which can&#x27;t be used as identifiers. 

It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, &quot;overloading&quot; of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing. 

Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system or compiler might be reserved by another.

==Further reservation==
Beyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.

This is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.

The frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation &quot;dunder;&quot; this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.

==Specification==
The list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language&#x27;s formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.

Reasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like codice_13 or codice_14. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.

A notable example is in Java, where codice_10 and codice_9 are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like codice_10 to the language, which was possible using the codice_10 word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) &quot;would&quot; break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.

Languages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:

That is, C11 introduced the keyword codice_19 within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword codice_20 despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.

==Reserved words and language independence==
Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined into a final product. Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language. For example, a Visual Basic (.NET) library may contain a class definition such as:
&#x27; Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:

Public Class this
 &#x27; This class does something...
End Class
If this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type &quot;codice_21&quot; would encounter a problem: codice_22 is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:
// Using This Class in C#:

this x = new this(); // Won&#x27;t compile!
A similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.

This is resolved by stropping. To work around this issue, the specification allows placing (in C#) the at-sign before the identifier, which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:
// Using This Class in C#:

@this x = new @this(); // Will compile! 
For consistency, this use is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.

<text>The American bison (Bison bison; : &quot;bison&quot;), commonly known as the American buffalo, or simply buffalo (not to be confused with true buffalo), is a species of bison that is endemic (or native) to North America. It is one of two extant species of bison, along with the European bison. Its historical range &quot;circa&quot; 9000 BC is referred to as the great bison belt, a tract of rich grassland spanning from Alaska south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas), as far north as New York, south to Georgia, and according to some sources, further south to northern Florida, with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.

Two subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (&quot;B. b. bison&quot;), smaller and with a more rounded hump; and the wood bison (&quot;B. b. athabascae&quot;), the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump. Furthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern plains (&quot;B. b. montanae&quot;) and a southern plains (&quot;B. b. bison&quot;) subspecies, bringing the total to three. However, this is generally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of extant bovid in the world, surpassed only by the Asian gaur. Among extant land animals in North America, the bison is the heaviest and the longest, and the second tallest after the moose.

Once roaming in vast herds, the species nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle. With an estimated population of 60 million in the late 18th century, the species was culled down to just 541 animals by 1889 as part of the subjugation of the Native Americans, because the American bison was a major resource for their traditional way of life (food source, hides for clothing and shelter, and horns and bones for tools). Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century, with a resurgence to roughly 31,000 wild bison as of March 2019. For many years, the population was primarily found in a few national parks and reserves. Through multiple reintroductions, the species now freely roams wild in several regions in the United States, Canada and Mexico, others are kept in smaller natural areas as conservation herds, while some are also kept in private commercial herds. The American bison has also been introduced to Yakutia in Russia.

Spanning back millennia, Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison. It is the national mammal of the United States.

==Etymology==
In American English, both &quot;buffalo&quot; and &quot;bison&quot; are considered correct terms for the American bison. However, in British English, the word &quot;buffalo&quot; is reserved for the African buffalo and water buffalo and not used for the bison.

In English usage, the term &quot;buffalo&quot; was used to refer to the American mammal as early as 1625. The word &quot;bison&quot; was applied in the 1690s.

&quot;Buffalo&quot; was applied to the American bison by Samuel de Champlain as the French word &quot;buffles&quot; in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing. These were shown to him by members of the Nipissing First Nation, who said they traveled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals. &quot;Buffel&quot; in turn comes from Portuguese &quot;bufalo&quot; (water buffalo), which comes from Latin &quot;bufalus&quot; (an antelope, gazelle, or wild ox), from Greek &quot;boubalos&quot;. The same Greek word &quot;boubalos&quot; is also the origin for the Bubal hartebeest.

&quot;Bison&quot; was borrowed from French &quot;bison&quot; in the early 17th century, from Latin &quot;bison&quot; (aurochs), from a Proto-Germanic word similar to wisent and, per Etymonline, first applied to American buffalo in the 1690s.

In Plains Indian languages in general, male and female bison are distinguished, with each having a different designation rather than there being a single generic word covering both sexes. Thus:
* in Arapaho: (bison cow), (bison bull)
* in Lakota: (bison cow), (bison bull)
Such a distinction is not a general feature of the language (for example, Arapaho possesses gender-neutral terms for other large mammals such as elk, mule deer, etc.), and so presumably is due to the special significance of the bison in Plains Indian life and culture.

==Description==

A bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat. Male bison are significantly larger and heavier than females. Plains bison are often in the smaller range of sizes, and wood bison in the larger range. Head-rump lengths at maximum up to for males and for females long and the tail adding . Heights at withers in the species can reach up to for &quot;B. b. bison&quot; and &quot;B. b. athabascae&quot; respectively. Typically weights can range from , with medians of (&quot;B.b. bison&quot;) and (&quot;B.b.athabascae&quot;) in males, and with medians of in females, although the lowest weights probably representing typical weight around the age of sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age.

The heaviest wild bull for &quot;B.b.bison&quot; ever recorded weighed while there had been bulls estimated to be . &quot;B.b.athabascae&quot; is significantly larger and heavier on average than &quot;B.b.bison&quot; while the number of recorded samples for the former was limited after the rediscovery of a relatively pure herd. Elk Island National Park, which has wild populations of both wood and plains bison, has recorded maximum weights for bull bison of 1186 kg (plains) and 1099 kg (wood), but noted that 3/4 of all bison over 1000 kg were wood bison. When raised in captivity and farmed for meat, the bison can grow unnaturally heavy and the largest semidomestic bison weighed . The heads and forequarters are massive, and both sexes have short, curved horns that can grow up to long with to width, which they use in fighting for status within the herd and for defense.

Bison are herbivores, grazing on the grasses and sedges of the North American prairies. Their daily schedule involves two-hour periods of grazing, resting, and cud chewing, then moving to a new location to graze again. Sexually mature young bulls may try to start mating with cows by the age of two or three years, but if more mature bulls are present, they may not be able to compete until they reach five years of age.

For the first two months of life, calves are lighter in color than mature bison. Though extremely rare, white buffalos exist.

==Evolution==
Bison are members of the tribe Bovini. Genetic evidence from nuclear DNA indicates that the closest living relatives of bison are yaks, with bison being nested within the genus &quot;Bos,&quot; rendering &quot;Bos&quot; without including bison paraphyletic. While nuclear DNA indicates that the two living bison species are each other&#x27;s closest living relatives, the mitochondrial DNA of European bison is more closely related to that of domestic cattle and aurochs, which is suggested to be the result of either incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression. 

Bison first appeared in Asia during the Early Pleistocene, around 2.6 million years ago. Bison only arrived in North America 195,000 to 135,000 years ago, during the late Middle Pleistocene, descending from the widespread Siberian steppe bison (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;), which had migrated through Beringia. Following their first appearance in North America, the bison rapidly differentiated into new species, such as the largest of all bison, the long-horned &quot;Bison latifrons&quot;, along with &quot;Bison antiquus&quot;. The first appearance of bison in North America is considered to define the regional Rancholabrean faunal stage, due to its major impact on the ecology of the continent. Modern American bison are thought to have evolved from &quot;B. antiquus&quot; at the end of the Late Pleistocene - beginning of the Holocene, with likely intermediates between the species referred to as &quot;Bison &quot;occidentalis&quot;&quot;. The North American bison population experienced demographic stability during the Middle Holocene but began a slow decline in the Late Holocene beginning about 2,700 BP.

===Differences from European bison===

Although they are superficially similar, the American and European bison exhibit a number of physical and behavioral differences. Adult American bison are slightly heavier on average because of their less rangy build and have shorter legs, which render them slightly shorter at the shoulder. American bison tend to graze more and browse less than their European relatives because their necks are set differently. Compared to the nose of the American bison, that of the European species is set farther forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position. The body of the American bison is hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point forward through the plane of its face, making it more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favors charging. American bison are more easily tamed than the European and breed more readily with domestic cattle.

===Crossbreeding with cattle===
During the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce &quot;cattalo&quot; or &quot;beefalo&quot;. Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with bison cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%. Many claimed &quot;beefalo&quot;, even those regarded as pedigree, have no detectable bison ancestry. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics which prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species.

==Range and population==
Population estimates in 2010 ranged from 400,000 to 500,000, with approximately 20,500 animals in 62 conservation herds and the remainder in approximately 6,400 commercial herds. According to the IUCN, roughly 15,000 bison are considered wild, free-range bison not primarily confined by fencing.

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has reintroduced bison to over a dozen nature preserves around the United States. In October 2016, TNC established its easternmost bison herd in the country, at Kankakee Sands nature preserve in Morocco, Newton County, Indiana. In 2014, U.S. Tribes and Canadian First Nations signed a treaty to help with the restoration of bison, the first to be signed in nearly 150 years.

===Habitat and trails===
American bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the Yellowstone Park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above , and the Henry Mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of . Reintroduced plains bison in Banff National Park have been observed to roam mountainous areas, including high ridges and steep drainages, and archaeological finds indicate that some bison historically may have spent their lives within mountain ranges while others may have migrated in and out of mountain ranges.

Those in Yukon, Canada, typically summer in alpine plateaus above treeline. The first thoroughfares of North America, except for the time-obliterated paths of mastodon or muskox and the routes of the mound builders, were the traces made by bison and deer in seasonal migration and between feeding grounds and salt licks. Many of these routes, hammered by countless hoofs instinctively following watersheds and the crests of ridges in avoidance of lower places&#x27; summer muck and winter snowdrifts, and often following the routes of least resistance across rolling terrain, were followed by the aboriginal North Americans as routes to hunting grounds and as warriors&#x27; paths. They were invaluable to explorers and were adopted by pioneers.

Bison traces were characteristically north and south along seasonal migration routes, but several key east–west buffalo trails were used later as routes for railways. Some of these include the Cumberland Gap through the Blue Ridge Mountains to upper Kentucky. A heavily used trace crossed the Ohio River at the Falls of the Ohio and ran west, crossing the Wabash River near Vincennes, Indiana. In Senator Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s phrase saluting these sagacious path-makers, the bison paved the way for the railroads to the Pacific.

===Mexico===

The southern extent of the historic range of the American bison includes northern Mexico and adjoining areas in the United States as documented by archeological records and historical accounts from Mexican archives from 700 CE to the 19th century. The Janos-Hidalgo bison herd has ranged between Chihuahua, Mexico, and New Mexico, United States, since at least the 1920s. The persistence of this herd suggests that habitat for bison is suitable in northern Mexico. In 2009, genetically pure bison were reintroduced to the Janos Biosphere Reserve in northern Chihuahua adding to the Mexican bison population. In 2020, the second herd was formed in Maderas del Carmen. A private reserve named Jagüey de Ferniza has kept bisons since before the above-mentioned reintroductions in Coahuila.

===Introductions to Siberia===

Since 2006, an outherd of wood bison sent from Alberta&#x27;s Elk Island National Park was established in Yakutia, Russia as a practice of pleistocene rewilding; wood bison are the most similar to the extinct steppe bison species (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;). The bison are adapting well to the cold climate, and Yakutia&#x27;s Red List officially registered the species in 2019; a second herd was formed in 2020.

In Pleistocene Park, there are also 24 plains bison as wood bison could not be acquired.

==Behavior and ecology==

Bison are migratory and herd migrations can be directional as well as altitudinal in some areas. Bison have usual daily movements between foraging sites during the summer. In the Hayden Valley, Wyoming, bison have been recorded traveling, on average, per day. The summer ranges of bison appear to be influenced by seasonal vegetation changes, interspersion and size of foraging sites, the rut, and the number of biting insects. The size of preserve and availability of water may also be a factor. Bison are largely grazers, eating primarily grasses and sedges. On shortgrass pasture, bison predominately consume warm-season grasses. On mixed prairie, cool-season grasses, including some sedges, apparently compose 79–96% of their diet. In montane and northern areas, sedges are selected throughout the year. Bison also drink water or consume snow on a daily basis.

===Social behavior and reproduction===

Female bison live in maternal herds which include other females and their offspring. Male offspring leave their maternal herd when around three years old and either live alone or join other males in bachelor herds. Male and female herds usually do not mingle until the breeding season, which can occur from July through September. However, female herds may also contain a few older males. During the breeding season, dominant bulls maintain a small harem of females for mating. Individual bulls &quot;tend&quot; cows until allowed to mate, by following them around and chasing away rival males. The tending bull shields the female&#x27;s vision with his body so she will not see any other challenging males. A challenging bull may bellow or roar to get a female&#x27;s attention, and the tending bull has to bellow or roar back. The most dominant bulls mate in the first 2–3 weeks of the season. More subordinate bulls mate with any remaining estrous cow that has not mated yet. Male bison play no part in raising the young.

Bison herds have dominance hierarchies that exist for both males and females. A bison&#x27;s dominance is related to its birth date. Bison born earlier in the breeding season are more likely to be larger and more dominant as adults. Thus, bison are able to pass on their dominance to their offspring as dominant bison breed earlier in the season. In addition to dominance, the older bison of a generation also have a higher fertility rate than the younger ones.

Bison mate in August and September; gestation is 285 days. A single reddish-brown calf nurses until the next calf is born. If the cow is not pregnant, a calf will nurse for 18 months. Cows nurse their calves for at least 7 or 8 months, but most calves seem to be weaned before the end of their first year. At three years of age, bison cows are mature enough to produce a calf. The birthing period for bison in boreal biomes is protracted compared to that of other northern ungulates, such as moose and caribou.

Bison have a life expectancy around 15 years in the wild and up to 25 years in captivity. However, males and females from a hunted population also subject to wolf predation in northern Canada have been reported to live to 22 and 25 years of age, respectively.

Bison have been observed to display homosexual behaviors, males much more so than females. In the case of males, it is unlikely to be related to dominance, but rather to social bonding or gaining sexual experience.

===Horning===
Bison mate in late spring and summer in more open plain areas. During fall and winter, bison tend to gather in more wooded areas. During this time, bison partake in horning behaviors. They rub their horns against trees, young saplings, and even utility poles. Aromatic trees like cedars and pine seem to be preferred. Horning appears to be associated with insect defense, as it occurs most often in the fall when the insect population is at its highest. Cedar and pines emit an aroma after bison horn them and this seems to be used as a deterrent for insects.

===Wallowing behavior===
A bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, which bison use either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with dust or mud. Past and current hypotheses to explain the purpose of wallowing include grooming associated with shedding, male-male interaction (typically rutting), social behavior for group cohesion, play, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of ectoparasite (tick and lice) load, and thermoregulation. Bison wallowing has important ecosystem engineering effects and enhances plant and animal diversity on prairies.

===Predation===
While often secure from predation because of their size and strength, in some areas, vulnerable individuals are regularly preyed upon by wolves. Wolf predation typically peaks in late winter, when elk migrates south and bison are distressed with heavy snows and shortages of food sources, with attacks usually being concentrated on weakened and injured cows and calves. Wolves more actively target herds with calves than those without. The length of a predation episode varies, ranging from a few minutes to over nine hours. Bison calves use five apparent defense strategies in protecting themselves from wolves: running to a cow, running to a herd, running to the nearest bull, running in the front or center of a stampeding herd, and entering a lake or river or other body of water. When fleeing wolves in open areas, cows with young calves take the lead, while bulls take to the rear of the herds to guard the cows&#x27; escape. Bison typically ignore wolves not displaying hunting behavior. Wolf packs specializing in bison tend to have more males because their larger size than females allows them to wrestle prey to the ground more effectively. Healthy, mature bulls in herds rarely fall prey.

Grizzly bears are known to feed on carcass and may steal wolves&#x27; kills. Grizzlies can sometimes kill calves as well as old, injured, or sick adult bison, but direct killing of adult bison is rare even when grizzlies target lone and injured young individuals. Attacking a healthy bison is risky for a bear, who itself may be killed instead.

===Dangers to humans===
Bison are among the most dangerous animals encountered by visitors to the various North American national parks and will attack humans if provoked. They appear slow because of their lethargic movements but can easily outrun humans; bison have been observed running as fast as . Bison may approach people for curiosity. Close encounters, including to touch the animals, can be dangerous, and gunshots do not startle them.

Between 1980 and 1999, more than three times as many people in Yellowstone National Park were injured by bison than by bears. During this period, bison charged and injured 79 people, with injuries ranging from goring puncture wounds and broken bones to bruises and abrasions. Bears injured 24 people during the same time. Three people died from the injuries inflicted—one person by bison in 1983, and two people by bears in 1984 and 1986.

==Genetics==

A major problem that bison face today is a lack of genetic diversity due to the population bottleneck the species experienced during its near-extinction in the late 1800s. Another genetic issue is the entry of genes from domestic cattle into the bison population, through hybridization.

Officially, the &quot;American buffalo&quot; is classified by the United States government as a type of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. This is a reflection of the characteristics that bison share with cattle. Though the American bison is a separate species and usually regarded as being in a separate genus from domestic cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;), they have a lot of genetic compatibility with cattle. American bison can interbreed with cattle, although only the female offspring are fertile in the first generation. These female hybrids can be bred back to either bison or domestic bulls, resulting in either 1/4 or 3/4 bison young. Female offspring from this cross are also fertile, but males are not reliably fertile unless they are either bison or domestic. Moreover, when they do interbreed, crossbreed animals in the first generation tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining which is a purebred bison, a crossbred cow and a crossbred bison. Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and some natural hybridization could be expected in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for crossbreeding may sometimes have been common.

In recent decades, tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and most private &quot;buffalo&quot; herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds known to contain cattle genes has increased. As of 2011, though about 500,000 bison existed on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison were pure and not actually bison-cattle hybrids. DNA from domestic cattle (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;) has been found in almost all examined bison herds.

Significant public bison herds that do not appear to have hybridized domestic cattle genes are the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd, which was started with bison taken from Yellowstone Park, the Wind Cave bison herd, and the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd and subsidiary herds started from it, in Canada.

A landmark study of bison genetics performed by James Derr of Texas A&amp;M University corroborated this. The Derr study was undertaken in an attempt to determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison seem to be adapting successfully, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.
In the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state, and private herds. &quot;The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds,&quot; said Derr. &quot;All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.&quot;

It appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the Book Cliffs of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.

A separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in &quot;Genome&quot;, was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected &quot;wood buffalo&quot;. However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to genetic drift caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population. A side finding of this was that the Antelope Island bison herd appears to be most closely related to the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd, though the Antelope Island bison are actually plains bison.

In order to bolster the genetic diversity of the American bison, the National Park Service alongside the Department of the Interior announced the 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative on May 7, 2020. This initiative focuses on maintaining the genetic diversity of the metapopulation rather than individual herds. Small populations of bison are at considerably larger risk due to their decreased gene pool and are susceptible to catastrophic events more so than larger herds. The 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative aims to translocate up to three bison every five to ten years between the Department of the Interior&#x27;s herds. Specific smaller herds will require a more intense management plan. Translocated bison will also be screened for any health defects such as infection of brucellosis bacteria as to not put the larger herd at risk.

== Population bottleneck and near extinction ==
Bison went from numbering an estimated 60 million individuals before the 1870s to becoming nearly extinct in the 1880s. This was due to the mass slaughtering of bison during the 1870s, which caused the plains bison population to undergo a population bottleneck. The bottleneck resulted in a founding population of around 100 individuals, split into six herds, five of which were managed by private ranchers and one managed by the New York Zoological Park (now the Bronx Zoo). Additionally, a wild herd consisting of 25 individuals in Yellowstone National Park survived the bottleneck.

Each of the privately ranched herds had an initial effective population size (Ne) of an estimated 5 to 7 individuals, for a total combined effective population size of between 30 and 50 individuals, from which all of the modern plains bison descend. While these herds have remained mostly isolated, some more than others, there has been some interbreeding between the herds over the past 150 years.

The conservation efforts and copious amounts of data taken on American bison populations allow for American bison to serve as a useful study case of population bottlenecking and its effects. This is especially true of the Texas State Bison Herd, which underwent very extreme genetic bottlenecking, with a founding population of only 5 individuals.

=== Texas State Bison Herd ===
The Texas State Bison Herd (TSBH), also known as the Goodnight herd, was established by Charles Goodnight in the mid-1880s with five wild-caught calves. In 1887, the herd consisted of 13 individuals; in 1910, the population consisted of 125 individuals; and in the 1920s, the population ranged from 200 to 250 individuals. In 1929, Goodnight died and the herd switched hands multiple times, leaving the population of the herd unknown from 1930 until the herd was donated to the State of Texas in 1997, with a population of 36 individuals, solely descended from the original five calves. By 2002, the population of the TSBH consisted of 40 individuals and had concerningly low birth rates and high rates of calf mortality. This led to extra attention being given to this herd by conservationists who then performed significant amounts of genetic testing.

Goodnight was an advocate for the hybridization of bison with cattle, in the hopes of creating a stronger and healthier breed. When the herd was donated to the State of Texas, genetic testing revealed that 6 out of 36 individuals still carried cattle mitochondrial DNA.

Researchers found that the average number of alleles per locus and the heterozygosity levels (a measure of genetic diversity, where high heterozygosity is representative of high genetic diversity) for the TSBH were significantly lower than that of the Yellowstone National Park bison population and the Theodore Roosevelt National Park bison population. Additionally, of the 54 nuclear microsatellites that were examined, the TSBH had 8 monomorphic loci (i.e., each loci had only one allele), whereas in both the Yellowstone and Theodore Roosevelt herds there was only one monomorphic locus, indicating a much lower level of genetic diversity in the TSBH. The Yellowstone herd had an average number of alleles per locus of 4.75, the Theodore Roosevelt National Park herd had an average of 4.15 alleles per locus, but the TSBH only had an average of 2.54 alleles per locus, statistically significantly lower than the others. The heterozygosity level of the Yellowstone, Theodore Roosevelt, and TSBH populations were 0.63, 0.57, and 0.38 respectively, with the TSBH again having a statistically significantly lower value. This low genetic diversity found in TSBH is likely due to the critically low starting population, several additional bottlenecks throughout the herd&#x27;s history–leading to inbreeding depression–, and a continuously low population allowing for genetic drift to have a large effect. Before any addition of new individuals, the rate of loss of genetic diversity was estimated to be between 30 and 40% over the proceeding 50 years.

The inbreeding depression resulting from the multiple extreme population bottlenecks in the TSBH led to a coefficient of inbreeding of 0.367, equal to the level of inbreeding that results from two generations of full-siblings mating.

The Texas State Bison Herd is also a useful example of the deleterious effects of extreme population bottlenecking, with an average natality rate of 0.376 offspring per female and a 1st-year mortality rate of 52.6% from 1997 to 2002, compared to an average natality rate of 0.560 offspring per female and a 1st-year mortality rate of 4.2% for the other bison herds.

Additionally, if it were not for the intervention of conservationists, the Texas State Bison Herd would have most likely gone extinct, as the population bottleneck would have proven to be too severe. Multiple population models based on the genetics of the TSBH in the early 2000s predicted a 99% chance of extinction of the TSBH in less than 50 years, with an estimation in 2004 giving the TSBH a 99% chance of extinction in 41 years without the introduction of any outside individuals (Halbert et al. 2004). Importantly for conservation, another simulation predicted that the addition of multiple (3–9) outside male bison into the herd would increase genetic diversity enough to give the herd a 100% chance of surviving for another 100 years.

Conservation efforts have led the current TSBH population to be at the carrying capacity of their habitat, at around 300 individuals.

=== Yellowstone National Park Bison Herd ===

The Yellowstone National Park Bison herd started with only 25 individuals, and there was evidence of two population bottlenecking events from 1896 to 1912, with a population ranging between 25 and 50 individuals during this time. In 1902, 18 female and 3 male bison from outside herds–the Pablo-Allard herd and Goodnight (TSBH) herds respectively–were introduced to the Yellowstone herd. After the addition of those individuals, the effective population size is estimated to have been Ne=7.2 individuals. The Yellowstone herd was kept completely isolated from 1902 to around 1920, and these previously mentioned founders contributed between 60 and 70% of the genetics of the current bison population at Yellowstone.

Similar to the Texas State Bison Herd, the introduction of new individuals into the population in 1902 likely was the savior of this herd, which now numbers around 5,900 individuals as of summer 2022.

=== Population recovery ===
From the late 19th century onwards, the bison population gradually rose from 325 in 1884 to 500,000 in 2017, as a result of careful preservation and a general population boom. Although they are no longer classified as endangered, there are still conservation efforts in order to prevent population crashes down the line.

==Hunting==

Buffalo hunting, i.e. hunting of the American bison, was an activity fundamental to the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains, providing more than 150 uses for all parts of the animal, including being a major food source, hides for clothing and shelter, bones and horns as tools as well as ceremonial and adornment uses. Bison hunting was later adopted by American professional hunters, as well as by the U.S. government, in an effort to sabotage the central resource of some American Indian Nations during the later portions of the American Indian Wars, leading to the near-extinction of the species around 1890. For many tribes the buffalo was an integral part of life—something guaranteed to them by the Creator. In fact, for some Plains indigenous peoples, bison are known as the first people. The concept of species extinction was foreign to many tribes.

Thus, when the U.S. government began to massacre the buffalo, it was particularly harrowing to the Indigenous people. As Crow chief Plenty Coups described it: &quot;When the buffalo went away the hearts of my people fell to the ground, and they could not lift them up again. After this nothing happened. There was little singing anywhere.&quot; Spiritual loss was rampant; bison were an integral part of traditional tribal societies, and they would frequently take part in ceremonies for each bison they killed to honor its sacrifice. In order to boost morale during this time, Sioux and other tribes took part in the Ghost Dance, which consisted of hundreds of people dancing until 100 persons were lying unconscious.

Many conservation measures have been taken by Native Americans, with the Inter Tribal Bison Council being one of the most significant. Formed in 1990, it comprises 56 tribes in 19 states. These tribes represent a collective herd of more than 15,000 bison and focus on reestablishing herds on tribal lands in order to promote culture, revitalize spiritual solidarity, and restore the ecosystem. Some Inter Tribal Bison Council members argue that the bison&#x27;s economic value is one of the main factors driving its resurgence. Bison serve as a low-cost substitute for cattle, and they can withstand the winters in the Plains region far easier than cattle.

==As livestock==
Bison are increasingly raised for meat, hide, wool, and dairy products. The majority of American bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef, which has led to the development of beefalo, a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle. In 2005, about 35,000 bison were processed for meat in the U.S., with the National Bison Association and USDA providing a &quot;Certified American Buffalo&quot; program with birth-to-consumer tracking of bison via RFID ear tags. There is kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S., and the meat is then distributed nationwide.

Bison are found in publicly and privately held herds. Custer State Park in South Dakota is home to 1,500 bison, one of the largest publicly held herds in the world, but some question the genetic purity of the animals. Wildlife officials believe that free roaming herds with minimal cattle introgression on public lands in North America can be found only in: the Yellowstone Park bison herd; the Henry Mountains bison herd at the Book Cliffs and Henry Mountains in Utah; at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota; Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana; Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary in the Northwest Territories; Elk Island National Park and Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta; Grasslands National Park and Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan. 

Another population, the Antelope Island bison herd on Antelope Island in Utah, consisting of 550 to 700 bison, is also one of the largest and oldest public herds in the United States, but the bison in that herd are considered to be only semifree roaming, since they are confined to the Antelope Island. In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that, like most bison herds, the Antelope Island bison herd has a small number of genes from domestic cattle. In 2002, the United States government donated some bison calves from South Dakota and Colorado to the Mexican government. Their descendants live in the Mexican nature reserves El Uno Ranch at Janos and Santa Elena Canyon, Chihuahua, and Boquillas del Carmen, Coahuila, located near the southern banks of the Rio Grande, and around the grassland state line with Texas and New Mexico.

Recent genetic studies of privately owned herds of bison show that many of them include animals with genes from domestic cattle. For example, the herd on Santa Catalina Island, California, isolated since 1924 after being brought there for a movie shoot, were found to have cattle introgression. As few as 12,000 to 15,000 pure bison are estimated to remain in the world. The numbers are uncertain because the tests used to date—mitochondrial DNA analysis—indicate only if the maternal line (back from mother to mother) ever included domesticated bovines, thus say nothing about possible male input in the process. Most hybrids were found to look exactly like purebred bison; therefore, appearance is not a good indicator of genetics.

The size of the Canadian domesticated herd (genetic questions aside) grew dramatically through the 1990s and 2000s. The 2006 Census of Agriculture reported the Canadian herd at 195,728 head, a 34.9% increase since 2001. Of this total, over 95% were located in Western Canada, and less than 5% in Eastern Canada. Alberta was the province with the largest herd, accounting for 49.7% of the herd and 45.8% of the farms. The next-largest herds were in Saskatchewan (23.9%), Manitoba (10%), and British Columbia (6%). The main producing regions were in the northern parts of the Canadian prairies, specifically in the parkland belt, with the Peace River region (shared between Alberta and British Columbia) being the most important cluster, accounting for 14.4% of the national herd. Canada also exports bison meat, totaling in 2006.

A proposal known as Buffalo Commons has been suggested by a handful of academics and policymakers to restore large parts of the drier portion of the Great Plains to native prairie grazed by bison. Proponents argue that current agricultural use of the shortgrass prairie is not sustainable, pointing to periodic disasters, including the Dust Bowl, and continuing significant human population loss over the last 60 years. However, this plan is opposed by some who live in the areas in question.

=== Domestication ===
Despite being the closest relatives of domestic cattle native to North America, bison were never domesticated by Native Americans. Later attempts of domestication by Europeans prior to the 20th century met with limited success. Bison were described as having a &quot;wild and ungovernable temper&quot;; they can jump close to vertically, and run when agitated. This agility and speed, combined with their great size and weight, makes bison herds difficult to confine, as they can easily escape or destroy most fencing systems, including most razor wire. The most successful systems involve large, fences made from welded steel I beams sunk at least into concrete. These fencing systems, while expensive, require very little maintenance. Furthermore, making the fence sections overlap so the grassy areas beyond are not visible prevents the bison from trying to get to new range.

It has been alleged that the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II kept a bison at his private zoo (&quot;Totocalli&quot;) in Tenochtitlan, observed by the first Spanish conquistadors in the region; this would provide proof of Native Americans keeping bison in captivity, serve as an extremely far range extension south, and be the very first observation of bison by European colonists. These claims originate from Juan Díaz de Solís&#x27;s interpretation of Bernal Diaz del Castillo&#x27;s accounts of the &quot;totocalli&quot;, in which de Solís claims the conquistadors observed &quot;&quot;the Mexican Bull; a wonderful composition of divers Animals&quot;.&quot; However, further analysis of del Castillo&#x27;s account shows no such mention of such an animal, and the mention of this &quot;Mexican Bull&quot; was likely an embellishment by de Solís.

==As a symbol==

===Native Americans===

Among many Native American tribes, especially the Plains Indians, the bison is considered a sacred animal and religious symbol. According to University of Montana anthropology and Native American studies professor S. Neyooxet Greymorning, &quot;The creation stories of where buffalo came from put them in a very spiritual place among many tribes. The buffalo crossed many different areas and functions, and it was utilized in many ways. It was used in ceremonies, as well as to make tipi covers that provided homes for people, utensils, shields, weapons and parts were used for sewing with the sinew.&quot; The Sioux consider the birth of a white buffalo to be the return of White Buffalo Calf Woman, their primary cultural prophet and the bringer of their &quot;Seven Sacred Rites&quot;. Among the Mandan and Hidatsa, the White Buffalo Cow Society was the most sacred of societies for women.

===North America===
The American bison is often used in North America in official seals, flags, and logos. In 2016, the American bison became the national mammal of the United States. The bison is a popular symbol in the Great Plains states: Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming have adopted the animal as their official state mammal, and many sports teams have chosen the bison as their mascot. In Canada, the bison is the official animal of the province of Manitoba and appears on the Manitoba flag. It is also used in the official coat of arms of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Several American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the &quot;buffalo nickel&quot; from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the United States Mint coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its &quot;Westward Journey&quot; series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the &quot;50 State Quarter&quot; series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.

Other institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:

<doc id="49726" wikidata="Q438814" url="?curid=49726" title="Alternating group">
<text>In mathematics, an alternating group is the group of even permutations of a finite set. The alternating group on a set of elements is called the alternating group of degree, or the alternating group on letters and denoted by or 

== Basic properties ==
For , the group A&quot;n&quot; is the commutator subgroup of the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot; with index 2 and has therefore &quot;n&quot;!/2 elements. It is the kernel of the signature group homomorphism explained under symmetric group.

The group A&quot;n&quot; is abelian if and only if and simple if and only if or . A5 is the smallest non-abelian simple group, having order 60, and thus the smallest non-solvable group.

The group A4 has the Klein four-group V as a proper normal subgroup, namely the identity and the double transpositions , that is the kernel of the surjection of A4 onto . We have the exact sequence . In Galois theory, this map, or rather the corresponding map , corresponds to associating the Lagrange resolvent cubic to a quartic, which allows the quartic polynomial to be solved by radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari.

== Conjugacy classes ==
As in the symmetric group, any two elements of A&quot;n&quot; that are conjugate by an element of A&quot;n&quot; must have the same cycle shape. The converse is not necessarily true, however. If the cycle shape consists only of cycles of odd length with no two cycles the same length, where cycles of length one are included in the cycle type, then there are exactly two conjugacy classes for this cycle shape .

Examples:
*The two permutations (123) and (132) are not conjugates in A3, although they have the same cycle shape, and are therefore conjugate in S3.
*The permutation (123)(45678) is not conjugate to its inverse (132)(48765) in A8, although the two permutations have the same cycle shape, so they are conjugate in S8.

== Relation with symmetric group ==
:&quot;See Symmetric group&quot;.
As finite symmetric groups are the groups of all permutations of a set with finite elements, and the alternating groups are groups of even permutations, alternating groups are subgroups of finite symmetric groups.

== Generators and relations ==
For &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3, A&quot;n&quot; is generated by 3-cycles, since 3-cycles can be obtained by combining pairs of transpositions. This generating set is often used to prove that A&quot;n&quot; is simple for .

== Automorphism group ==

For , except for , the automorphism group of A&quot;n&quot; is the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot;, with inner automorphism group A&quot;n&quot; and outer automorphism group Z2; the outer automorphism comes from conjugation by an odd permutation.

For and 2, the automorphism group is trivial. For the automorphism group is Z2, with trivial inner automorphism group and outer automorphism group Z2.

The outer automorphism group of A6 is the Klein four-group , and is related to the outer automorphism of S6. The extra outer automorphism in A6 swaps the 3-cycles (like (123)) with elements of shape 32 (like ).

== Exceptional isomorphisms ==
There are some exceptional isomorphisms between some of the small alternating groups and small groups of Lie type, particularly projective special linear groups. These are:
* A4 is isomorphic to PSL2(3) and the symmetry group of chiral tetrahedral symmetry.
* A5 is isomorphic to PSL2(4), PSL2(5), and the symmetry group of chiral icosahedral symmetry. (See for an indirect isomorphism of using a classification of simple groups of order 60, and here for a direct proof).
* A6 is isomorphic to PSL2(9) and PSp4(2)&#x27;.
* A8 is isomorphic to PSL4(2).

More obviously, A3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z3, and A0, A1, and A2 are isomorphic to the trivial group (which is also for any &quot;q&quot;).

==Examples S4 and A4==


== Example A5 as a subgroup of 3-space rotations ==

A5 is the group of isometries of a dodecahedron in 3-space, so there is a representation .

In this picture the vertices of the polyhedra represent the elements of the group, with the center of the sphere representing the identity element. Each vertex represents a rotation about the axis pointing from the center to that vertex, by an angle equal to the distance from the origin, in radians. Vertices in the same polyhedron are in the same conjugacy class. Since the conjugacy class equation for A5 is , we obtain four distinct (nontrivial) polyhedra.

The vertices of each polyhedron are in bijective correspondence with the elements of its conjugacy class, with the exception of the conjugacy class of (2,2)-cycles, which is represented by an icosidodecahedron on the outer surface, with its antipodal vertices identified with each other. The reason for this redundancy is that the corresponding rotations are by radians, and so can be represented by a vector of length in either of two directions. Thus the class of (2,2)-cycles contains 15 elements, while the icosidodecahedron has 30 vertices.

The two conjugacy classes of twelve 5-cycles in A5 are represented by two icosahedra, of radii 2/5 and 4/5, respectively. The nontrivial outer automorphism in interchanges these two classes and the corresponding icosahedra.

==Example: the 15 puzzle==

It can be proved that the 15 puzzle, a famous example of the sliding puzzle, can be represented by the alternating group A15, because the combinations of the 15 puzzle can be generated by 3-cycles. In fact, any sliding puzzle with square tiles of equal size can be represented by A2&quot;k&quot;−1.

==Subgroups==
A4 is the smallest group demonstrating that the converse of Lagrange&#x27;s theorem is not true in general: given a finite group &quot;G&quot; and a divisor &quot;d&quot; of , there does not necessarily exist a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; with order &quot;d&quot;: the group , of order 12, has no subgroup of order 6. A subgroup of three elements (generated by a cyclic rotation of three objects) with any distinct nontrivial element generates the whole group.

For all , A&quot;n&quot; has no nontrivial (that is, proper) normal subgroups. Thus, A&quot;n&quot; is a simple group for all . A5 is the smallest non-solvable group.

==Group homology==

The group homology of the alternating groups exhibits stabilization, as in stable homotopy theory: for sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;, it is constant. However, there are some low-dimensional exceptional homology. Note that the homology of the symmetric group exhibits similar stabilization, but without the low-dimensional exceptions (additional homology elements).

=== &quot;H&quot;1: Abelianization ===
The first homology group coincides with abelianization, and (since A&quot;n&quot; is perfect, except for the cited exceptions) is thus:
:&quot;H&quot;1(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z1 for &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2;
:&quot;H&quot;1(A3, Z) = A = A3 = Z3;
:&quot;H&quot;1(A4, Z) = A = Z3;
:&quot;H&quot;1(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z1 for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5.

This is easily seen directly, as follows. A&quot;n&quot; is generated by 3-cycles – so the only non-trivial abelianization maps are since order-3 elements must map to order-3 elements – and for all 3-cycles are conjugate, so they must map to the same element in the abelianization, since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups. Thus a 3-cycle like (123) must map to the same element as its inverse (321), but thus must map to the identity, as it must then have order dividing 2 and 3, so the abelianization is trivial.

For , A&quot;n&quot; is trivial, and thus has trivial abelianization. For A3 and A4 one can compute the abelianization directly, noting that the 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes (rather than all being conjugate) and there are non-trivial maps (in fact an isomorphism) and .

=== &quot;H&quot;2: Schur multipliers ===

The Schur multipliers of the alternating groups A&quot;n&quot; (in the case where &quot;n&quot; is at least 5) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where &quot;n&quot; is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is (the cyclic group) of order 6. These were first computed in .

:&quot;H&quot;2(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z1 for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3;
:&quot;H&quot;2(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z2 for &quot;n&quot; = 4, 5;
:&quot;H&quot;2(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z6 for &quot;n&quot; = 6, 7;
:&quot;H&quot;2(A&quot;n&quot;, Z) = Z2 for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 8.

<text>In mathematics, when &quot;X&quot; is a finite set with at least two elements, the permutations of &quot;X&quot; (i.e. the bijective functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;) fall into two classes of equal size: the even permutations and the odd permutations. If any total ordering of &quot;X&quot; is fixed, the parity (oddness or evenness) of a permutation formula_1 of &quot;X&quot; can be defined as the parity of the number of inversions for &quot;σ&quot;, i.e., of pairs of elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that and .

The sign, signature, or signum of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; is denoted sgn(&quot;σ&quot;) and defined as +1 if &quot;σ&quot; is even and −1 if &quot;σ&quot; is odd. The signature defines the alternating [[character (mathematics)|character]] of the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot;. Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general Levi-Civita symbol (&quot;ε&quot;&quot;σ&quot;), which is defined for all maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;, and has value zero for non-bijective maps.

The sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as
where &quot;N&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;) is the number of inversions in &quot;σ&quot;.

Alternatively, the sign of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; can be defined from its decomposition into the product of transpositions as
where &quot;m&quot; is the number of transpositions in the decomposition. Although such a decomposition is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions in all decompositions is the same, implying that the sign of a permutation is well-defined.

== Example ==
Consider the permutation &quot;σ&quot; of the set defined by formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 formula_5 and formula_6 In one-line notation, this permutation is denoted 34521. It can be obtained from the identity permutation 12345 by three transpositions: first exchange the numbers 2 and 4, then exchange 3 and 5, and finally exchange 1 and 3. This shows that the given permutation &quot;σ&quot; is odd. Following the method of the cycle notation article, this could be written, composing from right to left, as
: formula_7
There are many other ways of writing &quot;σ&quot; as a composition of transpositions, for instance
but it is impossible to write it as a product of an even number of transpositions.

== Properties ==
The identity permutation is an even permutation. An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an even number (and only an even number) of exchanges (called transpositions) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.

The following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:
* the composition of two even permutations is even
* the composition of two odd permutations is even
* the composition of an odd and an even permutation is odd
From these it follows that
* the inverse of every even permutation is even
* the inverse of every odd permutation is odd

Considering the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot; of all permutations of the set {1, ..., &quot;n&quot;}, we can conclude that the map
that assigns to every permutation its signature is a group homomorphism.

Furthermore, we see that the even permutations form a subgroup of S&quot;n&quot;. This is the alternating group on &quot;n&quot; letters, denoted by A&quot;n&quot;. It is the kernel of the homomorphism sgn. The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a coset of A&quot;n&quot; (in S&quot;n&quot;).

If , then there are just as many even permutations in S&quot;n&quot; as there are odd ones; consequently, A&quot;n&quot; contains &quot;n&quot;!/2 permutations. (The reason is that if &quot;σ&quot; is even then is odd, and if &quot;σ&quot; is odd then is even, and these two maps are inverse to each other.)

A cycle is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like
:formula_8
In practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.

Another method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding permutation matrix and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.

Every permutation of odd order must be even. The permutation in A4 shows that the converse is not true in general.

== Equivalence of the two definitions ==
This section presents proofs that the parity of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; can be defined in two equivalent ways:

* as the parity of the number of inversions in &quot;σ&quot; (under any ordering); or
* as the parity of the number of transpositions that &quot;σ&quot; can be decomposed to (however we choose to decompose it).



== Other definitions and proofs ==
The parity of a permutation of formula_9 points is also encoded in its cycle structure.

Let &quot;σ&quot; = (&quot;i&quot;1 &quot;i&quot;2 ... &quot;i&quot;&quot;r&quot;+1)(&quot;j&quot;1 &quot;j&quot;2 ... &quot;j&quot;&quot;s&quot;+1)...(&quot;ℓ&quot;1 &quot;ℓ&quot;2 ... &quot;ℓ&quot;&quot;u&quot;+1) be the unique decomposition of &quot;σ&quot; into disjoint cycles, which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle involving points can always be obtained by composing &quot;k&quot; transpositions (2-cycles):

:formula_10

so call &quot;k&quot; the &quot;size&quot; of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into &quot;m&quot; disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of &quot;σ&quot; into transpositions, where &quot;k&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the size of the &quot;i&quot;th cycle. The number is called the discriminant of &quot;σ&quot;, and can also be computed as

:formula_11

if we take care to include the fixed points of &quot;σ&quot; as 1-cycles.

Suppose a transposition (&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;) is applied after a permutation &quot;σ&quot;. When &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are in different cycles of &quot;σ&quot; then
:formula_12,

and if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are in the same cycle of &quot;σ&quot; then

:formula_13.

In either case, it can be seen that , so the parity of &quot;N&quot;((&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;)&quot;σ&quot;) will be different from the parity of &quot;N&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;).

If is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation &quot;σ&quot; into transpositions, by applying the &quot;r&quot; transpositions formula_14 after &quot;t&quot;2 after ... after &quot;t&quot;&quot;r&quot; after the identity (whose &quot;N&quot; is zero) observe that &quot;N&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;) and &quot;r&quot; have the same parity. By defining the parity of &quot;σ&quot; as the parity of &quot;N&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;), a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.

; Remarks:
* A careful examination of the above argument shows that , and since any decomposition of &quot;σ&quot; into cycles whose sizes sum to &quot;r&quot; can be expressed as a composition of &quot;r&quot; transpositions, the number &quot;N&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;) is the minimum possible sum of the sizes of the cycles in a decomposition of &quot;σ&quot;, including the cases in which all cycles are transpositions.
* This proof does not introduce a (possibly arbitrary) order into the set of points on which &quot;σ&quot; acts.

== Generalizations ==
Parity can be generalized to Coxeter groups: one defines a length function ℓ(&quot;v&quot;), which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, adjacent transpositions), and then the function gives a generalized sign map.

<doc id="49728" wikidata="Q62" url="?curid=49728" title="San Francisco">
<text>San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a commercial, financial, and cultural center within Northern California. With a population of 808,988 residents as of 2023, San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in the state of California and the 17th-most populous in the United States. It covers a land area of at the upper end of the San Francisco Peninsula, making it the second-most densely populated major U.S. city and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county. Among U.S. cities proper with over 250,000 residents, San Francisco is ranked first by per capita income and sixth by aggregate income as of 2023. San Francisco anchors the 13th-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., with almost 4.6 million residents in 2023. The larger San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth-largest urban region in the U.S., had a 2023 estimated population of over nine million.

Prior to European settlement, the modern city proper was inhabited by the Yelamu, who spoke Ramaytush Ohlone. On June 29, 1776, settlers from New Spain established the Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate, and the Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, both named for Francis of Assisi. The California gold rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, transforming an unimportant hamlet into a busy port, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. In 1856, San Francisco became a consolidated city-county. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, it was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama–Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, it was a major port of embarkation for naval service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, significant immigration, liberalizing attitudes, the rise of the beatnik and hippie countercultures, the sexual revolution, opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism.

San Francisco and the surrounding San Francisco Bay Area are a global center of economic activity and the arts and sciences, spurred by leading universities, high-tech, healthcare, finance, insurance, real estate, and professional services sectors. , the metropolitan area, with 4.5 million residents, ranked 5th by GDP ($874 billion) and 2nd by GDP per capita ($131,082) across the OECD countries. In 2023, San Francisco proper had a GDP of $263.1 billion and a GDP per capita of $325,000. Despite an accelerating exodus of businesses from the downtown area of San Francisco, the city is still home to numerous companies inside and outside of technology, including Salesforce, Uber, Airbnb, OpenAI, Levi&#x27;s, Gap, Dropbox, and Lyft.

In 2022, San Francisco had more than 1.7 million international visitors and approximately 20 million domestic ones. It is known for its steep rolling hills and eclectic mix of architecture across varied neighborhoods; its Chinatown and Mission districts; mild climate; and landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, and Alcatraz. The city is home to educational and cultural institutions such as the University of California, San Francisco, the University of San Francisco, San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the Legion of Honor (museum), the de Young Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Ballet, the San Francisco Opera, the SFJAZZ Center, and the California Academy of Sciences. Two major league sports teams, the San Francisco Giants and the Golden State Warriors, play their home games within San Francisco proper. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) offers flights to over 125 destinations, while a light rail and bus network, in tandem with the BART and Caltrain systems, connects nearly every part of San Francisco with the wider region.

== Etymology ==

San Francisco, which is Spanish for &quot;Saint Francis&quot;, takes its name from Mission San Francisco de Asís, which in turn was named after Saint Francis of Assisi. The mission received its name in 1776, when it was founded by the Spanish under the leadership of Padre Francisco Palóu. The city has officially been known as San Francisco since 1847, when Washington Allon Bartlett, then serving as the city&#x27;s alcalde, renamed it from Yerba Buena (Spanish for &quot;Good Herb&quot;), which had been the name of the first civilian &quot;pueblo&quot; in San Francisco, as well as the name of Yerba Buena Cove, which the &quot;pueblo&quot; was on the shore of. Earlier in San Francisco&#x27;s history, the uninhabited area on the northeastern side of San Francisco was called &quot;El Paraje de Yerba Buena&quot;, after the herb that was growing abundantly there. The name Yerba Buena continues to be used in locations in the city, such as on Yerba Buena Island and in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts and Yerba Buena Gardens.

While people residing outside the San Francisco Bay Area use nicknames including &quot;Frisco&quot; and &quot;San Fran&quot;, local residents generally refer to San Francisco as &quot;the City&quot; or &quot;SF&quot;. The choice of nickname a person uses is a common way for locals to distinguish long-time residents from tourists and recent arrivals. The nicknames &quot;San Fran&quot; and &quot;Frisco&quot; are somewhat controversial among San Francisco residents.

== History ==

=== Indigenous history ===
The earliest archeological evidence of human habitation of the territory of San Francisco dates to 3000 BCE. The Yelamu group of the Ramaytush people resided in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay. The Ohlone name for San Francisco was &quot;Ahwaste&quot;, meaning, &quot;place at the bay&quot;. The arrival of Spanish colonists, and the implementation of their Mission system, marked the beginning of the assimilation of the Ramaytush people, and the decline of their language and culture.

===Spanish era===
The Spanish Empire claimed San Francisco as part of Las Californias, a province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish first arrived in what is now San Francisco on November 2, 1769, when the Portolá expedition led by Don Gaspar de Portolá and Juan Crespí arrived at San Francisco Bay. Having noted the strategic benefits of the area due to its large natural harbor, the Spanish dispatched Pedro Fages in 1770 to find a more direct route to the San Francisco Peninsula from Monterey, which would become part of the El Camino Real route. By 1774, Juan Bautista de Anza had arrived to the area to select the sites for a mission and presidio. The first European maritime presence in San Francisco Bay occurred on August 5, 1775, when the Spanish ship &quot;San Carlos&quot;, commanded by Juan Manuel de Ayala, became the first ship to anchor in the bay.

Soon after, on March 28, 1776, Anza established the Presidio of San Francisco. On October 9, Mission San Francisco de Asís, also known as Mission Dolores, was founded by Padre Francisco Palóu. In 1794, the Presidio established the Castillo de San Joaquín, a fortification on the southern side of the Golden Gate, which later came to be known as Fort Point.

In 1804, the province of Alta California was created, which included San Francisco. At its peak in 1810–1820, the average population at the Mission Dolores settlement was about 1,100 people.

===Mexican era===
In 1821, the Californias were ceded to Mexico by Spain. The extensive California mission system gradually lost its influence during the period of Mexican rule, although it was not until 1833 that the missions would be secularized. Agricultural land became largely privatized as ranchos, as was occurring in other parts of California. Coastal trade increased, including a half-dozen barques from various Atlantic ports which regularly sailed in California waters.

With the enactment of the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, the missions were made to divest themselves of their extensive landholdings and emancipate the indigenous people under their control. As part of the process of secularization, Governor José Figueroa opened up San Francisco to civilian settlement. Prior to secularization, the only settlements in San Francisco had been the military settlement at the Presidio and the religious settlement at Mission Dolores. In 1835, the Presidio garrison, commanded by Mariano Vallejo, relocated to the Presidio of Sonoma, which was regarded as needing a greater military presence due the proximity of the Russian settlement at Fort Ross. Only a small detachment remained at the Presidio of San Francisco. Mission Dolores sold most of its property in 1836, retaining only the church and related structures. 

In 1833, Juana Briones de Miranda was granted a small rancho at El Polín Spring, near the Presidio, founding the first non-indigenous civilian household in San Francisco. In 1834, the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Yerba Buena was founded. Yerba Buena Cove (named after a native herb) was already a favored anchorage spot and the new settlement and trading post was founded by its shores. Yerba Buena was located in what is now the city&#x27;s Chinatown and Financial District and was centered on a plaza that is now Portsmouth Square. A land survey of Yerba Buena was made by the Swiss immigrant Jean Jacques Vioget as prelude to the city plan. 

Francisco de Haro, a non-Californio Mexican native, became the first alcalde of Yerba Buena. The second alcalde José Joaquín Estudillo was a Californio from a prominent Monterey family. In 1835, while in office, he approved the first land grant in Yerba Buena: to William Richardson, a naturalized Mexican citizen of English birth. Richardson had arrived in San Francisco aboard a whaling ship in 1822. In 1825, he married Maria Antonia Martinez, eldest daughter of the Californio Ygnacio Martínez.
Yerba Buena began to attract American and European settlers; an 1842 census listed 21 residents (11%) born in the United States or Europe, as well as one Filipino merchant. 
Following the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma and the beginning of the U.S. Conquest of California, American forces from the &quot;USS Portsmouth&quot; under the command of John B. Montgomery captured Yerba Buena on July 9, 1846, with little resistance from the local Californio population, raising the American flag over Yerba Buena plaza (later renamed Portsmouth Square in commemoration of this event). 

Following the capture, U.S. forces appointed both José de Jesús Noé and Washington Allon Bartlett to serve as co-alcaldes (mayors), while the conquest continued on in the rest of California. On January 30, 1847, Mayor Bartlett ordained that the city should officially change its name from &quot;Yerba Buena&quot; to &quot;San Francisco&quot;, as the former name was only locally recognized and the latter name was in use on international maps. There was also concern that a new town being planned by General Vallejo on the Carquinez Strait was to be called &quot;Francisca&quot;, after the first name of his wife. After the name change to &quot;San Francisco&quot;, the name of Vallejo&#x27;s town was changed to Benicia, after his wife&#x27;s middle name. Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, Alta California was ceded from Mexico to the United States.

=== Post-Conquest era ===
Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, post-Conquest San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography. Situated at the tip of a windswept peninsula without water or firewood, San Francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement. These natural disadvantages forced the town&#x27;s residents to bring water, fuel and food to the site. Its 1847 population was said to be 459.

The California gold rush brought a flood of treasure seekers (known as &quot;forty-niners&quot;, as in &quot;1849&quot;). Prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival Benicia, raising the population from 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 by December 1849. The promise of wealth was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields, leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco harbor. Some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons, and hotels; many were left to rot, and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851, the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870, Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.

California was quickly granted statehood in 1850, and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island to secure San Francisco Bay. San Francisco County was one of the state&#x27;s 18 original counties established at California statehood in 1850. Until 1856, San Francisco&#x27;s city limits extended west to Divisadero Street and Castro Street, and south to 20th Street. In 1856, the California state government divided the county. A straight line was then drawn across the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula just north of San Bruno Mountain. Everything south of the line became the new San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco.

The California gold rush triggered a wave of entrepreneurial activity as individuals sought to capitalize on the newfound wealth. The discovery of silver deposits, notably the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further fueled rapid population growth and economic expansion.

San Francisco, as the gateway to the goldfields, experienced a surge in population and commercial activity. However, the influx of fortune seekers also brought challenges. Lawlessness was rampant, and the Barbary Coast district became synonymous with vice, attracting criminals, prostitutes, and illicit activities, including but not limited to prostitution, bootlegging, and gambling. The rapidly growing population, with its lawlessness, gambling and other vices, and the fact that there were no churches to be found, prompted missionaries like William Taylor to come to San Francisco where he began preaching in the streets, using an upright barrel as his pulpit. Taylor was able to garner enough generous donations from successful gold miners with which he used to build a church.

One of the most influential figures of this era was William Chapman Ralston. A shrewd banker and investor, Ralston amassed considerable wealth and influence in San Francisco. He gained control over a significant portion of the Comstock Lode&#x27;s gold and silver mines, establishing a virtual monopoly. Using his incredible clout, Ralston was able to generate millions of dollars for San Francisco during its heady boom years. He founded the Bank of California, the first bank in the Western United States, and built the opulent Palace Hotel, a symbol of San Francisco&#x27;s newfound prosperity and the largest hotel in the country at the time. His financial empire, however, collapsed in 1875 as a result of the Panic of 1873, triggering a major economic crisis in San Francisco.

Development of the Port of San Francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern U.S. rail system via the newly completed Pacific Railroad (the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support) helped make the Bay Area a center for trade. Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population, Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and Domingo Ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate. Chinese immigrants made the city a polyglot culture, drawn to &quot;Old Gold Mountain&quot;, creating the city&#x27;s Chinatown quarter. By 1880, Chinese made up 9.3% of the population. 

The first cable cars carried San Franciscans up Clay Street in 1873. The city&#x27;s sea of Victorian houses began to take shape, and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park, resulting in plans for Golden Gate Park. San Franciscans built schools, churches, theaters, and all the hallmarks of civic life. The Presidio developed into the most important American military installation on the Pacific coast. By 1890, San Francisco&#x27;s population approached 300,000, making it the eighth-largest city in the United States at the time. Around 1901, San Francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style, stately hotels, ostentatious mansions on Nob Hill, and a thriving arts scene. The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904.

=== 1906 earthquake and interwar era ===

At 5:12 am on April 18, 1906, a major earthquake struck San Francisco and northern California. As buildings collapsed from the shaking, ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days. With water mains out of service, the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks. More than three-quarters of the city lay in ruins, including almost all of the downtown core. Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people died, though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands. More than half of the city&#x27;s population of 400,000 was left homeless. Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, on the beaches, and elsewhere. Many fled permanently to the East Bay. Jack London is remembered for having famously eulogized the earthquake: &quot;Not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed. San Francisco is gone.&quot;

Rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale. Rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid, San Franciscans opted for speed. Amadeo Giannini&#x27;s Bank of Italy, later to become Bank of America, provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated. The influential San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association or SPUR was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake. The earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire, including Pacific Heights, where many of the city&#x27;s wealthy rebuilt their homes. In turn, the destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels. City Hall rose again in the Beaux Arts style, and the city celebrated its rebirth at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915.
During this period, San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure. Civil Engineer Michael O&#x27;Shaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the Stockton Street Tunnel, the Twin Peaks Tunnel, the San Francisco Municipal Railway, the Auxiliary Water Supply System, and new sewers. San Francisco&#x27;s streetcar system, of which the J, K, L, M, and N lines survive today, was pushed to completion by O&#x27;Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927. It was the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, and Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct that would have the largest effect on San Francisco. An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today.

In ensuing years, the city solidified its standing as a financial capital; in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed. Indeed, it was at the height of the Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects, simultaneously constructing the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, completing them in 1936 and 1937, respectively. It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz, a former military stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone, and Robert Franklin Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz. San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a World&#x27;s fair, the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939–40, creating Treasure Island in the middle of the bay to house it.

=== Contemporary era ===
During World War II, the city-owned Sharp Park in Pacifica was used as an internment camp to detain Japanese Americans. Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a hub of activity, and Fort Mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. The explosion of jobs drew many people, especially African Americans from the South, to the area. After the end of the war, many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay. The United Nations Charter creating the United Nations was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and, in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco re-established peaceful relations between Japan and the Allied Powers.

Urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west-side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways, of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen-led opposition. The onset of containerization made San Francisco&#x27;s small piers obsolete, and cargo activity moved to the larger Port of Oakland. The city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy. The suburbs experienced rapid growth, and San Francisco underwent significant demographic change, as large segments of the white population left the city, supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America. From 1950 to 1980, the city lost over 10 percent of its population.

Over this period, San Francisco became a magnet for America&#x27;s counterculture movement. Beat Generation writers fueled the San Francisco Renaissance and centered on the North Beach neighborhood in the 1950s. Hippies flocked to Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, reaching a peak with the 1967 Summer of Love. In 1974, the Zebra murders left at least 16 people dead. In the 1970s, the city became a center of the gay rights movement, with the emergence of The Castro as an urban gay village, the election of Harvey Milk to the Board of Supervisors, and his assassination, along with that of Mayor George Moscone, in 1978.

Bank of America, now based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was founded in San Francisco; the bank completed 555 California Street in 1969. The Transamerica Pyramid was completed in 1972, igniting a wave of &quot;Manhattanization&quot; that lasted until the late 1980s, a period of extensive high-rise development downtown. The 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city, an issue that remains today, despite many attempts to address it. 

The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area. In San Francisco, the quake severely damaged structures in the Marina and South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged Central Freeway, allowing the city to reclaim The Embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the Hayes Valley neighborhood.

The three recent decades have seen booms driven by the internet industry. During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, startup companies invigorated the San Francisco economy. Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city, followed by marketing, design, and sales professionals, changing the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified. Demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high-rise development, this time in the South of Market district. By 2000, the city&#x27;s population reached new highs, surpassing the previous record set in 1950. When the bubble burst in 2001, many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off. Yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the San Francisco economy. By the mid-2000s (decade), the social media boom had begun, with San Francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a common place to live for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google.

The early 2020s saw a reduction of tech companies&#x27; presence in Downtown San Francisco in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased popularity of working at home, and struggles with homelessness. Although some observers have raised the possibility that office vacancies and declining tax revenues could cause San Francisco to enter an economic doom loop, other sources have refuted this broad-based characterization of the city as a whole, asserting that the issues of concern are restricted primarily to the urban core of San Francisco. As of March 2024, Union Square was in &quot;sorry shape&quot; and had lost its traditional position as the Bay Area&#x27;s regional shopping hub to Westfield Valley Fair in San Jose.

The Ferry Station Post Office Building, Armour &amp; Co. Building, Atherton House, and YMCA Hotel are historic buildings among dozens of historical landmarks in the city, according to the National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco.

==Geography==

San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States, at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries. Several picturesque islands—Alcatraz, Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Island—are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited Farallon Islands, offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a &quot;seven-by-seven-mile square&quot;, a common local colloquialism referring to the city&#x27;s shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly .

There are more than 50 hills within the city limits. Some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated, including Nob Hill, Potrero Hill, and Russian Hill. Near the geographic center of the city, southwest of the downtown area, are a series of less densely populated hills. Twin Peaks, a pair of hills forming one of the city&#x27;s highest points, forms an overlook spot. San Francisco&#x27;s tallest hill, Mount Davidson, is high and is capped with a tall cross built in 1934. Dominating this area is Sutro Tower, a large red and white radio and television transmission tower reaching 1,811 ft (552 m) above sea level.

The nearby San Andreas and Hayward Faults are responsible for much earthquake activity, although neither physically passes through the city itself. The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city&#x27;s infrastructure development. The city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes, requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction. However, there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage. USGS has released the California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California.

San Francisco&#x27;s shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the Marina, Mission Bay, and Hunters Point, as well as large sections of the Embarcadero, sit on areas of landfill. Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the Yerba Buena Tunnel through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge. Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes. The resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it, as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A few natural lakes and creeks (Lake Merced, Mountain Lake, Pine Lake, Lobos Creek, El Polin Spring) are within parks and remain protected in what is essentially their original form, but most of the city&#x27;s natural watercourses, such as Islais Creek and Mission Creek, have been partially or completely culverted and built over. Since the 1990s, however, the Public Utilities Commission has been studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks.

===Neighborhoods===


An &quot;Historical Center of San Francisco&quot; monument,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfG/rs/unP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the 1899–1906 City Hall was once located,&lt;ref name=&quot;a&amp;A/Csf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is in United Nations Plaza, at 

The earliest center of San Francisco is Portsmouth Square, in the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. Here in the northeast quadrant, the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city&#x27;s business tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, and Pier 39, where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city&#x27;s Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was once San Francisco&#x27;s industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of Oracle Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco and Chase Center, which opened in 2019 as the new home of the Golden State Warriors.

West of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II. The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact, including the famous &quot;Painted Ladies&quot;, standing alongside Alamo Square. To the south, near the geographic center of the city is Haight-Ashbury, famously associated with 1960s hippie culture. The Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques and a few controversial chain stores, although it still retains some bohemian character.

North of the Western Addition is Pacific Heights, an affluent neighborhood that features the homes built by wealthy San Franciscans in the wake of the 1906 earthquake. Directly north of Pacific Heights facing the waterfront is the Marina, a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the Bay.

In the southeast quadrant of the city is the Mission District—populated in the 19th century by Californios and working-class immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Scandinavia. In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from Mexico began to predominate. In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to twenty-something professionals. Noe Valley to the southwest and Bernal Heights to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children. East of the Mission is the Potrero Hill neighborhood, a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco. West of the Mission, the area historically known as Eureka Valley, now popularly called the Castro, was once a working-class Scandinavian and Irish area. It has become North America&#x27;s first gay village, and is now the center of gay life in the city. Located near the city&#x27;s southern border, the Excelsior District is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco. The Bayview-Hunters Point in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and urban renewal projects.

The construction of the Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of West Portal, and nearby affluent Forest Hill and St. Francis Wood. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to Golden Gate Park lies the vast Sunset District, a large middle-class area with a predominantly Asian population.

The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the Richmond, a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many Russian and Ukrainian immigrants. Together, these areas are known as The Avenues. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the Ferry Building, while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.

===Climate===

San Francisco has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;, Trewartha: Csll), characteristic of California&#x27;s coast, with moist winters and dry summers. San Francisco&#x27;s weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city, and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east. This moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year-round climate with little seasonal temperature variation.

Among major U.S. cities, San Francisco has the coolest daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for June, July, and August. During the summer, rising hot air in California&#x27;s interior valleys creates a low-pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city&#x27;s characteristic cool winds and fog. The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall. As a result, the year&#x27;s warmest month, on average, is September, and on average, October is warmer than July, especially in daytime.

Temperatures reach or exceed on an average of only 21 and 23 days a year at downtown and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), respectively. The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at . The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at . On average, there are 73 rainy days a year, and annual precipitation averages . Variation in precipitation from year to year is high. Above-average rain years are often associated with warm El Niño conditions in the Pacific while dry years often occur in cold water La Niña periods. In 2013 (a &quot;La Niña&quot; year), a record low of rainfall was recorded at downtown San Francisco, where records have been kept since 1849. Snowfall in the city is very rare, with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852, most recently in 1976 when up to fell on Twin Peaks.

The highest recorded temperature at the official National Weather Service downtown observation station was on September 1, 2017. During that hot spell, the warmest ever night of was also recorded. The lowest recorded temperature was on December 11, 1932.

During an average year between 1991 and 2020, San Francisco recorded a warmest night at and a coldest day at . The coldest daytime high since the station&#x27;s opening in 1945 was recorded in December 1972 at .

As a coastal city, San Francisco will be heavily affected by climate change. , sea levels are projected to rise by as much as , resulting in periodic flooding, rising groundwater levels, and lowland floods from more severe storms.

San Francisco falls under the USDA 10b Plant hardiness zone, though some areas, particularly downtown, border zone 11a.

Historically, tule elk were present in San Francisco County, based on archeological evidence of elk remains in at least five different Native American shellmounds: at Hunter&#x27;s Point, Fort Mason, Stevenson Street, Market Street, and Yerba Buena. Perhaps the first historical observer record was from the De Anza Expedition on March 23, 1776. Herbert Eugene Bolton wrote about the expedition camp at Mountain Lake, near the southern end of today&#x27;s Presidio: &quot;Round about were grazing deer, and scattered here and there were the antlers of large elk.&quot; Also, when Richard Henry Dana Jr. visited San Francisco Bay in 1835, he wrote about vast elk herds near the Golden Gate: on December 27 &quot;...we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay, under a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of hundreds and hundreds of red deer [note: &quot;red deer&quot; is the European term for &quot;elk&quot;], and the stag, with his high branching antlers, were bounding about...&quot;, although it is not clear whether this was the Marin side or the San Francisco side.

==Demographics==

The 2020 United States census showed San Francisco&#x27;s population to be 873,965, an increase of 8.5% from the 2010 census. With roughly one-quarter the population density of Manhattan, San Francisco is the second-most densely populated large American city, behind only New York City among cities greater than 200,000 population, and the fifth-most densely populated U.S. county, following only four of the five New York City boroughs.

San Francisco is part of the five-county San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region of 4.7 million people (13th most populous in the U.S.), and has served as its traditional demographic focal point. It is also part of the greater 14-county San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area, whose population is over 9.6 million, making it the fifth-largest in the United States .

===Race, ethnicity, religion, and languages===

As of the census, the racial makeup and population of San Francisco included: 361,382 Whites (41.3%), 296,505 Asians (33.9%), 46,725 African Americans (5.3%), 86,233 Multiracial Americans (9.9%), 6,475 Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.7%), 3,476 Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (0.4%) and 73,169 persons of other races (8.4%). There were 136,761 Hispanic or Latino residents of any race (15.6%).

San Francisco is a majority minority city, as non-Hispanic White residents comprise less than half of the population; in 1940 they formed 92.5% of the population.

In 2010, residents of Chinese ethnicity constituted the largest single ethnic minority group in San Francisco at 21% of the population; other large Asian groups include Filipinos (5%) and Vietnamese (2%), with Japanese, Koreans and many other Asian and Pacific Islander groups represented in the city. The population of Chinese ancestry is most heavily concentrated in Chinatown and the Sunset and Richmond Districts. Filipinos are most concentrated in SoMa and the Crocker-Amazon; the latter neighborhood shares a border with Daly City, which has one of the highest concentrations of Filipinos in North America. The Tenderloin District is home to a large portion of the city&#x27;s Vietnamese population as well as businesses and restaurants, which is known as the city&#x27;s Little Saigon.

The principal Hispanic groups in the city were those of Mexican (7%) and Salvadoran (2%) ancestry. The Hispanic population is most heavily concentrated in the Mission District, Tenderloin District, and Excelsior District. The city&#x27;s percentage of Hispanic residents is less than half of that of the state.

African Americans constituted about 5% of San Francisco&#x27;s population in 2020; their share of the city&#x27;s population has been decreasing since the 1970s. The majority of the city&#x27;s Black residents live in the neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, and the Fillmore District. There are smaller Black communities in Diamond Heights, Glen Park, and Mission District.

Unlike many other Western cities, San Francisco has a significant Irish American population. Drawn by the California Gold Rush, the Irish were one of the first major White immigrant groups to arrive in California, settling in the city of San Francisco. The Irish historically settled in Irish Hill, which was razed following World War II. Despite this, San Francisco is still one of only three counties in the entire Western United States whose White population is plurality (20.6%) Irish.

The city has long been home to a significant Jewish community; in 2018 Jewish Americans made up an estimated 10% (80,000) of the city&#x27;s population. It the third-largest Jewish community in proportional terms in the United States, behind only those of New York City, and Los Angeles, respectively, and it is also relatively young compared to other major U.S. cities. The Jewish community resides throughout the city, but the Richmond District is home to an ethnic enclave of mostly Russian Jews. The Fillmore District was formerly a mostly Jewish neighborhood from the 1920s until the 1970s, when many of its Jewish residents moved to other neighborhoods of the city as well as the suburbs of nearby Marin County.
According to a 2018 study by the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, Jews make up 10% (80,000) of the city&#x27;s population, making Judaism the second-largest religion in San Francisco after Christianity. A prior 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the largest religious groupings in San Francisco&#x27;s metropolitan area are Christians (48%), followed by those of no religion (35%), Hindus (5%), Jews (3%), Buddhists (2%), Muslims (1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings. According to the same study by the Pew Research Center, about 20% of residents in the area are Protestant, and 25% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. Meanwhile, 10% of the residents in metropolitan San Francisco identify as agnostics, while 5% identify as atheists.

, 55% (411,728) of San Francisco residents spoke only English at home, while 19% (140,302) spoke a variety of Chinese (mostly Taishanese and Cantonese), 12% (88,147) Spanish, 3% (25,767) Tagalog, and 2% (14,017) Russian. In total, 45% (342,693) of San Francisco&#x27;s population spoke a language at home other than English.

==== Ethnic clustering ====
San Francisco has several prominent Chinese, Mexican, and Filipino neighborhoods including Chinatown and the Mission District. Research collected on the immigrant clusters in the city show that more than half of the Asian population in San Francisco is either Chinese-born (40.3%) or Philippine-born (13.1%), and of the Mexican population 21% were Mexican-born, meaning these are people who recently immigrated to the United States. Between the years of 1990 and 2000, the number of foreign-born residents increased from 33% to nearly 40%. During this same time period, the San Francisco metropolitan area received 850,000 immigrants, ranking third in the United States after Los Angeles and New York.

===Education, households, and income===

Of all major cities in the United States, San Francisco has the second-highest percentage of residents with a college degree, second only to Seattle. Over 44% of adults have a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree. San Francisco had the highest rate at 7,031 per square mile, or over 344,000 total graduates in the city&#x27;s .

San Francisco has the highest estimated percentage of gay and lesbian individuals of any of the 50 largest U.S. cities, at 15%. San Francisco also has the highest percentage of same-sex households of any American county, with the Bay Area having a higher concentration than any other metropolitan area.

San Francisco ranks third of American cities in median household income with a 2007 value of $65,519. Median family income is $81,136. An emigration of middle-class families has left the city with a lower proportion of children than any other large American city, with the dog population cited as exceeding the child population of 115,000, in 2018. The city&#x27;s poverty rate is 12%, lower than the national average.
Homelessness has been a chronic problem for San Francisco since the early 1970s.
The city is believed to have the highest number of homeless inhabitants per capita of any major U.S. city.

There are 345,811 households in the city, out of which: 133,366 households (39%) were individuals, 109,437 (32%) were opposite-sex married couples, 63,577 (18%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 21,677 (6%) were unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 10,384 (3%) were same-sex married couples or partnerships.

San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, and city officials strengthened the stance in 2013 with its &#x27;Due Process for All&#x27; ordinance. The law declared local authorities could not hold immigrants for immigration offenses if they had no violent felonies on their records and did not currently face charges. The city issues a Resident ID Card regardless of the applicant&#x27;s immigration status.

=== Homelessness ===
Homelessness in San Francisco emerged as a major issue in the late 20th century and remains a growing problem in modern times.

8,035 homeless people were counted in San Francisco&#x27;s 2019 point-in-time street and shelter count. This was an increase of more than 17% over the 2017 count of 6,858 people. 5,180 of the people were living unsheltered on the streets and in parks. 26% of respondents in the 2019 count identified job loss as the primary cause of their homelessness, 18% cited alcohol or drug use, and 13% cited being evicted from their residence. 
The city of San Francisco has been dramatically increasing its spending to service the growing population homelessness crisis: spending jumped by $241 million in 2016–17 to total $275 million, compared to a budget of just $34 million the previous year. In 2017–18 the budget for combatting homelessness stood at $305 million. In the 2019–2020 budget year, the city budgeted $368 million for homelessness services. In the proposed 2020–2021 budget the city budgeted $850 million for homelessness services.

In January 2018 a United Nations special rapporteur on homelessness, Leilani Farha, stated that she was &quot;completely shocked&quot; by San Francisco&#x27;s homelessness crisis during a visit to the city. She compared the &quot;deplorable conditions&quot; of the homeless camps she witnessed on San Francisco&#x27;s streets to those she had seen in Mumbai. In May 2020, San Francisco officially sanctioned homeless encampments.

According to San Francisco&#x27;s Point-in-Time (PIT) count, the homeless population in 2024 was approximately 8,323 individuals. Additionally, over 20,000 people in the city were seeking homeless services.

===Crime===


San Francisco&#x27;s violent crime rate is low compared to other major cities, though many residents are still concerned about it.

In 2011, 50 murders were reported, which is 6.1 per 100,000 people. There were about 134 rapes, 3,142 robberies, and about 2,139 assaults. There were about 4,469 burglaries, 25,100 thefts, and 4,210 motor vehicle thefts. The Tenderloin area has the highest crime rate in San Francisco: 70% of the city&#x27;s violent crimes, and around one-fourth of the city&#x27;s murders, occur in this neighborhood. The Tenderloin also sees high rates of drug abuse, gang violence, and prostitution. Another area with high crime rates is the Bayview-Hunters Point area. In the first six months of 2015 there were 25 murders compared to 14 in the first six months of 2014. However, the murder rate is still much lower than in past decades. That rate, though, did rise again by the close of 2016. According to the San Francisco Police Department, there were 59 murders in the city in 2016, an annual total that marked a 13.5% increase in the number of homicides (52) from 2015. The city has also gained a reputation for car break-ins, with over 19,000 car break-ins occurring in 2021.

During the first half of 2018, human feces on San Francisco sidewalks were the second-most-frequent complaint of city residents, with about 65 calls per day. The city has formed a &quot;poop patrol&quot; to attempt to combat the problem.
In January 2022, CBS News reported that a single suspect was &quot;responsible for more than half of all reported hate crimes against the API community in San Francisco last year&quot;, and that he &quot;was allowed to be out of custody despite the number of charges against him&quot;.

Several street gangs have operated in the city over the decades, including MS-13, the Sureños and Norteños in the Mission District.

African-American street gangs familiar in other cities, including the Bloods, Crips and their sets, have struggled to establish footholds in San Francisco, while police and prosecutors have been accused of liberally labeling young African-American males as gang members.
Criminal gangs with shot callers in China, including Triad groups such as the Wo Hop To, were active in San Francisco in the 20th century. According to statistics released by SFPD in April 2024, the crime figures were down in the first 100 days of the year, namely in terms of robberies, burglaries and larceny. In the first half of 2024, San Francisco experienced a 32% decrease in overall crime compared to the previous year. Personal property theft saw a 41% reduction, and violent crimes, including gun-related incidents, decreased by 30%.

==Economy==

The city has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of professional services, including tourism, financial services, and high technology. In 2016, approximately 27% of workers were employed in professional business services; 14% in leisure and hospitality; 13% in government services; 12% in education and health care; 11% in trade, transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In 2023, GDP in the five-county San Francisco metropolitan area grew 3.4% in real terms to $779 billion. Additionally, in 2023 the 14-county San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland combined statistical area had a GDP of $1.397 trillion, ranking 3rd among CSAs, and ahead of all but 15 countries. , San Francisco County ranked 11th by income per capita among U.S. counties, with a per capita personal income of $164,807. Marin County, directly to the north over the Golden Gate Bridge, and San Mateo County, directly to the south on the Peninsula, were the 7th and 9th highest-income counties respectively.

The legacy of the California gold rush turned San Francisco into the principal banking and finance center of the West Coast in the early twentieth century. Montgomery Street in the Financial District became known as the &quot;Wall Street of the West&quot;, home to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the site of the now-defunct Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Bank of America, a pioneer in making banking services accessible to the middle class, was founded in San Francisco and in the 1960s, built the landmark modern skyscraper at 555 California Street for its corporate headquarters, since relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. Many large financial institutions, multinational banks, and venture capital firms are based in or have regional headquarters in the city. With over 30 international financial institutions, six Fortune 500 companies, and a large supporting infrastructure of professional services—including law, public relations, architecture and design—San Francisco is designated as an Alpha(-) World City. The 2024 Global Financial Centres Index ranked San Francisco as the fifth-most competitive financial center in the world.

Beginning in the 1990s, San Francisco&#x27;s economy diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech, biotechnology, and medical research. Technology jobs accounted for just 1 percent of San Francisco&#x27;s economy in 1990, growing to 4 percent in 2010 and an estimated 8 percent by the end of 2013. San Francisco became a center of Internet start-up companies during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the subsequent social media boom of the late 2000s (decade). Since 2010, San Francisco proper has attracted an increasing share of venture capital investments as compared to nearby Silicon Valley, attracting 423 financings worth US$4.58 billion in 2013. In 2004, the city approved a payroll tax exemption for biotechnology companies to foster growth in the Mission Bay neighborhood, site of a second campus and hospital of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Mission Bay hosts the UCSF Medical Center, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, and Gladstone Institutes, as well as more than 40 private-sector life sciences companies.

According to academic Rob Wilson, San Francisco is a global city, a status that pre-dated the city&#x27;s popularity during the California gold rush. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to high office vacancy rates and the accelerating evacuation of many retail and tech businesses out of the downtown core of San Francisco. Attributed causes include a shift to remote work in the technology and professional services sectors, as well as high levels of homelessness, drug use, and crime in areas around downtown San Francisco, such as the Tenderloin and Mid-Market neighborhoods.

The top employer in San Francisco is the city government itself, employing 5.6% (35,000+ people) of the city&#x27;s workforce, followed by UCSF with over 29,000 employees. The largest private-sector employer is Salesforce, with 11,953 employees, . Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees and self-employed firms made up 85% of city establishments in 2006, and the number of San Franciscans employed by firms of more than 1,000 employees has fallen by half since 1977. The growth of national big box and formula retail chains into the city has been made intentionally difficult by political and civic consensus. In an effort to buoy small privately owned businesses in San Francisco and preserve the unique retail personality of the city, the Small Business Commission started a publicity campaign in 2004 to keep a larger share of retail dollars in the local economy, and the Board of Supervisors has used the planning code to limit the neighborhoods where formula retail establishments can set up shop, an effort affirmed by San Francisco voters. However, by 2016, San Francisco was rated low by small businesses in a Business Friendliness Survey.

Like many U.S. cities, San Francisco once had a significant manufacturing sector employing nearly 60,000 workers in 1969, but nearly all production left for cheaper locations by the 1980s. , San Francisco has seen a small resurgence in manufacturing, with more than 4,000 manufacturing jobs across 500 companies, doubling since 2011. The city&#x27;s largest manufacturing employer is Anchor Brewing Company, and the largest by revenue is Timbuk2.

As of the first quarter of , the median value of homes in San Francisco County was $1,297,030. It ranked third in the U.S. for counties with highest median home value, behind Nantucket, Massachusetts and San Mateo County, California.

===Technology===

San Francisco became a hub for technological driven economic growth during the internet boom of the 1990s, and still holds an important position in the world city network today. Intense redevelopment towards the &quot;new economy&quot; makes business more technologically minded. Between the years of 1999 and 2000, the job growth rate was 4.9%, creating over 50,000 jobs in technology firms and internet content production. However, the technology industry has become geographically dispersed.

In the second technological boom driven by social media in the mid-2000s, San Francisco became a location for companies such as Apple, Google, Ubisoft, Facebook, and Twitter (now known as X) to base their tech offices and for their employees to live.

In recent years, several AI companies have either been founded in the city or moved there, due to a giant talent pool, proximity to venture capital, and serendipitous connections.

===Tourism and conventions===
Tourism is one of San Francisco&#x27;s most important private-sector industries, accounting for more than one out of seven jobs in the city. The city&#x27;s frequent portrayal in music, film, and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks recognizable worldwide. In 2016, it attracted the fifth-highest number of foreign tourists of any city in the United States. More than 25 million visitors arrived in San Francisco in 2016, adding US$9.96 billion to the economy.
With a large hotel infrastructure and a major convention facility in the Moscone Center, San Francisco is a popular destination for annual conventions and conferences.

Some of the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco, as noted by the Travel Channel, include the Golden Gate Bridge and Alamo Square Park, home to the famous &quot;Painted Ladies&quot;. Both of these locations were often used as landscape shots for the hit American television sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;. There is also Lombard Street, known for its &quot;crookedness&quot; and extensive views. Tourists also visit Pier 39, which offers dining, shopping, entertainment, and views of the bay, sunbathing California sea lions, the Aquarium of the Bay, and the famous Alcatraz Island.
San Francisco also offers tourists varied nightlife in its neighborhoods.

The new Terminal Project at Pier 27 opened September 25, 2014, as a replacement for the old Pier 35. Itineraries from San Francisco usually include round-trip cruises to Alaska and Mexico.

A heightened interest in conventioneering in San Francisco, marked by the establishment of convention centers such as Yerba Buena, acted as a feeder into the local tourist economy and resulted in an increase in the hotel industry: &quot;In 1959, the city had fewer than thirty-three hundred first-class hotel rooms; by 1970, the number was nine thousand; and by 1999, there were more than thirty thousand.&quot; The commodification of the Castro District has contributed to San Francisco&#x27;s tourist economy.

==Arts and culture==
 
Although the Financial District, Union Square, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf are well known around the world, San Francisco is also characterized by its numerous culturally rich streetscapes featuring mixed-use neighborhoods anchored around central commercial corridors to which residents and visitors alike can walk. Because of these characteristics, San Francisco is ranked the &quot;most walkable&quot; city in the United States by Walk Score. Many neighborhoods feature a mix of businesses, restaurants and venues that cater to the daily needs of local residents while also serving many visitors and tourists. Some neighborhoods are dotted with boutiques, cafés and nightlife such as Union Street in Cow Hollow, 24th Street in Noe Valley, Valencia Street in the Mission, Grant Avenue in North Beach, and Irving Street in the Inner Sunset. This approach especially has influenced the continuing South of Market neighborhood redevelopment with businesses and neighborhood services rising alongside high-rise residences.
Since the 1990s, the demand for skilled information technology workers from local startups and nearby Silicon Valley has attracted white-collar workers from all over the world and created a high standard of living in San Francisco. Many neighborhoods that were once blue-collar, middle, and lower class have been gentrifying, as many of the city&#x27;s traditional business and industrial districts have experienced a renaissance driven by the redevelopment of the Embarcadero, including the neighborhoods South Beach and Mission Bay. The city&#x27;s property values and household income have risen to among the highest in the nation, creating a large and upscale restaurant, retail, and entertainment scene. According to a 2014 quality of life survey of global cities, San Francisco has the highest quality of living of any U.S. city. However, due to the exceptionally high cost of living, many of the city&#x27;s middle and lower-class families have been leaving the city for the outer suburbs of the Bay Area, or for California&#x27;s Central Valley. By June 2, 2015, the median rent was reported to be as high as $4,225. The high cost of living is due in part to restrictive planning laws which limit new residential construction.

The international character that San Francisco has enjoyed since its founding is continued today by large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Latin America. With 39% of its residents born overseas, San Francisco has numerous neighborhoods filled with businesses and civic institutions catering to new arrivals. In particular, the arrival of many ethnic Chinese, which began to accelerate in the 1970s, has complemented the long-established community historically based in Chinatown throughout the city and has transformed the annual Chinese New Year Parade into the largest event of its kind on the West Coast.

With the arrival of the &quot;beat&quot; writers and artists of the 1950s and societal changes culminating in the Summer of Love in the Haight-Ashbury district during the 1960s, San Francisco became a center of liberal activism and of the counterculture that arose at that time. The Democrats and to a lesser extent the Green Party have dominated city politics since the late 1970s, after the last serious Republican challenger for city office lost the 1975 mayoral election by a narrow margin. San Francisco has not voted more than 20% for a Republican presidential or senatorial candidate since 1988. In 2007, the city expanded its Medicaid and other indigent medical programs into the Healthy San Francisco program, which subsidizes certain medical services for eligible residents.

Since 1993, the San Francisco Department of Public Health has distributed 400,000 free syringes every month aimed at reducing HIV and other health risks for drug users, as well as providing disposal sites and services.

San Francisco also has had a very active environmental community. Starting with the founding of the Sierra Club in 1892 to the establishment of the non-profit Friends of the Urban Forest in 1981, San Francisco has been at the forefront of many global discussions regarding the environment. The 1980 San Francisco Recycling Program was one of the earliest curbside recycling programs. The city&#x27;s GoSolarSF incentive promotes solar installations and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is rolling out the CleanPowerSF program to sell electricity from local renewable sources. SF Greasecycle is a program to recycle used cooking oil for conversion to biodiesel.

The Sunset Reservoir Solar Project, completed in 2010, installed 24,000 solar panels on the roof of the reservoir. The 5-megawatt plant more than tripled the city&#x27;s 2-megawatt solar generation capacity when it opened in December 2010.

===LGBT===
San Francisco has long had an LGBT-friendly history. It was home to the first lesbian-rights organization in the United States, Daughters of Bilitis; the first openly gay person to run for public office in the United States, José Sarria; the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, Harvey Milk; the first openly lesbian judge appointed in the U.S., Mary C. Morgan; and the first transgender police commissioner, Theresa Sparks. The city&#x27;s large gay population has created and sustained a politically and culturally active community over many decades, developing a powerful presence in San Francisco&#x27;s civic life. Survey data released in 2015 by Gallup places the proportion of LGBT adults in the San Francisco metro area at 6.2%, which is the highest proportion of the 50 most populous metropolitan areas as measured by the polling organization.
One of the most popular destinations for gay tourists internationally, the city hosts San Francisco Pride, one of the largest and oldest pride parades. San Francisco Pride events have been held continuously since 1972. The events are themed and a new theme is created each year. In 2013, over 1.5 million people attended, around 500,000 more than the previous year. Pink Saturday is an annual street party held the Saturday before the pride parade, which coincides with the Dyke march.

The Folsom Street Fair (FSF) is an annual BDSM and leather subculture street fair that is held in September, endcapping San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Leather Pride Week&quot;. It started in 1984 and is California&#x27;s third-largest single-day, outdoor spectator event and the world&#x27;s largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture.

===Performing arts===

San Francisco&#x27;s War Memorial and Performing Arts Center hosts some of the most enduring performing arts companies in the country. The War Memorial Opera House houses the San Francisco Opera, the second-largest opera company in North America as well as the San Francisco Ballet, while the San Francisco Symphony plays in Davies Symphony Hall. Opened in 2013, the SFJAZZ Center hosts jazz performances year round.

The Fillmore is a music venue located in the Western Addition. It is the second incarnation of the historic venue that gained fame in the 1960s, housing the stage where now-famous musicians such as the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, and Jefferson Airplane first performed, fostering the San Francisco Sound. It closed its doors in 1971 with a final performance by Santana and reopened in 1994 with a show by the Smashing Pumpkins.

San Francisco has a large number of theaters and live performance venues. Local theater companies have been noted for risk taking and innovation. The Tony Award-winning non-profit American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.) is a member of the national League of Resident Theatres. Other local winners of the Regional Theatre Tony Award include the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
San Francisco theaters frequently host pre-Broadway engagements and tryout runs, and some original San Francisco productions have later moved to Broadway.

===Museums===
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) houses 20th century and contemporary works of art. It moved to its current building in the South of Market neighborhood in 1995 and attracted more than 600,000 visitors annually. SFMOMA closed for renovation and expansion in 2013. The museum reopened on May 14, 2016, with an addition, designed by Snøhetta, that has doubled the museum&#x27;s size.

The Palace of the Legion of Honor holds primarily European antiquities and works of art at its Lincoln Park building modeled after its Parisian namesake. The de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park features American decorative pieces and anthropological holdings from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, while Asian art is housed in the Asian Art Museum. Opposite the de Young stands the California Academy of Sciences, a natural history museum that also hosts the Morrison Planetarium and Steinhart Aquarium. Located on Pier 15 on the Embarcadero, the Exploratorium is an interactive science museum. The Contemporary Jewish Museum is a non-collecting institution that hosts a broad array of temporary exhibitions. On Nob Hill, the Cable Car Museum is a working museum featuring the cable car powerhouse, which drives the cables. Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts was founded in 1998 and is part of the California College of the Arts.

==Sports==
Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Francisco Giants have played in San Francisco since moving from New York in 1958. The Giants play at Oracle Park, which opened in 2000. The Giants won World Series titles in 2010, 2012, and in 2014. The Giants have boasted stars such as Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and Barry Bonds (MLB&#x27;s career home run leader). In 2012, San Francisco was ranked No. 1 in a study that examined which U.S. metro areas have produced the most Major Leaguers since 1920.

==Parks and recreation==
Several of San Francisco&#x27;s parks and nearly all of its beaches form part of the regional Golden Gate National Recreation Area, one of the most visited units of the National Park system in the United States with over 13 million visitors a year. Among the GGNRA&#x27;s attractions within the city are Ocean Beach, which runs along the Pacific Ocean shoreline and is frequented by a vibrant surfing community, and Baker Beach, which is located in a cove west of the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as the California Academy of Sciences, a research institute and natural history museum.

The Presidio of San Francisco is the former 18th century Spanish military base, which today is one of the city&#x27;s largest parks and home to numerous museums and institutions. Also within the Presidio is Crissy Field, a former airfield that was restored to its natural salt marsh ecosystem. The GGNRA also administers Fort Funston, Lands End, Fort Mason, and Alcatraz. The National Park Service separately administers the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park – a fleet of historic ships and waterfront property around Aquatic Park.

There are more than 220 parks maintained by the San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks Department. The largest and best-known city park is Golden Gate Park, which stretches from the center of the city west to the Pacific Ocean. Once covered in native grasses and sand dunes, the park was conceived in the 1860s and was created by the extensive planting of thousands of non-native trees and plants. The large park is rich with cultural and natural attractions such as the Conservatory of Flowers, Japanese Tea Garden and San Francisco Botanical Garden.

Red Rock Island is the only privately owned island in San Francisco Bay, but is uninhabited. Yerba Buena Island is largely utilized by the military.

San Francisco is the first city in the U.S. to have a park within a 10-Minute Walk of every resident. It also ranks fifth in the U.S. for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States, according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.

==Government==

The mayor is also the county executive, and the county Board of Supervisors acts as the city council. The government of San Francisco is a charter city and is constituted of two co-equal branches: the executive branch is headed by the mayor and includes other citywide elected and appointed officials as well as the civil service; the 11-member Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch, is headed by a president and is responsible for passing laws and budgets, though San Franciscans also make use of direct ballot initiatives to pass legislation.

Because of its unique city-county status, the local government is able to exercise jurisdiction over certain property outside city limits. San Francisco International Airport, though located in San Mateo County, is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco. San Francisco&#x27;s largest jail complex (County Jail No. 5) is located in San Mateo County, in an unincorporated area adjacent to San Bruno. San Francisco was also granted a perpetual leasehold over the Hetch Hetchy Valley and watershed in Yosemite National Park by the Raker Act in 1913.

The members of the Board of Supervisors are elected as representatives of specific districts within the city. Upon the death or resignation of the mayor, the President of the Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board elects an interim replacement for the remainder of the term. In 1978, Dianne Feinstein assumed the office following the assassination of George Moscone and was later selected by the board to finish the term. In 2011, Ed Lee was selected by the board to finish the term of Gavin Newsom, who resigned to take office as Lieutenant Governor of California. Lee (who won two elections to remain mayor) was temporarily replaced by San Francisco Board of Supervisors President London Breed after he died on December 12, 2017. Supervisor Mark Farrell was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to finish Lee&#x27;s term on January 23, 2018.

Most local offices in San Francisco are elected using ranked choice voting.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Public transportation====

Transit is the most used form of transportation every day in San Francisco. Every weekday, more than 560,000 people travel on Muni&#x27;s 69 bus routes and more than 140,000 customers ride the Muni Metro light rail system. 32% of San Francisco residents use public transportation for their daily commute to work, ranking it fourth in the United States and first on the West Coast. The San Francisco Municipal Railway, primarily known as Muni, is the primary public transit system of San Francisco. As of 2023, Muni is the eighth-largest transit system in the United States. The system operates a combined light rail and subway system, the Muni Metro, as well as large bus and trolley coach networks. Additionally, it runs a historic streetcar line, which runs on Market Street from Castro Street to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. It also operates the famous cable cars, which have been designated as a National Historic Landmark and are a major tourist attraction.

Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a regional Rapid Transit system, connects San Francisco with the East Bay and San Jose through the underwater Transbay Tube. The line, which contains all except the Orange Line, runs under Market Street to Civic Center where it turns south to the Mission District, the southern part of the city, and through northern San Mateo County, to the San Francisco International Airport, and Millbrae. BART also shares stations with SFMTA Muni Metro under Market Street.
Another commuter rail system, Caltrain, runs from San Francisco along the San Francisco Peninsula to San Jose. Historically, trains operated by Southern Pacific Lines ran from San Francisco to Los Angeles, via Palo Alto and San Jose.

Amtrak Thruway runs a shuttle bus from three locations in San Francisco to its station across the bay in Emeryville. Additionally, BART offers connections to San Francisco from Amtrak&#x27;s stations in Emeryville, Oakland and Richmond, and Caltrain offers connections in San Jose and Santa Clara.

====Freeways and roads====
In 2014, only 41.3% of residents commuted by driving alone or carpooling in private vehicles in San Francisco, a decline from 48.6% in 2000. There are 1,088 miles of streets in San Francisco with 946 miles of these streets being surface streets, and 59 miles of freeways. Due to its unique geography, and the freeway revolts of the late 1950s,
Interstate 80 begins at the approach to the Bay Bridge and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay. U.S. Route 101 connects to the western terminus of Interstate 80 and provides access to the south of the city along San Francisco Bay toward Silicon Valley. Northward, the routing for U.S. 101 uses arterial streets to connect to the Golden Gate Bridge, the only direct automobile link to Marin County and the North Bay.

As part of the retrofitting of the Golden Gate Bridge and installation of a suicide barrier, starting in 2019 the railings on the west side of the pedestrian walkway were replaced with thinner, more flexible slats in order to improve the bridge&#x27;s aerodynamic tolerance of high wind to . Starting in June 2020, reports were received of a loud hum produced by the new railing slats, heard across the city when a strong west wind was blowing.

State Route 1 also enters San Francisco from the north via the Golden Gate Bridge and bisects the city as the 19th Avenue arterial thoroughfare, joining with Interstate 280 at the city&#x27;s southern border. Interstate 280 continues south from San Francisco, and also turns to the east along the southern edge of the city, terminating just south of the Bay Bridge in the South of Market neighborhood.

<text>Alonzo Church (June 14, 1903 – August 11, 1995) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, logician, and philosopher who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the lambda calculus, the Church–Turing thesis, proving the unsolvability of the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (&quot;decision problem&quot;), the Frege–Church ontology, and the Church–Rosser theorem. Alongside his doctoral student Alan Turing, Church is considered one of the founders of computer science.

==Life==
Alonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in Washington, D.C., where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was a justice of the peace and the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. He was the grandson of Alonzo Webster Church (1829–1909), United States Senate Librarian from 1881 to 1901, and great-grandson of Alonzo Church, a professor of Mathematics and Astronomy and 6th President of the University of Georgia. As a young boy, Church was partially blinded by an air gun accident. The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost his position at the university because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, the son attended the private Ridgefield School for Boys in Ridgefield, Connecticut. After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended Princeton University, where he was an exceptional student. He published his first paper on Lorentz transformations in 1924 and graduated the same year with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton for graduate work, earning a Ph.D. in mathematics in three years under Oswald Veblen.

He married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925. The couple had three children: Alonzo Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933), and Mildred (1938).

After receiving his Ph.D., he taught briefly as an instructor at the University of Chicago. He received a two-year National Research Fellowship that enabled him to attend Harvard University in 1927–1928, and the University of Göttingen and University of Amsterdam the following year.

He taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton for nearly four decades, from 1929 to 1967. He held the Flint Professorship of Philosophy and Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles, 1967–1990. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1962 in Stockholm.

He received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Case Western Reserve University in 1969, Princeton University in 1985, and the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York in 1990 in connection with an international symposium in his honor organized by John Corcoran.

He was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1966, to the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences in 1967, to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978.

Church was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian church. He died on August 11, 1995, at the age of 92. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery.

==Mathematical work==
Church is known for the following accomplishments:
* His proof that the Entscheidungsproblem, which asks for a decision procedure to determine the truth of arbitrary propositions in a first-order mathematical theory, is undecidable. This is known as Church&#x27;s theorem. 
* His invention of the lambda calculus.
* His use of the lambda calculus to prove that Peano arithmetic is undecidable.
* His articulation of what has come to be known as the Church–Turing thesis.
* Being a founding editor of the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;, editing its reviews section for 43 years from 1936 until 1979.
* His authorship of a prominent textbook in the field of mathematical logic, &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Logic&quot;.
* The Church–Rosser theorem

The lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem. This result preceded Alan Turing&#x27;s work on the halting problem, which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Upon hearing of Church&#x27;s work, Turing enrolled at Princeton later that year under Church for a Ph.D. Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine used in Turing&#x27;s halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative &quot;mechanical processes for computation.&quot; This resulted in the Church–Turing thesis.

The efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas.

The lambda calculus influenced the design of Lisp and functional programming languages in general. The Church encoding is named in his honor.

In his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation (ACM SIGLOG), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS), the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL), and the Kurt Gödel Society (KGS). The award is for an outstanding contribution to the field published within the past 25 years and must not yet have received recognition via another major award, such as the Turing Award, the Paris Kanellakis Award, or the Gödel Prize.

Church also made contributions to the theory of random sequences.

==Philosophical work==

 Church is also known for the Frege–Church ontology, which he created based on the philosophical ideas of Gottlob Frege. He is credited with formulating the Slingshot Argument, which suggests that sentential references must be truth-values, rather than propositions.

== Influence ==
Over the course of his academic career, Church oversaw 31 doctoral students. Many of them have led distinguished careers in mathematics, computer science, and other academic subjects, including Peter B. Andrews, George A. Barnard, David Berlinski, William W. Boone, Martin Davis, Alfred L. Foster, Leon Henkin, John G. Kemeny, Stephen C. Kleene, Simon B. Kochen, Maurice L&#x27;Abbé, Gary R. Mar, Michael O. Rabin, Nicholas Rescher, Hartley Rogers, Jr., J. Barkley Rosser, Dana Scott, Raymond Smullyan and Alan Turing.

In addition to those he directly supervised, Church also had a large influence on other mathematicians and computer scientists. Haskell Curry, who expanded on Church&#x27;s ideas with the concept of currying, stated that one of his textbooks, Introduction to Mathematical Logic (first published in 1944), was &quot;written with the meticulous precision which characterizes the author&#x27;s work generally.&quot;

<text>The Australia Group is a multilateral export control regime (MECR) and an informal group of countries (now joined by the European Commission) established in 1985 (after the use of chemical weapons by Iraq in 1984) to help member countries to identify those exports which need to be controlled so as not to contribute to the spread of chemical and biological weapons.

The group, initially consisting of 15 members, held its first meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in June 1985. With the incorporation of India on 19 January 2018, it now has 43 members, including Australia, New Zealand, the European Commission, all 27 member states of the European Union, United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, India, Ukraine, and Argentina. The name comes from Australia&#x27;s initiative to create the group. Australia manages the secretariat.

The initial members of the group had different assessments of which chemical precursors should be subject to export control. Later adherents initially had no such controls. Today, members of the group maintain export controls on a uniform list of 90 compounds, including several that are not prohibited for export under the Chemical Weapons Convention, but can be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Additionally, the Australia Group expanded its standardization of licensing and export controls to cover technology related to the manufacturing of chemical weapons or controlled components.

In 2002, the group took two important steps to strengthen export control. The first was the &quot;no-undercut&quot; requirement, which stated that any member of the group considering making an export to another state that had already been denied an export by any other member of the group must first consult with that member state before approving the export. The second was the &quot;catch-all&quot; provision, which requires member states to halt all exports that could be used by importers in chemical or biological weapons programs, regardless of whether the export is on the group&#x27;s control lists. Delegations representing the members meet every year in Paris, France.

<doc id="49733" wikidata="Q41425" url="?curid=49733" title="Ballet">
<text>Ballet () is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures. Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.

A &quot;ballet&quot; as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery.

==Etymology==
Ballet is a French word which had its origin in Italian &quot;balletto&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;ballo&quot; (dance) which comes from Latin &quot;ballo&quot;, &quot;ballare&quot;, meaning &quot;to dance&quot;, which in turn comes from the Greek &quot;βαλλίζω&quot; (&quot;ballizo&quot;), &quot;to dance, to jump about&quot;. The word came into English usage from the French around 1630.

In French, the word refers to a ballet performance, a ballet work, and possibly to the dance genre itself, although the expression &quot;danse classique&quot; also exists for the latter meaning, is less equivocal and is more commonly used when referring to the learning of this dance.

==History==

Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Under Catherine de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s influence as Queen, it spread to France, where it developed even further. The dancers in these early court ballets were mostly noble amateurs. Ornamented costumes were meant to impress viewers, but they restricted performers&#x27; freedom of movement.

The ballets were performed in large chambers with viewers on three sides. The implementation of the proscenium arch from 1618 on distanced performers from audience members, who could then better view and appreciate the technical feats of the professional dancers in the productions.

French court ballet reached its height under the reign of King Louis XIV. Louis founded the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy) in 1661 to establish standards and certify dance instructors. In 1672, Louis XIV made Jean-Baptiste Lully the director of the Académie Royale de Musique (Paris Opera) from which the first professional ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, arose. Pierre Beauchamp served as Lully&#x27;s ballet-master. Together their partnership would drastically influence the development of ballet, as evidenced by the credit given to them for the creation of the five major positions of the feet. By 1681, the first &quot;ballerinas&quot; took the stage following years of training at the Académie.

Ballet started to decline in France after 1830, but it continued to develop in Denmark, Italy, and Russia. The arrival in Europe of the Ballets Russes led by Sergei Diaghilev on the eve of the First World War revived interest in the ballet and started the modern era.

In the twentieth century, ballet had a wide influence on other dance genres, Also in the twentieth century, ballet took a turn dividing it from classical ballet to the introduction of modern dance, leading to modernist movements in several countries.

Famous dancers of the twentieth century include 
Mikhail Baryshnikov,
Erik Bruhn,
Maria Tall Chief,
Jeanne Devereaux,
Suzanne Farrell,
Margot Fonteyn,
Rosella Hightower,
Gelsey Kirkland,
Natalia Makarova,
Arthur Mitchell,
Rudolf Nureyev,
Anna Pavlova,
Maya Plisetskaya,
and 
Galina Ulanova.

==Styles==

Stylistic variations and subgenres have evolved over time. Early, classical variations are primarily associated with geographic origin. Examples of this are Russian ballet, French ballet, and Italian ballet. Later variations, such as contemporary ballet and neoclassical ballet, incorporate both classical ballet and non-traditional technique and movement. Perhaps the most widely known and performed ballet style is late Romantic ballet (or Ballet blanc).

=== Classical ballet ===
Classical ballet is based on traditional ballet technique and vocabulary. Different styles have emerged in different countries, such as French ballet, Italian ballet, English ballet, and Russian ballet. Several of the classical ballet styles are associated with specific training methods, typically named after their creators (see below). The Royal Academy of Dance method is a ballet technique and training system that was founded by a diverse group of ballet dancers. They merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organization and is recognized internationally as the English style of ballet. Some examples of classical ballet productions are: &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker.&quot;

===Romantic ballet===
Romantic ballet was an artistic movement of classical ballet and several productions remain in the classical repertoire today. The Romantic era was marked by the emergence of pointe work, the dominance of female dancers, and longer, flowy tutus that attempt to exemplify softness and a delicate aura. This movement occurred during the early to mid-nineteenth century (the Romantic era) and featured themes that emphasized intense emotion as a source of aesthetic experience. The plots of many romantic ballets revolved around spirit women (sylphs, wilis, and ghosts) who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men. The 1827 ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot; is widely considered to be the first, and the 1870 ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot; is considered to be the last. Famous ballet dancers of the Romantic era include Marie Taglioni, Fanny Elssler, and Jules Perrot. Jules Perrot is also known for his choreography, especially that of &quot;Giselle&quot;, often considered to be the most widely celebrated romantic ballet.

===Neoclassical ballet===
Neoclassical ballet is usually abstract, with no clear plot, costumes or scenery. Music choice can be diverse and will often include music that is also neoclassical (e.g. Stravinsky, Roussel). Tim Scholl, author of &quot;From Petipa to Balanchine&quot;, considers George Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Apollo&quot; in 1928 to be the first neoclassical ballet. &quot;Apollo&quot; represented a return to form in response to Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s abstract ballets. Balanchine worked with modern dance choreographer Martha Graham, and brought modern dancers into his company such as Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in Balanchine&#x27;s &quot;Episodes&quot;.

While Balanchine is widely considered the face of neoclassical ballet, there were others who made significant contributions. Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; (1946) is a seminal work for the choreographer. Set to César Franck&#x27;s score of the same title, it is a pure-dance interpretation of the score.

Another form, Modern Ballet, also emerged as an offshoot of neoclassicism. Among the innovators in this form were Glen Tetley, Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino. While difficult to parse modern ballet from neoclassicism, the work of these choreographers favored a greater athleticism that departed from the delicacy of ballet. The physicality was more daring, with mood, subject matter and music more intense. An example of this would be Joffrey&#x27;s &quot;Astarte&quot; (1967), which featured a rock score and sexual overtones in the choreography.

===Contemporary ballet===
This ballet style is often performed barefoot. Contemporary ballets may include mime and acting, and are usually set to music (typically orchestral but occasionally vocal). It can be difficult to differentiate this form from neoclassical or modern ballet. Contemporary ballet is also close to contemporary dance because many contemporary ballet concepts come from the ideas and innovations of twentieth-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs. The main distinction is that ballet technique is essential to perform a contemporary ballet.

George Balanchine is considered to have been a pioneer of contemporary ballet. Another early contemporary ballet choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot; for the American Ballet Theatre in 1976, and in 1986 created &quot;In The Upper Room&quot; for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their melding of distinctly modern movements with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.

Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers. These include Alonzo King and his company LINES Ballet; Matthew Bourne and his company New Adventures; Complexions Contemporary Ballet; Nacho Duato and his Compañia Nacional de Danza; William Forsythe and The Forsythe Company; and Jiří Kylián of the Nederlands Dans Theater. Traditionally &quot;classical&quot; companies, such as the Mariinsky (Kirov) Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet, also regularly perform contemporary works.

The term &quot;ballet&quot; has evolved to include all forms associated with it. Someone training as a ballet dancer will now be expected to perform neoclassical, modern and contemporary work. A ballet dancer is expected to be able to be stately and regal for classical work, free and lyrical in neoclassical work, and unassuming, harsh or pedestrian for modern and contemporary work. In addition, there are several modern varieties of dance that fuse classical ballet technique with contemporary dance, such as Hiplet, that require dancers to be practised in non-Western dance styles.

== Technical methods of ballet instruction ==

There are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the French School, the Vaganova Method, the Cecchetti Method, the Bournonville method, the Royal Academy of Dance method (English style), and the Balanchine method (American style). Many more schools of technique exist in various countries.

Although preschool-age children are a lucrative source of income for a ballet studio, ballet instruction is generally not appropriate for young children. Initial instruction requires standing still and concentrating on posture, rather than dancing. Because of this, many ballet programs have historically not accepted students until approximately age 8. Creative movement and non-demanding pre-ballet classes are recommended as alternatives for children.

=== French method ===

The French method is the basis of all ballet training. When Louis XIV created the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661, he helped to create the codified technique still used today by those in the profession, regardless of what method of training they adhere to. The French school was particularly revitalized under Rudolf Nureyev, in the 1980s. His influence revitalized and renewed appreciation for this style, and has drastically shaped ballet as a whole. In fact, the French school is now sometimes referred to as Nureyev school. The French method is often characterized by technical precision, fluidity and gracefulness, and elegant, clean lines. For this style, fast footwork is often utilized in order to give the impression that the performers are drifting lightly across the stage. Two important trademarks of this technique are the specific way in which the port de bras and the épaulement are performed, more rounded than when dancing in a Russian style, but not as rounded as the Danish style.

=== Vaganova method ===

The Vaganova method is a style of ballet training that emerged from Russian ballet, created by Agrippina Vaganova. After retiring from dance in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1921. Her training method is now internationally recognized and her book, &quot;The Fundamentals of Classical Dance&quot; (1934), is a classic reference. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era, with the athleticism of the Italian method, and the soulful passion of Russian ballet. She developed an extremely precise method of instruction in her book &quot;Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance&quot; (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student&#x27;s career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.

The method emphasizes development of strength, flexibility, and endurance for the proper performance of ballet. She espoused the belief that equal importance should be placed on the arms and legs while performing ballet, as this will bring harmony and greater expression to the body as a whole.

=== Cecchetti method ===

Developed by Enrico Cecchetti (1850–1928), this method is one known internationally for its intense reliance of the understanding of anatomy as it relates to classical ballet. The goal of this method is to instill important characteristics for the performance of ballet into students so that they do not need to rely on imitations of teachers. Important components for this method is the emphasis of balance, elevations, ballon, poise, and strength.

This method espouses the importance of recognizing that all parts of the body move together to create beautiful, graceful lines, and as such cautions against thinking of ballet in terms of the arms, legs, and neck and torso as separate parts. This method is well known for eight port de bras that are utilized.

=== Bournonville method ===

The Bournonville method is a Danish method first devised by August Bournonville. Bournonville was heavily influenced by the early French ballet method due to his training with his father, Antoine Bournonville and other important French ballet masters. This method has many style differences that differentiate it from other ballet methods taught today. A key component is the use of diagonal épaulements, with the upper body turning towards the working foot typically. This method also incorporates very basic use of arms, pirouettes from a low développé position into seconde, and use of fifth position bras en bas for the beginning and end of movements.

The Bournonville method produces dancers who have beautiful &quot;ballon&quot; (&quot;the illusion of imponderable lightness&quot;).

=== The Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD) ===
The Royal Academy of Dance method, also referred to as the English style of ballet, was established in 1920 by Genee, Karsavina, Bedells, E Espinosa, and Richardson. The goal of this method is to promote academic training in classical ballet throughout Great Britain. This style also spread to the United States, and is widely utilized still today. There are specific grade levels which a student must move through in order to complete training in this method. The key principle behind this method of instruction is that basic ballet technique must be taught at a slow pace, with difficulty progression often much slower than the rest of the methods. The idea behind this is if a student is to put in a large amount of effort into perfecting the basic steps, the technique learned in these steps allow a student to utilize harder ones at a much easier rate.

=== Balanchine method ===

Developed by George Balanchine at the New York City Ballet. His method draws heavily on his own training as a dancer in Russia. The technique is known for extreme speed throughout routines, emphasis on lines, and deep pliés. Perhaps one of the most well known differences of this style is the unorthodox positioning of the body. Dancers of this style often have flexed hands and even feet, and are placed in off-balance positions. Important ballet studios teaching this method are the Miami City Ballet, Ballet Chicago Studio company, and the School of American Ballet in New York.

== Costumes ==
Ballet costumes play an important role in the ballet community. They are often the only survival of a production, representing a living imaginary picture of the scene.

=== Renaissance and Baroque ===
The roots of ballet go back to the Renaissance in France and Italy when court wear was the beginning of ballet costumes. Ballet costumes have been around since the early 15th century. Cotton and silk were mixed with flax, woven into semitransparent gauze to create exquisite ballet costumes.

=== 17th century ===
During the 17th century, different types of fabrics and designs were used to make costumes more spectacular and eye catching. Court dress still remained for women during this century. Silks, satins and fabrics embroidered with real gold and precious stones increased the level of spectacular decoration associated with ballet costumes. Women&#x27;s costumes also consisted of heavy garments and knee-long skirts which made it difficult for them to create much movement and gesture.

=== 18th century ===
During the 18th century, stage costumes were still very similar to court wear but progressed over time, mostly due to the French dancer and ballet-master Jean-Georges Noverre (1727–1810) whose proposals to modernize ballet are contained in his revolutionary &quot;Lettres sur la danse et les ballets&quot; (1760). Noverre&#x27;s book altered the emphasis in a production away from the costumes towards the physical movements and emotions of the dancers.

European ballet was centered in the Paris Opera. During this era, skirts were raised a few inches off the ground. Flowers, flounces, ribbons, and lace emphasized this opulent feminine style, as soft pastel tones in citron, peach, pink, and pistachio dominated the color range.

=== 19th century ===
During the early 19th century, close-fitting body costumes, floral crowns, corsages, and jewels were used. Ideals of Romanticism were reflected through female movements.

Costumes became much tighter as corsets started to come into use, to show off the curves on a ballerina. Jewels and bedazzled costumes became much more popular.

=== 20th century ===

During the 20th century, ballet costumes transitioned back to the influence of Russian ballet. Ballerina skirts became knee-length tutus, later on in order to show off their precise pointe work. Colors used on stage costumes also became much more vibrant. Designers used colors such as red, orange, yellow, etc. to create visual expression when ballet dancers perform on stage.

==Ballet as a career==
Professional dancers are generally not well paid, and earn less money than a typical worker. As of 2020, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$19 per hour, with pay somewhat better for teachers than for performers.

The job outlook is not strong, and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the number of job openings. Most jobs involve teaching in private dance schools.

Choreographers are paid better than dancers. Musicians and singers are paid better per hour than either dancers or choreographers, about US$30 per hour; however, full-time work is unusual for musicians.

== Health effects ==
Teenage girl ballet dancers are prone to stress fractures in the first rib. Posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS) most commonly affects people who perform repetitive plantar flexion, such as ballet dancers. Eating disorders are thought to be common, and a 2014 meta-analysis suggests that studies do indicate that ballet dancers are at higher risk than the general population for several kinds of eating disorders. In addition, some researchers have noted that intensive training in ballet results in lower bone mineral density in the arms.

==Criticism==
Most ballet choreography is written so that it can only be performed by a relatively young dancer. The structure of ballet – in which a (usually) male choreographer or director uses (mostly) women&#x27;s bodies to express his artistic vision, has been criticized as harming women.

<doc id="49744" wikidata="Q1780900" url="?curid=49744" title="Trade credit">
<text>Trade credit is the loan extended by one trader to another when the goods and services are bought on credit. Trade credit facilitates the purchase of supplies without immediate payment. Trade credit is commonly used by business organizations as a source of short-term financing. It is granted to those customers who have a reasonable amount of financial standing and goodwill. (Kuveya, 2020)

There are many forms of trade credit in common use. Various industries use various specialized forms. They all have, in common, the collaboration of businesses to make efficient use of capital to accomplish various business objectives.

Trade credit is the largest use of capital for a majority of business-to-business (B2B) sellers in the United States and is a critical source of capital for a majority of all businesses. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has used trade credit as a larger source of capital than bank borrowings; trade credit for Wal-Mart is 8 times the amount of capital invested by shareholders.

Most small businesses rely on trade credit to finance their operational costs, with 40% of U.S. businesses using trade credit for B2B transactions.

== Type of trade credit financing ==

=== Open account credit ===
Open trade credit is the most common type, typically involving an invoice and a promissory note as primary documentation.

=== Installment credit ===
Repayment for trade credit is often done through equal installments, similar to standard loans or credit, with specific terms agreed upon.

=== Revolving credit lines ===
Traditional revolving credit allows borrowers to access credit multiple times until reaching a predetermined credit limit. Payments replenish available credit, allowing for repeated use over multiple time periods.

=== Consignment credit ===
Consignment credit involves one party (the consignee) selling goods provided by another party (the cosigner) at a lower cost. The consignee can profit from marking up the goods, while the cosigner benefits from the sale. Unsold goods can be returned within a specified timeframe.

==Example==
The operator of an ice cream stand may sign a franchising agreement, under which the distributor agrees to provide ice cream stock under the terms &quot;net 60&quot; with a ten percent discount on payment within 30 days, and a 20% discount on payment within 10 days. This means that the operator has 60 days to pay the invoice in full. If sales are good within the first week, the operator may be able to send a cheque for all or part of the invoice, and make an extra 20% on the ice cream sold. However, if sales are slow, leading to a month of low cash flow, then the operator may decide to pay within 30 days, obtaining a 10% discount, or use the money for another 30 days and pay the full invoice amount within 60 days.

If the ice cream distributor for its part were to receive trade credit from milk and sugar suppliers on terms of net 30 and 2% discount if paid within ten days, it would appear it were taking a loss or disadvantageous position in this web of trade credit balances. The ice cream distributor may be willing to do so if it has a substantial markup on the ingredients and other costs of production of the ice cream it sells to the operator, but there exists more than one reason to manage trade credit terms for the benefit of a business, and more than one way to do so. The ice cream distributor may be well-capitalized either from the owners&#x27; investment or from accumulated profits, and may be looking to expand his markets. They may be aggressive in attempting to locate new customers or to help them get established. It is not in their best interests for customers to go out of business from cash flow instabilities, so their financial terms aim to accomplish two things:

# Allow startup ice cream parlors the ability to mismanage their investment in inventory for a while, while learning their markets, without having a dramatic negative balance in their bank account which could put them out of business. This is in effect, a short-term business loan made to help expand the distributor&#x27;s market and customer base.
# By tracking who pays, and when, the distributor can see potential problems developing and take steps to reduce or increase the allowed amount of trade credit he extends to prospering or exposure to losses from customers going bankrupt who would never pay for the ice cream delivered.

==Alternatives==
One alternative to straightforward trade credit is when a supplier offers to give product on consignment to a trader e.g. a gift shop. The terms of the arrangement mean that the original supplier retains ownership of the goods until the shop sells them.
Trade credit has been identified as a critical source of short-term financing for listed manufacturing companies. A trade credit contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties that allows a buyer to purchase goods or services on account and pay the supplier at a later date

<doc id="49749" wikidata="Q70" url="?curid=49749" title="Bern">
<text>Bern (), or Berne (), is the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Switzerland, referred to as the &quot;federal city&quot;. With a population of about 146,000 (), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland, behind Zürich, Geneva, Basel and Lausanne. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000.

Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland&#x27;s cantons. The official language is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German. In 1983, the historic old town (in ) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is notably surrounded by the Aare, a major river of the Swiss Plateau.

Although fortified settlements were established since antiquity, the medieval city proper was founded by the Zähringer ruling family, probably in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen. Bern was made a free imperial city in 1218 and, in 1353, it joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of its eight early cantons. Since then, Bern became a large city-state and a prominent actor of Swiss history by pursuing a policy of sovereign territorial expansion. Since the 15th century, the city was progressively rebuilt and acquired its current characteristics. Bern was made the Federal City in 1848. From about 5,000 inhabitants in the 15th century, the city passed the 100,000 mark in the 1920s.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the name &quot;Bern&quot; is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as &quot;Bern&quot; in Middle High German. The city was sometimes referred to as &quot;Bern im Üechtland&quot; to distinguish it from Verona. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly &quot;*berna&quot; &quot;cleft&quot;. The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the &quot;Bärengraben&quot; dates to the 1440s.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
No archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today&#x27;s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic &quot;oppidum&quot; stood on the &quot;Engehalbinsel&quot; (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La Tène period), thought to be one of the 12 &quot;oppida&quot; of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman &quot;vicus&quot; was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name &quot;Brenodor&quot; (&quot;dwelling of Breno&quot;). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in Bümpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some from the medieval city.

The medieval city is a foundation of the Zähringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (&quot;Cronica de Berno&quot;, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen.

In 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the &quot;Goldene Handfeste&quot; of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.

=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===
In 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming the eighth canton of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.

Bern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps. By the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.
The city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The &quot;Zytglogge&quot; tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the &quot;Käfigturm&quot; took over this role until 1345. It was succeeded by the &quot;Christoffelturm&quot; (formerly located closer to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, two new fortifications – the so-called big and small &quot;Schanze&quot; (entrenchments) – were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.

After a major blaze in 1405, the city&#x27;s original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses, and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.

During the 18th century, the city of Bern was at one point the largest shareholder in the South Sea Company, a British joint-stock company which was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. From 1689 to 3 March 1798 in the town was printed, in French, the biweekly newspaper &quot;Gazette de Berne&quot;, which reflected the opinions of Bern, usually hostile to the politics of Pre-revolutionary France.

=== Modern history ===

Bern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.

On 28 November 1848, during the revolutions that year, a majority of the new Swiss Federal Assembly deputies chose Bern as the Federal City (seat of the government) of the newly created Swiss federal state, ahead of Zürich and Lucerne. Bern was chosen as not to concentrate all the power in the economic powerhouse of Zürich, while Catholic and conservative Lucerne had been part of the Sonderbund during the war a year before. In addition, Bern had a more central location and was supported by the French-speaking cantons due to proximity to them. However, the constitution doesn&#x27;t define Bern as official capital of Switzerland, but as the seat of government.

A number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.

The city&#x27;s population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s. Population peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000. As of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.

<text>Arms control is a term for international restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of small arms, conventional weapons, and weapons of mass destruction. Historically, arms control may apply to melee weapons (such as swords) before the invention of firearm. Arms control is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such limitations upon consenting participants through international treaties and agreements, although it may also comprise efforts by a nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a non-consenting country.

== Enactment ==

Arms control treaties and agreements are often seen as a way to avoid costly arms races which could prove counter-productive to national aims and future peace. Some are used as ways to stop the spread of certain military technologies (such as nuclear weaponry or missile technology) in return for assurances to potential developers that they will not be victims of those technologies. Additionally, some arms control agreements are entered to limit the damage done by warfare, especially to civilians and the environment, which is seen as bad for all participants regardless of who wins a war.

While arms control treaties are seen by many peace proponents as a key tool against war, by the participants, they are often seen simply as ways to limit the high costs of the development and building of weapons, and even reduce the costs associated with war itself. Arms control can even be a way of maintaining the viability of military action by limiting those weapons that would make war so costly and destructive as to make it no longer a viable tool for national policy.

== Enforcement ==

Enforcement of arms control agreements has proven difficult over time. Most agreements rely on the continued desire of the participants to abide by the terms to remain effective. Usually, when a nation no longer desires to abide by the terms, they usually will seek to either covertly circumvent the terms or to end their participation in the treaty. This was seen with the Washington Naval Treaty (and the subsequent London Naval Treaty), where most participants sought to work around the limitations, some more legitimately than others. The United States developed better technology to get better performance from their ships while still working within the weight limits, the United Kingdom exploited a loop-hole in the terms, the Italians misrepresented the weight of their vessels, and when up against the limits, Japan left the treaty. The nations which violated the terms of the treaty did not suffer great consequences for their actions. Within little more than a decade, the treaty was abandoned. The Geneva Protocol has lasted longer and been more successful at being respected, but still nations have violated it at will when they have felt the need. Enforcement has been haphazard, with measures more a matter of politics than adherence to the terms. This meant sanctions and other measures tended to be advocated against violators primarily by their natural political enemies, while violations have been ignored or given only token measures by their political allies.

More recent arms control treaties have included more stringent terms on enforcement of violations as well as verification. This last has been a major obstacle to effective enforcement, as violators often attempt to covertly circumvent the terms of the agreements. Verification is the process of determining whether or not a nation is complying with the terms of an agreement, and involves a combination of release of such information by participants as well as some way to allow participants to examine each other to verify that information. This often involves as much negotiation as the limits themselves, and in some cases questions of verification have led to the breakdown of treaty negotiations (for example, verification was cited as a major concern by opponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ultimately not ratified by the United States).

States may remain in a treaty while seeking to break the limits of that treaty as opposed to withdrawing from it. This is for two major reasons. To openly defy an agreement, even if one withdraws from it, often is seen in a bad light politically and can carry diplomatic repercussions. Additionally, if one remains in an agreement, competitors who are also participatory may be held to the limitations of the terms, while withdrawal releases your opponents to make the same developments you are making, limiting the advantage of that development.

== Theory of arms control ==

Scholars and practitioners such as John D. Steinbruner, Thomas Schelling, Morton Halperin, Jonathan Dean or Stuart Croft worked extensively on the theoretical backing of arms control. Arms control is meant to break the security dilemma. It aims at mutual security between partners and overall stability (be it in a crisis situation, a grand strategy, or stability to put an end to an arms race). Other than stability, arms control comes with cost reduction and damage limitation. It is different from disarmament since the maintenance of stability might allow for mutually controlled armament and does not take a peace-without-weapons-stance. Nevertheless, arms control is a defensive strategy in principle, since transparency, equality, and stability do not fit into an offensive strategy.

According to a 2020 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;, arms control is rare because successful arms control agreements involve a difficult trade-off between transparency and security. For arms control agreements to be effective, there needs to be a way to thoroughly verify that a state is following the agreement, such as through intrusive inspections. However, states are often reluctant to submit to such inspections when they have reasons to fear that the inspectors will use the inspections to gather information about the capabilities of the state, which could be used in a future conflict.

== History ==

===Pre-19th century===
One of the first recorded attempts in arms control was a set of rules laid down in ancient Greece by the Amphictyonic Leagues. Rulings specified how war could be waged, and breaches of this could be punished by fines or by war.

In the 8th and 9th centuries AD, swords and chain mail armor manufactured in the Frankish empire were highly sought after for their quality, and Charlemagne (r. 768–814), made their sale or export to foreigners illegal, punishable by forfeiture of property or even death. This was an attempt to limit the possession and use of this equipment by the Franks&#x27; enemies, including the Moors, the Vikings and the Slavs.

The church used its position as a trans-national organization to limit the means of warfare. The 989 Peace of God (extended in 1033) ruling protected noncombatants, agrarian and economic facilities, and the property of the church from war. The 1027 Truce of God also tried to prevent violence between Christians. The Second Lateran Council in 1139 prohibited the use of crossbows against other Christians, although it did not prevent its use against non-Christians.

The development of firearms led to an increase in the devastation of war. The brutality of wars during this period led to efforts to formalize the rules of war, with humane treatment for prisoners of war or wounded, as well as rules to protect non-combatants and the pillaging of their property. However, during the period until the beginning of the 19th century few formal arms control agreements were recorded, except theoretical proposals and those imposed on defeated armies.

One treaty which was concluded was the Strasbourg Agreement of 1675. This is the first international agreement limiting the use of chemical weapons, in this case, poison bullets. The treaty was signed between France and The Holy Roman Empire

===19th century===
The 1817 Rush–Bagot Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom was the first arms control treaty of what can be considered the modern industrial era, leading to the demilitarization of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain region of North America. This was followed by the 1871 Treaty of Washington which led to total demilitarization.

The industrial revolution led to the increasing mechanization of warfare, as well as rapid advances in the development of firearms; the increased potential of devastation (which was later seen in the battlefields of World War I) led to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia calling together the leaders of 26 nations for the First Hague Conference in 1899. The Conference led to the signing of the Hague Convention of 1899 that led to rules of declaring and conducting warfare as well as the use of modern weaponry, and also led to the setting up of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

===1900 to 1945===
A Second Hague Conference was called in 1907 leading to additions and amendments to the original 1899 agreement. A Third Hague Conference was called for 1915, but this was abandoned due to the First World War.

After the World War I, the League of Nations was set up which attempted to limit and reduce arms. However the enforcement of this policy was not effective. Various naval conferences, such as the Washington Naval Conference, were held during the period between the First and Second World Wars to limit the number and size of major warships of the five great naval powers.

The 1925 Geneva Conference led to the banning of chemical weapons being deployed against enemy nationals in international armed conflict as part of the Geneva Protocol. The 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, whilst ineffective, attempted for &quot;providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy&quot;.

===Since 1945===

After World War II, the United Nations was set up as a body to promote and to maintain international peace and security. The United States proposed the Baruch Plan in 1946 as a way to impose stringent international control over the nuclear fuel cycle and thereby avert a global nuclear arms race, but the Soviet Union rejected the proposal and negotiations failed. Following President Eisenhower&#x27;s 1953 Atoms for Peace speech to the UN General Assembly, the International Atomic Energy Agency was set up in 1957 to promote peaceful uses of nuclear technology and apply safeguards against the diversion of nuclear material from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons.

Under the auspices of the United Nations, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which aimed to end nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, underwater and in outer-space, was established in 1963. The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was signed to prevent further spread of nuclear weapons technology to countries outside the five that already possessed them: the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France and China. With the three main goals of establishing nonproliferation with inspections, nuclear arms reduction, and the right to use nuclear energy peacefully, this treaty initially met some reluctance from countries developing their own nuclear programs such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. Still, all countries with the exception of India, Israel, Pakistan and South Sudan decided to sign or ratify the document.

The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the United States and Soviet Union in the late 1960s/early 1970s led to further weapons control agreements. The SALT I talks led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an &quot;Interim Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement&quot; (see SALT I), both in 1972. The SALT II talks started in 1972 leading to agreement in 1979. Due to the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan the United States never ratified the treaty, but the agreement was honoured by both sides.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed between the United States and Soviet Union in 1987 and ratified in 1988, leading to an agreement to destroy all missiles with ranges from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. This came in the context of a revitalised peace movement during the previous decade which included huge demonstrations around the world for nuclear disarmament.

The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention was signed banning the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties were signed, as START I and START II, by the US and Soviet Union, further restricting weapons. This was further moved on by the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, which was in turn superseded by the New START Treaty.
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1996 banning all nuclear explosions in all environments, for military or civilian purposes, but it has not entered into force due to the non-ratification of eight specific states.

In 1998 the United Nations founded the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA). Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons. It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially landmines and small arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.

In addition to treaties focused primarily on stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons, there has been a recent movement to regulate the sale and trading of conventional weapons. As of December 2014, the United Nations is preparing for entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty, which has been ratified by 89 nations. However, it is currently missing ratification by key arms producers such as Russia and China, and while the United States has signed the treaty it has not yet ratified it. The Treaty regulates the international trade in almost all categories of conventional weapons – from small arms to battle tanks, combat aircraft and warships. Ammunition, as well as parts and components, are also covered.

More recently, the United Nations announced the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2020, following the 50th ratification or accession by member states.

==Arms control organizations==

The intergovernmental organizations for arms control are the following:
* International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
* Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)
* Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which has other functions besides arms control
* Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO PrepCom)

<doc id="49759" wikidata="Q1355487" url="?curid=49759" title="Down and Out in Paris and London">
<text>Down and Out in Paris and London is the first full-length work by the English author George Orwell, published in 1933. It is a memoir in two parts on the theme of poverty in the two cities. Its target audience was the middle- and upper-class members of society—those who were more likely to be well educated—and it exposes the poverty existing in two prosperous cities: Paris and London. The first part is an account of living in near-extreme poverty and destitution in Paris and the experience of casual labour in restaurant kitchens. The second part is a travelogue of life on the road in and around London from the tramp&#x27;s perspective, with descriptions of the types of hostel accommodation available and some of the characters to be found living on the margins.

==Background==

After giving up his post as a policeman in Burma to become a writer, Orwell moved to rooms in Portobello Road, London at the end of 1927 when he was 24. While contributing to various journals, he undertook investigative tramping expeditions in and around London, collecting material for use in &quot;The Spike&quot;, his first published essay, and for the latter half of &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. In spring of 1928 he moved to Paris and lived at 6 Rue du Pot de Fer in the Latin Quarter, a bohemian quarter with a cosmopolitan flavour. American writers like Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald had lived in the same area. Following the Russian Revolution, there was a large Russian emigre community in Paris. Orwell&#x27;s aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He led an active social life, worked on his novels and had several articles published in avant-garde journals.

Orwell fell seriously ill in March 1929 and shortly afterwards had money stolen from the lodging house. The thief was probably not the young Italian described in &quot;Down and Out&quot;. In a later account, he said the theft was the work of a young woman whom he had picked up and brought back with him; it has been submitted that &quot;consideration for his parents&#x27; sensibilities would have required the suppression of this misadventure&quot;. Whoever reduced Orwell to destitution did him a good turn; his final ten weeks in Paris sowed the seed of his first published book. Whether through necessity or just to collect material, and probably both, he undertook casual work as a dishwasher in restaurants. In August 1929 he sent a copy of &quot;The Spike&quot; to the &quot;Adelphi&quot; magazine in London, and it was accepted for publication. Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents&#x27; house in Southwold. Later he acted as a private tutor to a disabled child there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931. After this adventure, he ended up in the Tooley Street kip, which he found so unpleasant that he wrote home for money and moved to more comfortable lodgings.

==Publication==
Orwell&#x27;s first version of &quot;Down and Out&quot; was called &quot;A Scullion&#x27;s Diary&quot;. Completed in October 1930, it used only his Paris material. He offered it to Jonathan Cape in the summer of 1931. Cape rejected it in the autumn. A year later he offered &quot;a fatter typescript (the London chapters had been added)&quot; to Faber &amp; Faber, where T. S. Eliot, then an editorial director, also rejected it, stating, &quot;We did find it of very great interest, but I regret to say that it does not appear to me possible as a publishing venture.&quot;

It was in the home of Mabel Fierz that Orwell then discarded the typescript. She had, with her husband, a London businessman named Francis, been for a number of years a visitor to Southwold in the summer and was on friendly terms with the Blairs. Fierz at this point took it to a literary agent, Leonard Moore, who &quot;recognised it as a &#x27;natural&#x27; for the new house of Gollancz.&quot; Victor Gollancz was prepared to publish the work, subject to the removal of bad language and some identifiable names, and offered an advance of £40. Orwell complained that one passage that Gollancz asked be changed or cut was &quot;about the only good bit of writing in the book&quot;. The title improvised by Gollancz, &quot;Confessions of a Down and Outer&quot;, bothered Orwell. &quot;Would &quot;The Confessions of a Dishwasher&quot; do as well?&quot; he asked Moore. &quot;I would &quot;rather&quot; answer to &quot;dishwasher&quot; than &quot;down &amp; out&quot;.&quot; In July 1932, Orwell had suggested calling the book &quot;The Lady Poverty&quot;, in reference to a poem by Alice Meynell; in August 1932, he suggested &quot;In Praise of Poverty&quot;. At the last minute, Gollancz shortened the title to &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;. The author, after possibilities including &quot;X,&quot; &quot;P.S. Burton&quot; (an alias Orwell had used on tramping expeditions), &quot;Kenneth Miles&quot; and &quot;H. Lewis Allways&quot; had been considered, was renamed &quot;George Orwell.&quot; Orwell did not wish to publish under his own name Eric Blair, and Orwell was the name he used from then on for his main works—although many periodical articles were still published under the name Eric Blair. &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot; was published on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews from, among others, C. Day Lewis, WH Davies, Compton Mackenzie and JB Priestley. It was subsequently published by Harper &amp; Brothers in New York. Sales were low, however, until December 1940, when Penguin Books printed 55,000 copies for sale at sixpence.

A French translation, which Orwell admired, by RN Raimbault and Gwen Gilbert, entitled &quot;&quot;, was published by Éditions Gallimard, on 2 May 1935, with a preface by Panait Istrati and an introduction by Orwell.

==Summary==

===Chapters 1–23 (Paris)===
The scene-setting opening chapters describe the atmosphere in the Paris quarter and introduce various characters who appear later in the book. From Chapter III to Chapter X, where the narrator obtains a job at &quot;Hotel X,&quot; he describes his descent into poverty, often in tragi-comic terms. An Italian compositor forges room keys and steals his savings and his scant income vanishes when the English lessons he is giving stop. He begins at first to sell some of his clothes, and then to pawn his remaining clothes, and then searches for work with a Russian waiter named Boris—work as a porter at Les Halles, work as an English teacher and restaurant work. He recounts his two-day experience without any food and tells of meeting Russian &quot;Communists&quot; who, he later concludes, on their disappearance, must be mere swindlers.

After the various ordeals of unemployment and hunger the narrator obtains a job as a &quot;plongeur&quot; (dishwasher) in the &quot;Hôtel X&quot; near the Place de la Concorde, and begins to work long hours there. In Chapter XIII, he describes the &quot;caste system&quot; of the hotel—&quot;manager-cooks-waiters-plongeurs&quot;—and, in Chapter XIV, its frantic and seemingly chaotic workings. He notes also &quot;the dirt in the Hôtel X.,&quot; which became apparent &quot;as soon as one penetrated into the service quarters.&quot; He talks of his routine life among the working poor of Paris, slaving and sleeping, and then drinking on Saturday night through the early hours of Sunday morning. In Chapter XVI, he refers briefly to a murder committed &quot;just beneath my window [while he was sleeping ... The thing that strikes me in looking back,&quot; he says, &quot;is that I was in bed and asleep within three minutes of the murder [...] We were working people, and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder?&quot;

Misled by Boris&#x27;s optimism, the narrator is briefly penniless again after he and Boris quit their hotel jobs in the expectation of work at a new restaurant, the &quot;Auberge de Jehan Cottard,&quot; where Boris feels sure he will become a waiter again; at the Hotel X, he had been doing lower-grade work. The &quot;patron&quot; of the Auberge, &quot;an ex-colonel of the Russian Army,&quot; seems to have financial difficulties. The narrator is not paid for ten days and is compelled to spend a night on a bench—&quot;It was very uncomfortable—the arm of the seat cuts into your back—and much colder than I had expected&quot;—rather than face his landlady over the outstanding rent.

At the restaurant, the narrator finds himself working &quot;seventeen and a half hours&quot; a day, &quot;almost without a break,&quot; and looking back wistfully at his relatively leisured and orderly life at the Hotel X. Boris works even longer: &quot;eighteen hours a day, seven days a week.&quot; The narrator claims that &quot;such hours, though not usual, are nothing extraordinary in Paris.&quot; He adds

by the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating-house frequented by students and workmen. We did not provide an adequate meal at less than twenty-five francs, and we were picturesque and artistic, which sent up our social standing. There were the indecent pictures in the bar, and the Norman decorations—sham beams on the walls, electric lights done up as candlesticks, &quot;peasant&quot; pottery, even a mounting-block at the door—and the &quot;patron&quot; and the head waiter were Russian officers, and many of the customers titled Russian refugees. In short, we were decidedly chic.

He falls into a routine again and speaks of quite literally fighting for a place on the Paris Métro to reach the &quot;cold, filthy kitchen&quot; by seven. Despite the filth and incompetence, the restaurant turns out to be a success.

The narrative is interspersed with anecdotes recounted by some of the minor characters, such as Valenti, an Italian waiter at Hotel X, and Charlie, &quot;one of the local curiosities,&quot; who is &quot;a youth of family and education who had run away from home.&quot; In Chapter XXII, the narrator considers the life of a &quot;plongeur&quot;:

[A] &quot;plongeur&quot; is one of the slaves of the modern world. Not that there is any need to whine over him, for he is better off than many manual workers, but still, he is no freer than if he were bought and sold. His work is servile and without art; he is paid just enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the sack [... He has] been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible. If &quot;plongeurs&quot; thought at all, they would long ago have formed a labour union and gone on strike for better treatment. But they do not think, because they have no leisure for it; their life has made slaves of them.

Because of the stress of the long hours, he mails to a friend, &quot;B,&quot; back in London, asking if he could get him a job that allows more than five hours&#x27; sleep a night. His friend duly replies, offering a job taking care of a &quot;congenital imbecile,&quot; and sends him some money to get his possessions from the pawn. The narrator then quits his job as a &quot;plongeur&quot; and leaves for London.

===Chapters 24–38 (London)===
The narrator arrives in London expecting to have the job waiting for him. Unfortunately the would-be employers have gone abroad, &quot;patient and all.&quot;

Until his employers return, the narrator lives as a tramp, sleeping in an assortment of venues: lodging houses, tramps&#x27; hostels or &quot;spikes,&quot; and Salvation Army shelters. Because vagrants can not &quot;enter any one spike, or any two London spikes, more than once in a month, on pain of being confined for a week,&quot; he is required to keep on the move, with the result that long hours are spent tramping or waiting for hostels to open. Chapters XXV to XXXV describe his various journeys, the different forms of accommodation, a selection of the people he meets, and the tramps&#x27; reaction to Christian charity: &quot;Evidently the tramps were not grateful for their free tea. And yet it was excellent [...] I am sure too that it was given in a good spirit, without any intention of humiliating us; so in fairness we ought to have been grateful—still, we were not.&quot; Characters in this section of the book include the Irish tramp called Paddy, &quot;a good fellow&quot; whose &quot;ignorance was limitless and appalling,&quot; and the pavement artist from the Embankment, Bozo, who has a good literary background and was formerly an amateur astronomer. He has a &quot;dreadfully deformed&quot; right foot and has fallen prey to a succession of similar misfortunes, in his trade and his life.

The final chapters provide a catalogue of various types of accommodation open to tramps, including the four penny coffin. The narrator offers some general remarks, concluding,

At present I do not feel that I have seen more than the fringe of poverty. Still, I can point to one or two things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal at a smart restaurant. That is a beginning.

== Fact and fiction ==
One of the debates surrounding &quot;Down and Out&quot; is whether it was a piece of factual autobiography or part fiction. Orwell wrote in the Introduction to the 1935 French edition: &quot;I think I can say that I have exaggerated nothing except in so far as all writers exaggerate by selecting. I did not feel that I had to describe events in the exact order in which they happened, but everything I have described did take place at one time or another.&quot; In Chapter XXIV, it is &quot;clear that Orwell did distort facts by claiming on his return from Paris he found himself down and out in London and had not &#x27;the slightest notion of how to get a cheap bed&#x27;. This of course heightens the tension [...] but the truth is that in Paris he had already written his first substantial essay, &quot;The Spike&quot;, describing a night spent in a Notting Hill tramps&#x27; hostel. Before his departure from England he had voluntarily lived among tramps for some time.&quot;

In &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;, Orwell referred to the tramping experiences described in &quot;Down and Out&quot;, writing that &quot;nearly all the incidents described there actually happened, though they have been re-arranged.&quot; Some measure of the work&#x27;s veracity may be gleaned from a marked-up copy, containing sixteen annotations, which Orwell gave to Brenda Salkeld. Of the descent into poverty from Chapter III, he wrote, &quot;Succeeding chapters are not actually autobiography but drawn from what I have seen.&quot; Of Chapter VII, however, he wrote, &quot;This all happened;&quot; of Hotel X, &quot;All as exact as I could make it;&quot; and, of the Russian restaurant, &quot;All the following is an entirely accurate description of the restaurant.&quot; On the personalities, Orwell&#x27;s own introduction to the French edition states that the characters are individuals, but are &quot;intended more as representative types.&quot;

The luxury hotel in which Orwell worked in the autumn of 1929 was identified as the Crillon by Sonia Orwell, as recounted by Sam White, the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;&#x27;s Paris correspondent in his column for 16 June 1967. The writers Stansky and Abrahams suggested, in their study of Orwell, that it was the Hotel Lotti.

== Reactions ==
Within a month of publication, Humbert Possenti, &quot;a restaurateur and hotelier of forty years,&quot; had written to &quot;The Times&quot; complaining that the book was unfairly disparaging to the restaurant trade. The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; had previously reviewed &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;, describing it as &quot;a vivid picture of an apparently mad world.&quot; Orwell responded to the restaurateur&#x27;s criticism with a letter to the same newspaper: &quot;I do know that in our hotel there were places which no customer could possibly have been allowed to see with any hope of retaining his custom.&quot; In France, political outlook very much determined the reception of &quot;La Vache enragée&quot;. The left welcomed it as an indictment of health hazards in commercial kitchens. The right accused Orwell of Francophobia. A middle of the road paper surmised that Orwell&#x27;s account was likely to &quot;give a retrospective retch to Americans&quot; who had patronized Parisian restaurants.

In the &quot;Adelphi&quot;, C. Day Lewis wrote, &quot;Orwell&#x27;s book is a tour of the underworld, conducted without hysteria or prejudice [...] a model of clarity and good sense.&quot; JB Priestley, in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, considered it &quot;uncommonly good reading. An excellent book and a valuable social document. The best book of its kind I have read in a long time.&quot; Compton Mackenzie wrote of Orwell&#x27;s &quot;immensely interesting book [...] a genuine human document, which at the same time is written with so much artistic force that, in spite of the squalor and degradation thus unfolded, the result is curiously beautiful with the beauty of an accomplished etching on copper. The account of a casual ward in this country horrifies like some scene of inexplicable misery in Dante.&quot;

Following the American publication, James T. Farrell, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, called it &quot;genuine, unexaggerated and intelligent,&quot; while Herbert Gorman wrote for the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;He possesses a keen eye for character and a rough-and-ready &#x27;styleless style&#x27; that plunges along and makes the reader see what the author wants him to see.&quot; In contrast, the reviewer for &quot;New English Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;This book [...] is forcefully written and is very readable, yet it fails to carry conviction. We wonder if the author was really down and out. Down certainly, but out?&quot;

Cyril Connolly later wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t think &quot;Down and Out in London and Paris&quot; is more than agreeable journalism; it was all better done by his friend Henry Miller. Orwell found his true form a few years later.&quot; Orwell agreed with this assessment. Henry Miller&#x27;s controversial work &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (1934) is based on his own experiences in Paris around the time Orwell was there.

In an essay for the 1971 &quot;The World of George Orwell&quot;, Richard Mayne considered the book as typical of something that was true of a great deal of Orwell&#x27;s later writing: his &quot;relish at revealing behind-the-scenes squalor. He was always taking the lid off things—poverty, parlour Socialism, life in a coal mine, prep-school tyranny, the Empire, the Spanish Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the political misuse of language. He might well have echoed W.H. Auden: &quot;All I have is a voice/To undo the folded lie.&quot;&quot;

The narrator&#x27;s comments on Jews in the book are cited by a journalist for &quot;Haaretz&quot; when considering what he terms &quot;Orwell’s latent anti-Semitism&quot;. Some suggest the work may have been Orwell&#x27;s parody of his own social upbringing and social class, noticing the narrator has both racist and anti-racist outbursts. Another commentator cites the book as evidence that anti-Semitism was much more prevalent in Paris than in London.

<text>A letter bomb is an explosive device sent via the postal service, and designed with the intention to injure or kill the recipient when opened. They have been used in terrorist attacks such as those of the Unabomber. Some countries have agencies whose duties include the interdiction of letter bombs and the investigation of letter bombings. The letter bomb may have been in use for nearly as long as the common postal service has been in existence, as far back as 1764 (&quot;see Examples&quot;).

==Description==
Letter bombs are usually designed to explode immediately on opening, with the intention of seriously injuring or killing the recipient (who may or may not be the person to whom the bomb was addressed). A related threat is mail containing unidentified powders or chemicals, as in the 2001 anthrax attacks.

==Use by suffragettes==

One of, if not the first, groups to consistently use letter bombs on a wide scale were the British suffragettes of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union in the years before the First World War. The group were the original inventors of a form of letter bomb designed to maim or kill politicians or opponents. In 1913, numerous letter bombs were sent to politicians such as the Chancellor David Lloyd George and Prime Minister H.H. Asquith, but they invariably all exploded in post offices, post boxes or in mailbags while in transit across the country. Suffragettes also once attempted to assassinate a judge they considered to be anti-women&#x27;s suffrage, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, with a &quot;deadly&quot; letter-bomb made partly out of bullets, but the bomb was intercepted by London postal workers before it could reach him.

==Patentability==
Letter-bombs, along with anti-personnel mines, are typical examples of subject-matter excluded from patentability under the European Patent Convention, because the publication or exploitation of such inventions are contrary to the &quot;ordre public&quot; and/or morality ().

==Examples==

* What might be the first recorded case of a device broadly similar to a modern parcel bomb featured in the 18th century affair known as the Bandbox Plot. On November 4, 1712, a bandbox (i.e. a lightweight hat-box) was sent to Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, the British Lord Treasurer. It contained a number of loaded and cocked pistols, to whose triggers was attached a thread which would have made the pistols fire the moment the box was opened. The plot was foiled by the perspicacity of Jonathan Swift, who happened to be visiting the Earl of Oxford. Swift, perceiving the thread, seized the package and cut the thread, thus disarming the device. The attack was laid at the door of the opposition Whig party and threw enormous popular sympathy behind Harley. The precise perpetrators were never identified or apprehended.
* One of the world&#x27;s first mail bombs is mentioned in the 18th century diary of Danish official and historian Bolle Willum Luxdorph. His diary mainly consists of concise references to news from Denmark and abroad. In the entry for January 19, 1764, he writes the following: &quot;Colonel Poulsen residing at Børglum Abbey was sent by mail a box. When he opens it, therein is to be found gunpowder and a firelock which sets fire unto it, so he became very injured.&quot; The entry for February 15 same year says: &quot;Colonel Poulsen receives a letter in German, [saying] that soon the dose will be increased.&quot; It is referring to the dose of gunpowder in the box. The perpetrator was never found. In a later reference Luxdorph has found a mention of a similar bomb being used, also in 1764, but in Savona in Italy.

<text>Punched tape or perforated paper tape is a form of data storage device that consists of a long strip of paper through which small holes are punched. It was developed from and was subsequently used alongside punched cards, the difference being that the tape is continuous.

Punched cards, and chains of punched cards, were used for control of looms in the 18th century. Use for telegraphy systems started in 1842. Punched tapes were used throughout the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries for programmable looms, teleprinter communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and CNC machine tools. During the Second World War, high-speed punched tape systems using optical readout methods were used in code breaking systems. Punched tape was used to transmit data for manufacture of read-only memory chips.

== History ==

Perforated paper tapes were first used by Basile Bouchon in 1725 to control looms. However, the paper tapes were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard had developed machines to create paper tapes by tying punched cards in a sequence for Jacquard looms. The resulting paper tape, also called a &quot;chain of cards&quot;, was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair. This led to the concept of communicating data not as a stream of individual cards, but as one &quot;continuous card&quot; (or tape). Paper tapes constructed from punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling looms. Many professional embroidery operations still refer to those individuals who create the designs and machine patterns as &quot;punchers&quot; even though punched cards and paper tape were eventually phased out in the 1990s.

In 1842, a French patent by Claude Seytre described a piano playing device that read data from perforated paper rolls. By 1900, wide perforated music rolls for player pianos were used to distribute popular music to mass markets.
In 1846, Alexander Bain used punched tape to send telegrams. This technology was adopted by Charles Wheatstone in 1857 for the Wheatstone system used for the automated preparation, storage and transmission of data in telegraphy.

In the 1880s, Tolbert Lanston invented the Monotype typesetting system, which consisted of a keyboard and a composition caster. The tape, punched with the keyboard, was later read by the caster, which produced lead type according to the combinations of holes in up to 31 positions. The tape reader used compressed air, which passed through the holes and was directed into certain mechanisms of the caster. The system went into commercial use in 1897 and was in production well into the 1970s, undergoing several changes along the way.

=== Modern use ===
In the 21st century, punched tape is obsolete except among hobbyists. In computer numerical control (CNC) machining applications, though paper tape has been superseded by digital memory, some modern systems still measure the size of stored CNC programs in feet or meters, corresponding to the equivalent length if the data were actually punched on paper tape.

== Formats ==
Data was represented by the presence or absence of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data across the width of the tape. Later tapes had more rows. A 1944 electro-mechanical programmable calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper tape with 24 rows, The IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) used paper tape with 74 rows. Australia&#x27;s 1951 electronic computer, CSIRAC, used wide paper tape with twelve rows.

A row of smaller sprocket holes was always punched to be used to synchronize tape movement. Originally, this was done using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later, optical readers made use of the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes were slightly closer to one edge of the tape, dividing the tape into unequal widths, to make it unambiguous which way to orient the tape in the reader. The bits on the narrower width of the tape were generally the least significant bits when the code was represented as numbers in a digital system.

=== Materials ===
Many early machines used oiled paper tape, which was pre-impregnated with a light machine oil, to lubricate the reader and punch mechanisms. The oil impregnation usually made the paper somewhat translucent and slippery, and excess oil could transfer to clothing or any surfaces it contacted. Later optical tape readers often specified non-oiled opaque paper tape, which was less prone to depositing oily debris on the optical sensors and causing read errors. Another innovation was fanfold paper tape, which was easier to store compactly and less prone to tangling, as compared to rolled paper tape.

For heavy-duty or repetitive use, polyester Mylar tape was often used. This tough, durable plastic film was usually thinner than paper tapes, but could still be used in many devices originally designed for paper media. The plastic tape was sometimes transparent, but usually was aluminized to make it opaque enough for use in high-speed optical readers.

=== Dimensions ===
Tape for punching was usually thick. The two most common widths were for five bit codes, and for tapes with six or more bits. Hole spacing was in both directions. Data holes were in diameter; sprocket feed holes were .

=== Chadless tape ===

Most tape-punching equipment used solid circular punches to create holes in the tape. This process created &quot;chad&quot;, or small circular pieces of paper. Managing the disposal of chad was an annoying and complex problem, as the tiny paper pieces had a tendency to escape containment and to interfere with the other electromechanical parts of the teleprinter equipment. Chad from oiled paper tape was particularly problematic, as it tended to clump and build up, rather than flowing freely into a collection container.

A variation on the tape punch was a device called a &quot;Chadless Printing Reperforator&quot;. This machine would punch a received teleprinter signal into tape and print the message on it at the same time, using a printing mechanism similar to that of an ordinary page printer. The tape punch, rather than punching out the usual round holes, would instead punch little U-shaped cuts in the paper, so that no chad would be produced; the &quot;hole&quot; was still filled with a little paper trap-door. By not fully punching out the hole, the printing on the paper remained intact and legible. This enabled operators to read the tape without having to decipher the holes, which would facilitate relaying the message on to another station in the network. Also, there was no &quot;chad box&quot; to empty from time to time.

A disadvantage to this technology was that, once punched, chadless tape did not roll up well for storage, because the protruding flaps of paper would catch on the next layer of tape so it could not be coiled up tightly. Another disadvantage that emerged in time, was that there was no reliable way to read chadless tape in later high-speed readers which used optical sensing. However, the mechanical tape readers used in most standard-speed equipment had no problem with chadless tape, because they sensed the holes by means of blunt spring-loaded mechanical sensing pins, which easily pushed the paper flaps out of the way.

== Encoding ==

Text was encoded in several ways. The earliest standard character encoding was Baudot, which dates back to the 19th century and had five holes. The Baudot code was superseded by modified five-hole codes such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed) which was developed into the Western Union code which was further developed into the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA 2), and a variant called the American Teletypewriter code (USTTY). Other standards, such as Teletypesetter (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&amp;T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.

== Applications ==
=== Communications ===

Punched tape was used as a way of storing messages for teletypewriters. Operators typed in the message to the paper tape, and then sent the message at the maximum line speed from the tape. This permitted the operator to prepare the message &quot;off-line&quot; at the operator&#x27;s best typing speed, and permitted the operator to correct any error prior to transmission. An experienced operator could prepare a message at 135 words per minute (WPM) or more for short periods.

The line typically operated at 75 WPM, but it operated continuously. By preparing the tape &quot;off-line&quot; and then sending the message with a tape reader, the line could operate continuously rather than depending on continuous &quot;on-line&quot; typing by a single operator. Typically, a single 75 WPM line supported three or more teletype operators working offline. Tapes punched at the receiving end could be used to relay messages to another station. Large store and forward networks were developed using these techniques.

Paper tape could be read into computers at up to 1,000 characters per second. In 1963, a Danish company called Regnecentralen introduced a paper tape reader called RC 2000 that could read 2,000 characters per second; later they increased the speed further, up to 2,500 cps. As early as World War II, the Heath Robinson tape reader, used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2,000 cps while Colossus could run at 5,000 cps using an optical tape reader designed by Arnold Lynch.

=== Minicomputers ===

When the first minicomputers were being released, most manufacturers turned to the existing mass-produced ASCII teleprinters (primarily the Teletype Model 33, capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and printer output. The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for &quot;Automatic Send/Receive&quot; as opposed to the punchless/readerless KSR – Keyboard Send/Receive and RO – Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low-cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.

Binary data transfer to or from these minicomputers was often accomplished using a doubly encoded technique to compensate for the relatively high error rate of punches and readers. The low-level encoding was typically ASCII, further encoded and framed in various schemes such as Intel Hex, in which a binary value of &quot;01011010&quot; would be represented by the ASCII characters &quot;5A&quot;. Framing, addressing and checksum (primarily in ASCII hex characters) information helped with error detection. Efficiencies of such an encoding scheme are on the order of 35–40% (e.g., 36% from 44 8-bit ASCII characters being needed to represent sixteen bytes of binary data per frame).

=== Computer-aided manufacturing===

In the 1970s, computer-aided manufacturing equipment often used paper tape. A paper tape reader was smaller and less expensive than Hollerith card or magnetic tape readers, and the medium was reasonably reliable in a manufacturing environment. Paper tape was an important storage medium for computer-controlled wire-wrap machines, for example.
Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and Mylar film tape were developed so that heavily used production tapes would last longer.

=== Data transfer for ROM and EPROM programming ===
In the 1970s through the early 1980s, paper tape was commonly used to transfer binary data for incorporation in either mask-programmable read-only memory (ROM) chips or their erasable counterparts EPROMs. A significant variety of encoding formats were developed for use in computer and ROM/EPROM data transfer. Encoding formats commonly used were primarily driven by those formats that EPROM programming devices supported and included various ASCII hex variants as well as a number of proprietary formats.

A much more primitive as well as a much longer high-level encoding scheme was also used, BNPF (Begin-Negative-Positive-Finish), also written as BPNF (Begin-Positive-Negative-Finish). In BNPF encoding, a single byte (8 bits) would be represented by a highly redundant character framing sequence starting with a single uppercase ASCII &quot;B&quot;, eight ASCII characters where a &quot;0&quot; would be represented by a &quot;N&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; would be represented by a &quot;P&quot;, followed by an ending ASCII &quot;F&quot;. These ten-character ASCII sequences were separated by one or more whitespace characters, therefore using at least eleven ASCII characters for each byte stored (9% efficiency). The ASCII &quot;N&quot; and &quot;P&quot; characters differed in four bit positions, providing excellent protection from single punch errors. Alternative schemes named BHLF (Begin-High-Low-Finish) and B10F (Begin-One-Zero-Finish) were also available where either &quot;L&quot; and &quot;H&quot; or &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; were also available to represent data bits, but in both of these encoding schemes, the two data-bearing ASCII characters differ in only one bit position, providing very poor single punch error detection.

=== Cash registers ===
NCR of Dayton, Ohio, made cash registers around 1970 that would punch paper tape. Sweda made similar cash registers around the same time. The tape could then be read into a computer and not only could sales information be summarized, billings could be done on charge transactions. The tape was also used for inventory tracking, recording department and class numbers of items sold.

=== Newspaper industry ===
Punched paper tape was used by the newspaper industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices like Linotype machines. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch paper tape, rather than the Linotype operator having to retype all the incoming stories, the paper tape could be put into a paper tape reader on the Linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the Friden Flexowriter, to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of Linotype and hot lead typesetting, many early phototypesetter devices utilized paper tape readers.

If an error was found at one position on the six-level tape, that character could be turned into a null character to be skipped by punching out the remaining non-punched positions with what was known as a “chicken plucker&quot;. It looked like a strawberry stem remover that, pressed with thumb and forefinger, could punch out the remaining positions, one hole at a time.

=== Cryptography ===

Vernam ciphers were invented in 1917 to encrypt teleprinter communications using a key stored on paper tape. During the last third of the 20th century, the National Security Agency (NSA) used punched paper tape to distribute cryptographic keys. The eight-level paper tapes were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a fill device, such as the hand held KOI-18, that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system (EKMS), but , paper tape was apparently still being employed. The paper tape canister is a tamper-resistant container that contains features to prevent undetected alteration of the contents.

== Advantages and limitations ==
Acid-free paper or Mylar tapes can be read many decades after manufacture, in contrast with magnetic tape that can deteriorate and become unreadable with time. The hole patterns of punched tape can be decoded by eye if necessary, and even editing of a tape is possible by manual cutting and splicing. Unlike magnetic tape, magnetic fields such as produced by electric motors cannot alter the punched data. In cryptography applications, a punched tape used to distribute a key can be rapidly and completely destroyed by burning, preventing the key from falling into the hands of an enemy.

Reliability of paper tape punching operations was a concern, so that for critical applications a new punched tape could be read after punching to verify the correct contents. Rewinding a tape required a takeup reel or other measures to avoid tearing or tangling the tape. In some uses, &quot;fan fold&quot; tape simplified handling as the tape would refold into a &quot;takeup tank&quot; ready to be re-read. The information density of punched tape was low compared with magnetic tape, making large datasets clumsy to handle in punched tape form.

<text>Anne Neville (11 June 1456 – 16 March 1485) was Queen of England from 26 June 1483 until her death in 1485 as the wife of King Richard III. She was the younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;), and Anne de Beauchamp. Before her marriage to Richard, she had been Princess of Wales as the wife of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the only son and heir apparent of King Henry VI.

As a member of the powerful House of Neville, Anne played a critical part in the Wars of the Roses fought between the houses of York and Lancaster for the English crown. Her father betrothed her as a girl to Prince Edward, the only son of the ousted King Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. The marriage was to seal an alliance with the Lancastrians and halt the Wars of the Roses.

After the death of Prince Edward and defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, Anne married Richard, Duke of Gloucester, younger brother of King Edward IV and of George, Duke of Clarence, the husband of Anne&#x27;s elder sister Isabel. Richard was also Anne&#x27;s first cousin once removed; her great-aunt, Cecily Neville, was Richard&#x27;s mother. Anne became queen when Richard acceded to the throne in June 1483, following the declaration that Edward IV&#x27;s children by Elizabeth Woodville were illegitimate. Anne predeceased her husband by five months, dying in March 1485. Her only child, Edward of Middleham, died in 1484 at the age of seven.

==Early life==
Anne Neville was born at Warwick Castle on 11 June 1456, the younger daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne de Beauchamp. Her father was one of the most powerful noblemen in England and the most important supporter of the House of York. Her grandfather&#x27;s sister, Cecily Neville, was the wife of Richard, Duke of York, who claimed the crown for the House of York.

Much of Anne Neville&#x27;s childhood was spent at Middleham Castle, one of her father&#x27;s properties, where she and her elder sister, Isabel, met two younger sons of the Duke of York: Richard, Duke of Gloucester (the future Richard III) and George, Duke of Clarence. Richard especially attended his knighthood training at Middleham since mid-1461 until at least the spring of 1465, or possibly since 1465 until late 1468. It is possible that even at this early stage, a match between the Earl&#x27;s daughters and the young dukes was being considered. The Duke of York was killed on 30 December 1460 but, with Warwick&#x27;s help, his eldest son became King Edward IV in March 1461. In July 1469, Lady Isabel married Clarence, while in July 1470, after the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s flight to France and change of allegiance, Anne Neville was betrothed to Edward of Westminster, the Lancastrian heir to the throne of England, and married to him by the end of the same year.

==Princess of Wales==
The Earl of Warwick had been at odds with Edward IV for some time, resenting his clandestine marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and the subsequent rise in the king&#x27;s favour of the new queen&#x27;s family, the Woodvilles. In 1469, the earl tried to put his son-in-law George on the throne, but met resistance from Parliament. After a second rebellion against King Edward failed in early 1470, he was forced to flee to France, where he allied himself with the ousted House of Lancaster in 1470. With King Henry VI imprisoned in the Tower of London, the &quot;de facto&quot; Lancastrian leader was his consort, Margaret of Anjou, who was suspicious of Warwick&#x27;s motives. To quell these suspicions, Anne Neville was formally betrothed to the son of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou, Edward of Westminster, at the Château d&#x27;Amboise in France. They were married in Angers Cathedral, probably on 13 December 1470, to make Anne Neville the Princess of Wales.
Warwick restored Henry VI to the throne in October 1470; Edward IV however returned to the country in March 1471 and quickly captured London and the person of Henry VI. The mentally challenged Henry VI was taken by Edward IV as a prisoner to the Battle of Barnet, where Warwick was killed on 14 April 1471. Edward IV then incarcerated Henry VI in the Tower of London. Following the decisive Yorkist victory at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, Henry was reported to have died of &quot;pure displeasure and melancholy,&quot; although &quot;The Great Chronicle of London&quot; reported that Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was responsible for his death. As Constable of England, he probably delivered King Edward&#x27;s order to kill Henry to the Constable of the Tower.

Margaret of Anjou had returned to England with Anne Neville and Prince Edward in April, bringing additional troops. At the Battle of Tewkesbury, Edward IV crushed this last Lancastrian army. Prince Edward was killed in or shortly after the battle, and Anne Neville was taken prisoner. She was taken first to Coventry and then to the house of her brother-in-law the Duke of Clarence in London, while her mother Anne Beauchamp, Warwick&#x27;s wife, sought sanctuary in Beaulieu Abbey. When the crisis settled down and the Countess wished to be restored to her estates, Edward IV refused her safe conduct to plead her case; she wrote to Queen Elizabeth and several others to no avail.

Anne, now widowed, became the subject of some dispute between George of Clarence and his brother Richard of Gloucester, who still wanted to marry her. Anne Neville and her sister, the Duchess of Clarence, were heiresses to their parents&#x27; vast estates. Clarence, anxious to secure the entire inheritance, treated her as his ward and opposed her getting married, which would strengthen her position to claim a share.

There are various accounts of what happened subsequently, including the story that Clarence hid her in a London cookshop, disguised as a servant, so that his brother would not know where she was. Gloucester is said to have tracked her down and escorted her to sanctuary at the Church of St Martin&#x27;s le Grand. In order to win the final consent of his brother George to the marriage, Richard of Gloucester renounced most of Warwick&#x27;s land and property, including the earldoms of Warwick (which the earl had held in his wife&#x27;s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.

==Duchess of Gloucester==
The exact date of the wedding of Anne Neville and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is not known, although most sources agree that a ceremony took place sometime in the late spring/early summer of 1472 in St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel in the Palace of Westminster, after a dispensation to marry was issued from Rome on 22 April 1472. This dispensed the impediment of affinity created when Anne married Edward of Lancaster, who was Richard&#x27;s blood cousin. The couple made their marital home in the familiar surroundings of Middleham Castle, Yorkshire, after Richard was appointed Governor of the North on the king&#x27;s behalf. Upon her marriage, Anne was styled Duchess of Gloucester. They had only one child, Edward, born at Middleham allegedly sometime in 1473, but more probably in 1476. Anne&#x27;s mother, the Countess of Warwick, joined her daughter&#x27;s household in 1473 after Richard obtained the king&#x27;s permission to release his mother-in-law from her guarded sanctuary.

In 1478, Anne Neville inherited the Lordship of Glamorgan. The title had been held by her father and on his death had passed to Anne&#x27;s elder sister Isabel Neville. Women could not exercise the Lordship in their own right, so the title immediately transferred to Isabel&#x27;s husband, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. On his death in February 1478, the title passed to Anne and was henceforth exercised by her husband, Richard of Gloucester until his death, when it passed to the new king, Henry VII.

==Queen of England==
On 9 April 1483, Edward IV died and Anne&#x27;s husband Richard was named Lord Protector for his 12-year-old nephew Edward V. But on 25 June 1483, Edward V and his siblings were declared illegitimate and Richard ascended the throne as King Richard III. Anne Neville was crowned alongside her husband on 6 July 1483 by Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, the first joint coronation in England in 175 years. The queen&#x27;s train was borne by Margaret, Countess of Richmond, whose son would become Henry VII after defeating Richard at the Battle of Bosworth. Almost the entire peerage of England was present at what was a magnificent spectacle. Richard and Anne&#x27;s son, Edward of Middleham, was created Prince of Wales in York Minster on 8 September 1483 following their Royal Progress across England.

Anne was on good terms with her mother-in-law Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, with whom she discussed religious works, such as the writings of Mechtilde of Hackeborn.

Edward of Middleham died suddenly in April 1484 at Middleham Castle, while his parents were in Nottingham on their way to visit him. Both Richard and Anne were overwhelmed with grief at this news. Anne was particularly heartbroken, and she fell gravely ill only a few months later.

After the death of her son, Anne Neville effectively adopted her nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick. After Anne Neville died, Richard may have named another nephew, John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, as his heir presumptive.

== Death ==
Anne Neville died on 16 March 1485, probably of tuberculosis, at Westminster. The day she died, there was an eclipse, which some took to be an omen of her husband&#x27;s fall from heavenly grace. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave to the right of the High Altar, next to the door to the Confessor&#x27;s Chapel. Richard III is said to have wept at her funeral. Nevertheless, rumours circulated that Richard III had poisoned her in order to marry his niece Elizabeth of York.

Richard sent Elizabeth away from court to Sheriff Hutton and publicly rebutted these rumours on 30 March 1485 during an assembly of Lords he had summoned at the Hospital of St. John. Addressing them &quot;in a loud and distinct voice&quot;, he &quot;showed his grief and displeasure aforesaid and said it never came into his thought or mind to marry in such manner wise, nor willing nor glad of the death of his queen but as sorry and in heart as heavy as man might be …&quot;. There is no reason to doubt that Richard&#x27;s grief over his wife&#x27;s death was genuine. Documents later found in the Portuguese royal archives show that after Anne&#x27;s death, Richard&#x27;s ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese king&#x27;s sister Joanna (who was of Lancastrian descent), and Elizabeth of York and Joanna&#x27;s cousin Duke Manuel (the future Manuel I).

There was no memorial to Queen Anne until 1960, when a bronze tablet was erected on a wall near her grave by the Richard III Society.
