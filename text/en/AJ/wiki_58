<text>Leptis or Lepcis Magna, also known by other names in antiquity, was a prominent city of the Carthaginian Empire and Roman Libya at the mouth of the Wadi Lebda in the Mediterranean.

Established as a Punic settlement prior to 500 BC, the city experienced significant expansion under Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (), who was born in the city. The 3rd Augustan Legion was stationed here to defend the city against Berber incursions. After the legion&#x27;s dissolution under in 238, the city was increasingly open to raids in the later part of the 3rd century. Diocletian reinstated the city as provincial capital, and it grew again in prosperity until it fell to the Vandals in 439. It was reincorporated into the Eastern Empire in 533 but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the Muslim invasion in and was subsequently abandoned.

After being abandoned, the city was remarkably preserved as it lay buried beneath layers of sand dunes. In the 1920s, the city was unearthed by Italian archaeologists during Italy&#x27;s occupation of Libya. Its ruins are within present-day Khoms, Libya, east of Tripoli. They are among the best-preserved Roman sites in the Mediterranean.

==Names==
The Punic name of the settlement was written () or (). This has been tentatively connected to the Semitic root (present in Arabic) , meaning &quot;to build&quot; or &quot;to piece together&quot;, presumably in reference to the construction of the city.

This name was hellenized as &quot;Léptis&quot; (), also known as &quot;Léptis Megálē&quot; (, &quot;Greater Leptis&quot;) distinguishing it from the &quot;Lesser Leptis&quot; closer to Carthage in modern-day Tunisia. It was also known by the Greeks as &quot;Neápolis&quot; (, &quot;New Town&quot;). The latinization of these names was Lepcis or Leptis Magna (&quot;Greater Leptis&quot;), which also appeared as the &quot;Leptimagnese City&quot; (). The Latin demonym was &quot;Leptitan&quot; (). It was also known as &quot;UlpiaTraiana&quot; as a Roman colony, after Emperor Trajan of the Ulpia gens. Its Italian name is &quot;LeptiMaggiore&quot;, and in Arabic it is named &quot;Labdah&quot; ().

== History ==
===Punics===
The Punic city was founded in the second half of the 7th centuryBC. Little is known about Leptis during this time, but it appears to have been powerful enough to repel Dorieus&#x27;s attempt to establish a Greek colony nearby around 515BC. Like most Punic settlements, Leptis became part of the Carthaginian Empire and fell under Rome&#x27;s control with Carthage&#x27;s defeat in the Punic Wars. Leptis remained highly independent for a period after about 111BC.

===Roman Republic===
The Roman Republic sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. The city prospered and was even allowed to coin its own money in silver and bronze. Reflecting its blend of cultures, its coins bore Punic inscriptions but images of Hercules and Dionysus. Soon Italian merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior. The city depended primarily on the fertility of its surrounding farmland, where many olive-presses have been excavated. By 46BC, its olive oil production was of such an extent that the city was able to provide three million pounds of oil annually to Julius Caesar as tax.

===Roman Empire===

Kenneth D. Matthews Jr. writes:


Leptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post. The city grew rapidly under Roman administration. During the reign of Nero, an amphitheater was constructed. The settlement was elevated to &quot;municipium&quot; in AD 64 or 65 and to &quot;colonia&quot; under Trajan (). The first known bishop of Leptis Magna was a certain priest called Victor who became pope in 189.

Leptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in AD193, as the hometown of emperor Septimius Severus. Septimius favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In AD205, he and the imperial family visited the city and bestowed great honors. Among the changes that Severus introduced were the creation of a magnificent new forum and the rebuilding of the docks. The natural harbor had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used.

Leptis prospered through trans-Saharan trade in various valuable goods, including ivory, wild animals for the gladiatorial arena, gold dust, carbuncle, precious woods like ebony, and ostrich feathers.

Leptis overextended itself during this period. During the Crisis of the 3rd Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna&#x27;s importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the 365 tsunami, large parts of the city had been abandoned. Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus, who demanded bribes to protect the city during a major tribal raid. The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian I. Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished &quot;for bringing false accusations&quot;. It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I.

===Vandal Kingdom===
In 439, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city&#x27;s walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in AD523 when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city.

===Byzantine Empire===
Belisarius, general of Emperor Justinian I, recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of the Roman Empire ten years later, and in 533–4 it was re-incorporated into the empire. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Empire, but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. In 544, under the prefecture of Sergius, the city came under intensified attack of Berber tribes, and after some successes, Sergius was reduced to retreating into the city, with the Leuathae tribal confederation camped outside the gate demanding payments. Sergius admitted eighty deputies into the city to present their demands, but when Sergius moved to leave the conference he was detained by the robe by one deputy and crowded by others. This provoked an officer of the prefect&#x27;s guard to kill the deputy laying hands on the prefect, which resulted in a general massacre. The Berbers reacted with an all-out attack and Sergius was eventually forced to abandon Leptis and retreat to Carthage.

===Islamic conquest===
By the 6th century, the city was fully Christianized. During the decade 565–578 AD, Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the Berber tribes as far south as the Fezzan in the Libyan desert and converted the Garamantes. Numerous new churches were built in the 6th century, but the city continued to decline, and by the time of the Arab conquest around 647 the city was mostly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force and a population of less than 1,000 inhabitants. By the 10th century, the city of Al-Khums had fully absorbed it.

===Excavation===
Today, the site of Leptis Magna is the site of some of the most impressive ruins of the Roman period.
Part of an ancient temple was brought from Leptis Magna to the British Museum in 1816 and installed at the Fort Belvedere royal residence in England in 1826. It now lies in part of Windsor Great Park. The ruins are located between the south shore of Virginia Water and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.

When Italians conquered Italian Libya in the early 20th century, they dedicated huge efforts to the rediscovery of Leptis Magna. In the early 1930s, Italian archeological research was able to show again the buried remains of nearly all the city. A 4th to 3rd centuryBC necropolis was found under the Roman theatre.

In June 2005, it was revealed that archaeologists from the University of Hamburg had been working along the coast of Libya when they uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century. The mosaics show with exceptional clarity depictions of a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue and staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a &quot;balneae&quot; within a Roman villa at Wadi Lebda in Leptis Magna. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of representational mosaic art ever seen—a &quot;masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii.&quot; The mosaics were originally discovered in the year 2000 but were kept secret in order to avoid looting. They are currently on display in the Leptis Magna Museum.

There were reports that Leptis Magna was used as a cover for tanks and military vehicles by pro-Gaddafi forces during the First Libyan Civil War in 2011. When asked if the historic site could be targeted in an airstrike, NATO refused to rule out the possibility of such an action, saying that it had not been able to confirm the rebels&#x27; report that weapons were being hidden at the location. Shortly after the war, Libyan archaeologist Hafed Walda reported that Leptis Magna, along with nearby Rasaimergib Fort and the western Tripolis of Sabratha, had &quot;so far seen no visible loss&quot; from either fighting on the ground or bombings conducted by international forces.

In the midst of the Second Libyan Civil War and the disappearance of governmental and international support for the site, people living in the area organized to voluntarily protect and maintain Leptis Magna.

==Climate change==

Since they are located on the coast, Leptis Magna ruins are vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included them in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4°C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5°C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~ with a range of ) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Leptis Magna ruins are threatened by rising water levels, unless they can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.

<text>Jack Jones (24 November 1884 – 7 May 1970) was a Welsh miner, Trade Union official, politician, novelist and playwright.

==Background==
Jack Jones was born in 1884 at Tai-Harri-Blawdd in Merthyr Tydfil, the eldest of nine surviving children of David Jones, a coal miner, and his wife Sarah Ann. He was educated at St David’s Elementary School, Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan. He married Laura Grimes Evans in 1908. They had four sons (two died young) and one daughter.

==Career==
In 1896 he joined his father to work in the mines aged 12. In 1901 at the age of 17 he joined the army and was posted to South Africa with his regiment the Militia Battalion of the Welch. However he was very unhappy there and ended up deserting. Once recaptured, he was transferred to India. When he eventually returned to Wales he went back to working in the coal mines. In 1914 Jones was summoned back to his regiment and sent to the front lines in France and later on Belgium. After suffering shrapnel wounds he was invalided home and appointed as recruiting officer for Merthyr Tydfil. He became honorary secretary of his local miners lodge. In 1923 he was appointed as the full-time secretary-representative of the miners at Blaengarw. In 1926 during the General Strike as part of his job as a miners agent, he travelled around South Wales urging miners to continue supporting the strike. In 1927 he resigned from his full-time post with the miners union. In early 1928 he was employed by Liberal Party headquarters as a speaker. He continued in this job until 1930. By 1934 he had started to earn a living as a writer. He went on two lecture tours in America and the European battlefronts during the Second World War (1939-1945).

==Politics==
In 1920 Jones became a member of the Communist Party. He attended a convention in Manchester on behalf of his local miners lodge with the purpose of establishing the party; at this meeting he was chosen to be Corresponding Secretary for the South Wales Region. He later founded a branch at Merthyr Tydfil. In 1923 he left the Communist Party and joined the Labour Party. He undertook a number of speaking engagements for the party including speaking in support of Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald at Aberavon. In 1927 he produced his first article for the press entitled &quot;The Need for a Lib-Lab Coalition&quot;. He was becoming disenchanted with the Labour party and its support for nationalisation. He was drawn to support the Liberal Party through its new policies on coal and power. and had joined by the beginning of 1928. Liberal leader David Lloyd George who had been impressed by his rhetoric, recruited him to the Liberal headquarters speaking staff. He travelled around Britain speaking in support of the Liberal party&#x27;s new industrial policies. In May 1928 he was selected by Neath Liberal Association to be their prospective parliamentary candidate. Neath was a safe Labour seat that the Liberals last won in 1918; at the last election in 1924 the Liberals had not run a candidate. He stood as Liberal candidate for Neath at the 1929 General Election and polled nearly 30%;


He did not stand for parliament again. He was retained by Liberal headquarters as a speaker for another 12 months after the election. During the 1930s he made another political change and was a speaker for Oswald Mosley&#x27;s New Party. In the 1945 election he supported &#x27;National&#x27; candidate Sir James Grigg.

==Writing career==
During his 20s Jack Jones began to educate himself and develop his love of the theatre and writing, often taking part in local dramatic productions. In 1926 he successfully entered a short play he had written entitled &quot;Dad&#x27;s Double&quot; into a competition in Manchester.
He began writing seriously during a period of unemployment. His first novel, &quot;Saran&quot;, was never published, but a reduced version of it appeared as &quot;Black Parade&quot; (1935). By 1939, he had written the novels &quot;Rhondda Roundabout&quot; (1934), and &quot;Bidden to the Feast&quot; (1938), a play, &quot;Land of my Fathers&quot; (1937), and his first autobiography, &quot;Unfinished Journey&quot; (1937). The London stage version of Rhondda Roundabout was acclaimed. He wrote the dialogue for the film &quot;The Proud Valley&quot;, in which he also had a minor acting role. During the Second World War he was a speaker for the Ministry of Information and the National Savings Movement. He wrote &quot;The Man David&quot; (1944), a life of David Lloyd George.

After the war he wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Me and Mine&quot; (1946) and &quot;Give Me Back My Heart&quot; (1950), three novels, &quot;Off to Philadelphia in the Morning&quot; (1947) made into a BBC drama of the same name in 1978, &quot;Some Trust in Chariots&quot; (1948), and &quot;River Out of Eden&quot; (1951), and a play &quot;Transatlantic Episode&quot; (1947). His later works, &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; and &quot;Lucky Year&quot; (1952), &quot;Time and the Business&quot; (1953), &quot;Choral Symphony&quot; (1955) and &quot;Come, Night; End, Day&quot; (1956) were less well received. In 1954, he married his second wife, Gladys Morgan. He was elected first President of the English section of Yr Academi Gymreig. Until his death in May 1970 he continued writing; these works remained unpublished, including a biographical novel, &quot;A Burnt Offering&quot;, based on the life of Dr William Price (1800–1893), Llantrisant, pioneer of cremation.

==Honours==
In 1948 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the community and to literature. In February 1970 he won an award from the Arts Council of Wales for `his distinguished contribution to the literature of Wales&#x27;. Jack Jones died on 7 May 1970.

<doc id="48701" wikidata="Q294435" url="?curid=48701" title="Thomas Cromwell">
<text>Thomas Cromwell (; 1485 – 28 July 1540) was an English statesman and lawyer who served as chief minister to King Henry VIII from 1534 to 1540, when he was beheaded on orders of the king, who later blamed false charges for the execution.

Cromwell was one of the most powerful proponents of the English Reformation. As the king&#x27;s chief secretary, he instituted new administrative procedures that transformed the workings of government. He helped to engineer an annulment of the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that Henry could lawfully marry Anne Boleyn. Henry failed to obtain the approval of Pope Clement VII for the annulment in 1533, so Parliament endorsed the king&#x27;s claim to be Supreme Head of the Church of England, giving him the authority to annul his own marriage. Cromwell subsequently charted an evangelical and reformist course for the Church of England from the unique posts of Vicegerent in Spirituals and Vicar-general (the two titles refer to the same position).

During his rise to power as Baron Cromwell, he made many enemies, including Anne Boleyn, with his fresh ideas and lack of inherited nobility. He duly played a prominent role in her downfall. He fell from power in 1540, despite being created Earl of Essex that year, after arranging the King&#x27;s marriage to the German princess Anne of Cleves. The marriage was a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later. Cromwell was arraigned under an act of attainder (32 Hen. 8. c. &quot;62&quot;) and was executed for treason and heresy on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540. The King later expressed regret at the loss of his chief minister and his reign never recovered from the incident.

==Family background and early life==
===Putney===
Thomas Cromwell is thought to have been born by or around 1485 in Putney, then a village in Surrey providing a ferry service across the Thames upstream from London. His grandfather, John, had moved to the area from Nottinghamshire to run a fulling mill (for wool processing) leased to him by the archbishop of Canterbury, who had a mansion further upstream at Mortlake and was lord of the local manor of Wimbledon. His father, Walter (), was an ambitious yeoman landowner who plied various trades, operating as a sheep farmer and wool processor (&quot;fuller&quot; and &quot;shearman&quot;), while also running a tavern and a brewery. A popular tradition that he was also a blacksmith is plausible, although the association could have arisen from his use of the alternative surname of &quot;Smith&quot; (as in &quot;Cromwell alias Smyth&quot;). As a successful tradesman, Cromwell&#x27;s father was regularly called upon for jury service and was elected Constable of Putney in 1495. He had frequent brushes with the law himself in the local manorial court, often on relatively minor matters, but also for assault and, ultimately, in 1514, for &quot;falsely and fraudulently&quot; removing evidence from the court roll regarding his manorial tenancy, a judgement that led to confiscation of all his accumulated lands.

Little is known about Cromwell&#x27;s mother, even though she came from a recognised gentry family, the Meverells of Staffordshire. Generally referred to as &quot;Katherine Meverell&quot;, her first name is uncertain. She married Cromwell&#x27;s father in 1474 while living in Putney in the house of a local attorney, John Welbeck.

Cromwell is assumed to have been the youngest of three children. He had two sisters: the elder, Katherine, married Morgan Williams, a Welsh lawyer&#x27;s son who came to Putney as a follower of King Henry VII when he established himself in the nearby Richmond Palace; the younger, Elizabeth, married William Wellyfed, a sheep farmer. Katherine and Morgan&#x27;s son, Richard, was employed in his uncle&#x27;s service and by the autumn of 1529 had changed his name to Cromwell. Richard was the great-grandfather of Oliver Cromwell.

No record survives of Cromwell&#x27;s childhood days in Putney, and it is unknown whether he was ever sent to school or had to serve an apprenticeship. Various people from Putney crop up in his adult life, and he maintained close relations with his two sisters and their extended families.

===Early life===
====France, Italy and the Low Countries====
Cromwell acknowledged to Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he had been a &quot;ruffian ... in his young days&quot;. Around the turn of the century, for reasons which remain unclear, he left his family in Putney and crossed the Channel to continental Europe, allegedly after spending some time in prison. Accounts of his activities in France, Italy and the Low Countries are problematic. The tradition that he quickly became a mercenary and marched with the French army to Italy, where in 1503 he fought in the Battle of Garigliano, stems from a novella by the contemporary Italian writer Matteo Bandello in which Cromwell is portrayed as a page to a foot-soldier, carrying his pike and helmet. This account was treated as fact by many later writers, including John Foxe in his &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; of 1563. Despite the obvious exaggerations contained in Bandello&#x27;s novella, MacCulloch points out that the &quot;picaresque&quot; narrative provides the best available clues to shine some light on the obscurity of Cromwell&#x27;s first Italian trip.

While in Italy, Cromwell seems to have entered service in the household of the Frescobaldi family of Florentine bankers (Bandello has an implausibly young Francesco Frescobaldi graciously saving him from starvation on the streets of Florence). It appears that he later worked as a cloth merchant in the Low Countries, where his frequentation of English Merchant Adventurers allowed him to develop useful contacts and gain familiarity with several languages. Cromwell, who was known to have a prodigious memory, was probably already fluent in French and Italian, as well as being proficient in Latin, with some knowledge also of Ancient Greek.

====Return to Italy====
At some point Cromwell returned to Italy: the records of the English Hospital in Rome indicate that he stayed there in June 1514, while documents in the Vatican Archives suggest that he was an agent for the Archbishop of York, Cardinal Christopher Bainbridge, and handled English ecclesiastical issues before the Roman Rota.

In 1517–1518, he travelled to Rome again, this time to gain Pope Leo X&#x27;s approval for plenary indulgences to be sold by the St Mary&#x27;s Guild, Boston as part of a thriving trade. During this lengthy trip, Cromwell studied in detail Erasmus&#x27;s new edition of the gospels. His reading made him, for the first time, doubt the legitimacy of the practice he was advocating. Tracy Borman has suggested that it was at this point Cromwell developed his contempt for the papacy, because of the ease with which he had been able to manipulate the pope into granting the Boston petition without due consideration.

==Marriage and issue==
At one point during these years, Cromwell returned to England, where around 1515 he married Elizabeth Wyckes (d. 1529). She was the widow of Thomas Williams, a Yeoman of the Guard, and the daughter of a Putney , Henry Wyckes, who had later served as a gentleman usher to King Henry VII. 
The couple had three children:
* Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell (–1551), who became Elizabeth Seymour&#x27;s second husband.
* Anne Cromwell (1522 – October 1529)
* Grace Cromwell (1527 – October 1529)

Cromwell&#x27;s wife died in 1529 and his daughters, Anne and Grace, are believed to have died not long after their mother. Their death may have been due to sweating sickness. Provisions made for Anne and Grace in Cromwell&#x27;s will, dated 12 July 1529, were crossed out at some later date. Gregory outlived his father by only 11 years, succumbing to sweating sickness in 1551.

Cromwell also had an illegitimate daughter, Jane (–1580), whose early life is a complete mystery. According to novelist Hilary Mantel, &quot;Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter, and beyond the fact that she existed, we know very little about her. She comes briefly into the records, in an incredibly obscure way—she&#x27;s in the archives of the county of Chester.&quot; Jane was born to an unknown mother during the time Cromwell was mourning the loss of his wife and daughters. Jane presumably was educated and resided in Cromwell&#x27;s homes, but in 1539, Margaret Vernon, the worldly Prioress of Little Marlow Priory (who had also helped to raise Gregory Cromwell) suggested she take Jane to begin her education away from home. In that same year Jane&#x27;s half-brother Gregory (at age nineteen) and his wife Elizabeth moved into Leeds Castle, Kent, in preparation for Gregory&#x27;s election as a knight of the shire (Member of Parliament) for the county. Jane, then nine years of age, accompanied him. Cromwell&#x27;s records show him paying Elizabeth for clothing and expenses for Jane. It is unknown what became of Jane&#x27;s mother, though historian Caroline Angus argues that Jane&#x27;s mother was Elizabeth Gregory, a former household servant who was left a surprisingly large amount of money and items in Cromwell&#x27;s will. Elizabeth Gregory was listed among family members in the will, despite not being any relation to the Cromwell, Williams, Wyckes or Williamson families. Cromwell was known to be one of the few men at court without mistresses and tried to keep this indiscretion secret.

Jane married William Hough (–1585), of Leighton in the Wirral Hundred, around 1550. William Hough was the son of Richard Hough (1505–1574) who was Cromwell&#x27;s agent in Chester from 1534 to 1540. Jane and her husband remained staunch Roman Catholics, who, together with their daughter, Alice, her husband, William Whitmore, and their children, all came to the attention of the authorities as recusants during the reign of Elizabeth I.

==Lawyer, Member of Parliament, adviser to Wolsey==

By 1520, Cromwell was firmly established in London mercantile and legal circles. In 1523, he obtained a seat in the House of Commons as a burgess, though the constituency he represented has not been identified with certainty. He prepared a daring speech against King Henry&#x27;s declared intention of leading an invasion of France, although it was expressed tactfully in terms of concern for the King&#x27;s safety while on campaign and fear of the costs such an overbold policy would entail; it was the latter point that embodied Cromwell&#x27;s true concern. There is no record of when Cromwell actually delivered the speech in the chamber and some modern historians, including Michael Everett and Robert Woods, have suggested that the whole episode was no more than a ploy, sanctioned by Henry himself, to allow him to withdraw graciously from his rash threat of war.

After Parliament had been dissolved, Cromwell wrote a letter to a friend, jesting about the session&#x27;s lack of productivity:I amongst other have indured a parlyament which contenwid by the space of xvii hole wekes wher we communyd of warre pease Stryffe contencyon debatte murmure grudge Riches poverte penurye trowth falshode Justyce equyte dicayte [deceit] opprescyon Magnanymyte actyvyte foce [force] attempraunce [moderation] Treason murder Felonye consyli... [conciliation] and also how a commune welth myght be ediffyed and a[lso] contenewid within our Realme. Howbeyt in conclusyon we have d[one] as our predecessors have been wont to doo that ys to say, as well we myght and lefte wher we begann.

For a short while early in 1523 Cromwell became an adviser to Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, drafting a parliamentary bill to relieve his sponsor of taxation on some property in Cumberland. Although the bill was not introduced in the 1523 session of Parliament, this may indicate that the unidentified seat for which Cromwell was returned in that year was Carlisle, Cumberland, to present the Marquess&#x27;s bill. Early in 1524 he became a member of the household of Lord Chancellor Cardinal Thomas Wolsey although, initially, he maintained his private legal practice; in that year he was elected a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn, a lawyers&#x27; guild. Cromwell assisted in the dissolution of nearly thirty monasteries to raise funds for Wolsey to found The King&#x27;s School, Ipswich (1528), and Cardinal College, in Oxford (1529). In 1529 Wolsey appointed Cromwell a member of his council, as one of his most senior and trusted advisers. By the end of October of that year, however, Wolsey had fallen from power. Cromwell had made enemies by aiding Wolsey to suppress the monasteries, but was determined not to fall with his master, as he told George Cavendish, then a Gentleman Usher and later Wolsey&#x27;s biographer:I do entend (god wyllyng) this after none, whan my lord hathe dyned to ride to london and so to the Court, where I wyll other make or marre, or ere [before] I come agayn, I wyll put my self in the prese [press] to se what any man is Able to lay to my charge of ontrouthe or mysdemeanor.

Cavendish acknowledges that Cromwell&#x27;s moves to mend the situation were by means of engaging himself in an energetic defence of Wolsey (&quot;There could nothing be spoken against my lord... but he [Cromwell] would answer it incontinent[ly]&quot;), rather than by distancing himself from his old master&#x27;s actions, and this display of &quot;authentic loyalty&quot; only enhanced his reputation, not least in the mind of the King.

==Royal favourite==
Cromwell successfully overcame the shadow cast over his career by Wolsey&#x27;s downfall. By November 1529, he had secured a seat in Parliament as a member for Taunton and was reported to be in favour with the King. Early in this short session of Parliament (November to December 1529) Cromwell involved himself with legislation to restrict absentee clergy from collecting stipends from multiple parishes (&quot;clerical farming&quot;) and to abolish the power of Rome to award dispensations for the practice.

At some point during the closing weeks of 1530, the King appointed him to the Privy Council. Cromwell held numerous offices during his career in the King&#x27;s service, including:

* Commissioner for the Subsidy, London 1524, Kent 1534, for printing of the Bible 1539, for sale of crown lands 1539, 1540

* Lord Great Chamberlain, 17 April 1540

Cromwell also possessed numerous other minor offices.

===Anne Boleyn===
From 1527, Henry VIII sought to have his marriage to Queen Catherine of Aragon annulled, so that he could lawfully marry Anne Boleyn. At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king&#x27;s legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with Thomas Audley, and had joined the inner circle of the council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.

The third session of what is now known as the Reformation Parliament had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of Henry&#x27;s indecision as to the best way to proceed towards his annulment. Cromwell favoured the assertion of royal supremacy over the recalcitrant Church, and he manipulated support in the House of Commons for the measure by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier, in the session of 1529. Once he achieved his goal of managing affairs in Parliament, he never relinquished it. In March 1532, speaking without royal permission, he urged the House of Commons to draw up a list of clerical abuses in need of reform. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the King, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as &quot;the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender&quot; of the Church. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was prorogued. Two days later, Sir Thomas More resigned as Lord Chancellor, realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More&#x27;s resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.
The King&#x27;s gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of the manor of Romney in the Welsh Marches (recently confiscated from the family of the executed Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham) and appointment to three relatively minor offices: Master of the Jewels on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the Hanaper on 16 July, and Chancellor of the Exchequer on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.
Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that may have taken place in Calais.

On 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor and his replacement as Speaker of the House of Commons was Cromwell&#x27;s old friend (and former lawyer to Cardinal Wolsey) Humphrey Wingfield. Cromwell further increased his control over parliament through his management of by-elections: since the previous summer, assisted by Thomas Wriothesley, then Clerk of the Signet, he had prepared a list of suitably amenable &quot;burgesses, knights and citizens&quot; for the vacant parliamentary seats.

The parliamentary session began on 4 February 1533, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome, reasserting the long-standing contention that England was an &quot;empire&quot; and thus not subject to external jurisdiction. On 30 March, Thomas Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and Convocation immediately declared the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell&#x27;s bill into law, as the Ecclesiastical Appeals Act 1532 (24 Hen. 8. c. 12), ensuring that any adjudication concerning the King&#x27;s marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King formal notice that the validity of his marriage to Catherine was to be the subject of an ecclesiastical court hearing. The trial began on 10 May 1533 at Dunstable Priory (near to where Catherine was staying at Ampthill Castle) and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced the court&#x27;s verdict, declaring the marriage &quot;null and invalid…contrary to the law of God&quot;. Five days later he pronounced the King&#x27;s marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.

In December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy. The minister organised a campaign throughout the nation, attacking the Pope in sermons, pamphlets and plays mounted in parish churches. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell&#x27;s supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England&#x27;s remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s verdict took statutory form as the Succession to the Crown Act 1533 (25 Hen. 8. c. 22), the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533 (25 Hen. 8. c. 21) reiterated royal supremacy and the Submission of the Clergy Act 1533 (25 Hen. 8. c. 19) incorporated into law the clergy&#x27;s surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.

==King&#x27;s chief minister==
In April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession: all the King&#x27;s subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King&#x27;s new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later. On 7 May Cromwell led a deputation from the commissioners to Fisher and More, to persuade them to accept the Act and save themselves. This failed and, within a month, both prisoners were executed.

On 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear their acceptance of the Oath of Succession. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy 1534 (26 Hen. 8. c. 1) also clarified the King&#x27;s position as head of the church and the First Fruits and Tenths Act 1534 (26 Hen. 8. c. 3) substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church.

During November 1534, another provision of the Act of Succession was in preparation: the appointment of three &quot;vicegerentes&quot; to supervise all ecclesiastical institutions. When the measure was put into effect on 21 January 1535, however, only one name remained: that of Cromwell. The King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and issued a warrant to authorise a visitation of all the country&#x27;s churches, monasteries and clergy. Neville Williams explains that as Vicegerent in spiritual affairs, Cromwell held sway over church doctrine and religious policy, while from the Vicar General title, he drew his authority over monasteries and other church institutions. By September 1535 Cromwell had appointed his own officials for church administration, with authority over the archbishops of Canterbury and York, to oversee all church affairs. He never declared that this visitation was ever complete, so he retained its extensive powers in his own hands. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to evaluate and tax church property more effectively.

A lasting achievement of Cromwell&#x27;s vicegerency was his direction of Autumn 1538 that every parish in the country should securely maintain a record of all christenings, marriages and burials. Although intended as a means to identify Anabaptists (dissenting religious refugees from the Low Countries and elsewhere who did not practise infant baptism) the measure proved to be of great benefit to the posterity of English historians.

===Fall of Anne Boleyn===

The final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (27 Hen. 8. c. 28), an act for the suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than £200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell&#x27;s strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King&#x27;s coffers.

Anne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her almoner, John Skypp, denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skypp&#x27;s diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skypp was called before the council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking &quot;the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth&quot; and inviting anarchy. Cromwell took no action against Skypp beyond the unsympathetic questioning, and he remained as the Queen&#x27;s almoner, attending her when she was awaiting execution in the Tower.

Anne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was becoming impatient, now enamoured of the young Jane Seymour and being encouraged by Anne&#x27;s enemies, particularly Sir Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with: Mark Smeaton, a musician of the royal household; Sir Henry Norris, the King&#x27;s groom of the stool and one of his closest friends; Sir Francis Weston; Sir William Brereton; and her brother, George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford. The Imperial Ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, wrote to Charles V that: he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress&#x27;s trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble... He set himself to devise and conspire the said affair. Regardless of the role Cromwell played in Anne Boleyn&#x27;s fall, and his confessed animosity to her, Chapuys&#x27;s letter states that Cromwell claimed that he was acting with the King&#x27;s authority. Some historians, such as Alison Weir and Susan Bordo, are convinced that her fall and execution were engineered by Cromwell, while others, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch and John Schofield, accept that the King instigated the process. Alexander Alesius, a theologian and associate of Cromwell, wrote that it had indeed been Cromwell who hinted to Henry of Anne&#x27;s infidelity, but the King had in turn instructed Cromwell to turn the rumours into proceedings.

The Queen and her brother stood trial on Monday 15 May, while the four others accused with them were condemned on the Friday beforehand. The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the Second Succession Act, securing the rights of Queen Jane&#x27;s heirs to the throne.

===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===


Cromwell&#x27;s position was now stronger than ever. He succeeded Anne Boleyn&#x27;s father, Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, as Lord Privy Seal on 2 July 1536, resigning the office of Master of the Rolls, which he had held since 8 October 1534. On 8 July 1536, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cromwell of Wimbledon.

===Religious reform===
Cromwell orchestrated the Dissolution of the Monasteries and visitations to the universities and colleges in 1535, which had strong links to the church. This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed &quot;popish&quot; and &quot;superstitious&quot;. This has been described as &quot;easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history&quot;. Oxford University was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley&#x27;s donation in 1602.

In July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop Edward Foxe tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the Ten Articles and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in Lincolnshire and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular uprisings of the laity, collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, found support among the gentry and even the nobility.

The rebels&#x27; grievances were wide-ranging, but the most significant was the suppression of the monasteries, blamed on the King&#x27;s &quot;evil counsellors&quot;, principally Cromwell and Cranmer. One of the leaders of the rebellion was Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy, who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning during his interrogation in the Tower: &quot;[…] men who have been in cases like with their prince as ye be now have come at the last to the same end that ye would now bring me unto.&quot;. The suppression of the risings spurred further Reformation measures. In February 1537, Cromwell convened a vicegerential synod of bishops and academics. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: &quot;The Institution of a Christian Man&quot;, more commonly known as the Bishops&#x27; Book. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell&#x27;s success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a Privy Council, a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the Order of the Garter on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.

In January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what the opponents of the old religion termed &quot;idolatry&quot;; statues, rood screens, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on &quot;pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions&quot; and commanding that &quot;one book of the whole Bible in English&quot; be set up in every church. Moreover, following the &quot;voluntary&quot; surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also &quot;invited&quot; to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.

====Resistance to further religious reform====
The King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, Sir Edward Neville, and Sir Nicholas Carew on charges of treason in November 1538 (the &quot;Exeter Conspiracy&quot;), using evidence acquired from Sir Geoffrey Pole under interrogation in the Tower. Sir Geoffrey, &quot;broken in spirit&quot;, was pardoned but the others were executed.

On 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of Miles Coverdale&#x27;s Great Bible. Then, Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell&#x27;s principal achievements, being the first authoritative version in English.

The King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the Duke of Norfolk presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of Six Articles shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.

===Anne of Cleves===

Henry&#x27;s third wife, Jane, died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future Edward VI. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell&#x27;s suggestion that he should marry Anne of Cleves, the sister of William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, partly on the basis of a portrait which Hans Holbein had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1540, the King met her at Rochester and was immediately repelled by her physically: &quot;I like her not!&quot;. The wedding ceremony, Archbishop Cranmer officiating, took place on 6 January in the Queen&#x27;s Closet at Greenwich Palace, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.

===Earl of Essex===
On 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the earldom of Essex and the senior court office of Lord Great Chamberlain. Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell&#x27;s tenure as the King&#x27;s chief minister was nearing its end. The King&#x27;s anger at being manoeuvered into marrying Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell&#x27;s conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, had been hoping for.

==Downfall and execution==
During 1536 Cromwell had proved himself an agile political survivor. The gradual movement towards Protestantism at home and the King&#x27;s ill-fated marriage to Anne of Cleves, which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that Hans Holbein the Younger was partly responsible for Cromwell&#x27;s downfall because he had shown the King a flattering portrait of Anne, which may have deceived him and that, when Henry finally met her, the King was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance. Cromwell had passed on to Henry some exaggerated claims of Anne&#x27;s beauty. However, Nicholas Wotton, one of the envoys sent to Cleves, considered Holbein&#x27;s portrait a good likeness; according to the depositions of witnesses assembled for Henry&#x27;s divorce hearing, it was this first disastrous meeting with Anne that caused him to dislike his fourth wife.

Henry VIII confided in Cromwell that he had been unable to consummate the union with Anne and he allowed Cromwell to impart this information to William FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Southampton who, as Lord High Admiral, had conveyed Anne from Calais. Back home at Austin Friars, and uncertain how to deal with this new problem, Cromwell also told Thomas Wriothesley, his principal secretary (who also served the King in various important positions). When Henry&#x27;s humiliation became common knowledge, Southampton (who was anxious to avoid the King&#x27;s displeasure for his part in bringing Anne to London), or possibly Wriothesley&#x27;s close friend Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, made sure that Cromwell was blamed for the indiscretion. Wriothesley, the bishop, and the Lord Admiral were erstwhile friends of Cromwell and their self-serving disloyalty indicated that the minister&#x27;s position was already known to be weakening.

A long-mooted Franco-Imperial alliance (contrary to England&#x27;s interests) had failed to materialise. The King had sent the Duke of Norfolk to the French king Francis I to offer Henry&#x27;s support in his unresolved dispute with Emperor Charles V, and the mission had been received favourably. This changed the balance of power in England&#x27;s favour and demonstrated that Cromwell&#x27;s earlier foreign policy of wooing support from the Duchy of Cleves had unnecessarily caused his king&#x27;s conjugal difficulty. Furthermore, the possibility of war was arising between the Duke of Cleves and Charles V and, if this materialised, Henry would be trapped by his new alliance with Cleves into declaring war on France, an unwelcome reversal of previous policy.

Early in 1540 Cromwell&#x27;s religiously conservative, aristocratic enemies, headed by the Duke of Norfolk and supported by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester (given the nickname &quot;Wily Winchester&quot; by polemical historian John Foxe for his mischievous counsels to the King) decided that the country&#x27;s trend towards &quot;doctrinal radicalism&quot; in religion, as expressed in a series of parliamentary debates held throughout that spring, had gone too far. They saw in Catherine Howard, Norfolk&#x27;s niece, &quot;considerately put in the King&#x27;s way by that pander, her uncle of Norfolk&quot;, an opportunity to displace their foe. Catherine&#x27;s assignations with the King were openly facilitated by the Duke and the Bishop and as she &quot;strode…towards the throne&quot; the two conspirators found themselves edging once more into political power. It would have been a simple matter for Cromwell to arrange an annulment of Henry&#x27;s marriage to the tractable Anne, but this would have put him in greater jeopardy as it would clear the way for Catherine to marry the King. At this point, however, cynical self-interest may have made Henry hesitate to act immediately against Cromwell, as the minister was guiding two important revenue bills (the Subsidy Bill—whereby Cromwell sought to extend the principle that taxation could be levied for general government purposes rather than a specified objective—and a bill to confiscate the assets of the Order of St John) through Parliament; Henry was anxious that any unpopularity caused by the measures would fall on Cromwell and not himself.

Cromwell was arrested at a Council meeting at Westminster on 10 June 1540 and accused of various charges. &quot;Cromwell may have been arrested for his promotion of religious reformation, but few could doubt that Henry was also punishing Cromwell for the humiliation of his latest marriage.&quot; His enemies took every opportunity to humiliate him: The Duke of Norfolk snatched the St George&#x27;s collar (insignia of the Order of the Garter) from Cromwell&#x27;s shoulders, saying: &quot;A traitor must not wear it&quot;, while the prisoner&#x27;s former friend Sir William Fitzwilliam, Earl of Southampton untied the ceremonial garter of the Order. His initial reaction was defiance: &quot;This then is my reward for faithful service!&quot; he cried out, and angrily defied his fellow councillors to call him a traitor. He was taken by barge to the Tower and imprisoned.

A bill of attainder containing a long list of indictments, including supporting Anabaptists, corrupt practices, leniency in matters of justice, acting for personal gain, protecting Protestants accused of heresy and thus failing to enforce the Act of Six Articles, and plotting to marry King Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary, was introduced into the House of Lords a week later. It was augmented with a further charge of sacramentarianism, for which the Six Articles allowed only the death penalty, two days after that. It passed on 29 June 1540.

All Cromwell&#x27;s honours were forfeited and it was publicly proclaimed that he could be called only &quot;Thomas Cromwell, cloth carder&quot;. The King deferred the execution until his marriage to Anne of Cleves could be annulled; Cromwell was being spared for the time being in case he was needed to give evidence of the King&#x27;s distaste for Anne. Anne, however, agreed to an amicable annulment (and was treated with great generosity by Henry as a result). Hoping for clemency, Cromwell wrote in support of the annulment, in his last personal address to the King. He ended the letter: &quot;Most gracious Prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy.&quot;

Cromwell was condemned to death without trial, lost all his titles and property and was publicly beheaded on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540, on the same day as the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Howard. Cromwell made a prayer and speech on the scaffold, professing to die &quot;in the traditional [Catholic] faith&quot; and denying that he had aided heretics. This was a necessary disavowal, to protect his family. The circumstances of his execution are a source of debate: while some accounts state that the executioner had great difficulty severing his head, others claim that this is and that it took only one blow. Afterwards, his head was set on a spike on London Bridge.

Edward Hall said of Cromwell&#x27;s downfall,

Many lamented but more rejoiced, and specially such as either had been religious men, or favoured religious persons; for they banqueted and triumphed together that night, many wishing that that day had been seven years before; and some fearing lest he should escape, although he were imprisoned, could not be merry. Others who knew nothing but truth by him both lamented him and heartily prayed for him. But this is true that of certain of the clergy he was detestably hated, &amp; specially of such as had borne swynge [beaten hard], and by his means was put from it; for in deed he was a man that in all his doings seemed not to favour any kind of Popery, nor could not abide the snoffyng pride of some prelates, which undoubtedly, whatsoever else was the cause of his death, did shorten his life and procured the end that he was brought unto.

Henry came to regret Cromwell&#x27;s killing and later accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell&#x27;s downfall by &quot;pretexts&quot; and &quot;false accusations&quot;; over important issues and policies, he had always been liable to be manoeuvred into a hasty decision by the intrigues of the factions within his court. On 3 March 1541, the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, reported in a letter that the King was now said to be lamenting that,

under pretext of some slight offences which he had committed, they had brought several accusations against him, on the strength of which he had put to death the most faithful servant he ever had.

There remains an element of what Geoffrey Elton describes as &quot;mystery&quot; about Cromwell&#x27;s demise. In April 1540, just three months before he went to the block, and less than two months before he was arrested, he was created Earl of Essex and Lord Great Chamberlain. The arbitrary and unpredictable streak in the King&#x27;s personality, which more than once exercised influence during his reign, had surfaced again and washed Cromwell away in its wake.

==Personal religious beliefs==
Although Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the Henrician Reformation was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.

In 1535, Cromwell succeeded in having clearly identified reformers, such as Hugh Latimer, Edward Foxe and Nicholas Shaxton, appointed to the episcopacy. He encouraged and supported the work of reformers, such as Robert Barnes; and he obtained the licence to publish the Matthew&#x27;s Bible, providing significant funding for the printing of this English translation of the Bible and sending one to every parish in England. By 1538, it was compulsory for all churches to own a Bible, in accordance with Cromwell&#x27;s injunctions. The revised version, the Great Bible, was widely available by 1539 and included a picture of Henry VIII, Thomas Cranmer and Cromwell on the title page.

When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, his alleged support for Anabaptism was cited. Although the charge was spurious, the fact that it was levelled at all demonstrates the reputation for evangelical sympathies Cromwell had developed.

==Historical significance==

Until the 1950s, historians discounted Cromwell&#x27;s role, stating he was little more than the agent of the despotic King Henry VIII. The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article (written by Albert Pollard) states &quot;his power has been overrated.&quot; Geoffrey Elton, however, in &quot;The Tudor Revolution&quot; (1953), featured him as the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government, the presiding genius, much more so than the King, in handling the break with Rome and in creating the laws and administrative procedures that reshaped post-Reformation England. Elton wrote that Cromwell had been responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms, creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of Church lands, and largely removing the medieval features of central government.

Subsequent historians have agreed with Elton as to Cromwell&#x27;s importance, though not with his claims of &quot;revolution&quot;. Leithead (2004) wrote, &quot;Against significant opposition he secured acceptance of the king&#x27;s new powers, created a more united and more easily governable kingdom, and provided the crown, at least temporarily, with a very significant landed endowment.&quot; Diarmaid MacCulloch credits the advancement of the most significant politicians and administrators of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, including William Cecil and Nicholas Bacon, to the influence and guidance of Thomas Cromwell at the start of their careers.

During Cromwell&#x27;s years in power, he skilfully managed Crown finances and extended royal authority. In 1536, he established the Court of Augmentations to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the Court of Wards and the Court of First Fruits and Tenths, owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the Council of the North, extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against enclosures, the promotion of English cloth exports and the poor relief legislation of 1536.

==Descendants==
Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s son Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, married Elizabeth Seymour, the sister of Queen Jane Seymour and widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred. They had five children:
* Henry Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell
* Edward Cromwell
* Thomas Cromwell
* Katherine Cromwell
* Frances Cromwell

Thomas Cromwell had an illegitimate daughter called Jane.

Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell was the great-grandson of Sir Richard Cromwell, Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s nephew.

==Hans Holbein portraits==
Thomas Cromwell was a patron of Hans Holbein the Younger, as were Thomas More and Anne Boleyn. In the New York Frick Collection, two portraits by Holbein hang facing each other on the same wall of the Study, one depicting Thomas Cromwell, the other Thomas More, Cromwell&#x27;s executed political and religious opponent. In 2023 the Book of Hours depicted in the Frick Collection portrait of Cromwell was put on display at Hever Castle, Kent.

==Fictional portrayals==

Cromwell has been portrayed in a number of plays, feature films, and television miniseries, usually as a villainous character. More recently, however, Hilary Mantel&#x27;s two Man Booker Prize-winning novels &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bring up the Bodies&quot; (2012), and the final volume in the trilogy, &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot; (2020), have shown Cromwell in a more sympathetic light. In the fiction, Cromwell is imbued with family affections, genuine respect for Cardinal Wolsey, zeal for the Reformation, and support for a limited degree of social reform, while the villainous character is Thomas More.

The television series &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2015) and its sequel &quot;Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light&quot; (2024) are based on Mantel&#x27;s novels. British actor Mark Rylance portrays Cromwell in both series, winning the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for the 2015 series.

<text>Rancid is an American punk rock band formed in Berkeley, California, in 1991. Founded by Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, former members of the band Operation Ivy, Rancid is often credited (alongside Green Day and the Offspring) as being among the wave of bands that revived mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States during the mid-1990s. Over its -year career, Rancid has retained much of its original fan-base, most of which was connected to its underground musical roots.

Rancid has had two lineup changes since its inception, with Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman being continuous members. Their current lineup consists of Armstrong on guitar and vocals, Freeman on bass and vocals, Lars Frederiksen on guitar and vocals, and Branden Steineckert on drums. The band was formed by Armstrong, Freeman, and former drummer Brett Reed, who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Steineckert. This lineup recorded their first album, with Frederiksen joining the band on their subsequent tour.

To date, Rancid has released ten studio albums, one split album, one compilation, two extended plays, and a series of live online-only albums, and has been featured on a number of compilation albums. The band has sold over four million records worldwide, making it one of the most successful punk rock groups of all time. The band rose to popularity in 1994 with its second studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, featuring the single &quot;Salvation&quot;. In the following year, Rancid released its highly successful album &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;, which produced its best-known songs &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;, &quot;Ruby Soho&quot;, and &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, and was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the United States alone. Its next six albums – &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; (1998), &quot;Rancid&quot; (2000), &quot;Indestructible&quot; (2003), &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot; (2009), &quot;...Honor Is All We Know&quot; (2014) and &quot;Trouble Maker&quot; (2017) – were also critically acclaimed, though not as commercially successful as &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;. The band released their tenth album, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, in 2023.

==History==

===Background and early history (1987–1993)===
Childhood friends Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman grew up together in Albany, California, a small, then–working-class community near Berkeley. The two had been playing together in the influential ska punk band Operation Ivy from 1987 to 1989. The band became popular in the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street, a club and concert venue featuring Bay Area punk bands. When Operation Ivy broke up, Armstrong and Freeman decided to form a new band, and formed a ska punk band called Downfall, which disbanded after a few months. They then started a hardcore punk band called Generator, which also disbanded shortly after. They also started the ska influenced Dance Hall Crashers, though they left the band shortly after it was formed. During this time, Armstrong was struggling with alcoholism, and to keep him focused on other interests, Freeman suggested they form a new band. In 1991, they recruited Armstrong&#x27;s roommate Brett Reed as their drummer and formed Rancid.

A few months after the band&#x27;s inception, Rancid began performing around the Berkeley area, and quickly developed a fan following. Rancid&#x27;s first recorded release was a 1992 EP for Operation Ivy&#x27;s old label Lookout! Records. Shortly after releasing the extended play, the band left Lookout! and was signed to Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s record label, Epitaph Records. Rancid released its self-titled debut album through Epitaph in 1993.

===Breakthrough success (1994–1996)===

While Rancid was writing for a follow-up album, Billie Joe Armstrong joined them to co-write the song &quot;Radio&quot;, which resulted in Armstrong playing a live performance with Rancid. Tim had previously asked Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid&#x27;s second guitarist, but he turned down the request initially as he was playing with the UK Subs at the time. After Billie Joe turned down the request, Frederiksen changed his mind and joined Rancid.

Frederiksen played with the band on its second studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; (1994). That year, its then-label-mates, the Offspring, experienced huge success with its album &quot;Smash&quot;. Rancid supported the Offspring&#x27;s 1994 tour, which helped &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; reach number 97 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Heatseekers and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, respectively. The album also provided its first widespread exposure when MTV broadcast the video for the single &quot;Salvation.&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; was certified gold on July 7, 2000, and with the success of the album, the band was pursued by a number of major record labels, including Madonna&#x27;s label Maverick Records. Many rumors circulated during this time period. Some of the rumors were Epitaph employees were not allowed to discuss matters with the press, Rancid convinced an A&amp;R man from Epic to shave a blue mohawk, and Madonna sent the band nude pictures of herself.

The band eventually decided to remain signed to Epitaph, and the next year released its third album &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; on August 22, 1995. The album quickly surpassed &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; in terms of success, and reached number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. on January 22, 1996, the album was certified gold. The album received positive reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as having &quot;classic moments of revivalist punk&quot;. Erlewine praised the music and claims the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t mark an isolationist retreat into didactic, defiantly underground punk rock&quot;. Three of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;, &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, and &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; all charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks, and earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. The band also performed &quot;Roots Radicals&quot; and &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

===Middle years (1997–2003)===

After two years of touring for &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;, Rancid returned to the studio in 1997 to begin recording its fourth studio album, &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;, which was released on June 30, 1998. The album branched out from Rancid&#x27;s previous musical styles, and combined punk rock with elements of roots reggae, rockabilly, dub, hip-hop, and funk, drawing comparisons to the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Sandinista!&quot;. Though the album did not achieve the success of &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;, but has since garnered a strong cult following in recent times. In 1999, Rancid decided to end its seven-year relationship with Epitaph and signed with Armstrong&#x27;s founded Hellcat Records (which is a sub-label of Epitaph).

A second self-titled album was released on August 1, 2000 and would be its first album released through Hellcat. The album failed to achieve the success of Rancid&#x27;s previous three albums and reached number 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. On the album, the group largely abandoned its ska-punk influences, recording a more hardcore-influenced album. The next year the band took part in the Vans Warped 2001 tour.

The three original members of Rancid released three songs under the name Devil&#x27;s Brigade in 2002, one on the &quot;Give &#x27;Em the Boot III&quot; compilation album, and two on a 12-inch vinyl record. In March of the same year, a split album with NOFX titled &quot;BYO Split Series Volume III&quot; was released, in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.

After a break from touring in 2001, Rancid returned to the studio with Gurewitz in 2002 to record its sixth studio album, &quot;Indestructible&quot;, which was released on August 19, 2003 and was their highest-charting album to date, reaching number 15. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Indestructible&quot; was distributed by not only Epitaph/Hellcat but major record label, Warner Bros. Records, a move that received some backlash from the band&#x27;s fans who questioned their loyalty to the independent scene. When released, the album didn&#x27;t feature the Warner logo anywhere on the packaging, a move to hide the major label move from fans. The album was warmly received by most critics however met with mixed reviews from fans, some of which felt the album contained a &quot;poppier&quot; sound (some accusing Warner of having an influence on the music) while others felt it was a mixture of &quot;..And Out Come the Wolves&quot; and &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;. The album&#x27;s music video for the first single, &quot;Fall Back Down&quot; was also met with some criticism from fans due to members of Good Charlotte and Kelly Osbourne making appearances.

===Hiatus (2004–2005)===

In 2004, after a tour for &quot;Indestructible&quot;, Rancid went on an extended hiatus. The band members worked with side projects, although it had not officially disbanded. Armstrong continued to play with his side project the Transplants, who released their second album, &quot;Haunted Cities&quot;, in 2005. He also contributed guitar and backing vocals on Cypress Hill&#x27;s song &quot;What&#x27;s Your Number?&quot; from its tenth album &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot;. Armstrong also released a solo album, &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Life&quot; in May 2007. Frederiksen continued working with his side-project Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards and released their second studio album, &quot;Viking&quot;, in 2004, the album was co-written and co-produced by Armstrong. Freeman briefly toured with Social Distortion in 2004 as John Maurer&#x27;s replacement until the band found its current bassist Brent Harding. Freeman and Frederiksen both had children during this time as well—Freeman had two, and Frederiksen had one.

===Reformation and &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot; (2006–2010)===

In early 2006, Rancid reformed to embark on a successful tour and played a number of acoustic performances as part of Hellcat Records&#x27; Hellcat Nights concert series at the Echo. It was the band&#x27;s first live performance since its hiatus. On April 13, 2006, Rancid announced plans for a worldwide tour beginning in July 2006, and the release of a DVD consisting of 31 of its music videos, as well as a tentative release date of Spring 2007 for a new as-yet-unnamed studio album.

Similar to a number of other bands signed to Lookout! Records, in September 2006, Rancid had taken its self-titled extended play from the label&#x27;s catalog.

On November 3, 2006, Reed left Rancid and was replaced by Branden Steineckert, formerly a member of the Used.

Rancid released a compilation album, &quot;B Sides and C Sides&quot;, on December 11, 2007. The album consists of various b-sides, &quot;c-sides&quot;, and songs from other compilations.

Rancid toured Japan in April 2008 for a number of shows following its two days headlining the Punkspring 2008 festival. Following the Japanese tour, Rancid embarked on a full tour of the United States during the summer and a tour of the United Kingdom in the winter.

Rancid used to host a one-hour once a week XM radio show. The show was called Rancid Radio and was on &quot;Fungus&quot; channel 53 Saturday at midnight. However, the show was canceled due to Fungus 53 being taken from XM&#x27;s programming.

Although plans for a follow-up to &quot;Indestructible&quot; had been mentioned during 2005, 2006 and 2007, it would not materialize until January 2008, when Rancid entered Skywalker Sound to record it. The resulting seventh studio album, &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot;, was released on June 2, 2009. In late May, the full album was streamed from the band&#x27;s MySpace page. It was Rancid&#x27;s first album without its &quot;classic&quot; lineup, with Branden Steineckert replacing Brett Reed on drums in 2006. The album was written at Branden&#x27;s Unknown Studios in Utah and was recorded at Skywalker Sound in Nicasio, California. Music legend Booker T. Jones performed organ on one song. A deluxe version of the album included the CD, some of the songs recorded acoustically on another CD, and a making of the album DVD. &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 11. Rancid toured North America in the summer of 2009 in support of &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot;, with Rise Against, Riverboat Gamblers, and Billy Talent as its opening bands. The tour began on June 4, 2009 in Vancouver, British Columbia and ended in Toronto, Ontario on July 31.

On June 10, 2009, the band appeared as the musical guest on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; playing &quot;Last One to Die&quot; from &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot;.

===&quot;...Honor Is All We Know&quot; (2011–2016)===

Rancid did a small US tour supporting Blink-182 from August 25 through September 4, 2011, to enable them to warm up before entering the studio in September 2011 to record their eighth album with Brett Gurewitz. A 2012 release date was expected. The band also mentioned that a 20th anniversary world tour would accompany the album. They were announced to headline one of the biggest punk festivals in the world, Groezrock in Belgium. Tim Armstrong stated that Rancid&#x27;s new album would arrive after the Transplants released their new one.

In March 2012, Rancid played some shows with Cock Sparrer. It was the 40th anniversary show for Cock Sparrer, and the 20th anniversary for Rancid. To accompany the shows, Pirates Press Records released a split 7-inch between the bands which featured &quot;East Bay Night&quot; from Rancid. As part of their 20th anniversary, they headlined the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool along with Public Image Limited, Social Distortion and Buzzcocks sharing headline slots, and on December 8, 2012 played in Birmingham along with Cock Sparrer as part of Rebellion Festival.

In December 2012, Rancid released their first new studio song in three years, titled &quot;Fuck You&quot;, which they made available for free download on their website. The song was included on &quot;Oi! This is Streetpunk, Volume Two&quot;, which was released on December 12, 2012.

In 2012, Rancid released &quot;Rancid Essentials&quot;, an online-exclusive massive box set celebrating the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary through Pirates Press Records. The box set features all of Rancid&#x27;s officially released albums and compilations including their debut self-titled EP from 1992 through 2009. 92 sides of music on 46 re-mastered 45 rpm 7-inches housed in a leather box. The albums were released each on their own on 7-inch.

On February 6, 2013, Rancid uploaded a picture to their Facebook page of the band in the studio with the caption, &quot;Recording has begun.&quot;

In a December 2013 interview on Reddit, Rancid drummer Branden Steineckert revealed that the new album was called &quot;...Honor Is All We Know&quot; and it would be released in 2014.

On September 28, 2014, Rancid revealed the artwork and track listing for &quot;...Honor Is All We Know&quot;. On the day after, they announced that the album would be released on October 27, 2014. On September 30, 2014, the band released a video of them performing three of the album&#x27;s tracks.

In March 2016, the band played on their first cruise ship, along with Flogging Molly, Fishbone, The Street Dogs, Frank Turner and others.

On March 25, 2017, Rancid played for the first time in Brazil at the Lollapalooza São Paulo in front of an audience estimated in 100,000 people who attended that first of 2 days festival. Line up of that Saturday included also acts like Criolo, The xx and Metallica. On the occasion, Lars Frederiksen dedicated the last song of the gig, Ruby Soho for &quot;Lemmy from Motörhead, the world is a much more fucked up place without you&quot;.

===&quot;Trouble Maker&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; (2017–present)===

On May 2, 2017, Rancid announced on their Facebook page that their ninth studio album, &quot;Trouble Maker&quot;, would be released on June 9. Rancid co-headlined the &quot;From Boston to Berkeley Tour&quot; with Dropkick Murphys in July and August 2017.

In June 2019, it was reported that Rancid had been working on their tenth studio album with a projected 2020 release, though the year passed without a new release.

Also in 2019, they headlined the traveling craft and beer festival The Bash, and toured North America in September, with support provided by Pennywise, Suicidal Tendencies, the English Beat, the Aquabats, Turnstile, Iron Reagan and Angel Du$t.

Rancid announced in June 2021 that they would be co-headlining the &quot;Boston to Berkeley II&quot; North American tour with Dropkick Murphys from August to October 2021.

In a November 2021 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Fredriksen confirmed that Rancid had been &quot;putting the finishing touches&quot; on their new album.

On April 18, 2023, Rancid announced that their tenth album, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, would be released on June 2, 2023.

In 2023, Rancid joined Green Day and The Smashing Pumpkins for the North American leg of the Saviors tour.

==Musical style and influences==
Steve Huey of AllMusic said Rancid &quot;drew heavily on the political commentary and rock/reggae fusions of the Clash&quot;, and that their sound showed an apparent &quot;fascination with ska while adding a bit of hardcore crunch&quot;.

<doc id="48707" wikidata="Q223679" url="?curid=48707" title="GNU Octave">
<text>GNU Octave is a scientific programming language for scientific computing and numerical computation. Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language. As part of the GNU Project, it is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

==History==
The project was conceived around 1988. At first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. Full development was started by John W. Eaton in 1992. The first alpha release dates back to 4 January 1993 and on 17 February 1994 version 1.0 was released. Version 9.2.0 was released on 7 June 2024.

The program is named after Octave Levenspiel, a former professor of the principal author. Levenspiel was known for his ability to perform quick back-of-the-envelope calculations.

== Development history ==
==Developments==
In addition to use on desktops for personal scientific computing, Octave is used in academia and industry. For example, Octave was used on a massive parallel computer at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to find vulnerabilities related to guessing social security numbers.

Acceleration with OpenCL or CUDA is also possible with use of GPUs.

==Technical details==
* Octave is written in C++ using the C++ standard library.
* Octave uses an interpreter to execute the Octave scripting language.
* Octave is extensible using dynamically loadable modules.
* Octave interpreter has an OpenGL-based graphics engine to create plots, graphs and charts and to save or print them. Alternatively, gnuplot can be used for the same purpose.
* Octave includes a graphical user interface (GUI) in addition to the traditional command-line interface (CLI); see #User interfaces for details.

==Octave, the language==
The Octave language is an interpreted programming language. It is a structured programming language (similar to C) and supports many common C standard library functions, and also certain UNIX system calls and functions. However, it does not support passing arguments by reference although function arguments are copy-on-write to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Octave programs consist of a list of function calls or a script. The syntax is matrix-based and provides various functions for matrix operations. It supports various data structures and allows object-oriented programming.

Its syntax is very similar to MATLAB, and careful programming of a script will allow it to run on both Octave and MATLAB.

Because Octave is made available under the GNU General Public License, it may be freely changed, copied and used. The program runs on Microsoft Windows and most Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, Android, and macOS.

==Notable features==

===Command and variable name completion===
Typing a TAB character on the command line causes Octave to attempt to complete variable, function, and file names (similar to Bash&#x27;s tab completion). Octave uses the text before the cursor as the initial portion of the name to complete.

===Command history===
When running interactively, Octave saves the commands typed in an internal buffer so that they can be recalled and edited.

===Data structures===
Octave includes a limited amount of support for organizing data in structures. In this example, we see a structure with elements , , and , (an integer, an array, and a string, respectively):

octave:1&gt; x.a = 1; x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]; x.c = &quot;string&quot;;
octave:2&gt; x.a
ans = 1
octave:3&gt; x.b
ans =

 1 2
 3 4

octave:4&gt; x.c
ans = string
octave:5&gt; x
x =

 scalar structure containing the fields:

 a = 1
 b =

 1 2
 3 4

 c = string
===Short-circuit Boolean operators===
Octave&#x27;s codice_1 and codice_2 logical operators are evaluated in a short-circuit fashion (like the corresponding operators in the C language), in contrast to the element-by-element operators codice_3 and codice_4.

===Increment and decrement operators===

Octave includes the C-like increment and decrement operators codice_5 and codice_6 in both their prefix and postfix forms.
Octave also does augmented assignment, e.g. codice_7.

===Unwind-protect===
Octave supports a limited form of exception handling modelled after the codice_8 of Lisp. The general form of an unwind_protect block looks like this:

unwind_protect
 body
unwind_protect_cleanup
 cleanup
end_unwind_protect
As a general rule, GNU Octave recognizes as termination of a given codice_9 either the keyword codice_10 (which is compatible with the MATLAB language) or a more specific keyword codice_11 or, in some cases, codice_12. As a consequence, an codice_8 block can be terminated either with the keyword codice_14 as in the example, or with the more portable keyword codice_10.

The &quot;cleanup&quot; part of the block is always executed. In case an exception is raised by the &quot;body&quot; part, &quot;cleanup&quot; is executed immediately before propagating the exception outside the block codice_8.

GNU Octave also supports another form of exception handling (compatible with the MATLAB language):

try
 body
catch
 exception_handling
end
This latter form differs from an codice_8 block in two ways. First, &quot;exception_handling&quot; is only executed when an exception is raised by &quot;body&quot;. Second, after the execution of &quot;exception_handling&quot; the exception is not propagated outside the block (unless a codice_18 statement is explicitly inserted within the &quot;exception_handling&quot; code).

===Variable-length argument lists===
Octave has a mechanism for handling functions that take an unspecified number of arguments without explicit upper limit. To specify a list of zero or more arguments, use the special argument codice_19 as the last (or only) argument in the list. codice_19 is a cell array containing all the input arguments.
function s = plus (varargin)
 if (nargin==0)
 s = 0;
 else
 s = varargin{1} + plus (varargin{2:nargin});
 end
end
===Variable-length return lists===
A function can be set up to return any number of values by using the special return value codice_21. For example:
function varargout = multiassign (data)
 for k=1:nargout
 varargout{k} = data(:,k);
 end
end
===C++ integration===
It is also possible to execute Octave code directly in a C++ program. For example, here is a code snippet for calling codice_22:

#include &lt;octave/oct.h&gt;
ColumnVector NumRands(2);
NumRands(0) = 10;
NumRands(1) = 1;
octave_value_list f_arg, f_ret;
f_arg(0) = octave_value(NumRands);
f_ret = feval(&quot;rand&quot;, f_arg, 1);
Matrix unis(f_ret(0).matrix_value());
C and C++ code can be integrated into GNU Octave by creating oct files, or using the MATLAB compatible MEX files.

== MATLAB compatibility==
Octave has been built with MATLAB compatibility in mind, and shares many features with MATLAB:

# Matrices as fundamental data type.
# Built-in support for complex numbers.
# Powerful built-in math functions and extensive function libraries.
# Extensibility in the form of user-defined functions.

Octave treats incompatibility with MATLAB as a bug; therefore, it could be considered a software clone, which does not infringe software copyright as per &quot;Lotus v. Borland&quot; court case.

MATLAB scripts from the MathWorks&#x27; FileExchange repository in principle are compatible with Octave. However, while they are often provided and uploaded by users under an Octave compatible and proper open source BSD license, the FileExchange Terms of use prohibit any usage beside MathWorks&#x27; proprietary MATLAB.

===Syntax compatibility===
There are a few purposeful, albeit minor, syntax additions :

# Comment lines can be prefixed with the # character as well as the % character;
# Various C-based operators ++, --, +=, *=, /= are supported;
# Elements can be referenced without creating a new variable by cascaded indexing, e.g. [1:10](3);
# Strings can be defined with the double-quote &quot; character as well as the single-quote &#x27; character;
# When the variable type is single (a single-precision floating-point number), Octave calculates the &quot;mean&quot; in the single-domain (MATLAB in double-domain) which is faster but gives less accurate results;
# Blocks can also be terminated with more specific Control structure keywords, i.e., endif, endfor, endwhile, etc.;
# Functions can be defined within scripts and at the Octave prompt;
# Presence of a do-until loop (similar to do-while in C).

===Function compatibility===
Many, but not all, of the numerous MATLAB functions are available in GNU Octave, some of them accessible through packages in Octave Forge. The functions available as part of either core Octave or Forge packages are listed online .

A list of unavailable functions is included in the Octave function codice_23. Unimplemented functions are also listed under many Octave Forge packages in the Octave Wiki.

When an unimplemented function is called the following error message is shown:

 octave:1&gt; guide
 warning: the &#x27;guide&#x27; function is not yet implemented in Octave

 Please read &lt;http://www.octave.org/missing.html&gt; to learn how you can contribute missing functionality.
 error: &#x27;guide&#x27; undefined near line 1 column 1
==User interfaces==
Octave comes with an official graphical user interface (GUI) and an integrated development environment (IDE) based on Qt. It has been available since Octave 3.8, and has become the default interface (over the command-line interface) with the release of Octave 4.0. 
It was well-received by an EDN contributor, who wrote &quot;[Octave] now has a very workable GUI&quot; in reviewing the then-new GUI in 2014.

Several 3rd-party graphical front-ends have also been developed, like ToolboX for coding education.

== GUI applications ==
With Octave code, the user can create GUI applications. See GUI Development (GNU Octave (version 7.1.0)). Below are some examples:

Button, edit control, checkbox
# create figure and panel on it
f = figure;
# create a button (default style)
b1 = uicontrol (f, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;A Button&quot;, &quot;position&quot;,[10 10 150 40]);
# create an edit control
e1 = uicontrol (f, &quot;style&quot;, &quot;edit&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;editable text&quot;, &quot;position&quot;,[10 60 300 40]);
# create a checkbox
c1 = uicontrol (f, &quot;style&quot;, &quot;checkbox&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;a checkbox&quot;, &quot;position&quot;,[10 120 150 40]);
Textbox
prompt = {&quot;Width&quot;, &quot;Height&quot;, &quot;Depth&quot;};
defaults = {&quot;1.10&quot;, &quot;2.20&quot;, &quot;3.30&quot;};
rowscols = [1,10; 2,20; 3,30];
dims = inputdlg (prompt, &quot;Enter Box Dimensions&quot;, rowscols, defaults);
Listbox with message boxes.
my_options = {&quot;An item&quot;, &quot;another&quot;, &quot;yet another&quot;};
[sel, ok] = listdlg (&quot;ListString&quot;, my_options, &quot;SelectionMode&quot;, &quot;Multiple&quot;);
if (ok == 1)
 msgbox (&quot;You selected:&quot;);
 for i = 1:numel (sel)
 msgbox (sprintf (&quot;\t%s&quot;, my_options{sel(i)}));
 endfor
else
 msgbox (&quot;You cancelled.&quot;);
endif
Radiobuttons
# create figure and panel on it
f = figure;
# create a button group
gp = uibuttongroup (f, &quot;Position&quot;, [ 0 0.5 1 1])
# create a buttons in the group
b1 = uicontrol (gp, &quot;style&quot;, &quot;radiobutton&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;Choice 1&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;, [ 10 150 100 50 ]);
b2 = uicontrol (gp, &quot;style&quot;, &quot;radiobutton&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, &quot;Choice 2&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;, [ 10 50 100 30 ]);
# create a button not in the group
b3 = uicontrol (f, &quot;style&quot;, &quot;radiobutton&quot;,&quot;string&quot;, &quot;Not in the group&quot;,&quot;Position&quot;, [ 10 50 100 50 ]);
== Packages ==
Octave also has many packages available. Those packages are located at Octave-Forge Octave Forge - Packages, or Github Octave Packages. It is also possible for anyone to create and maintain packages.

==Comparison with other similar software==
Alternatives to GNU Octave under an open source license, other than the aforementioned MATLAB, include Scilab and FreeMat. Octave is more compatible with MATLAB than Scilab is, and FreeMat has not been updated since June 2013.

Also the Julia programming language and its plotting capabilities has similarities with GNU Octave.

<text>The Oregon Trail was a east–west, large-wheeled wagon route and emigrant trail in North America that connected the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon Territory. The eastern part of the Oregon Trail crossed what is now the states of Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. The western half crossed the current states of Idaho and Oregon.

The Oregon Trail was laid by fur traders and trappers from about 1811 to 1840 and was initially only passable on foot or horseback. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall, Idaho. Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west and eventually reached the Willamette Valley in Oregon, at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete, though further improvements in the forms of bridges, cutoffs, ferries, and roads would make the trip faster and safer. From various starting points in Iowa, Missouri, or Nebraska Territory, the routes converged along the lower Platte River Valley near Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory. They led to fertile farmlands west of the Rocky Mountains. 

The Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers, farmers, miners, ranchers, and business owners and their families to get to the area known as Oregon and its surroundings, with traffic especially thick from 1846 to 1869. The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863) before turning off to their separate destinations. Use of the trail declined after the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, making the trip west substantially faster, cheaper, and safer. Since the mid-20th century, modern highways, such as Interstate 80 and Interstate 84, follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail.

==History==

===Lewis and Clark Expedition===

The first land route across the present-day contiguous United States was mapped by the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1804 and 1806, following these 1803 instructions from President Thomas Jefferson to Meriwether Lewis: &quot;The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, and such principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado and/or other river may offer the most direct and practicable water communication across this continent, for commerce.&quot; Although Lewis and William Clark found a path to the Pacific Ocean, it was neither direct nor practicable for prairie schooner wagons to pass through without considerable road work. The two passes they found going through the Rocky Mountains, Lemhi Pass, and Lolo Pass, turned out to be much too difficult. 

On the return trip in 1806, they traveled from the Columbia River to the Snake River and the Clearwater River over Lolo Pass again. They then traveled overland up the Blackfoot River and crossed the Continental Divide at Lewis and Clark Pass, as it would become known, and on to the head of the Missouri River. This was ultimately a shorter and faster route than the one they followed west. This route had the disadvantages of being much too rough for wagons and controlled by the Blackfoot tribes. Even though Lewis and Clark had only traveled a narrow portion of the upper Missouri River drainage and part of the Columbia River drainage, these were considered the two major rivers draining most of the Rocky Mountains, and the expedition confirmed that there was no &quot;easy&quot; route through the northern Rocky Mountains as Jefferson had hoped. Nonetheless, this famous expedition had mapped both the eastern and western river valleys (Platte and Snake Rivers) that bookend the route of the Oregon Trail (and other emigrant trails) across the continental dividethey just had not located the South Pass or some of the interconnecting valleys later used in the high country. They did show the way for the mountain men, who within a decade would find a better way across, even if it was not an easy way.

===Pacific Fur Company===
Founded in 1810 by John Jacob Astor as a subsidiary of his American Fur Company (AFC), the Pacific Fur Company (PFC) operated in the Pacific Northwest in the North American fur trade. Two movements of PFC employees were planned by Astor: one sent to the Columbia River aboard the merchant ship &quot;Tonquin,&quot; the other dispatched overland under an expedition led by Wilson Price Hunt. Hunt and his party were to find possible supply routes and trapping territories for further fur trading posts. Upon arriving at the river in March 1811, the &quot;Tonquin&quot; crew began building what became Fort Astoria. The ship left supplies and men to continue work on the station and ventured north up the coast to Clayoquot Sound for a trading expedition. While anchored there, Jonathan Thorn insulted an elder Tla-o-qui-aht who was previously elected by the natives to negotiate a mutually satisfactory price for animal pelts. Soon after, the vessel was attacked and overwhelmed by the indigenous Clayoquot, killing many of the crew. Its Quinault interpreter survived and later told the PFC management at Fort Astoria of the destruction. The next day, the ship was blown up by surviving crew members.

Under Hunt, fearing attack by the Niitsitapi, the overland expedition veered south of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s route into what is now Wyoming and in the process passed across Union Pass and into Jackson Hole, Wyoming. From there they went over the Teton Range via Teton Pass and then down to the Snake River into modern Idaho. They abandoned their horses at the Snake River, made dugout canoes, and attempted to use the river for transport. After a few days&#x27; travel, they soon discovered that steep canyons, waterfalls, and impassable rapids made travel by river impossible. Too far from their horses to retrieve them, they had to cache most of their goods and walk the rest of the way to the Columbia River where they made new boats and traveled to the newly established Fort Astoria. The expedition demonstrated that much of the route along the Snake River plain and across to the Columbia was passable by pack train or with minimal improvements, even wagons. This knowledge would be incorporated into the concatenated trail segments as the Oregon Trail took its early shape.

Pacific Fur Company partner Robert Stuart led a small group of men back east to report to Astor. The group planned to retrace the path followed by the overland expedition back up to the east following the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Fear of a Native American attack near Union Pass in Wyoming forced the group further south where they discovered South Pass, a wide and easy pass over the Continental Divide. The party continued east via the Sweetwater River, North Platte River (where they spent the winter of 1812–13), and Platte River to the Missouri River, finally arriving in St. Louis in the spring of 1813. The route they had used appeared to potentially be a practical wagon route, requiring minimal improvements, and Stuart&#x27;s journals provided a meticulous account of most of the route. Because of the War of 1812 and the lack of U.S. fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest, most of the route was unused for more than 10 years.

===North West Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company===

In August 1811, three months after Fort Astoria was established, David Thompson and his team of North West Company explorers came floating down the Columbia to Fort Astoria. He had just completed a journey through much of western Canada and most of the Columbia River drainage system. He was mapping the country for possible fur trading posts. Along the way, he camped at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake Rivers and posted a notice claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort on the site. When the War of 1812 broke out, the managers at Fort Astoria were concerned the British navy would seize their forts and supplies, and in 1813 they sold out to the North West Company.

By 1821, intense competition between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) and the North West Company reached the point of armed hostilities, and the British government pressured the two companies to merge. The newly reconfigured HBC had a near monopoly on trading (and most governing issues) in the Columbia District, or Oregon Country as it was referred to by the Americans, and also in Rupert&#x27;s Land. That year the British parliament passed a statute applying the laws of Upper Canada to the district and giving the HBC power to enforce those laws.

From 1813 to the early 1840s the British, through the NWC and HBC, had nearly complete control of the Pacific Northwest and the western half of the Oregon Trail. In theory, the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, restored possession of U.S. property in Oregon territory to the United States. &quot;Joint occupation&quot; of the region was formally established by the Anglo-American Convention of 1818. The British, through the HBC, tried to discourage any U.S. trappers, traders, and settlers from work or settlement in the Pacific Northwest.

By overland travel, American missionaries and early settlers (initially mostly ex-trappers) started showing up in Oregon in the late 1820s. Although officially the HBC discouraged settlement because it interfered with its lucrative fur trade, its manager at Fort Vancouver, John McLoughlin, gave substantial help, including employment, until they could get established. In the early 1840s thousands of American settlers arrived and soon greatly outnumbered the British settlers in Oregon. McLoughlin, despite working for the HBC, gave help in the form of loans, medical care, shelter, clothing, food, supplies and seed to U.S. emigrants. These new emigrants often arrived in Oregon tired, worn out, nearly penniless, with insufficient food or supplies, just as winter was coming on. McLoughlin would later be hailed as the Father of Oregon.

The York Factory Express, establishing another route to the Oregon territory, evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the North West Company between Fort Astoria and Fort William, Ontario on Lake Superior. By 1825 the HBC started using two brigades, each setting out from opposite ends of the express route—one from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River and the other from York Factory on Hudson Bay—in spring and passing each other in the middle of the continent. This established a &quot;quick&quot;— about 100 days for one way— to transport personnel and transmit messages between Fort Vancouver and York Factory on Hudson Bay.

The HBC built a new much larger Fort Vancouver in 1825 about 90 miles upstream from Fort Astoria, on the north side of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in its trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, the manager of Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.

When American emigration over the Oregon Trail began in earnest in the early 1840s, for many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies, aid, and help before starting their homesteads. Fort Vancouver was the main re-supply point for nearly all Oregon trail travelers until U.S. towns could be established. The HBC established Fort Colvile in 1825 on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls as a good site to collect furs and control the upper Columbia River fur trade. Fort Nisqually was built near the present town of DuPont, Washington, and was the first HBC fort on Puget Sound. Fort Victoria was erected in 1843 and became the headquarters of operations in British Columbia, eventually growing into modern-day Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia.

By 1840, the HBC had three forts: Fort Hall (purchased from Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth in 1837), Fort Boise and Fort Nez Perce on the western end of the Oregon Trail route as well as Fort Vancouver near its terminus in the Willamette Valley. With minor exceptions, they all gave substantial and often desperately needed aid to the early Oregon Trail pioneers.

When the fur trade slowed in the 1840s because of fashion changes in men&#x27;s hats, the value of the Pacific Northwest to the British was seriously diminished. Canada had few potential settlers who were willing to move more than to the Pacific Northwest, although several hundred ex-trappers, British and American, and their families did start settling in what became Oregon and Washington. In 1841, James Sinclair, on orders from HBC Governor Sir George Simpson, guided nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony (located at the junction of the Assiniboine River and Red River near present Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) into the Oregon territory. This attempt at settlement failed when most of the families joined the settlers in the Willamette Valley, with their promise of free land and HBC-free government.

In 1846, the Oregon Treaty ending the Oregon boundary dispute was signed with Britain. The British lost much of the land they had so long controlled. The new Canada–United States border was established at the 49th parallel to the Pacific Coast, then dipping south around Vancouver Island. The treaty granted the HBC navigation rights on the Columbia River for supplying their fur posts, clear titles to their trading post properties allowing them to be sold later if they wanted, and left the British with a good anchorage at Victoria. It gave the United States most of what it wanted, a &quot;reasonable&quot; boundary and a good anchorage on the West Coast in Puget Sound. While there were few United States settlers in the future state of Washington in 1846, the United States had already demonstrated it could induce thousands of settlers to go to the Oregon Territory, and it would be only a short time before they would vastly outnumber the few hundred HBC employees and retirees living in the region.

===Great American Desert===
Reports from expeditions in 1806 by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike and in 1819 by Major Stephen Long described the Great Plains as &quot;unfit for human habitation&quot; and as &quot;The Great American Desert&quot;. These descriptions were mainly based on the relative lack of timber and surface water. The images of sandy wastelands conjured up by terms like &quot;desert&quot; were tempered by the many reports of vast herds of millions of Plains Bison that somehow managed to live in this &quot;desert&quot;. In the 1840s, the Great Plains appeared to be unattractive for settlement and were illegal for homesteading until well after 1846—initially, it was set aside by the U.S. government for Native American settlements. The next available land for general settlement, Oregon, appeared to be free for the taking and had fertile lands, disease-free climate (yellow fever and malaria were then prevalent in much of the Missouri and Mississippi River drainage), extensive forests, big rivers, potential seaports, and only a few nominally British settlers.

===Fur traders, trappers, and explorers===
Fur trappers, often working for fur traders, followed nearly all possible streams looking for beaver in the years (1812–40) when the fur trade was active. Fur traders included Manuel Lisa, Robert Stuart, William Henry Ashley, Jedediah Smith, William Sublette, Andrew Henry, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Peter Skene Ogden, David Thompson, James Douglas, Donald Mackenzie, Alexander Ross, James Sinclair, and other mountain men. Besides describing and naming many of the rivers and mountains in the Intermountain West and Pacific Northwest, they often kept diaries of their travels and were available as guides and consultants when the trail started to become open for general travel. The fur trade business wound down to a very low level just as the Oregon trail traffic seriously began around 1840.

In the fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the Yellowstone River to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte Rivers, they found after a near-disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named Independence Rock and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813—eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Smith was killed by Comanche natives around 1831.

Up to 3,000 mountain men were trappers and explorers, employed by various British and United States fur companies or working as free trappers, who roamed the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 to the early 1840s. They usually traveled in small groups for mutual support and protection. Trapping took place in the fall when the fur became prime. Mountain men primarily trapped beaver and sold the skins. A good beaver skin could bring up to $4 at a time when a man&#x27;s wage was often $1 per day. Some were more interested in exploring the West. In 1825, the first significant American Rendezvous occurred on the Henry&#x27;s Fork of the Green River. The trading supplies were brought in by a large party using pack trains originating on the Missouri River. These pack trains were then used to haul out the fur bales. They normally used the north side of the Platte River—the same route used 20 years later by the Mormon Trail. For the next 15 years, the American rendezvous was an annual event moving to different locations, usually somewhere on the Green River in the future state of Wyoming. Each rendezvous, occurring during the slack summer period, allowed the fur traders to trade for and collect the furs from the trappers and their Native American allies without having the expense of building or maintaining a fort or wintering over in the cold Rockies. In only a few weeks at a rendezvous a year&#x27;s worth of trading and celebrating would take place as the traders took their furs and remaining supplies back east for the winter and the trappers faced another fall and winter with new supplies. Trapper Jim Beckwourth described the scene as one of &quot;Mirth, songs, dancing, shouting, trading, running, jumping, singing, racing, target-shooting, yarns, frolic, with all sorts of extravagances that white men or Indians could invent.&quot; In 1830, William Sublette brought the first wagons carrying his trading goods up the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers before crossing over South Pass to a fur trade rendezvous on the Green River near the future town of Big Piney, Wyoming. He had a crew that dug out the gullies and river crossings and cleared the brush where needed. This established that the eastern part of most of the Oregon Trail was passable by wagons. In the late 1830s, the HBC instituted a policy intended to destroy or weaken the American fur trade companies. The HBC&#x27;s annual collection and re-supply Snake River Expedition was transformed into a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to undersell the American traders—losing money but undercutting the American fur traders. By 1840 the fashion in Europe and Britain shifted away from the formerly very popular beaver felt hats and prices for furs rapidly declined and the trapping almost ceased.

Fur traders tried to use the Platte River, the main route of the eastern Oregon Trail, for transport but soon gave up in frustration as its many channels and islands combined with its muddy waters were too shallow, crooked, and unpredictable to use for water transport. The Platte proved to be unnavigable. The Platte River and North Platte River Valley, however, became an easy roadway for wagons, with its nearly flat plain sloping easily up and heading almost due west.

Several U.S. government-sponsored explorers explored part of the Oregon Trail and wrote extensively about their explorations. Captain Benjamin Bonneville on his expedition of 1832 to 1834 explored much of the Oregon trail and brought wagons up the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater route across South Pass to the Green River in Wyoming. He explored most of Idaho and the Oregon Trail to the Columbia. The account of his explorations in the West was published by Washington Irving in 1838. John C. Frémont of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Corps of Topographical Engineers and his guide Kit Carson led three expeditions from 1842 to 1846 over parts of California and Oregon. His explorations were written up by him and his wife Jessie Benton Frémont and were widely published. The first detailed maps of California and Oregon were drawn by Frémont and his topographers and cartographers in about 1848.

===Missionaries===
In 1834, The Dalles Methodist Mission was founded by Reverend Jason Lee just east of Mount Hood on the Columbia River. In 1836, Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman traveled west to establish the Whitman Mission near modern-day Walla Walla, Washington. The party included the wives of the two men, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding, who became the first European-American women to cross the Rocky Mountains. En route, the party accompanied American fur traders going to the 1836 rendezvous on the Green River in Wyoming and then joined Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur traders traveling west to Fort Nez Perce (also called Fort Walla Walla). The group was the first to travel in wagons to Fort Hall, where the wagons were abandoned at the urging of their guides. They used pack animals for the rest of the trip to Fort Walla Walla and then floated by boat to Fort Vancouver to get supplies before returning to start their missions. Other missionaries, mostly husband and wife teams using wagon and pack trains, established missions in the Willamette Valley, as well as various locations in the future states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.

===Early emigrants===
On May 1, 1839, a group of eighteen men from Peoria, Illinois, set out with the intention of colonizing the Oregon country on behalf of the United States of America and driving out the HBC operating there. The men of the Peoria Party were among the first pioneers to traverse most of the Oregon Trail. They were initially led by Thomas J. Farnham and called themselves the Oregon Dragoons. They carried a large flag emblazoned with their motto &quot;Oregon Or The Grave&quot;. Although the group split up near Bent&#x27;s Fort on the South Platte and Farnham was deposed as leader, nine of their members eventually did reach Oregon.

In September 1840, Robert Newell, Joseph L. Meek, and their families reached Fort Walla Walla with three wagons that they had driven from Fort Hall. Their wagons were the first to reach the Columbia River over land, and they opened the final leg of the Oregon Trail to wagon traffic.

In 1841, the Bartleson-Bidwell Party was the first emigrant group credited with using the Oregon Trail to emigrate west. The group set out for California, but about half the party left the original group at Soda Springs, Idaho, and proceeded to the Willamette Valley in Oregon, leaving their wagons at Fort Hall.

On May 16, 1842, the second organized wagon train set out from Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers. The party was led by Elijah White. The group broke up after passing Fort Hall with most of the single men hurrying ahead and the families following later.

===Great Migration of 1843===
In what was dubbed &quot;The Great Migration of 1843&quot; or the &quot;Wagon Train of 1843&quot;, an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon. They were led initially by John Gantt, a former U.S. Army Captain and fur trader who was contracted to guide the train to Fort Hall for $1 per person. The winter before, Marcus Whitman had made a brutal mid-winter trip from Oregon to St. Louis to appeal a decision by his mission backers to abandon several of the Oregon missions. He joined the wagon train at the Platte River for the return trip. When the pioneers were told at Fort Hall by agents from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company that they should abandon their wagons there and use pack animals the rest of the way, Whitman disagreed and volunteered to lead the wagons to Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons. The biggest obstacle they faced was in the Blue Mountains of Oregon where they had to cut and clear a trail through heavy timber. The wagons were stopped at The Dalles, Oregon, by the lack of a road around Mount Hood. The wagons had to be disassembled and floated down the treacherous Columbia River and the animals herded over the rough Lolo trail to get by Mt. Hood. Nearly all of the settlers in the 1843 wagon trains arrived in the Willamette Valley by early October. A passable wagon trail now existed from the Missouri River to The Dalles. Jesse Applegate&#x27;s account of the emigration, &quot;A Day with the Cow Column in 1843,&quot; has been described as &quot;the best bit of literature left to us by any participant in the [Oregon] pioneer movement...&quot; and has been republished several times from 1868 to 1990.

In 1846, the Barlow Road was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but completely passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about .

===Oregon Country===
In 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley drafted the Organic Laws of Oregon organizing land claims within the Oregon Country. Married couples were granted at no cost (except for the requirement to work and improve the land) up to (a section or square mile), and unmarried settlers could claim . As the group was a provisional government with no authority, these claims were not valid under United States or British law, but they were eventually honored by the United States in the Donation Land Act of 1850. The Donation Land Act provided for married settlers to be granted and unmarried settlers . Following the expiration of the act in 1854 the land was no longer free but cost $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare) with a limit of —the same as most other unimproved government land.

===Women on the Overland Trail===
Consensus interpretations, as found in John Faragher&#x27;s book, &quot;Women and Men on the Overland Trail&quot; (1979), held that men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s power within marriage was uneven. This meant that women did not experience the trail as liberating, but instead only found harder work than they had handled back east, all the while upholding the virtues of the Culture of Domesticity. Some of the additional tasks women had on the wagon trail included collecting &quot;buffalo
chips&quot; for fire fuel, unloading and loading up the wagons, driving teams of oxen, pouring
bullets to help in Indian attacks, and striving to keep their men and children at
peace. They were the backbones of life on the wagon trail and took up not only their
regular duties but many duties of men as well. However, feminist scholarship, by historians such as Lillian Schlissel, Sandra Myres, and Glenda Riley, suggests men and women did not view the West and western migration in the same way. Whereas men might deem the dangers of the trial acceptable if there was a strong economic reward at the end, women viewed those dangers as threatening to the stability and survival of the family. Once they arrived at their new Western home, women&#x27;s public role in building Western communities and participating in the Western economy gave them a greater authority than they had known back East. There was a &quot;female frontier&quot; that was distinct and different from that experienced by men.

Women&#x27;s diaries kept during their travels or the letters they wrote home once they arrived at their destination support these contentions. Women wrote with sadness and concern about the numerous deaths along the trail. Anna Maria King wrote to her family in 1845 about her trip to the Luckiamute Valley Oregon and of the multiple deaths experienced by her traveling group:

But listen to the deaths: Sally Chambers, John King, and his wife, their little daughter Electa and their babe, a son 9 months old, and Dulancy C. Norton&#x27;s sister are gone. Mr. A. Fuller lost his wife and daughter Tabitha. Eight of our two families have gone to their long home.

Similarly, emigrant Martha Gay Masterson, who traveled the trail with her family at the age of 13, mentioned the fascination she and other children felt for the graves and loose skulls they would find near their camps.

Anna Maria King, like many other women, also advised family and friends back home of the realities of the trip and offered advice on how to prepare for the trip. Women also reacted and responded, often enthusiastically, to the landscape of the West. Betsey Bayley, in a letter to her sister, Lucy P. Griffith, described how travelers responded to the new environment they encountered:

The mountains looked like volcanoes and the appearance that one day there had been an awful thundering of volcanoes and a burning world. The valleys were all covered with a white crust and looked like salaratus. Some of the companies used it to raise their bread.

While women experienced many deaths and hardships on the trail, the trail was also a place for women to take on roles they had previously not been allowed to take on back east. Women started to use their journals on the trails to express themselves as &quot;reporters, guides, poets, and historians.&quot; They would jot down botany and different species on the trail to help feed their family. Women used their resourcefulness and creativity on the trail. 

===Mormon emigration===
Following persecution and mob action in Missouri, Illinois, and other states, and the assassination of their prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, Mormon leader Brigham Young led settlers in the Latter Day Saints (LDS) church west to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, fast-moving group from their Winter Quarters encampments near Omaha, Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in Iowa including Council Bluffs. About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year; they were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in Nebraska to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. They initially started in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California-bound emigrants, typically taking about 100 days to cover the trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants averaged about per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to Fort Bridger, where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as Hastings Cutoff, used by the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846.

Between 1847 and 1860, over 43,000 Mormon settlers and tens of thousands of travelers on the California Trail and Oregon Trail followed Young to Utah. After 1848, the travelers headed to California or Oregon resupplied at the Salt Lake Valley, and then went back over the Salt Lake Cutoff, rejoining the trail near the future Idaho–Utah border at the City of Rocks in Idaho.

Along the Mormon Trail, the Mormon pioneers established several ferries and made trail improvements to help later travelers and earn much-needed money. One of the better-known ferries was the Mormon Ferry across the North Platte near the future site of Fort Caspar in Wyoming which operated between 1848 and 1852 and the Green River ferry near Fort Bridger which operated from 1847 to 1856. The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll ranging from $3 to $8.

===California gold rush===
In January 1848, James Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada portion of the American River, sparking the California gold rush. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the male population in Oregon went to California in 1848 to cash in on the opportunity. To get there, they helped build the Lassen Branch of the Applegate-Lassen Trail by cutting a wagon road through extensive forests. Many returned with significant gold which helped jump-start the Oregon economy. Over the next decade, gold seekers from the Midwestern United States and East Coast of the United States dramatically increased traffic on the Oregon and California Trails. The &quot;forty-niners&quot; often chose speed over safety and opted to use shortcuts such as the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff in Wyoming which reduced travel time by almost seven days but spanned nearly of the desert without water, grass, or fuel for fires. 1849 was the first year of large scale cholera epidemics in the United States, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California—most buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska. The adjusted 1850 U.S. census of California showed this rush was overwhelmingly male with about 112,000 males to 8,000 females (with about 5,500 women over age 15). Women were significantly underrepresented in the California gold rush, and sex ratios did not reach essential equality in California (and other western states) until about 1950. The relative scarcity of women gave them many opportunities to do many more things that were not normally considered women&#x27;s work of this era. After 1849, the California gold rush continued for several years as the miners continued to find about $50,000,000 worth of gold per year at $21 per ounce. Once California was established as a prosperous state, many thousands more emigrated there each year for the opportunities.

===Later emigration and uses of the trail===
The trail was still in use during the Civil War, but traffic declined after 1855 when the Panama Railroad across the Isthmus of Panama was completed. Paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships, often heavily subsidized to carry the mail, provided rapid transport to and from the East Coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to and from Panama to ports in California and Oregon.

Over the years many ferries were established to help get across the many rivers on the path of the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, Kansas River, Little Blue River, Elkhorn River, Loup River, Platte River, South Platte River, North Platte River, Laramie River, Green River, Bear River, two crossings of the Snake River, John Day River, Deschutes River, Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30 per wagon but decreased the speed of the transit from about 160 to 170 days in 1843 to 120 to 140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent death by drowning at river crossings.

In April 1859, an expedition of U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers led by Captain James H. Simpson left Camp Floyd, Utah, to establish an army supply route across the Great Basin to the eastern slope of the Sierras. Upon return in early August, Simpson reported that he had surveyed the Central Overland Route from Camp Floyd to Genoa, Nevada. This route went through central Nevada (roughly where U.S. Route 50 goes today) and was about shorter than the &quot;standard&quot; Humboldt River California trail route.

The Army improved the trail for use by wagons and stagecoaches in 1859 and 1860. Starting in 1860, the American Civil War closed the heavily subsidized Butterfield Overland Mail stage Southern Route through the deserts of the American Southwest.

In 1860–1861, the Pony Express, employing riders traveling on horseback day and night with relay stations about every to supply fresh horses, was established from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California. The Pony Express built many of their eastern stations along the Oregon/California/Mormon/Bozeman Trails and many of their western stations along the very sparsely settled Central Overland Route across Utah and Nevada. The Pony Express delivered mail summer and winter in roughly 10 days from the midwest to California.

In 1861, John Butterfield, who since 1858 had been using the Butterfield Overland Mail, also switched to the Central Route to avoid traveling through hostile territories during the American Civil War. George Chorpenning immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line along with their stations from the &quot;Northern Route&quot; (California Trail) along the Humboldt River. In the same year, the first transcontinental telegraph also laid its lines alongside the Central Overland Route. Several stage lines were set up carrying mail and passengers that traversed much of the route of the original Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger and from there over the Central Overland Route to California. By traveling day and night with many stations and changes of teams (and extensive mail subsidies), these stages could get passengers and mail from the Midwest to California in about 25 to 28 days. This combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Oregon Trail and Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the first transcontinental telegraph stations and telegraph line, which followed much the same route in 1861 from Carson City, Nevada to Salt Lake City. The Pony Express folded in 1861 as they failed to receive an expected mail contract from the U.S. government and the telegraph filled the need for rapid east-west communication. This combination wagon/stagecoach/pony express/telegraph line route is labeled the &quot;Pony Express National Historic Trail&quot; on the National Trail Map. From Salt Lake City the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon/California/Oregon trails to Omaha, Nebraska.

After the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, telegraph lines usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and telegraph lines were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. Telegraph lines to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned.

As the years passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used corridor from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots of the trail continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870, the population in the states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. Except for most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences.

Even before the famous Texas cattle drives after the Civil War, the trail was being used to drive herds of thousands of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the Midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years. In 1852, there were even records of a 1,500-turkey drive from Illinois to California. The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the Midwest and at the end of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the Midwest for about a third to tenth of what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the trail large herds of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets.

===Trail decline===
The first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, providing faster, safer, and usually cheaper travel east and west (the journey took seven days and cost as little as $65, or ). Some emigrants continued to use the trail well into the 1890s, and modern highways and railroads eventually paralleled large portions of the trail, including U.S. Highway 26, Interstate 84 in Oregon and Idaho and Interstate 80 in Nebraska. Contemporary interest in the overland trek has prompted the states and federal government to preserve landmarks on the trail including wagon ruts, buildings, and &quot;registers&quot; where emigrants carved their names. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, there have been several re-enactments of the trek with participants wearing period garments and traveling by wagon.

==Routes==

As the trail developed it became marked by many cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were necessary.

While the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail&#x27;s primary starting points were Independence, Missouri, or Westport, (which was annexed into modern day Kansas City), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across Kansas, and other towns became notable starting points, including Weston, Fort Leavenworth, Atchison, St. Joseph, and Omaha.

The Oregon Trail&#x27;s nominal termination point was Oregon City, at the time the proposed capital of the Oregon Territory. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.

At dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.

Many other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of California; and the Bozeman Trail to Montana. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established on both sides of the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot, the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may have been between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.

Remnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the entire trail is a designated National Historic Trail.

===Missouri===
Initially, the main jumping-off point was the common head of the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon trail— Independence, and Kansas City. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day Topeka, they ferried across the Kansas River to start the trek across Kansas and points west. Another busy &quot;jumping off point&quot; was St. Joseph—established in 1843. In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to St. Louis and other ports on the combined Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River systems. During the busy season, there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the Union Pacific Railroad was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin, Arrow Rock, and Fort Osage.

===Iowa===
The Lewis and Clark Expedition stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805–1806 expedition to the west coast. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. In 1846, the Mormons, expelled from Nauvoo, Illinois, traversed Iowa (on part of the Mormon Trail) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of Nebraska at their Winter Quarters near the future city of Omaha, Nebraska. The Mormons established about 50 temporary towns including the town of Kanesville, Iowa (renamed Council Bluffs in 1852), on the east bank of the Missouri River opposite the mouth of the Platte River. For travelers bringing their teams to the Platte River junction, Kanesville, and other towns became major jumping-off places and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census, there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large Pottawattamie County, Iowa District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.) By 1854, most of the Mormon towns, farms, and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846, the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha (est. 1852), and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and jumping-off places for travelers on the Mormon, California, Oregon, and other trails west.

===Kansas===
Starting initially in Independence, Missouri, or Kansas City in Missouri, the initial trail follows the Santa Fe Trail into Kansas south of the Wakarusa River. After crossing Mount Oread at Lawrence, the trail crosses the Kansas River by ferry or boats near Topeka and crosses the Wakarusa and Black Vermillion rivers by ferries. West of Topeka, the route paralleled what is now U.S. Route 24 until west of St. Mary&#x27;s. After the Black Vermillion River, the trail angles northwest to Nebraska paralleling the Little Blue River until reaching the south side of the Platte River. Destinations along the Oregon Trail in Kansas included St. Mary&#x27;s Mission, Pottawatomie Indian Pay Station, Vieux&#x27;s Vermilion Crossing, Alcove Springs and the Hollenberg Station which was built for and used concurrently in 1860 and 1861 by the Pony Express. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.

===Nebraska===

Those emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in Missouri or Iowa used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in Nebraska. Several towns in Nebraska were used as jumping-off places with Omaha eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. Fort Kearny (est. 1848) is about from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the Platte River west. The army-maintained Fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.

The Platte River and the North Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy, and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was &quot;too thin to plow and too thick to drink&quot;. While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and buffalo chips for fuel. The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about wide and deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.

In the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain, and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of bison migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried jerky for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Native Americans fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte River. Travelers gathered and ignited dried cow dung to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River Valley into present-day Wyoming heading to Fort Laramie. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child&#x27;s Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present-day town of Casper, Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.

Notable landmarks in Nebraska include Courthouse and Jail Rocks, Chimney Rock, Scotts Bluff, and Ash Hollow with its steep descent down Windlass Hill over the South Platte.

Today much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along Interstate 80 from Wyoming to Grand Island, Nebraska. From there U.S. Highway 30 which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte.

====Cholera on the Platte River====
Because of the Platte&#x27;s brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many freshwater streams draining into the Platte or the occasional freshwater spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years (1849–1855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. One of the side effects of cholera is acute diarrhea, which helps contaminate even more water unless it is isolated and/or treated. The cause of cholera (ingesting the &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; bacterium from contaminated water) and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Thousands of travelers on the combined California, Oregon, and Mormon trails succumbed to cholera between 1849 and 1855. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Although also considered part of the Mormon Trail, the grave of Rebecca Winters is one of the few marked ones left. There are many cases cited involving people who were alive and healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.

Most outbreaks did not progress further west than Fort Laramie. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.

===Colorado===
A branch of the Oregon trail crossed the very northeast corner of Colorado if they followed the South Platte River to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present-day Julesburg before entering Wyoming. Later settlers followed the Platte and South Platte Rivers into their settlements there (much of which became the state of Colorado).

===Wyoming===
After crossing the South Platte River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. Fort Laramie, at the confluence of the Laramie and North Platte rivers, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails. It was the last army outpost till travelers reached the coast.

After crossing the South Platte the trail continues up the North Platte River, crossing many small swift-flowing creeks. As the North Platte veers to the south, the trail crosses the North Platte to the Sweetwater River Valley, which heads almost due west. Independence Rock is on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the Continental Divide at South Pass, Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing Big Sandy Creek— about wide and deep— before hitting the Green River. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The deep, wide, swift, and treacherous Green River which eventually empties into the Colorado River, was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green, the main trail continued approximately southwest until the Blacks Fork of the Green River and Fort Bridger. From Fort Bridger the Mormon Trail continued southwest following the upgraded Hastings Cutoff through the Wasatch Mountains. From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the Bear River Valley. The trail turned north following the Bear River past the terminus of the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff at Smiths Fork and on to the Thomas Fork Valley at the present Wyoming–Idaho border.

Over time, two major heavily used cutoffs were established in Wyoming. The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff was established in 1844 and cut about off the main route. It leaves the main trail about west of South Pass and heads almost due west crossing Big Sandy Creek and then about of waterless, very dusty desert before reaching the Green River near the present town of La Barge. Ferries here transferred them across the Green River. From there the Sublette–Greenwood Cutoff trail had to cross a mountain range to connect with the main trail near Cokeville in the Bear River Valley.

The Lander Road, formally the Fort Kearney, South Pass, and Honey Lake Wagon Road, was established and built by U.S. government contractors in 1858–59. It was about shorter than the main trail through Fort Bridger with good grass, water, firewood, and fishing but it was a much steeper and rougher route, crossing three mountain ranges. In 1859, 13,000 of the 19,000 Emigrants traveling to California and Oregon used the Lander Road. The traffic in later years is undocumented.

The Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass, and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the Thompson Pass in the Wyoming Range. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another pass on the Salt River Range of mountains and then descending into Star Valley. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about south of the town of Smoot. The road continued almost due north along the present-day Wyoming; Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the Salt River (which drains into the Snake River) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River Valley (Star Valley) about north the road turned almost due west near the present town of Auburn, and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho, it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest until it crossed the Caribou Mountains and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake. The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternatively, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of Soda Springs.

Numerous landmarks are along the trail in Wyoming including Independence Rock, Ayres Natural Bridge, and Register Cliff.

===Utah===
In 1847, Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by Lansford Hastings to the Donner Party in 1846 through the Wasatch Mountains into Utah. After getting into Utah, they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities—including Salt Lake City. In 1848, the Salt Lake Cutoff was established by Sam Hensley, and returning members of the Mormon Battalion providing a path north of the Great Salt Lake from Salt Lake City back to the California and Oregon trails. This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the City of Rocks near the Utah; Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon-bound travelers. Located about halfway on both the California and Oregon trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies, or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one &quot;detoured&quot; to Salt Lake City or not. For their use and to encourage California and Oregon-bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much-needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the Weber, Bear, and Malad Rivers, which were used mostly by travelers bound for Oregon or California.

===Idaho===
The main Oregon and California Trail went north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the Bear River Valley, which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork Valley, the emigrants encountered Big Hill, a detour caused by a then-impassable cut the Bear River made through the mountains, with a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a steep and dangerous descent. In 1852, Eliza Ann McAuley found the McAuley Cutoff, which bypassed much of the difficult climb and descent of Big Hill. About on they passed present-day Montpelier, Idaho, which is now the site of the National Oregon-California Trail Center. The trail follows the Bear River northwest to present-day Soda Springs, which attracted pioneers with hot carbonated water for laundry and chugging springs for fresh water. Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for the Great Salt Lake, and the main trail turns northwest to follow the Portneuf River valley to Fort Hall, Idaho. Fort Hall was a fur trading post located on the Snake River, established in 1832 by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth and company and later sold in 1837 to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. At Fort Hall, travelers were given available aid and supplies as needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests, and travelers often mentioned that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about , taking nine to twelve days.

At Soda Springs was one branch of Lander Road (established and built with government contractors in 1858), which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day Auburn, Wyoming, and entering Idaho. From there it proceeded northwest into Idaho up Stump Creek canyon for about . One branch turned almost 90 degrees and proceeded southwest to Soda Springs. Another branch headed almost due west past Gray&#x27;s Lake to rejoin the main trail about west of Fort Hall.

On the main trail about west of Soda Springs Hudspeth&#x27;s Cutoff (established in 1849 and used mostly by California trail users) took off from the main trail heading west, bypassing Fort Hall. It rejoined the California Trail at Cassia Creek near the City of Rocks. Hudspeth&#x27;s Cutoff had five mountain ranges to cross and took about the same amount of time as the main route to Fort Hall, but many took it thinking it was shorter. Its main advantage was that it helped spread out the traffic during peak periods, increasing grass availability.

West of Fort Hall, the main trail traveled about on the south side of the Snake River southwest past American Falls, Massacre Rocks, Register Rock, and Coldwater Hill near present-day Pocatello, Idaho. Near the junction of the Raft River and Snake River, the California Trail diverged from the Oregon Trail. Travellers left the Snake River and followed the Raft River about southwest past present-day Almo. This trail then passed through the City of Rocks and over Granite Pass where it went southwest along Goose Creek, Little Goose Creek, and Rock Spring Creek. It went about through Thousand Springs Valley, West Brush Creek, and Willow Creek, before arriving at the Humboldt River in northeastern Nevada near present-day Wells. The California Trail proceeded west down the Humboldt before reaching and crossing the Sierra Nevada.

The Snake River&#x27;s depth and fast water meant that there were few places to safely cross. Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale&#x27;s Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth wrote in his diary that his party found a ford across the Snake River southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail. Some lost their wagons and teams over the falls. The trails on the north side joined the trail from Three Island Crossing about west of Glenns Ferry on the north side of the Snake River.

Goodale&#x27;s Cutoff, established in 1862 on the north side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Native Americans and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the Lost River part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of Arco, Idaho, and wound through the northern part of what is now Craters of the Moon National Monument. From there it went southwest to Camas Prairie and ended at Old Fort Boise on the Boise River. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the ward on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. The loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale&#x27;s Cutoff is visible at many points along U.S. Routes 20, 26, and 93 between Craters of the Moon National Monument and Carey.

From the present site of Pocatello, the trail proceeded west on the south side of the Snake River for about . This route passed Cauldron Linn rapids, Shoshone Falls, two falls near the present city of Twin Falls, and Upper Salmon Falls on the Snake River. At Salmon Falls there were often a hundred or more Native Americans fishing who would trade for their salmon.

The trail continued west to Three Island Crossing (near present-day Glenns Ferry). Here most emigrants used the divisions of the river caused by three islands to cross the difficult and swift Snake River by ferry, or by driving or sometimes floating their wagons and swimming their teams across. Hidden holes in the river bottom could overturn the wagon or entangle the team, and several drownings occurred nearly every year before ferries were established.

The north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about long. The next and final crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise, and could be done on bullboats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together, hoping that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of the water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. Often, Native American boys who could swim were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river. In present-day Idaho, Interstate 84 roughly follows the Oregon Trail from the Idaho-Oregon State border at the Snake River. Approximately east of Declo in present-day rural Cassia County, Interstate 84 meets the western terminus of the western section of Interstate 86. Interstate 86 heads east, then northeast to American Falls and Pocatello following the Oregon Trail, while Interstate 84 heads southeast to the State border with Utah. U.S. Route 30 roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from Pocatello to Montpelier.

Starting in about 1848, the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day Ontario, Oregon. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River Canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River Canyon to get water. Travelers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River. In present-day Idaho, the state highway ID-78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.

In 1869, the Central Pacific established Kelton, Utah as a railhead and the terminus of the western mail was moved from Salt Lake City. The Kelton Road became important as a communication and transportation road to the Boise Basin.

Boise has 21 monuments in the shape of obelisks along its portion of the Oregon Trail.

===Oregon===
Once across the Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise the weary travelers traveled across what would become the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the Malheur River and then past Farewell Bend on the Snake River, up the Burnt River canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day La Grande before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the Whitman Mission near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present-day Pendleton, Oregon, crossing the Umatilla River, John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.

Arriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the Cascade Mountains and Mount Hood, some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the Columbia River. Once they transited the Cascade&#x27;s Columbia River Gorge with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the portage around the Cascade Rapids before coming out near the Willamette River where Oregon City was located. The pioneer&#x27;s livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked, and rough Lolo Pass.

Several Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved through the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons, and family down the dangerous Columbia River.

In Central Oregon, there was the Santiam Wagon Road (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The Applegate Trail (established 1846), cutting off the California Trail from the Humboldt River in Nevada, crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. U.S. Route 99 and Interstate 5 through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.

==Travel equipment==

===Wagons and pack animals===
Three types of draft and pack animals were used by Oregon Trail pioneers: oxen, mules, and horses.

By 1842, many emigrants favored oxen— castrated bulls (males) of the genus &quot;Bos&quot; (cattle), generally over four years old; as the best animal to pull wagons, because they were docile, generally healthy, and able to continue moving in difficult conditions such as mud and snow. Oxen could also survive on prairie grasses and sage, unlike horses, who had to be fed. Moreover, oxen were less expensive to purchase and maintain than horses. Oxen also could stand idle for long periods without suffering damage to the feet and legs. Oxen were trained by leading, the use of a whip or goad, and the use of oral commands (such as &quot;Gee&quot; (right), &quot;Haw&quot; (left), and &quot;Whoa&quot; (stop)). Two oxen were typically yoked together at the neck or head; the left ox was referred to as the &quot;near&quot; or &quot;nigh&quot; ox, and the right ox as the &quot;off&quot; ox. While no reins, bits, or halters were needed, the trainer had to be forceful. Oxen typically traveled at a steady pace up to two miles an hour.

One drawback of oxen was the difficulty of shoeing. Oxen hooves are cloven (split), and they had to be shod with two curved pieces of metal, one on each side of the hoof. While horses and mules allowed themselves to be shod relatively easily, the process was more difficult with oxen, who would lie down and tuck their feet under themselves. As a result, several men had to lift and hold an ox while he was being shod.

Mules were used by some emigrants. The competing merits of oxen and mules were hotly debated among emigrants. Some found oxen to be more durable. Others, by contrast, believed that mules were more durable, and mules may have had a lower attrition rate on the trail than oxen. Like oxen, mules could survive on prairie grasses. Mules were, however, notoriously ill-tempered. Mules also cost about three times as much as oxen, a deciding factor for many emigrants.

Three types of wagons were pulled:
* Conestoga wagons, a heavy type of covered wagon 
* Covered wagon (&quot;prairie schooners&quot;), lighter than a Conestoga and often just a covered farm wagon.
* Studebaker (see § History)

===Food===
In 1855, the typical cost of food for four people for six months was about $150 which would cost almost $5,000 today.

Food and water were key concerns for migrants. Wagons typically carried at least one large water keg, and guidebooks available from the 1840s and later gave similar advice to migrants on what food to take. T. H. Jefferson, in his &quot;Brief Practice Advice&quot; guidebook for migrants, recommended that each adult take 200 pounds of flour: &quot;Take plenty of breadstuffs; this is the staff of life when everything else runs short.&quot;

Food often took the form of crackers or hardtack; Southerners sometimes chose cornmeal or pinole rather than wheat flour. Emigrants typically ate rice and beans only at forts stopped at along the way, because boiling water was difficult on the trail, and fuel was not abundant. Lansford Hastings recommended that each emigrant take 200 pounds of flour, 150 pounds of &quot;bacon&quot; (a word which, at the time, referred broadly to all forms of salt pork), 20 pounds of sugar, and 10 pounds of salt. Chipped beef, rice, tea, dried beans, dried fruit, saleratus (for raising bread), vinegar, pickles, mustard, and tallow might also be taken. Joseph Ware&#x27;s 1849 guide recommends that travelers take for each individual a barrel of flour or 180 pounds of ship&#x27;s biscuit (i.e., hardtack), 150–180 pounds of bacon, 60 pounds of beans or peas, 25 pounds of rice, 25 pounds of coffee, 40 pounds of sugar, a keg of lard, 30 or 40 pounds of dried fruit (peaches or apples), a keg of clear, rendered beef suet (to substitute for butter), as well as some vinegar, salt, and pepper. Many emigrant families also carried a small amount of tea and maple sugar.

Randolph B. Marcy, an army officer who wrote an 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended. He advised emigrants to drive cattle instead as a source of fresh beef. Marcy also instructed emigrants to store sides of bacon in canvas bags or in boxes surrounded by bran to protect against extreme heat, which could make bacon go rancid. Marcy instructed emigrants to put salt pork on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat. Marcy also recommended the use of pemmican, as well as the storage of sugar in India rubber or gutta-percha sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.

Canning technology had just begun to be developed, and it gained in popularity through the period of westward expansion. Initially, only upper-class migrants typically used canned goods. There are references in sources to canned cheese, fruit, meat, oysters, and sardines. By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon. Rather than canned vegetables, Marcy suggested that travelers take dried vegetables, which had been used in the Crimean War and by the U.S. Army.

Some pioneers took eggs and butter packed in barrels of flour, and some took dairy cows along the trail. Hunting provided another source of food along the trail; pioneers hunted American bison as well as pronghorn antelope, deer, bighorn sheep, and wildfowl. From rivers and lakes, emigrants also fished for catfish and trout. When emigrants faced starvation, they would sometimes slaughter their animals (horses, mules, and oxen). In desperate times, migrants would search for less-popular sources of food, including coyote, fox, jackrabbit, marmot, prairie dog, and rattlesnake (nicknamed &quot;bush fish&quot; in the later period).

At the time, scurvy was well-recognized, but there was a lack of clear understanding of how to prevent the disease. Nevertheless, pioneers&#x27; consumption of the wild berries (including chokeberry, gooseberry, and serviceberry) and currants that grew along the trail (particularly along the Platte River) helped make scurvy infrequent. Marcy&#x27;s guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, citric acid could be drunk with sugar and water.

Mostly middle-class emigrant families prided themselves on preparing a good table. Although operating Dutch ovens and kneading dough was difficult on the trail, many baked good bread and even pies.

For fuel to heat food, travelers would collect cedar wood, cottonwood, or willow wood, when available, and sometimes dry prairie grass. More frequently, however, travelers relied on &quot;buffalo chips&quot;—dried bison dung—to fuel fires. Buffalo chips resembled rotten wood and would make clear and hot fires. Chips burned quickly, however, and it took up to three bushels of chips to heat a single meal. Collecting buffalo chips was a common task for children and was one chore that even very young children could carry out. As a result, &quot;memoirs written by those who were very young when they made the journey west invariably refer to this aspect of life on the trail.&quot;

===Clothing, equipment, and supplies===
Tobacco was popular, both for personal use and for trading with natives and other pioneers. Each person brought at least two changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often worn out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occur once or twice a month, or less, depending on the availability of good grass, water, and fuel.

Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta-percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon if there were pregnant women or very young children along. Storage boxes were ideally the same height, so they could be arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for a sleeping platform.

The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.

Travelers brought books, Bibles, trail guides, and writing quills, ink, and paper for writing letters or journaling (about one in 200 kept a diary).

A belt and folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, and thread for mending were required. Spare leather was used for repairing shoes, harnesses, and other equipment. Some used goggles to keep dust out of the eyes.

Saddles, bridles, hobbles, and ropes were needed if the party had a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra harnesses and spare wagon parts were often carried. Most carried steel shoes for horses, mules, or livestock. Tar was carried to help repair an ox&#x27;s injured hoof.

Goods, supplies, and equipment were often shared by fellow travelers. Items that were forgotten, broken, or worn out could be bought from a fellow traveler, post, or fort along the way. New iron shoes for horses, mules, and oxen were put on by blacksmiths found along the way. Equipment repairs and other goods could be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries. Emergency supplies, repairs, and livestock were often provided by residents in California, Oregon, and Utah for late travelers on the trail who were hurrying to beat the snow.

Non-essential items were often abandoned to lighten the load or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or leaving behind their lower-quality items when a better one was found abandoned along the road. Some profited by collecting discarded items, hauling them back to jumping-off places, and reselling them. In the early years, Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and haul it to Salt Lake City, where supplies of all kinds were needed. Others would use discarded furniture, wagons, and wheels as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, Fort Laramie was known as &quot;Camp Sacrifice&quot; because of the large amounts of merchandise discarded nearby. Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their luxury items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead, and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Some travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City to be sold.

Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers were carried by nearly all. Axes, crowbars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels were used to clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steeply banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often along the top of ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys.

==Statistics==
Overall, some 268,000 pioneers used the Oregon Trail and its three primary offshoots, the Bozeman, California, and Mormon Trails, to reach the West Coast, 1840–1860. Another 48,000 headed to Utah. There is no estimate on how many used it to return East.

===Emigrants===
Some of the trail statistics for the early years were recorded by the U.S. Army at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, from about 1849 to 1855. None of these original statistical records have been found—the Army either lost them or destroyed them. Only some partial written copies of the Army records and notes recorded in several diaries have survived.

Emigration to California spiked considerably with the 1849 gold rush. Following the discovery of gold, California remained the destination of choice for most emigrants on the trail up to 1860, with almost 200,000 people traveling there between 1849 and 1860.

Travel diminished after 1860, as the Civil War caused considerable disruptions on the trail. Many of the people on the trail in 1861–1863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the South and the North. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trails and their offshoots.

Mormon emigration records after 1860 are reasonably accurate, as newspapers and other accounts in Salt Lake City give most of the names of emigrants arriving each year from 1847 to 1868. Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon caused a considerable increase in people using the trails, often in directions different from the original trail users.

Though the numbers are significant in the context of the times, far more people chose to remain at home in the 31 states. Between 1840 and 1860, the population of the United States rose by 14  million, yet only about 300,000 decided to make the trip. Many were discouraged by the cost, effort, and danger of the trip. Western scout Kit Carson is thought to have said, &quot;The cowards never started and the weak died on the way&quot;, though the general saying was written by Joaquin Miller, in reference to the California gold rush. According to several sources, 3 to 10  percent of the emigrants are estimated to have perished on the way west.

Many who went were between the ages of 12 and 24. Between 1860 and 1870, the U.S. population increased by seven million; about 350,000 of this increase was in the Western states.

===Western census data===
These census numbers show a 363,000 population increase in the western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon was from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low-cost transportation via East and West Coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman Trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.

===Costs===
The cost of traveling over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire one to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80  percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip for months and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.

===Deaths===
The route west was arduous and fraught with many dangers, but the number of deaths on the trail is not known with any precision; there are only widely varying estimates. Estimating is difficult because of the common practice of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid being dug up by animals or natives. Graves were often put in the middle of a trail and then run over by the livestock to make them difficult to find. Disease was the main killer of trail travelers; cholera killed up to 3 percent of all travelers in the epidemic years from 1849 to 1855.

Native attacks increased significantly after 1860, when most of the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Native American territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon-bound travelers away from much of the native trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the South Platte to avoid local Native American hot spots.

Other common causes of death included hypothermia, drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. Being run over was a major cause of death, despite the wagons&#x27; only averaging 2–3 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving—not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived threat of natives faded and hunting opportunities receded.

A significant number of travelers were suffering from scurvy by the end of their trips. Their typical flour and salted pork/bacon diet had very little vitamin C in it. The diet in the mining camps was also typically low in fresh vegetables and fruit, which indirectly led to the early deaths of many of the inhabitants. Some believe that scurvy deaths may have rivaled cholera as a killer, with most deaths occurring after the victim reached California.

Miscellaneous deaths included deaths by childbirth, falling trees, flash floods, homicides, kicks by animals, lightning strikes, snake bites, and stampedes. According to an evaluation by John Unruh, a 4 percent death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail.

Reaching the Sierra Nevada before the start of the winter storms was critical for the successful completion of a trip. The most famous failure in that regard was that of the Donner Party, whose members struggled to traverse what is today called Donner Pass, in November 1846. When the last survivor was rescued in April 1847, 33 men, women, and children had died at Donner Lake; with some of the 48 survivors confessing to having resorted to cannibalism to survive.

===Disease===
Disease was the biggest killer on the Oregon Trail. Cholera was responsible for taking many lives. As a fecal-oral disease, it commonly resulted from consuming food or water contaminated by the bacterium. Because a dead traveler would often be buried at the site of death, nearby streams could easily be contaminated by the dead body. Other common diseases along the trail included dysentery, an intestinal infection that causes diarrhea containing blood or mucus, and typhoid fever, another fecal-oral disease.

Airborne diseases also commonly affect travelers. One such disease was diphtheria, to which young children were particularly susceptible. It could spread quickly in close quarters, such as the parties that traveled the trail. Measles was also a difficulty, as it is highly contagious and can have an incubation period of ten days or longer. Diseases could spread particularly quickly because settlers had no place to quarantine the sick and because poor sanitation was typical along the route.

==Other trails west==
There were other possible migration paths for early settlers, miners, or travelers to California or Oregon besides the Oregon trail before the establishment of the transcontinental railroads.

From 1821 to 1846, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company twice annually used the York Factory Express overland trade route from Fort Vancouver to Hudson Bay and then on to London. James Sinclair led a large party of nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony in 1841. These northern routes were largely abandoned after Britain ceded its claim to the southern Columbia River basin by way of the Oregon Treaty of 1846.

The longest trip was the voyage of about on an uncomfortable sailing ship rounding the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between Antarctica and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost could be reduced to zero if you signed on as a crewman and worked as a common seaman. The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849–50, showed many thousands chose to do this.

Other routes involved taking a ship to Colón, Panama (then called Aspinwall) and a strenuous, disease-ridden, five- to seven-day trip by canoe and mule over the Isthmus of Panama before catching a ship from Panama City, Panama to Oregon or California. This trip could be done from the East Coast theoretically in less than two months if all ship connections were made without waits and typically cost about $450/person. Catching a fatal disease was a distinct possibility as Ulysses S. Grant in 1852 learned when his unit of about 600 soldiers and some of their dependents traversed the Isthmus and lost about 120 men, women, and children. This passage was considerably sped up and made safer in 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed at terrible cost in money and life across the Isthmus. The once treacherous trip could be done in less than a day. The time and the cost for transit dropped as regular paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships went from ports on the east coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to Colón, Panama ($80–100), across the Isthmus of Panama by railroad ($25) and by paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships to ports in California and Oregon ($100–150).

Another route was established by Cornelius Vanderbilt across Nicaragua in 1849. The long San Juan River to the Atlantic Ocean helps drain the long Lake Nicaragua. From the western shore of Lake Nicaragua, it is only about to the Pacific Ocean. Vanderbilt decided to use paddle wheel steamships from the U.S. to the San Juan River, small paddle wheel steam launches on the San Juan River, boats across Lake Nicaragua, and a stagecoach to the Pacific where connections could be made with another ship headed to California, Oregon, etc. Vanderbilt, by undercutting fares to the Isthmus of Panama and stealing many of the Panama Railroad workers, managed to attract roughly 30% of the California-bound steamboat traffic. All his connections in Nicaragua were never completely worked out before the Panama Railroad&#x27;s completion in 1855. Civil strife in Nicaragua and payment to Cornelius Vanderbilt of a &quot;non-compete&quot; payment (bribe) of $56,000 per year killed the whole project in 1855.

Another possible route consisted of taking a ship to Mexico traversing the country and then catching another ship out of Acapulco, Mexico to California, etc. This route was used by some adventurous travelers but was not too popular because of the difficulties of making connections and the often hostile population along the way.

The Gila Trail going along the Gila River in Arizona, across the Colorado River and then across the Sonora Desert in California was scouted by Stephen Kearny&#x27;s troops and later by Captain Philip St. George Cooke&#x27;s Mormon Battalion in 1846 who were the first to take a wagon the whole way. This route was used by many gold-hungry miners in 1849 and later suffered from the disadvantage that you had to find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.

Running from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield Stage Line won the $600,000/yr. U.S. mail contract to deliver mail to San Francisco, California. As dictated by southern Congressional members, the route ran from St. Louis, Missouri through Arkansas, Oklahoma Indian Territory, Texas, New Mexico Territory, and across the Sonora Desert before ending in San Francisco, California. Employing over 800 at its peak, it used 250 Concord Stagecoaches seating 12 very crowded passengers in three rows. It used 1,800 heads of stock, horses, and mules and 139 relay stations to ensure the stages ran day and night. A one-way fare of $200 delivered a very thrashed and tired passenger into San Francisco in 25 to 28 days. After traveling the route, &quot;New York Herald&quot; reporter Waterman Ormsby said, &quot;I now know what Hell is like. I&#x27;ve just had 24 days of it.&quot;

The ultimate competitor arrived in 1869, the first transcontinental railroad, which cut travel time to about seven days at a low fare of about $60 (economy)

==Legacy==
One of the enduring legacies of the Oregon Trail is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast. Without the many thousands of United States settlers in Oregon and California, and thousands more on their way each year, it is highly unlikely that this would have occurred.

===Arts, entertainment, and media===
The western expansion, and the Oregon Trail in particular, inspired numerous creative works about the settlers&#x27; experiences.

====Commemorative coin====
The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was coined to commemorate the route. Issued intermittently between 1926 and 1939, 202,928 were sold to the public. With 131,050 minted in 1926, that year&#x27;s issue remains readily available for collectors.

====Music====
The Oregon Trail has featured in various songs, especially in western music genres.

&quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; is a song written by Peter DeRose and Billy Hill, recorded by singing cowboy artist Tex Ritter in 1935, and by Australian country musician Tex Morton in 1936.

Woody Guthrie wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; while traveling in the region in 1941. It was the opening track in his &quot;Columbia River Collection&quot; album.

====Games====
The story of the Oregon Trail inspired the educational video game series &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, which became widely popular in the 1980s and early 1990s.

In 2014, a musical named &quot;The Trail to Oregon!&quot;, based on &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; game, with music and lyrics by Jeff Blim and a book by Jeff Blim, Nick Lang and Matt Lang was performed in Chicago and later posted to YouTube by StarKid Productions.

====Television====
&quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; was a television series that ran from September 22 through October 26, 1977, on NBC. The show stars Rod Taylor, Tony Becker, Darleen Carr, Charles Napier, and Ken Swofford. Although the show was canceled after six episodes, the remaining seven episodes were later aired on BBC 2 in the United Kingdom, the entire series was shown in the UK on BBC1, from November 1977 to January 1978, and on April 13, 2010, Timeless Media Group (TMG) released in the USA the entire show on six DVDs, running 750 minutes. The set includes 14 original episodes, including the feature-length pilot and the six episodes that did not air on NBC.

The episode of &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; titled &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; parodies expeditions that took place on the Oregon Trail, as well as the 1985 video game &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.

====Film====
The 1930 Western film &quot;The Big Trail&quot; featured John Wayne in his first starring role as a fur trapper leading a large wagon train of settlers across the Oregon Trail.

The 1967 film &quot;The Way West&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, and Richard Widmark, was based on the novel of the same name by A. B. Guthrie, Jr. It follows a wagon train of settlers as they make their way from Missouri to Oregon in 1843.

The animated film &quot;Calamity, a Childhood of Martha Jane Cannary&quot; portrays the expedition of a dozen wagons to Oregon, part of which was the young Calamity Jane.

<text>St John&#x27;s College, formally the College of St John the Evangelist in the University of Cambridge, is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, founded by the Tudor matriarch Lady Margaret Beaufort. In constitutional terms, the college is a charitable corporation established by a charter dated 9 April 1511. The aims of the college, as specified by its statutes, are the promotion of education, religion, learning and research. It is one of the largest Oxbridge colleges in terms of student numbers. For 2022, St John&#x27;s was ranked 6th of 29 colleges in the Tompkins Table (the annual league table of Cambridge colleges) with over 35 per cent of its students earning first-class honours. It is the second wealthiest college in Oxford and Cambridge, after its neighbour Trinity College, Cambridge.

Members of the college include the winners of twelve Nobel Prizes, seven prime ministers, twelve archbishops of various countries, at least two princes and three saints. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth studied at St John&#x27;s, as did William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, two abolitionists who led the movement that brought slavery to an end in the British Empire. Prince William was affiliated with the college while undertaking a university-run course in estate management in 2014.

St John&#x27;s is well known for its choir, its members&#x27; success in a variety of inter-collegiate sporting competitions and its annual May Ball. The Cambridge Apostles and the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club were founded by members of the college. The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race tradition began with a St John&#x27;s student and the college boat club, Lady Margaret Boat Club, is the oldest in the university. In 2011, the college celebrated its quincentenary, an event marked by a visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

==History==

The site was originally occupied by the Hospital of St John the Evangelist, probably founded around 1200. The hospital infirmary was located where the east end of the current chapel now stands. By 1470 Thomas Rotherham, Chancellor of the university, extended to the hospital the privileges of membership of the university. This led to St John&#x27;s House, as it was then known, being conferred the status of a college. By the early 16th century the hospital was dilapidated and suffering from a lack of funds. Lady Margaret Beaufort, having endowed Christ&#x27;s College, sought to found a new college, and chose the hospital site at the suggestion of John Fisher, her chaplain and Bishop of Rochester. However, Lady Margaret died without having mentioned the foundation of St John&#x27;s in her will, and it was largely the work of Fisher that ensured that the college was founded. He had to obtain the approval of King Henry VIII of England, the Pope through the intermediary Polydore Vergil, and the Bishop of Ely to suppress the religious hospital (which by then held only a Master and three Augustinian brethren) and convert it to a college.

The college received its charter on 9 April 1511. Further complications arose in obtaining money from the estate of Lady Margaret to pay for the foundation, and it was not until 22 October 1512 that a codicil was obtained in the court of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In November 1512 the Court of Chancery allowed Lady Margaret&#x27;s executors to pay for the foundation of the college from her estates. When the executors took over they found most of the old hospital buildings beyond repair, but they repaired the chapel and incorporated it into the new college. A kitchen and hall were added, and an imposing gate tower was constructed for the College Treasury. The doors were to be closed each day at dusk, sealing the monastic community from the outside world.

Over the following five hundred years, the college expanded westwards towards the River Cam and now has twelve courts, the most of any Oxford or Cambridge College. The first three courts are arranged in enfilade.

The college has retained its relationship with Shrewsbury School since 1578 when the headmaster Thomas Ashton assisted in drawing up ordinances to govern the school. Under these rulings, the borough bailiffs (mayors after 1638) had the power to appoint masters, with Ashton&#x27;s old college, St John&#x27;s, having an academic veto. Since then, the appointment of Johnian academics to the governing body, and the historic awards of &#x27;closed&#x27; Shrewsbury Exhibitions, have continued. A former Master of St John&#x27;s, Chris Dobson, was an &quot;ex officio&quot; governor of the school from 2007. 
St John&#x27;s College first admitted women in October 1981, when K. M. Wheeler was admitted to the fellowship, along with nine female graduate students. The first women undergraduates arrived a year later.
==Buildings and grounds==

===Great Gate===
St John&#x27;s Great Gate follows the contemporary pattern employed previously at Christ&#x27;s College and Queens&#x27; College. The gatehouse is crenellated and adorned with the arms of the foundress Lady Margaret Beaufort. Above these are displayed her ensigns, the Red Rose of Lancaster and Portcullis. The college arms are flanked by heraldic beasts known as yales, mythical creatures with elephants&#x27; tails, antelopes&#x27; bodies, goats&#x27; heads, and swivelling horns. Above them is a tabernacle containing a socle figure of St John the Evangelist, an Eagle at his feet and a symbolic, poisoned chalice in his hands. The fan vaulting above is contemporary with the tower and may have been designed by William Swayne, a master mason of King&#x27;s College Chapel.

===First Court===
First Court is entered via the Great Gate and is highly architecturally varied. First Court was converted from the hospital on the foundation of the college, and constructed between 1511 and 1520. Though it has since been gradually changed, the front (east) range is still much as it appeared when first erected in the 16th century. The south range was refaced between 1772 and 1776 in the Georgian style by the local architect, James Essex, as part of an abortive attempt to modernise the entire court in the same fashion. The most dramatic alteration to the original, Tudor court, however, remains the Victorian amendment of the north range, which involved the demolition of the original medieval chapel and the construction of a new, far larger set of buildings in the 1860s. These included the chapel, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, which includes in its interior some pieces saved from the original chapel. It is the third tallest building in Cambridge. The alteration of the north range necessitated the restructuring of the connective sections of First Court; another bay window was added to enlarge the college&#x27;s hall, and a new building was constructed to the north of Great Gate. Parts of the First Court were used as a prison in 1643 during the English Civil War. In April 2011, Queen Elizabeth II visited St John&#x27;s College to inaugurate a new pathway in First Court, which passes close to the ruins of the Old Chapel.

===Dining hall===
The college&#x27;s hall has a fine hammerbeam roof, painted in black and gold and decorated with the armorial devices of its benefactors. The hall is lined to cill level with linenfold panelling which dates from 1528 to 1529 and has a five-bay screen, surmounted by the Royal Arms. Above is a hexagonal louvre, dating to 1703. The room was extended from five to eight bays according to designs by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1863. It has two bay windows, containing heraldic glass dating from the 15th to 19th centuries. In 1564, Queen Elizabeth rode into the college&#x27;s Hall on horseback, during a state visit to Cambridge.

===Second Court===
Second Court, built from 1598 to 1602, has been described as &#x27;the finest Tudor court in England&#x27;. Built atop the demolished foundations of an earlier, far smaller court, Second Court was begun in 1598 to the plans of Ralph Symons of Westminster, and Gilbert Wigge of Cambridge. Their original architectural drawings are housed in the college&#x27;s library and are the oldest surviving plans for an Oxford or Cambridge college building. It was financed by the Countess of Shrewsbury, whose arms and statue stand above the court&#x27;s western gatehouse. The court&#x27;s Oriel windows are perhaps its most striking feature, though the dominating Shrewsbury Tower to the west is the most imposing. This gatehouse, built as a mirror image of the college&#x27;s Great Gate, contains a statue of the benefactress Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury, added in 1671. Behind the Oriel window of the north range lies the Long Gallery, a promenading room that was, before its segmentation, 148 feet long. In this room, the treaty between England and France was signed that established the marriage of King Charles I of England to Queen Henrietta Maria. In the 1940s, parts of the D-day landings were planned there. Second Court is also home to the college&#x27;s &#x27;triple set&#x27;, K6.


===Library===
The Old Library was built in 1624, largely with funds donated by John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln. Hearing of the college&#x27;s urgent need for greater library space, Williams donated £1,200 anonymously, later revealing his identity and donating a total of £2,011 towards the library&#x27;s total cost of £3,000. The library&#x27;s bay window overlooks the River Cam and bears the letters &quot;ILCS&quot; on it, standing for &quot;Iohannes Lincolniensis Custos Sigilli&quot;, or &quot;John of Lincoln, Keeper of the Seal&quot;. The original intention of the college had been to construct an elegant classical building supported by pillared porticos, but Bishop Williams insisted on a more traditional design. Thus, though the college lays claim to too few examples of neo-classical design, the library stands as one of the earliest examples of English neo-Gothic architecture.

===Third Court===
Third Court is entered through Shrewsbury Tower, which from 1765 to 1859 housed an observatory. Each of its ranges was built in a different style. Following the completion of the college library in 1624, the final sides of the Third Court were added between 1669 and 1672, after the college had recovered from the trauma of the English Civil War. The additions included a fine set of Dutch-gabled buildings backing onto the River Cam and a &#x27;window-with-nothing-behind-it&#x27; that was designed to solve the problem of connecting the windowed library with the remainder of the court.

===Kitchen or Wren Bridge===
This was the first stone bridge erected at St John&#x27;s College, continuing from Kitchen Lane. The crossing lies south of the Bridge of Sighs and was a replacement for a wooden bridge that had stood on the site since the foundation&#x27;s early days as a hospital. Though Sir Christopher Wren submitted designs for the bridge, it was eventually built on a different site by a local mason, Robert Grumbold, who also built Trinity College Library. As with the Library, Grumbold&#x27;s work was based on Wren&#x27;s designs, and the bridge has become known as &quot;the Wren Bridge&quot;.

===Kitchen Court===
This tiny court, formed within the walls of the old Kitchen Lane, is used as an outdoor dining area.

===Bridge of Sighs===
Though it bears little resemblance to its namesake in Venice, the bridge connecting Third Court to New Court, originally known as New Bridge, is now commonly known as the Bridge of Sighs. It is one of the most photographed buildings in Cambridge and was described by the visiting Queen Victoria as &quot;so pretty and picturesque&quot;. It is a single-span bridge of stone with a highly decorative Neo-Gothic covered footwalk over with traceried openings. There is a three-bay arcade at the east end of the bridge. The architect was Henry Hutchinson.

===New Court===

The 19th-century neo-Gothic New Court, probably one of the best-known buildings in Cambridge, was the first major building to be built by the college on the west side of the river. Designed by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson, New Court was constructed between 1826 and 1831 to accommodate the college&#x27;s rapidly increasing numbers of students. Despite the college&#x27;s original intention to get the architects to build another copy of the Second Court, plans were accepted for a fashionably romantic building in the &#x27;Gothic&#x27; style. It is also likely that the decision to utilise the neo-Gothic style was made to emulate and compete with the neo-Gothic screen of King&#x27;s College, designed by William Wilkins and already two years under construction at the time of John&#x27;s commission. It is a three-sided court of tall Gothic Revival buildings, closed on the fourth side by an open, seven-bayed cross-vaulted cloister and gateway. It is four storeys high, has battlements and is pinnacled. The main portal features a fan vault with a large octagonal pendant, which resembles that of the ceiling found in Bishop Alcock&#x27;s late 15th-century chapel in Ely Cathedral. The interior of the main building retains many of its original features including ribbed plaster ceilings. Its prominent location (particularly when glimpsed from the river) and flamboyant, tiered design have led it to be nicknamed &quot;The Wedding Cake&quot;.

===Chapel===
The Chapel of St John&#x27;s College is entered by the northwest corner of First Court. It was constructed between 1866 and 1869 to replace the smaller mediaeval chapel which dated back to the 13th century. When in 1861 the college&#x27;s administration decided that a new building was needed, Sir George Gilbert Scott was selected as the architect. He had recently finished work on the chapel at Exeter College, Oxford, and went about constructing the chapel of St John&#x27;s College along similar lines, drawing inspiration from Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.

The benefactor Henry Hoare offered a downpayment of £3000 to finance the chapel&#x27;s construction, in addition to which he promised to pay £1000 a year if a tower were added to Scott&#x27;s original plans, which had included only a small flèche. Work began, but Hoare&#x27;s death from a railway accident left the college £3000 short of his expected benefaction. The tower was completed, replete with louvres but left without bells; it is based on Pershore Abbey. The tower is high.

The chapel&#x27;s antechamber contains statues of Lady Margaret Beaufort and John Fisher. Inside the building is a stone-vaulted ante-chapel, at the end of which hangs a &#x27;Deposition of the Cross&#x27; by Anton Rafael Mengs, completed around 1777. The misericords and panelling date from 1516, and were salvaged from the old chapel. The chapel contains some 15th-century glass, but most was cast by Clayton and Bell, Hardman, and Wailes, in around 1869. Freestanding statues and plaques commemorate college benefactors such as James Wood, Master 1815–39, as well as alumni including William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and William Gilbert. The college tower can be climbed and is accessed via a small door on First Court. However, this access was closed in 2016 for the duration that important structural repairs were carried out to the tower Pinnacles and roof.

The chapel is surrounded on three sides by large tabernacles which form part of the external buttresses. Each contains a statue of a prominent college alumnus, alumna or benefactor. The people commemorated are, beginning with the buttress next to the transept on the south side:

===Master&#x27;s Lodge and garden===
St John&#x27;s Master&#x27;s Lodge is located in a grassy clearing to the north of Third Court. It was built at the same time as the new chapel was being constructed and has Tudor fittings, wainscot, portraits and other relics from the demolished north wing of First Court. It has a large garden, and in the winter its westmost rooms have excellent views of the college&#x27;s old library, the River Cam, and the Bridge of Sighs. The architect was Sir George Gilbert Scott.

===School of Pythagoras===
To the west of the Cripps Building lies the School of Pythagoras. Built around 1200, it predates the college by 300 years and is both the oldest secular building in Cambridge and the oldest building continuously in use by a university in Britain. The building now serves as the location for the College Archives. Next to the School of Pythagoras lies Merton Hall. From 1266 until 1959 both the School of Pythagoras and Merton Hall were the property of Merton College, Oxford. Merton Court is the college&#x27;s eleventh and westernmost court.

===Buildings and courts since 1900===

Located to the west of the chapel tower lies Chapel Court, which was constructed together with North Court and Forecourt in the 1930s to account for an increase in student numbers. North Court is located just north of Chapel Court and Forecourt is situated to the east, facing St John&#x27;s Street. The latter is used partly as a car park for fellows and leads to what is now the principal porters&#x27; lodge and entrance to the college. All three courts were designed by the architect Edward Maufe.

Further increases in student numbers following the Second World War prompted the college to increase the number of accommodation buildings. The Cripps Building was built in the late 1960s to satisfy this demand. It is located just behind New Court and forms two courts (Upper &amp; Lower River Court). Designed by architects Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, the building is Grade II* listed having received an award from the British Architectural Institution. It is considered an exemplar of late 20th-century architectural style and is named after its main benefactor, Humphrey Cripps. In 2014, the building went through an extensive refurbishment programme, which saw renovated accommodation and structural repairs, including the cleaning of the Portland stone from which the building was made.

In 1987 the construction of the Fisher Building was completed. Named after Cardinal John Fisher, the building contains teaching rooms, conference facilities, and a student-run college cinema. It was designed by the architect Peter Boston.

Located opposite the college&#x27;s Great Gate is All Saints&#x27; Yard. The complex is formed from the buildings of the so-called &quot;Triangle Site&quot;, a collection of structures owned by the college. An extensive renovation project finished in Michaelmas Term 2012 had a budget of approximately £9.75 million. The centrepiece of the Yard is Corfield Court, named after the project&#x27;s chief benefactor, Charles Corfield. The site can be entered through one of two card-activated gates or through the School of Divinity. The School of Divinity is the largest building on the site and was built between 1878 and 1879 by Basil Champneys for the University of Cambridge&#x27;s divinity faculty on land leased by St John&#x27;s College. Control of the building reverted to St John&#x27;s when the faculty of divinity moved to a new building on the Sidgwick site in 2000.

==College choirs==

The Choir of St John&#x27;s College has a tradition of religious music and has sung the daily services in the College Chapel since the 1670s. The services follow the cathedral tradition of the Church of England, with Evensong being sung during Term six days a week and Sung Eucharist on Sunday mornings. Since 2023 the choir has been directed by Christopher Gray, who was formerly the choirmaster and organist at Truro Cathedral. The boys and girls of the choir are educated and board at St John&#x27;s College School. During university vacations, the choir carries out engagements elsewhere. Recent tours have taken it to places including the Netherlands, the US and Japan.

The choir has an extensive discography of nearly 100 commercial releases dating back to the 1950s when it was signed to the Decca/Argo label under George Guest. The Choir has since had successful recording contracts with Hyperion Records and Chandos Records, resulting in many critical accolades including a &quot;Gramophone&quot; Editor&#x27;s Choice selection for 2015&#x27;s collection &quot;The Call&quot;. In 2016 the choir signed to Signum Records on its St John&#x27;s College imprint. The first recording of this venture was a collection of music by the contemporary composer Jonathan Harvey released in May 2016 to a number two position in the UK specialist classical charts. The imprint will also release non-choral recordings by current and former members of the college.

In October 2021, it was announced that girls and women would join the Choir of St John&#x27;s College, making it the first choir of an Oxford or Cambridge college to combine &quot;the voices of males and females in both adults and children&quot;.

The choral scholars and lay clerks of the choir also form their close harmony group, The Gents of St John&#x27;s. Their repertoire spans the 15th century through to the modern day, and concert tours have taken them to Europe, the US and Japan. They provide a mixture of classical &quot;a cappella&quot; music and folksongs, as well as covers of recent chart hits and light-hearted entertainment, and host an annual Christmas concert and garden party.

The college also had a mixed-voice adult choir, St John&#x27;s Voices, which was founded in 2013 to allow female members of the college to take part in the college&#x27;s choral tradition. It comprised around 30 members and premiered 3 works. In March 2024, St John&#x27;s Voices received written notice from the College of their disbandment by June 2024. This decision by the College was met with widespread controversy, as soprano undergraduates at the College would be unable to sing in a College Choir. This sparked a campaign by members of St John&#x27;s Voices against the disbandment, with an open letter stating that the decision was &quot;regressive&quot; and that the admission of female singers into the Choir of St John&#x27;s College had been &quot;weaponised against the very existence of another ensemble, supposedly in the name of broadening opportunities&quot;. The open letter received national media attention from The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent, with notable supporters including former Archbishop of Canterbury and Master of Magdalene College Rowan Williams, music director of the London Symphony Orchestra Sir Simon Rattle, mezzo-soprano Dame Sarah Connolly, and composer John Rutter.

==Traditions and legends==
===Shield and arms===
St John&#x27;s College and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge both bear the arms of Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of Henry VII. These arms are recorded in the College of Arms as being borne by right, and are described as &quot;Quarterly: 1 and 4 azure three fleurs-de-lis gold (France, Modern); 2 and 3 gules three lions passant gardant or (England); all within a border compony silver and azure&quot;. In addition, both foundations use the Beaufort crest, &quot;an eagle displayed arising out of a coronet of roses and fleurs-de-lis all gold&quot;, but their title to this is more doubtful. When displayed in their full achievement, the arms are flanked by mythical yales.
===Motto===
The college motto is the Old French &quot;souvent me souvient&quot; of Lady Margaret Beaufort. It is inscribed over gates, lintels and within tympana throughout the college, functioning as a triple pun. It means &quot;often I remember&quot;, &quot;think of me often&quot; and, when spoken (exploiting the homonym &quot;souvent me sous vient&quot;), &quot;I often pass beneath it&quot; (referring to the inscriptions). St John&#x27;s shares its motto with Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, which also honour Lady Margaret Beaufort.

=== Prayer ===
The College Prayer is spoken at the end of chapel services. It alludes to the gospel of John in which it is presumed the author mentions himself anonymously as the disciple Jesus loved:&quot;Bless, O Lord, the work of this College, which is called by the name of thy beloved disciple; and grant that love of the brethren and all sound learning may ever grow and prosper here, to thy honour and glory, and to the good of thy people, who, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, livest and reignest, one God, world without end. Amen.&quot;

===Grace===
The college grace is customarily said before and after dinner in the hall. The reading of grace before dinner (&quot;ante prandium&quot;) is usually the duty of a scholar of the college; grace after dinner (&quot;post prandium&quot;) is said by the president or the senior fellow dining. The graces used in St John&#x27;s have been in continuous use for some centuries and it is known that the &quot;ante prandium&quot; is based upon mediaeval monastic models. The grace is said shortly after the fellows enter the hall, signalled by the sounding of a gong, and accompanied by the ringing of the college&#x27;s Grace Bell. The &quot;ante prandium&quot; is read after the fellows have entered, and the &quot;post prandium&quot; after they have finished dining:

===Rivalry with Trinity===

St John&#x27;s remains a great rival of Trinity College, which is its main competitor in sports and academia. The rivalry can be traced to Henry VIII founding Trinity after having ordered the execution of John Fisher, whose efforts had ensured the foundation of St John&#x27;s. Over the years, numerous anecdotes and myths have arisen, involving students and fellows of both colleges. The rivalry is often cited as the reason why the older courts of Trinity have no &quot;J&quot; staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order (it should be mentioned that a far more likely reason is the absence of the letter &quot;J&quot; in the Latin alphabet). There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on Trinity&#x27;s bowling green pointing in the direction of John&#x27;s, though this orientation may be coincidental. Similarly, the eagle on top of the entrance to St John&#x27;s New Court is said to have been sculptured so that it shuns even the sight of its neighbouring rival. Generally, however, the colleges maintain a cordial relationship with one other; compatriotism led to the splitting of the atomic nucleus in 1932 by Ernest Walton (Trinity) and John Cockcroft (St John&#x27;s), for which they jointly received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics.

===New Court&#x27;s clock tower===

New Court&#x27;s central cupola has four blank clock faces. These are subject to various apocryphal explanations. One legend maintains that a statute limiting the number of chiming clocks in Cambridge rendered the addition of a mechanism illegal. No such limitation is known to exist. More likely explanations include Hutchinson&#x27;s fear that the installation of a clockface would spoil the building&#x27;s symmetry and that the college&#x27;s financial situation in the early 19th century made completion impossible.

Other legends explaining the absence of clockfaces claim that St John&#x27;s and its neighbour, Trinity were engaged in a race to build the final (or tallest) clocktower in Cambridge. Supposedly, whichever was finished first (or was tallest) would be permitted to house the &#x27;final&#x27; chiming clock in Cambridge. Trinity&#x27;s Tower was finished first (or, in another version of the same story, was made taller overnight by the addition of a wooden cupola), and its clock was allowed to remain. In truth, the completion of the New Court and Trinity&#x27;s Clock (which is in King Edward&#x27;s Tower) was separated by nearly two centuries. Trinity&#x27;s famous double-striking clock was installed in the 17th century by its then-Master, Richard Bentley, a former student of St John&#x27;s, who dictated that the clock chime once for Trinity, and once for his alma mater, St John&#x27;s.

===Consumption of swan===
Supposedly, Fellows of St John&#x27;s are the only people outside the royal family in the United Kingdom allowed to eat unmarked mute swans. The Crown (the British monarch) retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but the King only exercises his ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries. The ownership of swans in the Thames is shared equally among the Crown, the Vintners&#x27; Company and the Dyers&#x27; Company, who were granted rights of ownership by the Crown in the 15th century.

===Ghosts===
According to popular legend, St John&#x27;s is inhabited by some ghosts. In 1706, four fellows &quot;exorcised&quot; some ghosts from a house opposite the college by threatening to fire their pistols at the positions the moans and groans were coming from. The second court is supposedly haunted by the ghost of the former undergraduate and master, James Wood. Wood was so poor that he could not afford to light his room, and would often do his work in the well-lit stairway.

==Student life==
The buildings of St John&#x27;s College include the chapel, the Hall, the old library, a more contemporary &quot;new&quot; library, a bar, and common rooms for fellows, graduates and undergraduates. There are also extensive gardens, lawns, a neighbouring sports ground, a College School and a boat house. On-site accommodation is provided for all undergraduate and graduate students. This is generally spacious, and many undergraduate rooms comprise &quot;sets&quot; of living and sleeping rooms, where two students share a suite of two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. Members of the college can choose to dine either in the Hall, where silver service three-course meals are served six evenings per week or in the buttery, where food can be purchased from a cafeteria-style buffet.

The college maintains an extensive library, which supplements the university libraries. Most undergraduate supervisions are carried out in the college, though for some specialist subjects undergraduates may be sent to tutors in other colleges.

The college has two official combination rooms for junior members, which represent the interests of students in college and are responsible for the social aspects of college life. Undergraduates are members of the Junior Combination Room (JCR). Graduate students have a membership to the JCR, but also belong to the Samuel Butler Room (SBR), which is the Middle Combination Room (MCR) of St John&#x27;s College.

The fleet of punts is kept in a purpose-built punt pool behind the Cripps Building. Punt boats are available for use by all members of the college as well as alumni.

St John&#x27;s tends to be ranked near the middle of the Tompkins Table of undergraduate degree results, with an average position of 12.8 since 1997.

===Samuel Butler Room Society===

The Samuel Butler Room Society (SBR) is the Middle Combination Room (MCR) of St John&#x27;s College. The Society traces its foundation to 1960 when graduate student members submitted an application to the College Council for official separation from the Junior Combination Room (JCR). The name of the Society refers to the physical rooms which are used by members of the Society. The rooms were named after the noted Johnian author and polymath Samuel Butler. The membership of the Society comprises all members of the college who are registered graduate students of the college and affiliated students of the college.

===Sports===

The college has a sporting history, enjoying success in most of the major sports on offer in Cambridge. The college has a cardio gym and a weights gym on-site and has pristine pitches right behind the college.

The college&#x27;s hockey club is one of the biggest student sports clubs in the college, with over 50 active members as of 2024. It has had strong success including winning the Division One League title every year from 2019 to 2024. St John&#x27;s is the only Cambridge college to have more than one mixed hockey team, with four teams. Legend says that the founding of the hockey club predates the college itself.

The Red Boys, St John&#x27;s College Rugby Club, won the Division One League title for nine years in a row, before losing to Jesus in 2010–11, and the Cuppers trophy for 6 years in a row from 2006 to 2011, making it one of the most successful collegiate sports teams in Cambridge&#x27;s history. The Redboys occupy eighteen out of the twenty-four plates on the current Division One League Shield and thirteen out of the seventeen names on the Cuppers trophy. Since 2014, the club has taken home four Cuppers trophies (most recently in 2023 wherein they went undefeated and won the league title), three Division One League Shields, and the inaugural Sevens Shield in 2016–17. In the 2016–17 season, the Redboys went undefeated.

St John&#x27;s regularly produces a strong contingent of university players but also ensures new players develop and get game time swiftly. The rugby club has produced several notable alumni including former RFU executive Francis Baron, former Newcastle, England and Lions fly-half and former RFU Director of Elite Rugby Rob Andrew, and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; actor Jamie Bamber.

The college rowing club, the Lady Margaret Boat Club (LMBC), is the oldest in the university and was founded in 1825. Despite many rumours concerning the name of the club, it was merely the most successful of the many boat clubs established in the college in the 19th century. Similarly, the traditional rival of the LMBC, the Boat Club of Trinity College, is known as &quot;First and Third&quot; because of its formation from two original clubs.

===Scholarships and prizes===
Every year the college awards scholarships to a handful of graduate students under the Benefactors&#x27; and Scholarships Scheme. The most generous of all the early benefactors of St John&#x27;s College was Roger Lupton (died 1540), Provost of Eton and chaplain to Henry VIII. Lupton had amassed immense wealth through a lifetime of royal service and ecclesiastical pluralism and his scholarships exist today as the Lupton and Hebblethwaite Exhibitions. Other scholarships include the Craik Scholarship, the J.C. Hall Scholarship, the Luisa Aldobrandini Studentship Competition, the Paskin Scholarship and the Pelling Scholarship. Competition for these scholarships is very fierce as students from any country reading for any graduate degree—not only members of the college—can apply.
There is also the Adams Prize in mathematics, named after the mathematician (and alumnus of St John&#x27;s) John Couch Adams for his discovery of Neptune – it is an annual competition and can be awarded to any mathematician resident in the UK, with an age limit of under 40. The college is also associated with the Dr Manmohan Singh Scholarship, first awarded in 2008.

Students at the college wishing to practise law can apply for a McMahon Law Studentship to cover the expense of further study or obtaining professional qualifications.

Every year, students who excel academically and contribute to the life of the college can be nominated for the prestigious Larmor awards. The Awards are named after Sir Joseph Larmor, a former student at St John&#x27;s. Winners of the prize receive a unique handcrafted piece of silverware and a financial prize. Recent award winners include the actor Jonah Hauer-King and the violinist Julia Hwang.

===May Ball===
St John&#x27;s hosts a large and typically spectacular May Ball, which is traditionally held on the Tuesday of May Week. In recent years, tickets have only been available to Johnians and their guests. Highlights include an extravagant fireworks display and a variety of musical acts which in recent years have included Rudimental, Gorgon City and Katy B. The May Ball is organised by the committee, usually composed of 10 students from the college, with roles ranging from Head of Food, Drink, Security, Scene, Creative, Logistics, Employment, and the executive committee with a President, Vice-President and Junior Treasurer. The first ball took place in 1888 and has since been considered one of the most lavish end-of-year university parties. The theme is kept a secret until the night itself.

===St John&#x27;s and the abolition of the British slave trade===
Several of St John&#x27;s graduates were involved in the efforts to abolish the British Slave Trade that culminated in the Slave Trade Act 1807. In particular, Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce, Thomas Gisborne and Thomas Babington were active in the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and other abolitionist efforts.

As part of the commemoration of the bicentenary of the 1807 Act, and as a representative of one of the Ivy League universities offering an American historical perspective on the Triangular Trade, President Ruth J. Simmons of Brown University (herself a descendant of American slaves) gave a public lecture at St John&#x27;s College entitled &quot;Hidden in Plain Sight: Slavery and Justice in Rhode Island&quot; on 16 February 2007. St John&#x27;s College hosted some of the events relating to the commemoration, including an academic conference and a Gospel Mass in the College Chapel with the London Adventist Chorale.

<text>The Pulitzer Prize for Drama is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes that are annually awarded for Letters, Drama, and Music. It is one of the original Pulitzers, for the program was inaugurated in 1917 with seven prizes, four of which were awarded that year. (No Drama prize was given, however, so that one was inaugurated in 1918, in a sense.) It recognizes a theatrical work staged in the U.S. during the preceding calendar year.

Until 2007, eligibility for the Drama Prize ran from March 1 to March 2 to reflect the Broadway &quot;season&quot; rather than the calendar year that governed most other Pulitzer Prizes. 

The drama jury, which consists of one academic and four critics, attends plays in New York and in regional theaters. The Pulitzer board can overrule the jury&#x27;s choice; in 1986, the board&#x27;s opposition to the jury&#x27;s choice of &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot; resulted in no award being given. 

In 1955 Joseph Pulitzer, Jr. pressured the prize jury into presenting the Prize to &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, which the jury considered the weakest of the five shortlisted nominees (&quot;amateurishly constructed... from the stylistic points of view annoyingly pretentious&quot;), instead of Clifford Odets&#x27; &quot;The Flowering Peach&quot; (their preferred choice) or &quot;The Bad Seed&quot;, their second choice. Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; was selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for Drama by that award&#x27;s committee. However, the committee&#x27;s selection was overruled by the award&#x27;s advisory board, the trustees of Columbia University, because of the play&#x27;s then-controversial use of profanity and sexual themes. Had Albee been awarded, he would be tied with Eugene O&#x27;Neill for the most Pulitzer Prizes for Drama (four).

==Awards and nominations==
In its first 106 years to 2022, the Drama Pulitzer was awarded 91 times; none were given in 15 years and it was never split.

The most recipients of the prize in one year was five, when Michael Bennett, James Kirkwood, Jr., Nicholas Dante, Marvin Hamlisch, and Edward Kleban shared the 1976 prize for the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;.

==Notes==
== Musicals ==
Ten musicals have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, roughly one per decade from the 1930s to the 2020s¹. They are: George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; (1932), Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1950), Bock &amp; Harnick&#x27;s &quot;Fiorello!&quot; (1960), Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1962), Marvin Hamlisch, Edward Kleban, James Kirkwood, Jr., and Nicholas Dante&#x27;s &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (1976), Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s and James Lapine&#x27;s &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; (1985), Jonathan Larson&#x27;s &quot;Rent&quot; (1996), Brian Yorkey and Tom Kitt&#x27;s &quot;Next to Normal&quot; (2010), Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s &quot;Hamilton&quot; (2016), and Michael R. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; (2020). Though it did not win for Drama, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize in 1944.

Of note, &quot;South Pacific&quot; won the 1950 Pulitzer for Drama but its source material, James Michener&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, also won the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

&quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; and &quot;Next to Normal&quot; are the only musicals that won the Pulitzer Prize and did not also win the Tony Award for Best Musical; the latter won the authors Tonys for Best Original Score and Best Orchestrations. &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; opened before the Tony Awards existed.

The award goes to the playwright, although production of the play is also taken into account. In the case of a musical being awarded the prize, the composer, lyricist and book writer are generally the recipients. An exception to this was the first Pulitzer ever awarded to a musical: when &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; won in 1932, book authors George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, as well as lyricist Ira Gershwin, were cited as the winners, while composer George Gershwin&#x27;s contribution was overlooked by the committee. The reason given was that the Pulitzer Prize for Drama is a &quot;dramatic&quot; award, and not a &quot;musical&quot; one. However, by 1950 the Pulitzer committee included composer Richard Rodgers as a recipient when &quot;South Pacific&quot; won the award, in recognition of music as an integral and important part of the theatrical experience.

Additionally, since 1983, when the identity of finalists was first disclosed, five musicals have been finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. They are: Lee Breuer and Bob Telson&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel at Colonus&quot; (1985); Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes&#x27; &quot;In the Heights&quot; (2009); Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron&#x27;s &quot;Fun Home&quot; (2014); Taylor Mac&#x27;s &quot;A 24-Decade History of Popular Music&quot; (2017); and David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori&#x27;s &quot;Soft Power&quot; (2020).

¹All listed dates are Prize years. Generally, the musical in question opened in New York during either the preceding calendar year or the preceding Broadway season.

==Multiple wins and nominations==

Gurney, Richard Greenberg, Tina Howe, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Stephen Karam, Sarah Ruhl and Jeanine Tesori have each been named finalists twice without winning. David Henry Hwang is the only person to have been named a finalist thrice without winning. Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeanine Tesori are the only people to be named as a finalist twice for writing and composing a musical, with Miranda winning in 2016.

<text>Occupational therapists (OTs) are health care professionals specializing in occupational therapy and occupational science. OTs and occupational therapy assistants (OTAs) use scientific bases and a holistic perspective to promote a person&#x27;s ability to fulfill their daily routines and roles. OTs have training in the physical, psychological, and social aspects of human functioning deriving from an education grounded in anatomical and physiological concepts, and psychological perspectives. They enable individuals across the lifespan by optimizing their abilities to perform activities that are meaningful to them (&quot;occupations&quot;). Human occupations include activities of daily living, work/vocation, play, education, leisure, rest and sleep, and social participation.

OTs work in a variety of fields, including pediatrics, orthopedics, neurology, low vision therapy, physical rehabilitation, mental health, assistive technology, oncological rehabilitation, and geriatrics. OTs are employed in healthcare settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, residential care facilities, home health agencies, outpatient rehabilitation centers, etc. OTs are also employed by school systems, and as consultants by businesses to address employee work-related safety and productivity. Many OTs are also self-employed and own independent practices. In the United States, OTs are also employed as commissioned officers in the Army, Navy and Air force branches of the military. In the US Army, OTs are part of the Army Medical Specialist Corps. OTs are also a part of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one of eight uniformed services of the United States.

Occupational therapy interventions are aimed to restore/ improve functional abilities, and/or alleviate/ eliminate limitations or disabilities through compensatory/adaptive methods/and or drug use. OTs, thus, evaluate and address both the individual&#x27;s capacities and his/ her environment (physical and psycho-social) in order to help the individual optimize their function and fulfill their occupational roles. They often recommend adaptive equipment/ assistive technology products and provide training in its use to help mitigate limitations and enhance safety.

== Preparation and qualifications ==

To practice as an occupational therapist, the individual trained in the United States:
* Has graduated from an occupational therapy program (currently at the master&#x27;s or doctoral levels) accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) or predecessor organizations;
* Has successfully completed a period of supervised fieldwork experience required by the recognized educational institution where the applicant met the academic requirements of an educational program for occupational therapists that is accredited by ACOTE or predecessor organizations;
* Has passed a nationally recognized registration examination for occupational therapists (OTR, for &quot;Occupational Therapist, Registered, Licensed&quot;) administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT); and
* Fulfills state requirements for licensure, certification, or registration.

== Places of work ==
Employment may include hospitals, clinics, day and community-based rehabilitation centers, home care programs, special schools, industry, and private enterprise. Many occupational therapists work in private practice and as educators and consultants. Occupational therapist practitioners (OTPs) also work in community outreach, after school programs, community centers, and anywhere meaningful life activities occur. Occupational therapists meet clients in natural settings where real life activities and routines occur.

== Role ==
Occupational therapists are skilled healthcare professionals who promote participation, health, and well-being through meaningful engagement in everyday activities. One of their main goals is to help their patients function effectively in their roles and routines in everyday life.

Occupational therapy practitioners work with clients of all ages in diverse practice areas, some of which include rehabilitation after illness/injury, pediatrics, mental health, geriatrics, assistive technology, health and wellness, pain management, work/industry, and community accessibility.

Occupational therapists may promote client participation and independence in life by strengthening client factors and performance skills such as physical, cognitive, and perceptual abilities. OTs may also help clients achieve their desired outcomes by facilitating their use of adaptive strategies, adaptive equipment, and/or environmental modifications.

Occupational therapists focus on providing a client-centered, holistic approach to each patient, using therapeutic interventions geared toward the person, occupation, and environment. Occupational therapists bring attention to a person&#x27;s unique identity, abilities, strengths, interests, and environment to provide strategies and techniques that will allow clients to live life to the fullest. Occupational therapists foster promotion of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and a sense of achievement through doing, being, and belonging in a client&#x27;s choice of activities, roles, routines, contexts, and environments. Occupational therapists can also provide prevention and education regarding physical, mental, and social-emotional aspects of health and wellness within the realm of prevention, promotion, and intervention.

Occupational therapists are often involved in multidisciplinary teams that may include health care practitioners such as physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, rehabilitation psychologists, and social workers. Building effective partnerships with other professionals in the interest of quality service provision to clients are essential to valuable practice. Collaboration with members of the client&#x27;s team enriches interdisciplinary communication and ensures the best outcomes for clients. The client and their family and caregivers remain the central focus and driving force of the team.

===Work-related therapy===
Some occupational therapists treat individuals whose ability to function in a work environment has been impaired. These practitioners arrange employment, evaluate the work environment, plan work activities, and assess the client&#x27;s progress. Therapists also may collaborate with the client and the employer to modify the work environment so that the work can be successfully completed.

===Pediatric practice===
Pediatric occupational therapists support their communities by providing services to infants, toddlers, children, youth, and their families across a variety of settings that might include schools, clinics, and homes. They do this by implementing intervention that is driven by science and backed by evidence. A child&#x27;s life is made up of &quot;occupations&quot;. These &quot;occupations&quot;, or daily activities, include play, learning, and socializing. The role of the pediatric occupational therapist is to support the child in any environment in which the child is not able to carry out the desired occupations. The most common areas of practice for a pediatric occupational therapist include: neonatal intensive care units (NICU), early intervention, schools, and outpatient services. Areas of emerging practice include primary care and community-based.

==== Neonatal intensive care units (NICU) ====
From the beginning of life, occupational therapists might work with infants who are medically fragile in NICU of medical centers. An occupational therapist might address areas such as feeding/nutrition, positioning, development, sensory processing and integration, and sleep.

==== Early intervention ====
An occupational therapist may work with children in early intervention, from birth to three years old. The role of the occupational therapist is to support the child&#x27;s needs by collaborating with the caregivers/parents. The goal of the occupational therapist in early intervention is to support the achievement of developmental milestones. They do this by providing intervention and education in the context of play and daily living. Therapeutic intervention may include feeding/nutrition, physical development, play skill development, social/emotional development. In early intervention, a strong emphasis is placed on parent/caregiver education. The reason Occupational Therapists are vital to the NICU, is due to the vulnerability of premature infants. NICU-based therapists teach the skills the infant needs to live optimally. However, they do this while simultaneously understanding the medical interventions occurring, and how these medical needs need to be worked around during a therapy session. Infants who received more therapy displayed better neurological behaviors. Occupational Therapists mainly focus on positioning the child, including equipment and how to promote optimal development.

==== Schools ====
Once a child is over the age of three and meets eligibility for special education services, the child may receive occupational therapy services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). In the school setting, the goal of occupational therapy is to support the implementation of the IEP. The occupational therapist might do this by providing direct or indirect services. Direct services might include individual or group services. Indirect services might include consultation with their school team, creating modifications and/or accommodations for the classroom, and/or providing training to the school team.

====Outpatient services====
Occupational therapists might also work with children in an outpatient clinic. When serving children in an outpatient clinic, services typically have to meet the criteria for medical necessity. Occupational therapists continue to focus on &quot;occupations&quot;; however, the &quot;occupations&quot; typically are related to medically necessary occupations such as safety and health.

==== Primary care ====
Primary care for occupational therapists is an emerging area of practice. Traditionally a primary care office included physician, physician assistant, nurse, or nurse practitioner. In this model, the physician is limited to diagnosing and medical management. The field of occupational therapy is advocating for occupational therapists to become a part of primary care teams. In regard to children, an occupational therapist could contribute by providing early parent training, developmental screenings, tips for wellness and prevention.

===Community-based===
Another emerging area of practice for occupational therapy is promoting health and wellness through community-based programming. Occupational therapist can do this by coaching and consulting in the community. It is implemented through not just the OTs but through the community stakeholders and those with disabilities themselves.

OTs work in community-based rehabilitation projects as trainers and educators to help teach community members while facilitating them and developing programs.

Some examples include backpack awareness, promoting physical activity in families, creating inclusive community environments such as churches and health facilities, advocacy at government levels, conducting rallies, etc.

===Human displacement===
This refers to forced movement of communities by environmental or social factors which causes loss of occupational activities. This is caused by a number of factors including natural disaster, famine, armed conflict or developmental and economic changes. Occupational therapists work with these displaced persons in order to help rebuild roles, routines, self-efficacy, so that occupational imbalance, injustice, or deprivation does not occur. Occupational therapists work through community-based programs that are client-centered and culturally sensitive.

===With older people===
Occupational therapy is very beneficial to the older population. Therapists help older people lead more productive, active, and independent lives through a variety of methods, including the use of adaptive equipment. Occupational therapists work with older people in many varied environments, such as in their homes in the community, in hospital, and in residential care facilities to name a few. In the home environment, occupational therapists may work with the individuals to assess for hazards and to identify environmental factors that contribute to falls. Occupational therapists are often instrumental in assessing for appropriate wheelchairs for older people who may need them. In addition, therapists with specialized training in driver rehabilitation assess an individual&#x27;s ability to drive using both clinical and on-the-road tests. The evaluations allow the therapist to make recommendations for adaptive equipment, training to prolong driving independence, and alternative transport options.

===Mental health===
During World War II, occupational therapy began to play a far bigger role in the treatment of soldiers in psychiatric hospitals run by or for the British military. Therapists found that engagement in occupation (usually crafts such as woodwork, sign writing, carpentry, etc.) was an effective intervention for increasing self-regulation and mental well-being in people with physical disabilities such as loss of limb and mental illness. In the decades since, occupational therapy has continued to advance and services in mental health now aim to promote positive mental health, prevent mental health problems, and help manage mental health challenges by providing client-centered care. According to the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (2019, p. 2), occupational therapists recognize that good mental health enables people to realize their potential, cope with life&#x27;s normal stresses, work productively, and contribute to their communities&quot;. Occupational therapists acknowledge the unique identities of each individual and their lived experiences and values choice and autonomy with one&#x27;s recovery journey to promote participation in meaningful occupations of everyday life. Occupational therapists address the needs of clients in all phases of mental health recovery and in all settings, ranging from acute inpatient mental health settings to community mental health settings. Occupational therapists also work with clients on a large continuum of mental health challenges, including clients with substance-use disorders, mental illness, eating disorders, stress-related challenges, trauma, and adverse experiences. Skilled interventions with clients may include:
* Self-regulation and coping strategies (e.g. mindfulness, grounding)
* Emotional awareness training and emotional regulation strategies, including advocacy
* Social emotional skills and training
* Social cognitive skills
* Training in executive functioning strategies
* Quality of life measures and awareness
* Implementation of healthy habits and routines
* Motivational interviewing
* Strategies to reduce stress
* Sensory modulation-related interventions to self-regulate
* Behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)
* Trauma-informed care
* Skills training with accommodations or compensatory strategies
* Mental health literacy
* Lifestyle redesign, a preventative occupational therapy intervention to promote wellness

===With terminally-ill patients===
Occupational therapy (OT) practitioners help patients with terminal illnesses and conditions by assisting them with their needs related to end-of-life support. All of the areas of a patient&#x27;s life including work, play and leisure are widely affected. An occupational therapist provides various treatment modalities to help such individuals to restore or maintain their deteriorating performance components by using their remaining capabilities to give them a sense of self-importance and a measure of self-confidence. The World Federation of Occupational Therapy (WFOT) recognizes the important role OT practitioners have in end-of-life care. In working with patients who have severe health conditions, disabilities and terminal illnesses, the OT clinician will help these individuals engage in meaningful, everyday occupations, as well as exercise the right to well-being and the best quality of life despite the unavoidable conclusion to their lifecycle. An OT practitioner understands the transactional relationship that exists between the individual, environment, and occupation; so that life enhancing, ongoing performance in quality of life activities are promoted. The WFOT recognizes an optimistic presence for OT in end-of-life care with an ongoing need for advocacy and support.

===With people experiencing chronic pain===
Occupational therapists often work within interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary teams (professionals such as physical therapists, nurses and physicians) to help individuals with chronic pain develop active self-management strategies. An area of specific concern to occupational therapists is the usage of a patient&#x27;s time but it is also common for occupational therapists to help people return to work, and to return to leisure and family activities. Occupational therapists may use a variety of interventions including biofeedback, relaxation, goal setting, problem solving, planning, and can use those tools within both group and individual settings. Therapists may work within a clinic setting, or in the community including the workplace, school, home and health care centers. Occupational therapists may assess occupational performance before and after intervention, as a measure of effectiveness and reduction in disability.

===Models===
Occupational therapists can work from a variety of models, both broad and discrete. Top-down approaches are considered more broad and focus on the occupation itself while taking into consideration the many contextual factors (environmental, social, cultural, etc.), in comparison to bottom-up approaches which are more narrow or discrete. These models include the Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO), Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP), Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement (CMOP-E), Model of Human Occupation (MOHO), and Ecology of Human Performance (EHP).

===Assessment===
In order for an individual or group to receive occupational therapy services they must first be referred by themselves, another health care provider, or through their support system (family, friends) to receive an occupational therapy evaluation. As part of the service delivery process, the evaluation consists of the initial occupational profile followed by an analysis of occupational performance. Occupational therapy evaluations and occupational therapy assessments are important in determining an individual&#x27;s skill set or deficiency. Through the occupational profile, which is a structured interview of the client, an occupational therapist can identify the client&#x27;s self-perceived strengths and limitations in participating in daily occupations and help create an individualized treatment plan that addresses the occupations that are meaningful and necessary to the client. As part of the occupational profile, an occupational therapist also seeks to identify physical and social supports and barriers to participation. Occupational therapists often gather additional information by communicating with the client&#x27;s support system, which may include a child&#x27;s parents/guardians, a student&#x27;s teacher, an adult&#x27;s spouse/siblings/friends, or a senior&#x27;s caretaker. The analysis of occupational performance may be gathered through standardized assessments, clinical observations of the client performing a set of tasks and activities, and analysis of the physical or social environment and context in which the client performs the occupations. Occupational therapist utilize skilled observation simultaneously with evaluation of motor and process skills and the effect on the ability of an individual to perform complex or instrumental and personal activities of daily living (ADLs). Occupational therapists are trained in the administration of standardized assessments across the lifespan from infancy to old age, although some standardized assessments require an occupational therapist to gain additional certifications to administer.

Examples of the types of assessments or skill areas occupational therapy practitioners assess include:
* Sensory processing skills
* Visual perception and visual motor skills
* gross motor and fine motor skills
* Handwriting
* Upper Limb Hand dexterity
* Cognition and intelligence
* School-based evaluations
* Developmental milestones
* Daily living tasks include dressing and eating
* Pain
* Executive functioning
* Environmental assessments
* Employment-based assessments
* Ergonomic assessments
Through the initial evaluation process, occupational therapists work with the client to establish an individualized treatment plan. Data is collected and recorded throughout the treatment process to be utilized to assess progress and guide ongoing client-centered intervention. This data is also frequently utilized for reimbursement of services. At the conclusion of therapy services, an occupational therapist will complete an outcome assessment which may include a re-evaluation.

Assessment may also be more broad such as assessing the accessibility of public spaces for all individuals. Occupational therapists can provide recommendations for building design to allow for access for all. Occupational therapists are also skilled at completing home safety assessments and altering the environment or providing accommodations for ways to complete occupations in the home and for increased safety of clients and caregivers. Occupational therapists can also complete driving assessments to determine the required accommodations in the car or the ability of an individual to safely drive. Furthermore, occupational therapists can work with whole organizations to assess their workspaces to ensure that the work demands and physical set up are conducive to safe working habits to prevent workplace injuries.

==Hand therapy==
Occupational therapy also plays a major role in the rehabilitation and recovery of patients who have hand injuries, as well as upper and lower extremity injuries. Occupational therapists play a significant role in collaborating with Hand/Orthopedic Surgeons, a patient&#x27;s employers and/or case managers in providing the best client-centered rehabilitation program. Occupational therapists treat conditions ranging from soft tissue injuries such as tennis elbow to neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome. An Array of Upper Limb assessments are utilized to provide a treatment care plan that is effective and appropriate for each person and their injury. Treatment modalities such as orthosis/splints, soft braces and education are examples of the common treatment tools that an occupational therapist will use during treatment. Hand therapy is a specialized field of occupational therapy and therapists that work in this area are highly skilled and knowledgeable in upper limb anatomy.

<text>The Corpus Juris (or Iuris) Civilis (&quot;Body of Civil Law&quot;) is the modern name for a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence, enacted from 529 to 534 by order of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. It is also sometimes referred to metonymically after one of its parts, the Code of Justinian.

The work as planned had three parts: the &quot;Code&quot; (&quot;Codex&quot;) is a compilation, by selection and extraction, of imperial enactments to date; the &quot;Digest&quot; or &quot;Pandects&quot; (the Latin title contains both &quot;Digesta&quot; and &quot;Pandectae&quot;) is an encyclopedia composed of mostly brief extracts from the writings of Roman jurists; and the &quot;Institutes&quot; (&quot;Institutiones&quot;) is a student textbook, mainly introducing the &quot;Code&quot;, although it has important conceptual elements that are less developed in the &quot;Code&quot; or the &quot;Digest&quot;. All three parts, even the textbook, were given force of law. They were intended to be, together, the sole source of law; reference to any other source, including the original texts from which the &quot;Code&quot; and the &quot;Digest&quot; had been taken, was forbidden. Nonetheless, Justinian found himself having to enact further laws; today these are counted as a fourth part of the Corpus, the &quot;Novellae Constitutiones&quot; (&quot;Novels&quot;, literally &quot;New Laws&quot;).

The work was directed by Tribonian, an official in Justinian&#x27;s court in Constantinople. His team was authorized to edit what they included. How far they made amendments is not recorded and, in the main, cannot be known because most of the originals have not survived. The text was composed and distributed almost entirely in Latin, which was still the official language of the government of the Eastern Roman Empire in 529–534, whereas the prevalent language of merchants, farmers, seamen, and other citizens was Greek. By the early 7th century, Greek had largely replaced Latin as the dominant language of the empire.

The &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; was revised into Greek, when that became the predominant language of the Eastern Roman Empire, and continued to form the basis of the empire&#x27;s laws, the &quot;Basilika&quot; (Greek: τὰ βασιλικά, &#x27;imperial laws&#x27;), through the 15th century. The &quot;Basilika&quot; in turn served as the basis for local legal codes in the Balkans during the following Ottoman period and later formed the basis of the legal code of Modern Greece. In Western Europe, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, or its successor texts like the &quot;Basilika&quot;, did not get well established originally and was only recovered in the Middle Ages, being &quot;received&quot; or imitated as private law. Its public law content was quarried for arguments by both secular and ecclesiastical authorities. This recovered Roman law, in turn, became the foundation of law in all civil law jurisdictions. The provisions of the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; also influenced the canon law of the Catholic Church: it was said that &quot;ecclesia vivit lege romana&quot; – the church lives by Roman law. Its influence on common law legal systems has been much smaller, although some basic concepts from the Corpus have survived through Norman law – such as the contrast, especially in the &quot;Institutes&quot;, between &quot;law&quot; (statute) and custom. The Corpus continues to have a major influence on public international law. Its four parts thus constitute the foundation documents of the Western legal tradition.

==Compilation process==

Justinian acceded to the imperial throne in Constantinople in 527. Six months after his accession, in order to reduce the great number of imperial constitutions and thus also the number of court proceedings, Justinian arranged for the creation of a new collection of imperial constitutions (&quot;Codex Iustinianus&quot;). The commission in charge of the compilation process was explicitly authorized to leave out or change text and to delete what was obsolete or contradictory. Soon, in 529, the Codex was completed and was conferred the force of law in the whole empire, replacing all earlier constitutions and the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;.

A little more than a year after the enactment of the first edition of the Code, Justinian appointed a commission headed by Tribonian to compile the traditional jurists&#x27; law in a new, shortened and contemporary codification: the &#x27;Digest or Pandects&#x27;. The traditional collection of jurists&#x27; law, Justinian believed, was so extensive that it had become unmanageable, necessitating a new compilation. The commission completed its work within three years, in 533.

Tribonian&#x27;s commission surveyed the works of classical jurists who were assumed in Justinian&#x27;s time to have the authority to clarify law () and whose works were still available. In total, there are excerpts from 38 jurists in the Digest.

==The four parts==

===Codex===
The &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot;, &quot;Codex Justinianeus&quot; or &quot;Codex Justiniani&quot; (Latin for &quot;Justinian&#x27;s Code&quot;) was the first part to be finished, on 7 April 529. It contained in Latin most of the existing imperial &quot;constitutiones&quot; (imperial pronouncements having force of law), back to the time of Hadrian. It used both the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; and the fourth-century collections embodied in the &quot;Codex Gregorianus&quot; and &quot;Codex Hermogenianus&quot;, which provided the model for division into books that were themselves divided into titles. These works had developed authoritative standing. This first edition is now lost; a second edition was issued in 534 and is the text that has survived. At least the second edition contained some of Justinian&#x27;s own legislation, including some legislation in Greek. It is not known whether he intended there to be further editions, although he did envisage translation of Latin enactments into Greek.

====Legislation about religion====
Numerous provisions served to secure the status of Christianity as the state religion of the empire, uniting Church and state, and making anyone who was not connected to the Christian church a non-citizen. The Christianity referred to is Chalcedonian Christianity as defined by the state church, which excluded a variety of other major Christian sects in existence at the time such as the Church of the East and Oriental Orthodoxy.

=====Laws against heresy=====
The very first law in the Codex requires all persons under the jurisdiction of the Empire to hold the Christian faith. This was primarily aimed at heresies such as Nestorianism. This text later became the springboard for discussions of international law, especially the question of just what persons are under the jurisdiction of a given state or legal system.

=====Laws against paganism=====
Other laws, while not aimed at pagan belief as such, forbid particular pagan practices. For example, it is provided that all persons present at a pagan sacrifice may be indicted as if for murder.

===Digesta===

The &quot;Digesta&quot; or &quot;Pandectae&quot;, completed in 533, is a collection of juristic writings, mostly dating back to the second and third centuries. Fragments were taken out of various legal treatises and opinions and inserted in the Digest. In their original context, the statements of the law contained in these fragments were just private opinions of legal scholars – although some juristic writings had been privileged by Theodosius II&#x27;s Law of Citations in 426. The Digest, however, was given full force of law.

===Institutions===

As the &quot;Digest&quot; neared completion, Tribonian and two professors, Theophilus and Dorotheus, made a student textbook, called the &quot;Institutions&quot; or &quot;Elements&quot;. As there were four elements, the manual consists of four books. The &quot;Institutiones&quot; are largely based on the &quot;Institutiones&quot; of Gaius. Two-thirds of the &quot;Institutiones&quot; of Justinian consists of literal quotes from Gaius. The new &quot;Institutiones&quot; were used as a manual for jurists in training from 21 November 533 and were given the authority of law on 30 December 533 along with the &quot;Digest&quot;.

===Novellae===
The Novellae consisted of new laws that were passed after 534. They were later re-worked into the &quot;Syntagma&quot;, a practical lawyer&#x27;s edition, by Athanasios of Emesa during the years 572–577.

==Continuation in the Eastern Empire==
As the administrative language of the Eastern Roman Empire shifted away from Latin, legal codes based on the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; were enacted in Greek. The most well known are: 
* the &quot;Ecloga&quot; (740) – enacted by emperor Leo the Isaurian;
* the &quot;Prochiron&quot; and &quot;Epanagoge&quot; (c. 879) – enacted by emperor Basil the Macedonian; and 
* the &quot;Basilika&quot; (late 9th century) – started by Basil the Macedonian and finished by his son, emperor Leo the Wise. 
The &quot;Basilika&quot; was a complete adaptation of Justinian&#x27;s codification. At 60 volumes it proved to be difficult for judges and lawyers to use. There was need for a short and handy version. This was finally made by Constantine Harmenopoulos, a Byzantine judge from Thessaloniki, in 1345. He made a short version of &quot;Basilika&quot; in six books, called &quot;Hexabiblos&quot;. This was widely used throughout the Balkans during the following Ottoman period, and along with the &quot;Basilika&quot; was used as the first legal code for the newly independent Greek state in the 1820s. Serbian state, law and culture was built on the foundations of Rome and Byzantium. Therefore, the most important Serbian legal codes: Zakonopravilo (1219) and Dušan&#x27;s Code (1349 and 1354), transplanted Romano-Byzantine Law included in &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;, &quot;Prohiron&quot; and &quot;Basilika&quot;. These Serbian codes were practised until the Serbian Despotate fell to the Turkish Ottoman Empire in 1459. After the liberation from the Turks in the Serbian Revolution, Serbs continued to practise Roman Law by enacting Serbian civil code in 1844. It was a short version of Austrian civil code (called &quot;Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;), which was made on the basis of &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;.

==Recovery in the West==
Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; was distributed in the West and went into effect in those areas regained under Justinian&#x27;s wars of reconquest (Pragmatic Sanction of 554), including the Exarchate of Ravenna. Accordingly, the &quot;Institutes&quot; were made the textbook at the law school in Rome, and later in Ravenna when the school relocated there. However, after the loss of most of these areas, only the Catepanate (southern Italy) maintained a Byzantine legal tradition, but there the &quot;Corpus&quot; was superseded by the &quot;Ecloga&quot; and &quot;Basilika&quot;. Only the &quot;Corpus&quot;&#x27;s provisions regulating the church still had any effect, but the Catholic church&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy and the Great Schism made even that irrelevant. In Western Europe, the &quot;Corpus&quot; may have spurred a slew of Romano-Germanic law codes in the successor Germanic kingdoms, but these were heavily based on the older &quot;Theodosian Code&quot;, not the &quot;Corpus&quot;.

Historians disagree on the precise way the &quot;Corpus&quot; was recovered in Northern Italy about 1070: legal studies were undertaken on behalf of papal authority central to the Gregorian Reform of Pope Gregory VII, which may have led to its accidental rediscovery. Aside from the &quot;Littera Florentina&quot; (a complete 6th-century copy of the &quot;Digest&quot; preserved in Amalfi and later moved to Pisa) and the &quot;Epitome Codicis&quot; (c. 1050; incomplete manuscript preserving most of the &quot;Codex&quot;), there may have been other manuscript sources for the text that began to be taught at Bologna, by Pepo and then by Irnerius. Irnerius&#x27; technique was to read a passage aloud, which permitted his students to copy it, then to deliver an excursus explaining and illuminating Justinian&#x27;s text, in the form of glosses. Irnerius&#x27; pupils, the so-called Four Doctors of Bologna, were among the first of the &quot;glossators&quot; who established the curriculum of medieval Roman law. The tradition was carried on by French lawyers, known as the Ultramontani, in the 13th century.

The merchant classes of Italian communes required law with a concept of equity, and law that covered situations inherent in urban life better than the primitive Germanic oral traditions. The provenance of the Code appealed to scholars who saw in the Holy Roman Empire a revival of venerable precedents from the classical heritage. The new class of lawyers staffed the bureaucracies that were beginning to be required by the princes of Europe. The University of Bologna, where Justinian&#x27;s Code was first taught, remained the dominant centre for the study of law through the High Middle Ages.

A two-volume edition of the Digest was published in Paris in 1549 and 1550, translated by Antonio Agustín, Bishop of Tarragona, who was well known for other legal works. The full title of the Digest was &quot;Digestorum seu Pandectarum tomus alter&quot;, and it was published by Carolus Guillardus. Vol. 1 of the Digest has 2934 pages, while vol. 2 has 2754 pages. Referring to Justinian&#x27;s Code as &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; was only adopted in the 16th century, when it was printed in 1583 by Dionysius Gothofredus under this title. The legal thinking behind the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; served as the backbone of the single largest legal reform of the modern age, the Napoleonic Code, which marked the abolition of feudalism, but reinstated slavery in the French Caribbean. Napoleon, as he waged total war on Europe, wanted to see these principles introduced to the whole of Europe because he saw them as an effective form of rule that created a more equal society and thus creating a more friendly relationship between the ruling class and the rest of the peoples of Europe.

The &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; was translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish in the 19th century. However, no English translation of the entire &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis &quot;existed until 1932 when Samuel Parsons Scott published his version &quot;The Civil Law&quot;. Scott did not base his translation on the best available Latin versions, and his work was severely criticized. Fred. H. Blume used the best-regarded Latin editions for his translations of the Code and of the Novels. A new English translation of the Code, based on Blume&#x27;s, was published in October 2016. In 2018, the Cambridge University Press also published a new English translation of the Novels, based primarily on the Greek text.

<text>In the United States, Social Security is the commonly used term for the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program and is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The Social Security Act was passed in 1935, and the existing version of the Act, as amended, encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs.

The average monthly Social Security benefit for September 2023 was $1,706. The total cost of the Social Security program for 2022 was $1.244 trillion or about 5.2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).

Social Security is funded primarily through payroll taxes called the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act (SECA). Wage and salary earnings from covered employment, up to an amount determined by law (see tax rate table), are subject to the Social Security payroll tax. Wage and salary earnings above this amount are not taxed. In 2024, the maximum amount of taxable earnings is $168,600.

Social Security is nearly universal, with 94 percent of individuals in paid employment in the United States working in covered employment. However, about 6.6 million state and local government workers in the United States, or 28 percent of all state and local workers, are not covered by Social Security but rather pension plans operated at the state or local level.

Social Security payroll taxes are collected by the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund and the federal Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund, the two Social Security Trust Funds. Social Security revenues exceeded expenditures between 1983 and 2009 which increased trust fund balances. The retirement of the large baby-boom generation and the failure of payroll taxes to keep pace with inflation are together lowering balances. Without legislative changes, trust fund reserves are projected to be depleted in 2033 for the OASI fund. Should depletion occur, incoming payroll tax and other revenue would be sufficient to pay 77 percent of OASI benefits starting in 2035.

With few exceptions, all legal residents working in the United States have an individual Social Security Number.

== History ==


Social Security timeline
* 1935 The 37-page Social Security Act signed August 14 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The legislation included Unemployment Insurance, Aid to Dependent Children, Old Age Insurance (OAI), and Old Age Assistance (OAA). The old age insurance program gradually developed into the Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance program, which is what Americans typically associate with &quot;Social Security&quot;.
* 1936 The new Social Security Board contracts the Post Office Department in late November to distribute and collect applications.
*1937 More than twenty million Social Security Cards issued. Ernest Ackerman receives first lump-sum payout (17 cents) in January.
*1936 John Sweeney became the first American citizen to officially receive a social security number. He began paying his assessment in 1936. He died in 1978 at the age of 61 years, so he never collected any social security retirement benefits after paying into the system.
* 1939 Two new categories of beneficiaries added: spouse and minor children of a retired worker
* 1940 First monthly benefit check issued to Ida May Fuller for $22.54
* 1950 Benefits increased and cost of living adjustments (COLAs) made at irregular intervals77% COLA in 1950
* 1954 Disability program added to Social Security
* 1960 &quot;Flemming v. Nestor&quot;. Landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that affirmed that Congress has the power to amend and revise the schedule of benefits. The Court also ruled that recipients have no contractual right to receive payments.
* 1961 Early retirement age lowered to age 62 at reduced benefits
* 1965 Medicare health care benefits added to Social securitytwenty million joined in three years
* 1966 Medicare payroll tax of 0.7% added to pay for increased Medicare expenses
* 1972 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program federalized and assigned to Social Security Administration
* 1975 Automatic cost of living adjustments (COLAs) mandated
* 1977 COLA adjustments brought back to &quot;sustainable&quot; levels
* 1980 Amendments are made in disability program to help solve some problems of fraud
* 1983 Taxation of Social Security benefits introduced, new federal hires required to be under Social Security, retirement age increased for younger workers to 66 and 67 years
* 1984 Congress passed the Disability Benefits Reform Act modifying several aspects of the disability program
* 1996 Drug addiction or alcoholism disability beneficiaries could no longer be eligible for disability benefits. The Earnings limit doubled the exemption amount for retired Social Security beneficiaries. Terminated SSI eligibility for most non-citizens
* 1997 The law requires the establishment of federal standards for state-issued birth certificates and requires SSA to develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant Social Security cardstill being worked on.
* 1997 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, (TANF), replaces Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program placed under SSA
* 1997 State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program for low income citizensSCHIP added to Social Security Administration (SSA)
* 2003 Voluntary drug benefits with supplemental Medicare insurance payments from recipients added
* 2009 No Social Security Benefits for Prisoners Act of 2009 signed.

A limited form of the Social Security program began, during President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, as a measure to implement &quot;social insurance&quot; during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Act was an attempt to limit unforeseen and unprepared-for dangers in modern life, including old age, disability, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widow(er)s with and without children.

Opponents, however, decried the proposal as socialism. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins wrote that during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senator Thomas Gore (D-OK) asked &quot;Isn&#x27;t this Socialism?&quot; She replied that it was not, but he continued, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a teeny-weeny bit of Socialism?&quot;

The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as coverage for the poor, dependent children, spouses, survivors and the disabled. Poor farms were common in the US before Social Security took effect, then most disappeared by about 1950. By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to get enough taxpayers to fund Social Security to how to provide more benefits. Changes in Social Security have reflected a balance between promoting &quot;equality&quot; and efforts to provide &quot;adequate&quot; and affordable protection for low wage workers.

== Major programs ==
The larger and better known programs under the Social Security Act are:
* Federal Old-Age (Retirement), Survivors, and Disability Insurance, OASDI
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF
* Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Medicare
* Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs for low income citizens, Medicaid
* State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program for low income citizens, SCHIP
* Supplemental Security Income, SSI
The SSA administers two of these programs (OASDI and SSI).

== Benefits ==
=== Benefit types ===
The Social Security program in the United States pays benefits to three broad categories of individuals: retired individuals and some family members, disabled persons and some family members, and survivors. Within these broad categories, the program defines more specific types of beneficiaries. For example, spouses and divorced spouses are distinct categories, with somewhat different eligibility requirements. Survivor benefits include several categories including aged widow(er)s, aged surviving divorced spouses, disabled widow(er)s, disabled surviving divorced spouses, paternal and maternal orphans, and widow(er)s caring for minor or disabled children.

As of 2023, there were about 66.8 million individuals receiving Social Security benefits. Individuals receiving Retirement Insurance Benefits constitute the largest group of beneficiaries, with 52.4 million retired workers or family members receiving monthly payments. Social Security Disability Insurance benefits were paid to 7.4 million disabled workers and 1.2 million dependents (children and spouses). About 5.8 million individuals, including 2 million children, received some type of survivor benefit from Social Security.

Some individuals qualify for more than one type of benefit, but program rules on dual entitlement generally prevent the payment of two full benefits. For example, a person eligible for a retirement benefit and a higher spouse benefit will receive the full retirement benefit and a partial spouse benefit. The dual entitlement rules disproportionately affect women (7 million women in 2022) because historically they have earned less than current or former husbands and this leads to retirement benefits for women that are often lower than the full spouse benefit for which they qualify.

In addition, Social Security beneficiaries with low income and limited resources may qualify for additional income through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. SSI is separate from the Social Security program, but it is administered by SSA. In 2022, 2.5 million Social Security beneficiaries received additional income through SSI.

=== System financing ===
Social Security payments to beneficiaries, which totaled $1.23 trillion in 2022, are generally financed by payroll taxes on workers in Social Security covered employment, trust fund reserves, and income taxation of some Social Security benefits. The payroll tax rate totals 12.4 percent of earnings up to the taxable maximum (the rate is 6.2 percent from workers and 6.2 percent from employers and 12.4 percent from the self-employed).

The OASI Trust Fund and the DI Trust Fund are legally separate. For employees and employers combined, the OASI payroll taxes are 10.6 percent and the DI payroll taxes are 1.8 percent. In 2022, trust fund reserves for the OASI and DI programs were $2.7 trillion and $118 billion, respectively. Income taxation of some Social Security benefits brought in $47.1 billion for OASI and $1.6 billion for DI in 2022.

Assessments of system financing often focus on the combined programs together (OASI and DI) and focus on key measures such as trust fund depletion date, actuarial balance over a 75-year period, and comparisons of program costs to U.S. GDP.

Regarding trust fund depletion, the Social Security Trustees in 2024, based on technical work by the Social Security Administration&#x27;s actuaries, project the combined OASDI trust fund will be depleted in 2035. In 2021, the Penn Wharton Budget Model (University of Pennsylvania) projected depletion in 2032–2034, depending on the shape of the economic recovery in the U.S. following the COVID-19 pandemic.

With regard to actuarial balance, the Social Security Trustees estimate a 75-year actuarial deficit of 3.61 percent of payroll. This is approximately the total payroll tax increase that would be necessary to keep the system solvent for 75 years. The figure is designed to illustrate the size of the deficit. Legislation could close the deficit in ways other than raising the payroll tax rate.

Because taxable earnings are a fraction of GDP, sometimes the system&#x27;s finances are put into context by using GDP. Social Security&#x27;s cost are 5.2 percent of U.S. GDP as of 2023. Program costs will rise to 6.3 percent of GDP by 2076, and then decline to 6.0 percent of GDP by 2097.

In the past, legislation has been enacted to prevent trust fund depletion. Should the trust funds be depleted, Social Security would still have revenue coming into the system from payroll taxes. The Social Security trustees estimate that revenue would be sufficient to pay 77 percent of the program&#x27;s benefits. There has been debate about a trust fund depletion scenario regarding whether monthly benefits would be lowered or whether full amounts would be paid but not on a timely basis.

The amount of the monthly Social Security benefit to which a worker is entitled depends upon the earnings record on which they have paid FICA or SECA taxes and upon the age at which the retiree chooses to begin receiving benefits. That said, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Flemming v. Nestor&quot; (1960) that no one has a contractual right to Social Security benefits.

Medicare is a separate program from Social Security, although disabled and aged (65 or older) Social Security beneficiaries qualify for Medicare. The financing for Medicare (United States) is also based on payroll taxes, trust fund reserves, and the taxation of some Social Security benefits.

=== Total benefits paid, by year ===

=== Primary Insurance Amount and Monthly Benefit Amount calculations ===
Workers in Social Security covered employment pay FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) taxes and earn quarters of coverage if earnings are above minimum amounts specified in the law. Workers with 40 quarters of coverage (QC) are &quot;fully insured&quot; and eligible for retirement benefits. Retirement benefit amounts depend upon the average of the person&#x27;s highest 35 years of &quot;adjusted [for inflation]&quot; or &quot;indexed [for inflation]&quot; earnings. A person&#x27;s payroll-taxable earnings from earlier years are adjusted for economy-wide wage growth, using the national average wage index (AWI), and then averaged. If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, these non-contributory years are assigned zero earnings. The sum of the highest 35 years of adjusted or indexed earnings divided by 420 (35 years times 12 months per year) produces a person&#x27;s Average Indexed Monthly Earnings or AIME.

The AIME is then used to calculate the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). For workers who turn 62 in 2024, the PIA computation formula is:

(a) 90 percent of the first $1,174 of average indexed monthly earnings, plus

(b) 32 percent of average indexed monthly earnings between $1,174 and $7,078, plus

(c) 15 percent of average indexed monthly earnings over $7,078

For workers who turn 62 in the future, the 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the computation formula will remain the same but the dollar amounts in the formula (called bend points) will increase by wage growth in the national economy, as measured by the AWI. Because the AIME and the PIA calculation incorporate the AWI, Social Security benefits are said to be wage indexed. Because wages typically grow faster than prices, the PIAs for workers turning 62 in the future will tend to be higher in real terms but similar relative to average earnings in the economy at the time age 62 is attained.

Monthly benefit amounts are based on the PIA. Once the PIA is computed, it is indexed for price inflation over time. Thus, Social Security monthly benefit amounts retain their purchasing power throughout a person&#x27;s retirement years.

A worker who first starts receiving a retirement benefit at the full retirement age receives a monthly benefit amount equal to 100 percent of the PIA. A worker who claims the retirement benefit before the full retirement age receives a reduced monthly benefit amount and a worker who claims at an age after the full retirement age (up to age 70) receives an increased monthly amount.

The 90, 32, and 15 percent factors in the PIA computation lead to higher replacement rates for persons with lower career earnings. For example, a retired individual whose average earnings are below the first bend point can receive a monthly benefit at the full retirement age that equals 90 percent of the person&#x27;s average monthly earnings before retirement. The table shows replacement rates for workers who turned 62 in 2013.

The PIA computation formula for disabled workers parallels that for retired workers except the AIME is based on fewer years to reflect disablement before age 62. The monthly benefit amount of a disabled worker is 100 percent of PIA.

Benefits for spouses, children, and widow(er)s depend on the PIAs of a spouse or a deceased spouse. Aged spouse and divorced spouse beneficiaries can receive up to 50 percent of the PIA. Survivor benefit rates are higher and aged widow(er)s and aged surviving divorced spouses can receive 100 percent of the PIA.

Federal, state and local employees who have elected (when they could) NOT to pay FICA taxes are eligible for a reduced FICA benefits and full Medicare coverage if they have more than forty quarters of qualifying Social Security covered work. To minimize the Social Security payments to those who have not contributed to FICA for 35+ years and are eligible for federal, state and local benefits, which are usually more generous, the U.S. Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The WEP provision does not eliminate all Social Security or Medicare eligibility if the worker has 40 quarters of qualifying income, but calculates the benefit payments by reducing the 90% multiplier in the first PIA bendpoint to 40–85% depending on the number of Years of Coverage. Foreign pensions are subject to WEP.

A special minimum benefit, based on an alternative PIA calculation, is available for some workers with long careers but low earnings. However, it is rarely higher than the regularly computed PIA and thus few workers qualify for the special minimum benefit. 32,000 individuals received the special minimum benefit in 2019.

The benefits someone is eligible for are potentially so complicated that potential retirees should consult the Social Security Administration directly for advice. Many questions are addressed and at least partially answered on many online publications and online calculators.
=== How workers can get estimates of benefits ===

The Social Security Administration (SSA) provides benefit estimates to workers through the Social Security Statement. The Statement can be accessed online by opening an online account with SSA called &quot;my Social Security&quot;. With that account, workers can also construct &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, helping them to understand the effect on monthly benefits if they work additional years or delay the start of retirement benefits. The &quot;my Social Security&quot; account also offers other services, allowing individuals to request a replacement Social Security card or check the status of an application.

A printed copy of the Social Security Statement is mailed to workers age 60 or older.

In 2021, SSA began producing &quot;Retirement Ready&quot; fact sheets, available online and as part of the online Statement, that tailor retirement planning information to different age groups (young, middle age, and older workers).

SSA also has a Benefits Calculators web page with several stand-alone online calculators that help individuals estimate their benefits and prepare for retirement. These include benefit calculators for spouses, calculators for persons affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision or the Government Pension Offset and calculators to determine a person&#x27;s full retirement age or the effect of the earnings test on benefits.

SSA also provides a life expectancy calculator to help with retirement planning.

=== Full retirement age (FRA) ===
If a person first claims a retirement benefit at the full retirement age (FRA), the individual will receive a monthly benefit amount equal to 100 percent of the individual&#x27;s primary insurance amount (PIA). If first claimed before the FRA, the monthly benefit amount is smaller than 100 percent of PIA and if claimed after the FRA the monthly amount is higher than 100 percent of PIA. Sometimes the full retirement age is referred to as the normal retirement age.

Historically, the FRA was age 65. The 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act gradually increased the FRA and, for individuals born in 1960 or later, the FRA is 67. The early retirement age (age 62) has not changed, but the monthly benefit amount paid at the early retirement age is lower if a person has a higher FRA. For example, when the FRA was age 65, the early retirement benefit was 80 percent of the worker&#x27;s PIA. For a person with a FRA of 67, the early retirement benefit is 70 percent of PIA.

Individuals who first claim retirement benefits after the FRA (and up to age 70) receive delayed retirement credits that increase the monthly benefit amount by 8 percent per year of delayed claiming. For example, if a person has a FRA of 67 and waits until age 70 to claim retirement benefits, the individual&#x27;s monthly benefit amount will be 124 percent of PIA.

When a retirement beneficiary dies, a widow(er) or surviving divorced spouse is generally eligible for a monthly benefit amount equal to that received by the retirement beneficiary. Thus, a worker who delays retirement increases both the monthly benefit amount of the retirement benefit and, ultimately, the benefit a survivor receives.

Many press articles, guides, and studies have focused on whether it is optimal to claim benefits at the full retirement age or some other age. The Social Security Administration produces a publication called &quot;When to Start Receiving Retirement Benefits&quot; that is designed to help individuals understand the issues involved in deciding when to begin benefits. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College produced a guide designed to help individuals make informed claiming decisions.

Between 1985 and 2015, claiming of retirement benefits at the early retirement age became much less common and claiming at the full retirement age or later more common. In 2019, 1 in 4 individuals claimed at the early retirement age. From 2009 through 2019, the percentage of men claiming retirement benefits after the full retirement age increased from 4.1 percent to 16.2 percent. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing recession and recovery on benefit claiming, however, are not yet known.

The full retirement age is relevant for some benefit types other than retirement benefits. For example, aged spouses and aged survivors who claim spouse or survivor benefits before the full retirement age receive reduced spouse or survivor benefits. The increase in the full retirement age from the 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act was phased in at a slightly different pace for survivor benefits and the full retirement age is 67 for survivors born in 1962 or later. Many aged survivors, however, are well past the full retirement age when the worker dies and thus can receive full survivor benefits immediately upon the worker&#x27;s death.

For some types of Social Security benefits, benefits are not reduced or increased based on the age the benefits are first claimed. For example, a full monthly benefit amount (100 percent of PIA) is paid to disabled workers regardless of the age at which benefits start. At the full retirement age, the Social Security Administration reclassifies disabled workers as retired workers but the individual&#x27;s monthly benefit amount is not affected.

=== Delayed benefits ===

If a worker delays receiving Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age, the benefit will increase by two-thirds of one percent of the PIA per month. After age 70 there are no more increases as a result of delaying benefits. Social Security uses an &quot;average&quot; survival rate at your full retirement age to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever a person retires. Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the &quot;average&quot; survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men. The other consideration is that workers have a limited number of years of &quot;good&quot; health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy.

=== Benefits while continuing work ===
Due to changing needs or personal preferences, a person may go back to work after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker&#x27;s spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn &quot;too much&quot;, the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, SSA deducts $1 from the worker&#x27;s benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if a person was receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) that person would lose all ($14,760) benefits. If a person made $1,000 more than $15,200/year they would lose $500 in benefits. People got no benefits for the months they worked until the $1 deduction for $2 income &quot;squeeze&quot; is satisfied. First social security checks are delayed for several monthsthe first check may be only a fraction of the &quot;full&quot; amount. The benefit deductions change in the year a person reaches full retirement age and are still workingSSA deducts only one dollar in benefits for every three a person earns above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.

=== Spouse&#x27;s benefits ===
The spouse or divorced spouse of a retirement beneficiary is eligible for a Social Security spouse benefit if the spouse or divorced spouse is 62 or older. The benefit amount is equal to 50 percent of the retirement beneficiary&#x27;s Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) if the spouse claims the benefit at the full retirement age or later. If a person is eligible for both a retirement benefit based on the person&#x27;s own work in Social Security covered employment and a spouse benefit based on a spouse&#x27;s work in covered employment, SSA will pay a total amount approximately equal to the higher of the two benefits. For example, if at the full retirement age, a spouse claims a retirement benefit of $300 and a spouse benefit of $450, SSA will pay the person a $300 retirement benefit and a $150 partial spouse benefit for a total benefit of $450.

A spouse is eligible after a one-year duration of marriage requirement is met and a divorced spouse is eligible for spousal benefits if the marriage lasted for at least ten years and the person applying is not currently married. Payment of benefits to a divorced spouse does not reduce the Social Security benefits of the retired worker or family members of the retired worker, such as the worker&#x27;s current spouse. A divorced person can claim spousal benefits once the former spouse is eligible for retirement benefits, regardless of whether the former spouse has claimed those retirement benefits.

Spousal benefits are reduced if claimed before the full retirement age. The reduction is 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month earlier than the full retirement age. This typically works out to between 50% and 32.5% of the retirement beneficiary&#x27;s Primary Insurance Amount. There is no increase for starting spousal benefits &quot;after&quot; the full retirement age.

Although Social Security rules are gender-neutral, spousal benefits are disproportionately paid to women. Because of trends in marriage and workforce participation, retirement benefits are projected to become increasingly important for women, but spouse and survivor benefits will remain common.

Because spouse benefits are a 50 percent benefit and because divorced individuals do not share resources with a current husband or wife, divorced spouse beneficiaries have poverty rates that are high. About 29 percent of divorced spouse beneficiaries are in poverty compared to only about 5.4 percent of married spouse beneficiaries.

There was a Social Security government pension offset that would reduce or eliminate any spousal (or ex-spouse) or widow(er)&#x27;s benefits if the spouse or widow(er) is also receiving a government (federal, state, or local) pension from work that did not require paying Social Security taxes. It was repealed by the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023 (H.R. 82), which President Biden signed on January 5, 2025. The basic rule was that Social Security benefits would be reduced by two-thirds of the spouse&#x27;s or widow(er)&#x27;s government pension. If the spouse&#x27;s or widow(er)&#x27;s government pension exceeds 150% of the &quot;normal&quot; spousal or widow(er)&#x27;s benefit, the spousal benefit was eliminated. For example, a &quot;normal&quot; spousal or widow(er)&#x27;s benefit of $1,000/month was reduced to $0.00, if the spouse or widow(er) was already drawing a non-FICA taxed government pension of $1,500 or more per month. Pensions from work where Social Security taxes were paid, did not reduce Social Security spousal or widow(er)&#x27;s benefits. Pensions received from foreign countries did not cause GPO; however, a foreign pension used to be subject to the WEP.

=== Widow(er) benefits ===
If a worker covered by Social Security dies, a surviving spouse can receive survivors&#x27; benefits if a 9-month duration of marriage is met. If a widow(er) waits until Full Retirement Age, they are eligible for 100 percent of their deceased spouse&#x27;s PIA. If the death of the worker was accidental, the duration of marriage test may be waived. A divorced spouse may qualify if the duration of marriage was at least ten full years and the widow(er) is not currently married, or remarried after attainment of age 60 (50 if disabled and eligible for specific types of benefits prior to the date of marriage).

A father or mother of any age with a child age 16 or under or a disabled adult child in his or her care may be eligible for benefits. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)&#x27;s benefit is age 60. If the worker received retirement benefits prior to death, the benefit amount may not exceed the amount the worker was receiving at the time of death or 82.5% of the PIA of the deceased worker (whichever is more). If the surviving spouse starts benefits before full retirement age, there is an actuarial reduction. If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their full retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit. If the worker died before the year of attainment of age 62, the earnings will be indexed to the year in which the surviving spouse attained age 60.

=== Children&#x27;s benefits ===
Children of a retired, disabled or deceased worker receive benefits as a &quot;dependent&quot; or &quot;survivor&quot; if they are under the age of 18, or as long as attending primary or secondary school up to age 19 years and 2months; or are over the age of 18 and were disabled before the age of 22.

The benefit for a child on a living parent&#x27;s record, is 50% of the PIA. For a surviving child, the benefit is 75% of the PIA. The benefit amount may be reduced if total benefits on the record exceed the family maximum.

In &quot;Astrue v. Capato&quot; (2012), the Supreme Court unanimously held that children conceived after a parent&#x27;s death (by in vitro fertilization procedure) are not entitled to Social Security survivors&#x27; benefits if the laws of the state in which the parent&#x27;s will was signed do not provide for such benefits.

=== Disability ===

A worker who has worked long enough and recently enough (based on &quot;quarters of coverage&quot; within the recent past) to be covered &quot;can&quot; receive disability benefits. These benefits start after five full calendar months of disability, regardless of his or her age. The eligibility formula requires a certain number of credits (based on earnings) to have been earned overall, and a certain number within the ten years immediately preceding the disability, but with more-lenient provisions for younger workers who become disabled before having had a chance to compile a long earnings history.

The worker must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work, with age, education, and work experience taken into account; furthermore, the disability must be long-term, lasting twelve months, expected to last twelve months, resulting in death, or expected to result in death. As with the retirement benefit, the amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the worker&#x27;s age and record of covered earnings.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) uses the same disability criteria as the insured social security disability program, but SSI is not based upon insurance coverage. Instead, a system of means-testing is used to determine whether the claimants&#x27; income and net worth fall below certain income and asset thresholds.

Severely disabled children may qualify for SSI. Standards for child disability are different from those for adults.

Disability determination at the Social Security Administration has created the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending on the state of residence, a claimant whose initial application for benefits is denied can request &quot;reconsideration&quot; or a &quot;hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)&quot;. Such hearings sometimes involve participation of an independent vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), as called upon by the ALJ.

Reconsideration involves a re-examination of the evidence and, in some cases, the opportunity for a hearing before a (non-attorney) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer decides the case and provides justification for the finding in writing. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an ALJ. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an ALJ.

Because the number of applications for Social Security disability is large (approximately 650,000 applications per year), the number of hearings requested by claimants often exceeds the capacity of ALJs. The number of hearings requested and availability of ALJs varies geographically across the United States. In some areas of the country, it is possible for a claimant to have a hearing with an ALJ within 90 days of the request. In other areas, waiting times of 18 months are not uncommon.

After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issues a decision in writing. The decision can be &quot;Fully Favorable&quot; (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled as of the date that (s)he alleges in the application through the present), &quot;Partially Favorable&quot; (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled at some point, but not as of the date alleged in the application; OR the ALJ finds that the claimant &quot;was&quot; disabled but has improved), or &quot;Unfavorable&quot; (the ALJ finds that the claimant was not and is not disabled). Claimants can appeal decisions to the Social Security Appeals Council, which is in Virginia. The Appeals Council does not hold hearings; it accepts written briefs. Response time from the Appeals Council can range from twelve weeks to more than three years.

Claimants who disagree with the Appeals Council decision can appeal the case in federal district court. As in most federal court cases, an unfavorable district court decision can be appealed to the appropriate United States Court of Appeals, and an unfavorable appellate court decision can be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

The SSA has maintained its goal for judges to resolve 500–700 cases per year but ALJs struggle to meet this goal. While 81% of ALJs met this productivity level in 2019, only 18% achieved this case disposition target in 2020. Office of Hearing Operations staffing and work procedure disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have doubtlessly contributed to lower ALJ productivity in 2020.

The debate about the social security system in the United States has been ongoing for decades and there is concern about its sustainability.

== Current operation ==
=== Joining and quitting ===
Obtaining a Social Security number for a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal requirement that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want, or have, to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About the only way to avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes is to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987 and various state and local workers, including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs, were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often less expensive to obtain higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now, only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the SSA estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.

It is possible for railroad employees to get &quot;coordinated&quot; retirement and disability benefits. The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (or &quot;RRB&quot;) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States government created in 1935 to administer a social insurance program providing retirement benefits to the country&#x27;s railroad workers. Railroad retirement TierI payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay TierI taxes at the same rate as social security taxes and have the same benefits. In addition, both workers and employers pay TierII taxes (about 6.2% in 2005), which are used to finance railroad retirement and disability benefit payments that are over and above social security levels. TierII benefits are a supplemental retirement and disability benefit system that pays 0.875% times years of service times average highest five years of employment salary, in addition to Social Security benefits.

FICA taxes are imposed on nearly all workers and self-employed persons. Employers are required to report wages for covered employment to the SSA for processing Forms W-2 and W-3. Some specific wages are not part of the Social Security program (discussed below). Internal Revenue Code provisions section 3101 imposes payroll taxes on individuals and employer matching taxes. Section 3102 mandates that employers deduct these payroll taxes from workers&#x27; wages before they are paid. Generally, the payroll tax is imposed on everyone in employment earning &quot;wages&quot; as defined in 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code. and also taxes net earnings from self-employment.

=== Trust fund ===
Social Security taxes are paid into the Social Security Trust Fund maintained by the U.S. Treasury (technically, the &quot;Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund&quot;, as established by ). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009, the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. government bonds. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government&#x27;s general purpose deficit spending. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid stood at $2.2trillion. Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; of the U.S. government, which has an obligation to repay its debt.

The SSA authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e. redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security&#x27;s ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government&#x27;s ability to make good on the bonds it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government&#x27;s ability to repay the Social Security Trust Fund is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of the U.S. Congress to meet its obligations.

In 2009, the Office of the Chief Actuary of the SSA calculated an unfunded obligation of $15.1trillion for the Social Security program. The unfunded obligation is the difference between the future cost of the Social Security program (based on several demographic assumptions such as mortality, work force participation, immigration, and age expectancy) and total assets in the Trust Fund given the expected contribution rate through the current scheduled payroll tax. This unfunded obligation is expressed in present value dollars and is a part of the Fund&#x27;s long-range actuarial estimates, not necessarily a certainty of what will occur in the long run. An Actuarial Note to the calculation says &quot;the term obligation is used in lieu of the term liability, because liability generally indicates a contractual obligation (as in the case of private pensions and insurance) that cannot be altered by the plan sponsor without the agreement of the plan participants.&quot;

=== Office of Hearings Operations (OHO, formerly ODAR or OHA) ===
On August 8, 2017, Acting Commissioner, Nancy A. Berryhill, informed employees that the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (&quot;ODAR&quot;) would be renamed to Office of Hearings Operations (&quot;OHO&quot;). The hearing offices had been known as &quot;ODAR&quot; since 2006, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals (&quot;OHA&quot;) before that. OHO administers the ALJ hearings for the SSA. Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) conduct hearings and issue decisions. After an ALJ decision, the Appeals Council considers requests for review of ALJ decisions, and acts as the final level of administrative review for the SSA (the stage at which &quot;exhaustion&quot; could occur, a prerequisite for federal court review).

=== Benefit payout comparisons ===
Some federal, state, local and education government employees pay no Social Security tax but have their own retirement and disability systems that nearly always pay better retirement and disability benefits than the SSA. These plans typically require vesting (working 5–10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement). But their retirement typically depends on only the average of the best 3–10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%–3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a &quot;reasonably good&quot; (75–85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary at which they were last employed. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firefighters who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100–67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively. University of California Retirement Plan retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in stock market securities, which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses. Short term federal government investments may be more secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are &quot;piggy backed&quot; on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current Federal Employees Retirement System, which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution Thrift Savings Plan.

The current Social Security formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone who worked in OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision is that the first salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what a person would be eligible for if they had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if a person has 30 or more years of &quot;substantial&quot; earnings.

The average Social Security payment of $1,230/month ($14,760/year) in 2013 is only slightly above the federal poverty level for a one-person household$11,420/yr and below the poverty guideline of $15,500/yr for two person households.

For this reason, financial advisers often encourage those who have the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans such as an employer-sponsored 401(k) (or 403(b)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee&#x27;s savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee&#x27;s salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings compared to savings using no retirement plans. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a &quot;good&quot; investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into &quot;good&quot; investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn compound interest until needed after retirement.

Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses &quot;self correct&quot;, and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(k)s, etc. before the age of , and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 73; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.

=== International agreements ===
People sometimes relocate from one country to another, either permanently or on a limited-time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future benefits or having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the SSA has signed treaties, often referred to as &quot;Totalization Agreements&quot;, with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.

Overall, these agreements serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, the situation that occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.

=== Social Security number ===

A side effect of the Social Security program in the United States has been the near-universal adoption of the program&#x27;s identification number, the Social Security number (SSN), as the &quot;de facto&quot; U.S. national identification number. The SSN is issued pursuant to section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as . The government originally stated that the SSN would not be a means of identification, but currently a multitude of U.S. entities use the SSN as a personal identifier. These include government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service as well as the military, in addition to private agencies such as banks, colleges and universities, health insurance companies, and employers.

Although the Social Security Act itself does not require a person to have an SSN to live and work in the United States, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code does generally require the use of the SSN by individuals for federal tax purposes:

::The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title.

Importantly, most parents apply for SSNs for their dependent children in order to include them on their income tax returns as a dependent. Everyone filing a tax return, as taxpayer or spouse, must have an SSN or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) since the IRS is unable to process returns or post payments for anyone without an SSN or TIN.

The Privacy Act of 1974 was in part intended to limit usage of the SSN as a means of identification. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section7 of the Privacy Act, an uncodified provision, states in part:

::(1) It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual&#x27;s refusal to disclose his social security account number.

However, the Social Security Act provides:

::It is the policy of the United States that any State (or political subdivision thereof) may, in the administration of any tax, general public assistance, driver&#x27;s license, or motor vehicle registration law within its jurisdiction, utilize the social security account numbers issued by the Commissioner of Social Security for the purpose of establishing the identification of individuals affected by such law, and may require any individual who is or appears to be so affected to furnish to such State (or political subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having administrative responsibility for the law involved, the social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) issued to him by the Commissioner of Social Security.

Further, paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of section7 of the Privacy Act provides in part:

::(2) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection &quot;shall not apply&quot; with respect to –
:::(A) any disclosure which is &quot;required by Federal statute&quot;, or

:::(B) the disclosure of a social security number to any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.

The exceptions under section7 of the Privacy Act include the Internal Revenue Code requirement that SSNs be used as taxpayer identification numbers for individuals.

=== Demographic and revenue projections ===

In each year since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, interest payments and other income had exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example by more than $150billion in 2004. However, as the &quot;baby boomers&quot; moved out of the work force and into retirement, expenses came to exceed tax receipts and then, exceeded all OASDI trust income, including interest, starting in 2018 (see chart Social Security Revenue and Cost, above). At that point the system began drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the then current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted.

When the costs of the Social Security program started to exceed income in 2018, the trust fund began to empty and, without changes made to the system, will be fully depleted in the future. In a survey of 210 members of the American Economics Association published in November 2006, 85 percent agreed with the statement: &quot;The gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large within the next fifty years if current policies remain unchanged.&quot;

Furthermore, increased spending for the Social Security program will occur at the same time as increases in demand for Medicare, as a result of the aging of the baby boomers. One projection illustrates the relationship between the two programs:

From 2004 to 2030, the combined spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to rise from 8% of national income (gross domestic product) to 13%. Two-thirds of the increase occurs in Medicare.

In May 2024, the Treasury Department issued the annual trustees report for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds with depletion date projections for the funds estimated at 2033 and 2098 respectively and by 2035 when combined.

==== Ways to eliminate the projected shortfall ====

The Social Security program is predicted to run out of money to pay all prospective benefits at today&#x27;s level of benefits in 2034. Ways to extend that date are as follows.

* Lift the payroll ceiling. The payroll ceiling is now adjusted for inflation. Robert Reich, former United States Secretary of Labor, suggests lifting the ceiling on income subject to Social Security taxes, which is $168,600 as of 2024.
* Increase Social Security taxes. If workers and employers each paid 8.0% (up from today&#x27;s 6.2%), it would provide solvency through 2090. Self-employed persons would pay 16.00% on earnings (up from today&#x27;s 12.4%) under this proposal.
* Raise the retirement age(s). Raising the normal retirement age by two months per year until it reaches 69 in 2034 would reduce payouts and improve solvency.
* Means-test benefits. A phase out of Social Security benefits for those who already have income over $48,000/year ($4,000/month) would eliminate over 20% of the funding gap. This is not very popular, with only 31% of surveyed households favoring it.
* Change the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Several proposals have been discussed. Effects of COLA reductions would be cumulative over time and would affect some groups more than others. Poverty rates would increase.
* Reduce benefits for new retirees. If Social Security benefits were reduced by 3% to 5% for new retirees, about 18% to 30% percent of the funding gap would be eliminated.
* Average in more working years. Social Security benefits are now based on an average of a worker&#x27;s 35 highest paid annual salaries with zeros averaged in if there are fewer than 35 years of covered wages. The averaging period could be increased to 38 or 40 years, which could potentially reduce the deficit by 10% to 20%, respectively.
* Require all newly hired people to join Social Security. Over 90% of all workers already pay FICA and SECA taxes, so there is not much to gain by this. There would be an early increase in Social Security income that would be partially offset later by the benefits they might collect when they retire.

== Taxation ==
=== Tax on wages and self-employment income ===
Benefits are funded by taxes imposed on wages of employees and self-employed persons. As explained below, in the case of employment, the employer and employee are each responsible for one half of the Social Security tax associated with the employee, with the employee&#x27;s half being withheld from the employee&#x27;s pay check. In the case of self-employed persons (i.e., independent contractors), the self-employed person is responsible for the entire amount of Social Security tax associated with the self-employed person.

The portion of taxes collected from the employee for Social Security are referred to as &quot;trust fund taxes&quot; and the employer is required to remit them to the government. These taxes take priority over everything, and represent the only debts of a corporation or LLC that can impose personal liability upon its officers or managers. A sole proprietor and officers of a corporation and managers of an LLC can be held personally liable for non-payment of the income tax and social security taxes whether or not actually collected from the employee.

The &quot;Federal Insurance Contributions Act&quot; (FICA) (codified in the Internal Revenue Code) imposes a Social Security withholding tax equal to 6.20% of the gross wage amount, up to but not exceeding the &quot;Social Security Wage Base&quot; ($97,500 for 2007; $102,000 for 2008; and $106,800 for 2009, 2010, and 2011). The same 6.20% tax is imposed on employers. For 2011 and 2012, the employee&#x27;s contribution was temporarily reduced to 4.2%, while the employer&#x27;s portion remained at 6.2%. In 2024, the Social Security Wage Base (the upper limit on earnings taxed) increased to $168,600. For each calendar year for which the worker is assessed the FICA contribution, the SSA credits those wages as that year&#x27;s covered wages. The income cutoff is adjusted yearly for inflation and other factors.

A separate payroll tax of 1.45% of an employee&#x27;s income is paid directly by the employer, and an additional 1.45% deducted from the employee&#x27;s paycheck, yielding a total tax rate of 2.90%. There is no maximum limit on this portion of the tax. This portion of the tax is used to fund the Medicare program, which is primarily responsible for providing health benefits to retirees and also pay benefits to those on disability.

The changes in Social Security tax rates over time can be accessed on the SSA website.

The combined tax rate of these two federal programs is 15.30% (7.65% paid by the employee and 7.65% paid by the employer). In 2011–2012 it temporarily dropped to 13.30% (5.65% paid by the employee and 7.65% paid by the employer).

For self-employed workers (who technically are not employees and are deemed not to be earning &quot;wages&quot; for federal tax purposes), the self-employment tax, imposed by the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954, codified as Chapter2 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, , is 15.3% of &quot;net earnings from self-employment.&quot; In essence, a self-employed individual pays both the employee and employer share of the tax, although half of the self-employment tax (the &quot;employer share&quot;) is deductible when calculating the individual&#x27;s federal income tax.

If an employee has overpaid payroll taxes by having more than one job or switching jobs during the year, the excess taxes will be refunded when the employee files an annual federal income tax return. Any excess taxes paid by employers, however, are not refundable to the employers.

By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations, the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average income tax of −9.3% and −2.6% and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average Total Federal Tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.

=== Federal income taxation of benefits ===
Originally the benefits received by retirees were not taxed as income. Beginning in tax year 1984, with the Reagan-era reforms to repair the system&#x27;s projected insolvency, retirees with incomes over $25,000 (in the case of married persons filing separately who did not live with the spouse at any time during the year, and for persons filing as &quot;single&quot;), or with combined incomes over $32,000 (if married filing jointly) or, in certain cases, any income amount (if married filing separately from the spouse in a year in which the taxpayer lived with the spouse at any time) generally saw part of the retiree benefits subject to federal income tax. In 1984, the portion of the benefits potentially subject to tax was 50%. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1993 set the portion to 85%. Moreover, since the taxable income threshold is not indexed to inflation, the portion of beneficiaries&#x27; social security payments subject to income tax has risen significantly in real terms since the threshold was set in 1984.

== Criticism ==
=== Discrimination against the poor and the middle class ===
Workers must pay 12.4 percent, including a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($168,600 in 2024), but no tax on income in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, for people in the bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.

Despite its regressive tax rate, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces a much higher percentage of low-income workers&#x27; pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay a higher percentage of their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would apply only at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor benefits are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than ten years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence. Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.

Social Security&#x27;s benefit formula provides 90% of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) below the first &quot;bend point&quot; of $791/month, 32% of AIME between the first and second bend points $791 to $4781/month, and 15% of AIME in excess of the second bend point up to the Ceiling cap of $113,700 in 2013. The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that a lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers. A married low salaried worker can receive over 100% of their salary in benefits after retiring at the full retirement age. High-salaried workers receive 43% or less of their salary in benefits despite having paid into the &quot;system&quot; at the same rate (see benefit calculations above). To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed by the U.S. Congress, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations, the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S., pay an average federal income tax of −9.3% and −2.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations, the household incomes in the first and second quintiles have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively. However, these groups also have the smallest percentage of American household incomesthe first quintile earns 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns 8.4% of all income. Higher-income retirees pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.

=== Marital status ===
The Social Security Act defines the rules for determining marital relationships for SSI recipients. The act requires that if a couple is cohabitating, they should be considered married for purposes of the SSI program. Consequently, if the claimant is found disabled and found to be &quot;holding out&quot;; this claimant will be entitled to reduced or no SSI benefits. However, the Social Security Act does not accept that a claimant &quot;holding out as husband or wife&quot; should be entitled of Survivor, Retirement or Widow(er)s benefits, when the claimant&#x27;s &quot;husband or wife&quot; dies. SSA rules and regulations about marital status either prohibit (SRDI program) or reduce (SSI program) benefits to indigent claimants.

=== Politicians exempted themselves from the tax ===
Critics of Social Security have said that the politicians who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social Security tax. When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president and members of Congress, were exempt from having to pay the Social Security tax, and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within the Social Security system all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984. Many state and local government workers, however, are exempt from Social Security taxes because they contribute instead to alternative retirement systems set up by their employers.

=== Comparison to a Ponzi scheme ===

Critics have drawn parallels between Social Security and Ponzi schemes, arguing that the sustenance of Social Security is due to continuous contributions over time. One difference between a traditional Ponzi scheme and Social Security, is that while both may have similar &quot;structures&quot;—in particular, a sustainability problem when the number of new people paying in is declining—they have differing degrees of transparency. In the case of a traditional Ponzi scheme, the fact that there is no return-generating mechanism other than contributions from new entrants is obscured whereas the Social Security scheme is designed to have payouts openly underwritten by incoming tax revenue and the interest on the Treasury bonds held by or for the Social Security scheme. Private sector Ponzi schemes are also vulnerable to collapse because they cannot force new entrants to contribute, whereas participation in the Social Security program is usually mandatory upon beginning one&#x27;s first job in the United States. In connection with these and other issues, Robert E. Wright calls Social Security a pyramid scheme—rather than a true Ponzi scheme—in his book, &quot;Fubarnomics&quot;.

=== Estimated net benefits under differing circumstances ===

In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso created a Web-based Social Security benefits calculator. Using this calculator, it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book &quot;Democrats and RepublicansRhetoric and Reality,&quot; Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits of men and women who were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smallereven negative.

However, the impact is much greater for the future retiree (in 2045) than for the current retiree (2005). The male earning $95,000 per year and retiring in 2045 is estimated to lose over $200,000 by participating in the Social Security system.

In the next graph (Figure 165), the depicted net benefits are averaged for people turning age 65 anytime during the years 2005 through 2045. (In other words, the disparities shown are not related to retirement.) However, there is an impact of gender and wage level. Because women tend to live longer, they generally collect Social Security benefits for a longer time. As a result, they get a higher net benefit, on average, no matter what the wage level.
The next graph (Figure 166), shows estimated net benefits for married men and women at different wage levels. In this scenario, it is assumed that the spouse has little or no earnings and, thus, will be entitled to collect a spousal retirement benefit. According to Fried:
Two significant factors are evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that is higher than any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person, no matter what the gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.
The last graph shown (Figure 167), is a combination of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level, a married person could be a big winner, getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a &quot;swing&quot; of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition, there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of the man or woman earning $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender). In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.

In the book &quot;How Social Security Picks Your Pocket&quot; other factors affecting Social Security net benefits are identified: Generally, people who work for more than 35 years get a lower net benefit, all other factors being equal. People who do not live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit. Finally, people who derive a high percentage of income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be poor, when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for Social Security is blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.

== Current controversies ==
=== Contrast with private pensions ===
Although Social Security is sometimes compared to private pensions, the two systems are different in a number of respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal.

Social Security cannot &quot;prefund&quot; by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.

Two broad categories of private pension plans are &quot;defined benefit pension plans&quot; and &quot;defined contribution pension plans.&quot; Of these two, Social Security is more similar to a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based on some sort of pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address. He described the Social Security system as &quot;headed for bankruptcy&quot;, and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new government borrowing to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See Social Security debate (United States).

Both &quot;defined benefit&quot; and &quot;defined contribution&quot; private pension plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which requires employers to provide minimum levels of funding to support &quot;defined benefits&quot; pensions. The purpose is to protect the workers from corporate mismanagement and outright bankruptcy of the plan, although in practice many private pension funds have fallen short in recent years. In terms of financial structure, the current Social Security system is analogous to an underfunded &quot;defined benefit&quot; pension (&quot;underfunded&quot; meaning not that it is in trouble, but that its savings are not enough to pay future benefits without collecting future tax revenues).

=== Contrast with insurance ===
Besides the argument over whether the returns on Social Security contributions should or can be compared to returns on private investment instruments, there is the question of whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit commercial insurance companies to maintain and generate a return on a &quot;risk pool of funds&quot;. Like any insurance program, Social Security &quot;spreads risk&quot; as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner&#x27;s retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance plans, everyone in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.

The analogy to insurance, however, is limited by the fact that paying FICA taxes creates no legal right to benefits and by the extent to which Social Security is funded by FICA taxes. During 2011 and 2012, for example, FICA tax revenue was insufficient to maintain Social Security&#x27;s solvency without transfers from general revenues. These transfers added to the general budget deficit like general program spending.

=== Private retirement savings crisis ===
While inflation-adjusted stock market values generally rose from 1978 to 1997, from 1998 through 2007 they were higher than in March 2013. This has caused workers&#x27; supplemental retirement plans such as 401(k)s to perform substantially more poorly than expected when current retirees were investing the bulk of their savings in them. In 2010, the median household retirement account balance for workers aged 55 to 64 was $120,000, which will provide only a trivial supplement to Social Security benefits, but about a third of households had no retirement savings. 75% of Americans nearing retirement age had less than $30,000 in their retirement accounts, which &quot;Forbes&quot; called &quot;the greatest retirement crisis in American history.&quot;

=== Court interpretation of the Act to provide benefits ===
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has indicated that the Social Security Act has a moral purpose and should be liberally interpreted in favor of claimants when deciding what counted as covered wages for purposes of meeting the quarters of coverage requirement to make a worker eligible for benefits. That court has also stated: &quot;...[T]he regulations should be liberally applied in favor of beneficiaries&quot; when deciding a case in favor of a felon who had his disability payments retroactively terminated upon incarceration. According to the court, that the Social Security Act &quot;should be liberally construed in favor of those seeking its benefits can not be doubted.&quot; &quot;The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey&#x27;s end is near.&quot;

=== Constitutionality ===
The constitutionality of Social Security is intricately linked to the evolving nature of U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence on federal power (the 20th century saw a dramatic increase in allowed congressional action). When Social Security was first passed, there were significant questions over its constitutionality as the Court had found another pension scheme, the original Railroad Retirement Act, to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some, such as University of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein and Harvard University professor Robert Nozick, have argued that Social Security should be unconstitutional.

In the 1937, U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Helvering v. Davis&quot;, the Court examined the constitutionality of Social Security when George Davis of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston sued in connection with the Social Security tax. The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts first upheld the tax. The District Court judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Commissioner Guy Helvering of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the validity of the tax.

During the 1930s, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in the midst of promoting the passage of a large number of social welfare programs under the New Deal and the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of those programs (such as the Railroad Retirement Act and the National Recovery Act) as unconstitutional. Modified versions of the affected programs were afterwards approved by the Court, including Social Security.

When &quot;Helvering v. Davis&quot; was argued before the Court, the larger issue of constitutionality of the old-age insurance portion of Social Security was not decided. The case was limited to whether the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress&#x27;s taxing power. Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system&#x27;s constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress&#x27;s spending power may be more coextensive, as shown in cases like &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot; during the Reagan Administration.

== Fraud and abuse ==
=== Social Security Number theft ===
Because Social Security Numbers (SSNs) have become useful in identity theft and other forms of crime, various schemes have been perpetrated to acquire valid SSNs and related identity information.

In February 2006, the Social Security Administration (SSA) received several reports of an email message being circulated addressed to &quot;Dear Social Security Number And Card owner&quot; and purporting to be from the SSA. The message informs the reader &quot;that someone illegally is using your Social Security number and assuming your identity&quot; and directs the reader to a website designed to look like the SSA Internet website.

&quot;I am outraged that someone would target an unsuspecting public in this manner,&quot; said Commissioner Jo Anne B. Barnhart. &quot;I have asked the Inspector General to use all the resources at his command to find and prosecute whoever is perpetrating this fraud.&quot;

Once directed to the phony website, the individual is reportedly asked to confirm his or her identity with &quot;Social Security and bank information&quot;. Specific information about the individual&#x27;s credit card number, expiration date and PIN is then requested. &quot;Whether on our online website or by phone, Social Security will never ask you for your credit card information or your PIN,&quot; Commissioner Jo Anne B. Barnhart reported.

SSA Inspector General O&#x27;Carroll recommended people always take precautions when giving out personal information. &quot;You should never provide your Social Security number or other personal information over the Internet or by telephone unless you are extremely confident of the source to whom you are providing the information,&quot; O&#x27;Carroll said.

In August 2024, a class-action lawsuit was filed against National Public Data, claiming that the company permitted hackers to steal sensitive private information, including Social Security Numbers, covering millions of individuals. The theft was alleged to have occurred in April 2024. The stolen data contains records for people in the US, UK, and Canada.

=== Fraud in the acquisition and use of benefits ===
Given the vast size of the program, fraud sometimes occurs. The SSA has its own investigatory unit to combat and prevent fraud, the Cooperative Disability Investigations Unit (CDIU). The Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) Program continues to be one of the most successful initiatives, contributing to the integrity of SSA&#x27;s disability programs. In addition, when investigating fraud in other SSA programs, the Social Security Administration may request investigatory assistance from other law enforcement agencies including the Office of the Inspector General as well as state and local authorities.

=== Restrictions on potentially deceptive communications ===
Because of the importance of Social Security to millions of Americans, many direct-mail marketers packaged their mailings to resemble official communications from the SSA, hoping recipients would be more likely to open them. In response, Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1988 to prohibit the private use of the phrase &quot;Social Security&quot; and several related terms in any way that would convey a false impression of approval from the SSA. The constitutionality of this law () was upheld in &quot;United Seniors Association, Inc. v. Social Security Administration&quot;, 423 F.3d 397 (4th Cir. 2005), cert den 547 U.S. 1162; 126 S.Ct. 2346 (2006) (text at Findlaw).

== Public economics ==
=== Current recipients ===

The 2011 annual report by the program&#x27;s Board of Trustees noted the following: in 2010, 54 million people were receiving Social Security benefits, while 157 million people were paying into the fund; of those receiving benefits, 44 million were receiving retirement benefits and 10 million disability benefits. In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1billion and expenditures were $712.5billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6trillion, an amount that is expected to be adequate to cover the next ten years. In 2023, total income and interest earned on assets were projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system. By 2035, the ratio of potential retirees to working age persons will be 37 percentthere will be less than three potential income earners for every retiree in the population. At that rate the Social Security Trust Fund would be exhausted by 2036. In 2024, the estimated year in which funds would be exhausted was 2035.

=== Saving behavior ===

Social Security affects the saving behavior of the people in three different ways. The wealth substitution effect occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.

=== Reducing cost of living adjustment (COLA) ===
At present, a retiree&#x27;s benefit is annually adjusted for inflation to reflect changes in the consumer price index. Some economists argue that the consumer price index overestimates price increases in the economy and therefore is not a suitable metric for adjusting benefits, while others argue that the CPI underestimates the effect of inflation on what retired people actually need to buy to live.

The current cost of living adjustment is based on the consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics routinely checks the prices of 211 different categories of consumption items in 38 geographical areas to compute 8,018 item-area indices. Many other indices are computed as weighted averages of these base indices. CPI-W is based on a market basket of goods and services consumed by urban wage earners and clerical workers. The weights for that index are updated in January of every even-numbered year. People who say the CPI-W overestimates inflation recommend updating the weights each month; this produces the Chained Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U). People who say the C-CPI-U [or the unchained CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)] disadvantages the elderly, point out that seniors consume more medical care than younger people, and that the costs of medical care have been rising faster than inflation in other parts of the economy. According to this view, the costs of the things the elderly buy have been rising faster than the market basket averaged to obtain CPI-W, CPI-U or C-CPI-U. Some have recommended fixing this by using a CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E).

In 2003, economics researchers Hobijn and Lagakos estimated that the Social Security trust fund would run out of money in 40 years using CPI-W and in 35 years using CPI-E.

=== Consumption ===
According to a 2016 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics&quot;, the Social Security benefit increases from 1952 to 1991 have a &quot;large, immediate, and significant positive response of consumption&quot;.

=== Health outcomes ===
According to a 2021 study, the expansion of old-age assistance under the 1935 Social Security Act reduced mortality among the elderly by 30–39%.

<doc id="48732" wikidata="Q214242" url="?curid=48732" title="Pyramid scheme">
<text>A pyramid scheme is a business model which, rather than earning money (or providing returns on investments) by sale of legitimate products to an end consumer, mainly earns money by recruiting new members with the promise of payments (or services). As the number of members multiplies, recruiting quickly becomes increasingly difficult until it is impossible, and therefore most of the newer recruits do not make a profit. As such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable. The unsustainable nature of pyramid schemes has led to most countries outlawing them as a form of fraud.

Pyramid schemes have existed since at least the mid-to-late 19th century in different guises. Some multi-level marketing plans have been classified as pyramid schemes.

== Concept and basic models ==
In a pyramid scheme, an organization compels individuals who wish to join to make a payment. In exchange, the organization promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organization (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments. For the directors, the scheme is potentially lucrative—whether or not they do any work, the organization&#x27;s membership has a strong incentive to continue recruiting and funneling money to the top of the pyramid.

Such organizations seldom involve sales of products or services with value. Without creating any goods or services, the only revenue streams for the scheme are recruiting more members or soliciting more money from current members. The behavior of pyramid schemes follows the mathematics concerning exponential growth quite closely. Each level of the pyramid is much larger than the one before it. For a pyramid scheme to make money for everyone who enrolls in it, it would have to expand indefinitely. When the scheme inevitably runs out of new recruits, lacking other sources of revenue, it collapses. Since the biggest terms in this geometric sequence are at the end, most people will be in the lower levels of the pyramid; accordingly, the bottom layer of the pyramid contains the most people. The people working for pyramid schemes try to promote the actual company instead of the product they are selling. Eventually, all of the people at the lower levels of the pyramid do not make any money; only the people at the top turn a profit.

People in the upper layers of the pyramid typically profit, while those in the lower layers typically lose money. Since most of the members in the scheme are at the bottom, most participants will not make any money. In particular, when the scheme collapses, most members will be in the bottom layers and thus will not have any opportunity to profit from the scheme; still, they will have already paid to join. Therefore, a pyramid scheme is characterized by a few people (including the creators of the scheme) making large amounts of money, while subsequent members lose money. For this reason, they are considered scams.

=== The &quot;eight ball&quot; model ===
Many pyramids are more sophisticated than the simple model. These recognize that recruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult, so a seemingly simpler model is used. In this model each person must recruit two others, but the ease of achieving this is offset because the depth required to recoup any money also increases. The scheme requires a person to recruit two others, who must each recruit two others, and so on.

Prior instances of this scheme have been called the &quot;Airplane Game&quot; and the four tiers labelled as &quot;captain&quot;, &quot;co-pilot&quot;, &quot;crew&quot;, and &quot;passenger&quot; to denote a person&#x27;s level. Another instance was called the &quot;Original Dinner Party&quot; which labeled the tiers as &quot;dessert&quot;, &quot;main course&quot;, &quot;side salad&quot;, and &quot;appetizer&quot;. A person on the &quot;dessert&quot; course is the one at the top of the tree. Another variant, &quot;Treasure Traders&quot;, variously used gemology terms such as &quot;polishers&quot;, &quot;stone cutters&quot;, etc. One version called the Abundance Fractal uses the four elements as the names of tiers: &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;, and &quot;Water&quot;. A more recent variation known as the Living Workshop takes the names of plants, calling the tiers &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;sapling&quot;, &quot;blossom&quot;, and &quot;lotus&quot;.

Such schemes may try to downplay their pyramid nature by referring to themselves as &quot;gifting circles&quot; with money being &quot;gifted&quot;. Others focus on sharing circles or educational themes around &quot;abundance&quot; to divert attention away from the unsustainable structure. Popular schemes such as &quot;Women Empowering Women&quot; do exactly this.

Whichever euphemism is used, there are 15 total people in four tiers (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) in the scheme—with the Airplane Game as the example, the person at the top of this tree is the &quot;captain&quot;, the two below are &quot;co-pilots&quot;, the four below are &quot;crew&quot;, and the bottom eight joiners are the &quot;passengers&quot;.

The eight passengers must each pay (or &quot;gift&quot;) a sum (e.g., $5,000) to join the scheme. This sum (e.g., $40,000) goes to the captain, who leaves, with everyone remaining moving up one tier. There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers. A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not see a return until they advance through the crew and co-pilot tiers and exit the scheme as a captain. Therefore, the participants in the bottom three tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses.

If a person is using this model as a scam, the confidence trickster would take the majority of the money. They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying anything themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme for as long as possible to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.

Although the &quot;captain&quot; is the person at the top of the tree, having received the payment from the eight paying passengers, once they leave the scheme they are able to re-enter the pyramid as a &quot;passenger&quot; and hopefully recruit enough to reach captain again, thereby earning a second payout.

=== Blessing Loom ===
Similar to the eight ball model, the Blessing Loom tricks potential investors by claiming to turn $100 into $800. This scheme has a circular structure, as increases in new recruits pushes individuals closer to the center of the circle, hence the &quot;Loom&quot; in the name. Each participant needs to recruit two people without providing them with any service or product. The scam often resurfaces online across the globe, under different aliases such as &quot;loom circle&quot; or &quot;fractal mandala&quot;. The Blessing Loom scheme has been ruled as illegal in multiple US cities.

===Franchise fraud===
Franchise fraud is defined by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation as a pyramid scheme. The FBI website states:

Pyramid schemes—also referred to as franchise fraud or chain referral schemes—are marketing and investment frauds in which an individual is offered a distributorship or franchise to market a particular product. The real profit is earned, not by the sale of the product, but by the sale of new distributorships. Emphasis on selling franchises rather than the product eventually leads to a point where the supply of potential investors is exhausted and the pyramid collapses.

=== Matrix schemes ===

Matrix schemes use the same fraudulent, unsustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which only a fraction of them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of geometric progression as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse.

Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten joiners may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from joiners far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with shill names that must be cleared out before genuine people get to the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue.

Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner&#x27;s queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.

== Relation to Ponzi schemes==
While often confused with each other, pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes are different. Pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each person in the pyramid is tasked with bringing in their own subordinates and in turn profiting from their sales or recruitments. This fails because it essentially requires an infinite number of people to join the company. In a Ponzi scheme, however, participants are promised returns on &quot;investments&quot;, supposedly into stocks or goods, but which are actually paid for by new investors, while a central leading figure takes a portion as profit.

== Connection to multi-level marketing ==
Some multi-level marketing (MLM) companies operate as pyramid schemes and consumers often confuse legitimate multi-level marketing with pyramid schemes.

According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) legitimate MLM businesses are distinguished from pyramid schemes by participants making money primarily from product sales, rather than recruitment:

Not all multi-level marketing plans are legitimate. If the money you make is based on your sales to the public, it may be a legitimate multilevel marketing plan. If the money you make is based on the number of people you recruit and your sales to them, it&#x27;s probably not. It could be a pyramid scheme.

In contrast, pyramid schemes &quot;may purport to sell a product&quot;, but often &quot;simply use the product to hide their pyramid structure&quot;. While some people call MLMs in general &quot;pyramid selling&quot;, others use the term to denote an illegal pyramid scheme masquerading as a MLM.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission warns against becoming involved &quot;in plans where the money you make is based primarily on the number of distributors you recruit and your sales to them, rather than on your sales to people outside the plan who intend to use the products.&quot;

Some commentators contend that MLMs in general are nothing more than legalized pyramid schemes. There are different laws in every state, and they take different actions toward pyramid schemes, but multi-level-marketing is legal. Multi-level marketing lobbying groups have pressured US government regulators to maintain the legal status of such schemes.

== Legality ==
Pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries or regions including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman,
Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

== Notable cases ==
The 1997 Albanian civil unrest was partially motivated by the collapse of Ponzi schemes; however, they were widely referred to as pyramid schemes due to their prevalence in Albanian society.

In 2003, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) disclosed what it called an Internet-based &quot;pyramid scam.&quot; Its complaint states that customers would pay a registration fee to join a program that called itself an &quot;internet mall&quot; and purchase a package of goods and services such as internet mail, and that the company offered &quot;significant commissions&quot; to consumers who purchased and resold the package. The FTC alleged that the company&#x27;s program was instead and in reality a pyramid scheme that did not disclose that most consumers&#x27; money would be kept, and that it gave affiliates material that allowed them to scam others.

WinCapita was a scheme run by Finnish criminals that involved about €100 million. The scheme started in 2005.

In early 2006, Ireland was hit by a wave of schemes with major activity in Cork and Galway. Participants were asked to contribute €20,000 each to a &quot;Liberty&quot; scheme which followed the classic eight-ball model. Payments were made in Munich, Germany, to skirt Irish tax laws concerning gifts. Spin-off schemes called &quot;Speedball&quot; and &quot;People in Profit&quot; prompted a number of violent incidents and calls were made by politicians to tighten existing legislation. Ireland has launched a website to better educate consumers to pyramid schemes and other scams.

On 12 November 2008, riots broke out in the municipalities of Pasto, Tumaco, Popayán and Santander de Quilichao, Colombia, after the collapse of several pyramid schemes. Thousands of victims had invested their money in pyramids that promised them extraordinary interest rates. The lack of regulatory laws allowed those pyramids to grow excessively for several years. Finally, after the riots, the Colombian government was forced to declare the country in a state of economic emergency to seize and stop those schemes. Several of the pyramid&#x27;s managers were arrested, and prosecuted for the crime of &quot;illegal massive money reception.&quot;

The &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; reported on 26 November 2008 that American citizen Robert Fletcher (Robert T. Fletcher III; aka &quot;Rob&quot;) was arrested by the SBU (Ukraine State Police) after being accused by Ukrainian investors of running a Ponzi scheme and associated pyramid scam netting US$20 million. (The &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; also reported that some estimates were as high as US$150 million.)

In the United Kingdom in 2008 and 2009, a £21 million pyramid scheme named &#x27;Give and Take&#x27; involved at least 10,000 victims in the south-west of England and South Wales. Leaders of the scheme were prosecuted and served time in jail before being ordered to pay £500,000 in compensation and costs in 2015. The cost of bringing the prosecution was in excess of £1.4 million.

A number of authorities around the world declared TVI Express to be a pyramid scheme in 2010 and 2011, including the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, the Bank of Namibia, and the Central Bank of Lesotho. TVI Express, operated by Tarun Trikha from India, has apparently recruited hundreds of thousands of &quot;investors&quot;, very few of whom, it is reported, have recouped any of their investment.

BurnLounge, Inc. was a multi-level marketing online music store founded in 2004 and based in New York City. By 2006 the company reported 30,000 members using the site to sell music through its network. In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission sued the company for being an illegal pyramid scheme. The company lost the suit in 2012, and lost appeal in June 2014. In June 2015, the FTC began returning $1.9 million to people who had lost money in the scheme.

In August 2015, the United States FTC filed a lawsuit against Vemma Nutrition Company, an Arizona-based dietary supplement Multi-Level Marketing firm, accused of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. In December 2016, Vemma agreed to a $238 million settlement with the FTC, which banned the company from &quot;pyramid scheme practices&quot; including recruitment-focused business ventures, deceptive income claims, and unsubstantiated health claims.

In March 2017, Ufun Store, registered as an online business for its members as a direct-sales company, was declared to be operating a pyramid scheme in Thailand. The Criminal Court handed down prison terms totaling 12,265 to 12,267 years to 22 people convicted over the scheme, which conned about 120,000 people out of more than 20 billion baht.

The Airplane Game scheme resurfaced in 2020 as a savings club by the name of the Blessing Loom, Blessing Circle, Sending Flower, Gifting Flower, and so on. It is also misrepresented as a Sou-Sou, a legitimate savings club model where the number of people paying into the pot is fixed and each person gets a payout regularly. This is distinct from the pyramid scheme variation making use of the hierarchical flower model, where new members are continually recruited into the group by people at the edges of the flower. This re-imagining of the old Airplane/8-ball model is making a resurgence on social media platforms such as Instagram and Zoom.

<text>Ragnar Lodbrok (&quot;Ragnar hairy-breeches&quot;) (Old Norse: &quot;Ragnarr loðbrók&quot;), according to legends, was a Viking hero and a Swedish and Danish king.

He is known from Old Norse poetry of the Viking Age, Icelandic sagas, and near-contemporary chronicles. According to traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by conducting many raids against the British Isles and the Carolingian Empire during the 9th century. He also appears in Norse legends, and according to the legendary sagas &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot; and a &quot;Saga about Certain Ancient Kings&quot;, Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s father has been given as the legendary king of the Swedes, Sigurd Ring.

== Accounts ==
=== Icelandic sagas ===

According to the &quot;Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot;, &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, &quot;Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum&quot;, and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the king of Sweden Sigurd Ring. Nearly all of the sagas agree that the Danish king Randver was Sigurd&#x27;s father, with the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; citing his wife as Åsa, the daughter of King Harald of the Red Moustache from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king Ivar Vidfamne by his daughter Aud (whom the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; calls Alfhild). After the death of King Ivar Vidfamne, Aud&#x27;s eldest son by the Danish king Hrœrekr Ringslinger, Harald, conquered all of his grandfather&#x27;s territory and became known as Harald Wartooth. Harald&#x27;s nephew Sigurd Ring became the chief king of Sweden after Randver&#x27;s death (Denmark according to the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king Sigfred who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the princess Alfhild of the petty kingdom of Álfheimr, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him. Eysteinn Beli, who according to the &quot;Hervarar Saga&quot; was Harald Wartooth&#x27;s son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and Aslaug.

In their accounts of his reign, the &quot;fornaldarsǫgur&quot; (Legendary sagas, or sagas of Scandinavian prehistory), tell more about Ragnar&#x27;s marriages than about feats of warfare. In the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok, Ragnar is introduced by introducing his alleged father who was Sigurd Ring that according to the Saga, ruled over Denmark. In the Saga, Ragnar is Introduced as a big man, handsome and well-provided with wisdom. He was good to his men and cruel to his enemies. Ragnar’s first account in the saga was to assemble an army, a fleet of ships, becoming a great warrior and Slaying a Dragon in the Norse lands of Götaland.

According to the &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, &quot;he was the biggest and fairest of men that human eyes have seen, and he was like his mother in appearance and took after her kin&quot;. He first killed a giant snake that guarded the abode of the Geatish jarl Herrauð&#x27;s daughter Thora Borgarhjort, thereby winning her as his wife. The unusual protective clothes that Ragnar wore when attacking the serpent earned him the nickname Lodbrok. His sons with Thora were Erik and Agnar. After Thora died, he discovered Kráka, a woman of outstanding beauty and wisdom living with a poor peasant couple in Norway, and married her. This marriage resulted in the sons Ivar the Boneless, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, Ragnvald, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. Kráka was later revealed to actually be Aslaug, a secret daughter of the renowned hero Sigurd Fafnesbane. As the sons grew up to become renowned warriors, Ragnar, not wishing to be outdone, resolved to conquer England with merely two ships. He was, however, defeated by superior Northumbrian forces and was thrown into a snake pit to die. The &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot;, and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; all tell of the Great Heathen Army that invaded England at around 866, led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who is told to have captured and executed Ragnar.

=== Danish sources ===
The () mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as a father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the Franks. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of Britain, though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas. The chronicle of Sven Aggesen () is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is Knut, ancestor of the later Danish kings.

Neither of these sources mentions Ragnar Lodbrok as a Danish ruler. The first to do so is Saxo Grammaticus in his work (). This work mixes Norse legend with data about Danish history derived from the chronicle of Adam of Bremen (). Here Ragnar&#x27;s father Sigurd Ring is a Norwegian prince married to a Danish princess, and different from the victor of Brávellir (who had flourished about thirteen generations earlier). Sigurd Ring and his cousin and rival Ring (that is, Sigfred and Anulo of recorded history, d. 812) are both killed in battle, whereupon Ragnar is elevated to the Danish kingship (identified by Saxo with Ragnfred, d. 814). His first deed is the defeat of the Swedish king Frö, who has killed Ragnar&#x27;s grandfather. Ragnar is assisted in this by a ferocious shield-maiden named Ladgerda (Lagertha), whom Ragnar forces to marry him after killing a bear and a great hound to win her hand. In this marriage, he sires the son Fridleif and two daughters. Ragnar later repudiates his marriage to Ladgerda and marries Thora Borgarhjort, a daughter of the Swedish king Herrauðr, after killing two venomous giant snakes that guard Thora&#x27;s residence. His sons with Thora are Radbard, Dunvat, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, Björn Ironside, Agnar and Ivar the Boneless. From a non-marital relationship with an unnamed woman (described only as the daughter of a man named Esbjørn), Ragnar fathered Ubbe. Another, final marriage to Svanlaug (possibly another name for Aslaug) produces another three sons: Ragnvald, Eric Weatherhat and Hvitserk.

The sons were installed as sub-kings in various conquered territories. Ragnar led a Viking expedition to England and killed its king, Hama, before killing the earls of Scotland and installing Sigurd Snake-in-the Eye and Radbard as governors. Norway was also subjugated, and Fridleif was made ruler there and in Orkney. Later on, Ragnar with three sons invaded Sweden where a new king called Sörle had appeared and withheld the heritage of Thora&#x27;s sons. Sörle and his army were massacred, and Björn Ironside was installed on the throne. Sometime later Björn was put in charge of Norway, while Ragnar appointed another son, Eric Weatherhat, as ruler in Sweden; he was subsequently killed by a certain Eysteinn. One of the sons, Ubbe, revolted against his father at the instigation of his maternal grandfather Esbjørn, and could only be defeated and captured with utmost effort. Saxo moreover tells of repeated expeditions to the British Isles, one of which cost the lives of Dunvat and Radbard. Ælla, son of Hama, with the help of allies known collectively as the &quot;Galli&quot; – possibly a group of Norse-Gaels (who were known in Old Irish as &quot;Gall-Goídil&quot;), expelled Ragnar&#x27;s sub-ruler Ivar the Boneless from England and remained a persistent enemy. Finally, the Scythians were forced to accept Hvitserk as their ruler. In the end, Hvitserk was treacherously captured by the Hellespontian prince Daxon and burnt alive with his own admission. Hearing this, Ragnar led an expedition to Kievan Rus&#x27; and captured Daxon who was spared and exiled.

Unlike the Icelandic sources, Saxo&#x27;s account of Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s reign is largely a catalog of successful Viking invasions over an enormous geographical area. Among the seaborne expeditions was one against the Bjarmians and Finns (Saami) in the Arctic north. The Bjarmian use of magic spells caused foul weather and the sudden death of many Danish invaders, and the Finnish archers on skis turned out to be a formidable foe. Eventually, these two tribes were put to flight, and the Bjarmian king was slain. The historical king Harald Klak is by Saxo (based on a passage in Adam&#x27;s chronicle) made into another persistent enemy of Ragnar, who several times incited the Jutes and Scanians to rebel, but was regularly defeated. After the last victory over Harald, Ragnar learned that King Ælla had massacred Ragnar&#x27;s men on Ireland. Incensed, he attacked the English king with his fleet but was captured and thrown to his death in the snake pit - the fate ascribed by tradition to the early Burgundian king Gunnar, as recounted in the Icelandic sagas. In spite of all his praise for Ragnar Lodbrok, Saxo also considers his fate as God&#x27;s rightful vengeance for the contempt he had shown the Christian religion.

=== Poetic and epigraphic sources ===
While the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin. The &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, ostensibly composed by Bragi Boddason in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received. The shield depicts the assault on Jörmunrek, the Hjaðningavíg tale, the ploughing of Gefjon, and Thor&#x27;s struggle with the Midgard Serpent. Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c. 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England. The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless&#x27;s deceitful approach to King Ælla, Ivar&#x27;s cunning snatching of land from Ælla, Ragnar&#x27;s struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora). The &quot;Knutsdrapa&quot; of Sigvat Thordarson (c. 1038) mentions the death of Ælla at the hands of Ivar in York, who &quot;carved the eagle on Ælla&#x27;s back&quot;. From this, the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok&#x27;s sons already seems to be present. The reference to a &quot;blood eagle&quot; punishment has, however, been much debated by modern scholars. Another lay, &quot;Krakumal&quot;, put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British Isles. The poem&#x27;s name, &quot;Kráka&#x27;s lay&quot;, alludes to Ragnar&#x27;s wife&#x27;s Kráka, though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form.

The poem the &quot;Lay of Kraka&quot; or &quot;Krakumal&quot; tells the last words of Ragnar Lothbrok during his execution by King Aellla of the Kingdom of Northumbria. In the poem Ragnar makes its usual mentions of different Norse divinities and magical elements such as Valhalla as in the end of the Poem Ragnar says:

We hewed with the brand!

Full gladly do I go! See the Valkyrjar fresh from Odin’s halls!

High-seated among heroes shall I quaff the yellow-mead.

The Aesir welcome me. Laughing gladly do I die!

There is one runic inscription mentioning Lodbrok, carved on the prehistorical tumulus of Maeshowe on Orkney in the early 12th century. It reads: &quot;This howe was built a long time before Lodbrok&#x27;s. Her sons, they were bold; scarcely ever were there such tall men of their hands&quot;. The expression &quot;her sons&quot; has given rise to the theory that Lodbrok was originally thought of as a woman, mother of the historically known sons.

=== Frankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader ===
The Siege of Paris and the Sack of Paris of 845 were the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks. The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named &quot;Reginherus&quot;, or Ragnar. This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians. Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in Torhout, Flanders, by Charles the Bald in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King. Ragnar&#x27;s Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845 and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint-Denis (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river. Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the Norse god Odin, as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces. Ragnar&#x27;s fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King Horik I, but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark.

=== Later continental accounts ===
Among the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of William of Jumièges from c. 1070. According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way. It was during the time this practice was in fashion that King Lodbrok succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne. After gaining power, he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son Björn Ironside to leave his realm. Björn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in West Francia and later the Mediterranean. Roughly contemporary with William is Adam of Bremen whose history of the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia. In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf, and Inguar (Ivar). This Ivar is, in particular, seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi).

=== Anglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan ===
According to the contemporary &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alfred&quot;, in 878 the &quot;brother of Hingwar and Healfden&quot;, with a naval fleet, a contingent of the Great Heathen Army invaded Devon in England and fought the Battle of Cynwit. There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships. After the battle the Saxons took great plunder, and among other things the banner called &quot;Raven&quot;. The early 12th century &quot;Annals of St Neots&quot; further state that &quot;they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day. They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory, a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated, it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.&quot; This is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.

The Irish from the 12th century, with information deriving from earlier annals, mentions king Halfdan (d. 877) under the name &quot;mac Ragnaill&quot;. The form Ragnall may refer to either Ragnvald or Ragnar and the entry is a strong indication that the name of Ivar&#x27;s and Halfdan&#x27;s father was really Ragnar or a similar name. The early 11th century &quot;Three Fragments&quot; contains a passage that gives a semi-legendary background to the capture of York by the Vikings in 866. The two younger sons of Halfdan, King of Lochlann, expelled the eldest son, Ragnall, who sailed to the Orkney islands with his three sons and settled there. Two of the sons later raided the English and Franks, proceeding to plunder in the Mediterranean. One of them learned from a vision that Ragnall had fought a battle where the third son had been slain and in which he himself had most likely perished. The two Viking sons then returned home with a lot of dark-skinned captives. It has been hypothesized that this is an Irish version of &quot;Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s saga,&quot; the Mediterranean expedition being a historical event taking place in 859-61.

== Ragnar Mythical Accounts ==

=== The Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok ===
In the &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot; () This Icelandic saga, composed in the 13th century, is one of the most detailed sources about Ragnar&#x27;s life and exploits. It describes Ragnar&#x27;s rise to fame, his marriages (including to the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the noblewoman Thora Borgarhjort), and his legendary deeds.

The saga highlights Ragnar&#x27;s divine connections, particularly his descent from Odin, framing him as a semi-mythical hero blessed with the qualities associated with the Allfather, such as wisdom, courage, and poetic speech. The first account of Ragnar in the saga is the tale of Ragnar killing a dragon, showing the close relation between Ragnar and legendary/magical deeds.

When the Saga accounts Ragnar&#x27;s death the story also tells &quot;So Ragnar was let down into a serpent-pit, and he sat there a long time while none of the snakes would bite him. And some people said, &#x27;This is a great man; no weapons would bite him today, and now the serpents will not bite him.

=== Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons ===
The &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s Sons&quot; () is a short tale that complements the &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot; and focuses on the exploits of Ragnar&#x27;s sons most notably Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, and Hvitserk.

The sons are portrayed as avenging their father’s death and continuing his legacy. Their divine lineage through Ragnar and their heroic deeds further enhance Ragnar&#x27;s legendary status.

=== Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus ===
The Gesta Danorum, written in Latin in the 12th century, this work by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus provides one of the earliest accounts of Ragnar and his feats. Saxo portrays Ragnar as a Danish king and warrior, blending historical and mythical elements. While Saxo does not explicitly emphasize Ragnar&#x27;s descent from Odin, the narrative incorporates divine and heroic motifs that align with Norse tradition.

=== Norse Skaldic Poetry ===
Poetic references to Ragnar or figures resembling him appear in Norse skaldic poetry and eddic poems, often linking heroes to divine ancestry as a way of enhancing their heroic status. In the &quot;Krákumál,&quot; many of the poem&#x27;s stanzas have Ragnar making claims about Valhalla, Odin and the Valkyrs, showing how Ragnar was closely related with Norse Mythology.

== Ragnar&#x27;s sons ==

The Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had previously executed Ragnar by casting him into a pit full of venomous snakes. Among the organizers were at least some of the brothers: Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, all of whom are known as historical figures, save the slightly more dubious Hvitserk. Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts after 870. The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar&#x27;s death as 870. Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex. A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan&#x27;s army.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Danes battled the West Saxons nine times, including the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg was killed. Halfdan accepted a truce from the future Alfred the Great, newly crowned king of Wessex. After Bagsecg&#x27;s death, Halfdan was the only remaining king of the invading host. He may also have been a King of part of Denmark (Jutland?), since a co-ruler Halfdan is mentioned in Frankish sources in 873. According to late sagas Björn Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala, although this presents chronological inconsistencies. Björn had two sons, Erik and Refil Björnsson. His son Erik became the next king of Sweden, and was succeeded in turn by Erik Refilsson, the son of Refil. Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye is perhaps the same person as Sigfred, brother of Halfdan, who was king in Denmark together with Halfdan in 873. According to the sagas Sigurd became King of Zealand, Skåne and the lesser Danish Isles. Sigfred-Sigurd possibly succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of entire Denmark in about 877, and may be the Viking king Sigfred who was killed in West Francia in 887.

== Ragnar’s Historical Relevance ==

=== Conquest and Raids ===
Ragnar Lodbrok is famously associated with several daring raids, including the Siege of Paris in 845 CE and expeditions in England. These raids encapsulate the Viking era&#x27;s maritime prowess and opportunistic expansion. In the &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot; the saga tells the different exploits and raids made by Ragnar as well as in the Annals of St. Bertin the author talks about the chieftain Reginherus or Ragnar’s exploits and raiding in medieval Frankia.

=== Symbol of Viking Ambition ===
The Legend of Ragnar Lodbrok legends emphasize the Norse pursuit of glory, honor, and wealth. The stories of Ragnar’s courage and cunning, including his use of a fleet of ships to breach Paris, reflect the strategic brilliance attributed to Viking leaders.

=== Connection to Historical Figures ===
Ragnar is linked to historically attested figures such as his supposed sons Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. These sons are known for their roles in Viking invasions of England, as explained in both the &quot;Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot; and the &quot;Tale of Ragnar’s Sons,&quot; including the establishment of the Danelaw.

=== Mythical Origins and Death ===
The Sagas portray Ragnar as descended from Odin, tying him to the divine and emphasizing his extraordinary qualities. His death, allegedly in a pit of venomous snakes ordered by King Ella of Northumbria, is portrayed as a moment of stoic heroism, enhancing his mythic status.

=== Literary Influence ===
Ragnar’s story is preserved in medieval texts such as &quot;The Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok&quot; and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. These works helped to shape and form the myth and the legends of the Viking hero and inspired later historical and literary traditions.

=== Inspiration for National Identity ===
In Scandinavian history, Ragnar Lodbrok and similar legendary figures have served as symbols of national pride and resilience, particularly during periods of cultural revival.

== Ragnar&#x27;s Role on Warrior Aristocracy ==
Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s legendary status as a Viking chieftain and hero exemplifies the warrior aristocracy that defined Viking society during the early medieval period. The warrior aristocracy was a class of elite warriors who wielded political power, wealth, and influence based on their martial prowess, leadership, and ability to secure loyalty through plunder and patronage. In the Poem Havamal many different rules are highlighted to show what a good Norse warrior ought to be. Ragnar’s life is easily comparable to the different rules highlighted in the Hávamál. Ragnar&#x27;s role within this societal structure highlights the values and dynamics of Viking leadership.

=== Warlord and Chieftain ===
Ragnar is depicted as a charismatic and strategic leader who led numerous successful raids across Europe, including England and Francia. These exploits elevated his status as a powerful chieftain and warlord within the Viking hierarchy. His ability to gather and command loyal warriors was central to his influence, as a successful Viking leader depended on retaining a retinue of well-armed and motivated followers.

=== Pursuit of Wealth and Glory ===
In Viking society, wealth and fame were essential to a leader&#x27;s prestige. In the Norse poem Hávamál many of the Stanzas tell about the relevance of Wealth, fame and glory. In one of the Stanzas from the Hávamál the poem says:

&quot;Kinsmen die,&quot;

&quot;You yourself die,&quot;

&quot;gods and gold die;&quot;

&quot;an honourable name will never die,&quot;

&quot;one which was won&quot;

&quot;by your own work&quot;

Ragnar&#x27;s legendary exploits, such as his siege of Paris in 845 CE, illustrate his role in securing riches and reputation for himself and his men. The warrior aristocracy was sustained through the acquisition of plunder and tribute, and Ragnar&#x27;s reputed success in these endeavors exemplify the ideals of Viking leadership.

=== Kinship and Legacy ===
Ragnar&#x27;s role as a progenitor of a line of prominent Viking leaders, such as his legendary sons Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, help explain the importance of kinship ties in maintaining aristocratic power. His sons’ significant roles in Viking conquests and the establishment of the Danelaw reflect how Ragnar’s legacy reinforced the continuity of aristocratic dominance.

=== Role in Viking Expansion ===
Ragnar&#x27;s exploits exemplify the broader ambitions of the Viking warrior aristocracy, which sought to expand their influence through exploration, trade, and conquest. His legendary journeys to England and beyond reflect the aristocracy&#x27;s role in driving Viking expansion and shaping early medieval Europe.

== Sources and historical accuracy ==
Whereas Ragnar&#x27;s sons Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan Ragnarsson, Björn Ironside, Ubba and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye are historical figures, opinion regarding their father is divided. Contemporary academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction. According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, writing in 1979, &quot;Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar&#x27;s story as based on historical fact.&quot;

The most significant medieval sources that mention Ragnar include:
* Book IX of the , a 12th-century work by the Christian Danish chronicler 
* the &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s sons&quot; (), a legendary saga
* the &quot;Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok&quot;, another saga, a sequel to the 
* the , a skaldic poem of which only fragments remain, attributed to the 9th-century poet Bragi Boddason
* the , Ragnar&#x27;s death-song, an old and mysterious skaldic poem

In her commentary on Saxo&#x27;s , Davidson notes that Saxo&#x27;s coverage of Ragnar&#x27;s legend in book IX of the appears to be an attempt to consolidate many of the confusing and contradictory events and stories known to the chronicler into the reign of one king, Ragnar. That is why many acts ascribed to Ragnar in the can be associated, through other sources, with various figures, some of whom are more historically tenable.

The candidates scholars like to associate with the &quot;historical Ragnar&quot; include:
* the &quot;Reginherus&quot; or &quot;Ragnar&quot; who besieged Paris in 845
* the Danish King Horik I (d. 854)
* King Reginfrid (d. 814), a king who ruled part of Denmark in tandem with his brother Harald Klak, but was expelled by Horik I and his brothers and later fell in a battle against them
* possibly the Ragnall (Ragnvald or Ragnar) of the Irish Annals

Attempts to reliably associate the legendary Ragnar with one or several of those men have failed because of the difficulty in reconciling the various accounts and their chronology. But the tradition of a Viking hero named Ragnar (or similar) who wreaked havoc in mid-9th-century Europe and who fathered many famous sons is remarkably persistent, and some aspects of it are strengthened by relatively reliable sources, such as Irish historical tradition and, indirectly, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.

== In literature and media ==
Ragnar Lodbrok features prominently in the following works:
* Edwin Atherstone&#x27;s 1830 novel &quot;Sea-Kings in England&quot;.
* Edison Marshall&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Viking&quot;.
* &quot;Ragnar le Viking&quot;, a 1955 comic book feature written by Jean Ollivier with art by Eduardo Teixeira Coelho, that ran in the French &quot;Vaillant&quot; magazine up to 1969.
* Richard Parker&#x27;s 1957 historical novel &quot;The Sword of Ganelon&quot; explores the character of Ragnar, his sons, and Viking raiding culture.
* The 1958 film &quot;The Vikings&quot; based on Marshall&#x27;s novel, in which Ragnar, played by Ernest Borgnine, is captured by King Ælla and cast into a pit of wolves; a son named Einar , played by Kirk Douglas, vows revenge and conquers Northumbria with help from half-brother (and sworn enemy) Eric (played by Tony Curtis), who also had much to avenge upon King Aella.
* Harry Harrison&#x27;s 1993 alternative history novel &quot;The Hammer and the Cross&quot; depicts Ragnar being shipwrecked, captured and executed, as well as his sons&#x27; revenge.
* History&#x27;s 2013 TV series &quot;Vikings&quot; features Australian actor Travis Fimmel playing Ragnar Lodbrok.
*The 2020 release of Ubisoft&#x27;s &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot; features Ragnar&#x27;s children continuing to reign, plunder, and settle eastern England during the 9th century. Ragnar himself is briefly seen in a flashback of his execution.

<doc id="48738" wikidata="Q184928" url="?curid=48738" title="Russian Revolution of 1905">
<text>The Russian Revolution of 1905, also known as the First Russian Revolution, was a revolution in the Russian Empire which began on 22 January 1905 and led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy under the Russian Constitution of 1906, the country&#x27;s first. The revolution was characterized by mass political and social unrest including worker strikes, peasant revolts, and military mutinies directed against Tsar Nicholas II and the autocracy, who were forced to establish the State Duma legislative assembly and grant certain rights, though both were later undermined.

In the years leading up to the revolution, impoverished peasants had become increasingly angered by repression from their landlords and the continuation of semi-feudal relations. Further discontent grew due to mounting Russian losses in the Russo-Japanese War, poor conditions for workers, and urban unemployment. On , known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, a peaceful procession of workers was fired on by guards outside the tsar&#x27;s Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Widespread demonstrations and strikes spread all over the empire and were brutally repressed by the tsar&#x27;s troops. In June, sailors on the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; undertook a famous mutiny, and in October, a strike by railway workers turned into a general strike in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. The striking urban workers established councils, including the inaugural St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#x27; Deputies, in order to debate their course of action. The influence of revolutionary parties, in particular the Socialist Revolutionary Party and Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, quickly escalated. Reactionary Black Hundreds began attacks on intellectuals, revolutionaries, and Jews.

In response, the tsar issued the &quot;October Manifesto&quot;, a pledge to create a legislative assembly, halt censorship and violations of freedom of association, and expand the franchise. The constitution, drafted by Sergei Witte and enacted on 6 May O.S. 23 April] 1906, did not bring an end to the turmoil, as revolutionaries continued to rally for a constituent assembly. The movement for reform fragmented into conservative Octobrist and liberal Kadet factions, and the left split into moderates content with the reforms and those who desired a full overthrow of the tsar. The revolution slowly fizzled out in the face of harsh repression as troops returned after the end of Russo-Japanese War in September 1905. Despite popular participation, the Duma was unable to issue laws of its own and often came into conflict with the tsar, who in July 1906 dissolved the first Duma and appointed as prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, who set about restoring autocratic rule. In June 1907, the second Duma was dissolved and an electoral reform which favored the propertied classes was decreed.

Many historians contend that the Revolution of 1905 set the stage for the Russian Revolution of 1917, which saw the monarchy abolished, the tsar executed, and a socialist state established. Calls for the peasantry and workers to take power by force were present in the 1905 revolution, but many of the revolutionaries who were in a potential position to lead were either in exile or in prison while it took place. Vladimir Lenin later famously described the Revolution of 1905 as the &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; without which the &quot;victory of the October Revolution in 1917 would have been impossible&quot;.

==Causes==

Many factors contributed to unrest across the Russian Empire of 1905. Newly emancipated peasants earned too little and were not allowed to sell or mortgage their allotted land. Ethnic and national minorities resented the policy of &quot;Russification&quot; of the Empire: this represented discrimination and repression against national minorities, such as banning them from voting, serving in the Imperial Guard or Navy, and limiting their attendance in schools. A nascent industrial working class resented the government for doing too little to protect them, as it banned strikes and organizing into labor unions. University students developed a new consciousness after discipline was relaxed in the institutions, and as increasingly radical ideas gained attention.

Significantly, this was a period of disaffection in the Russian military. Soldiers returning from a bloody and disgraceful defeat with Japan found inadequate factory pay, shortages, and general disarray, and organized in protest.
Because the Russian economy was tied to European finances, the contraction of Western money markets in 1899–1900 plunged Russian industry into a deep and prolonged crisis; it outlasted the dip in European industrial production. This setback aggravated social unrest during the five years preceding the Revolution of 1905.

The Tsarist government did recognise some of these problems, albeit shortsightedly. The Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve had said in 1903 that, after the agrarian problem, the most serious issues plaguing the country were those of the Jews, the schools, and the workers, in that order.

Any residual popular loyalty to Tsar Nicholas II was lost on 22 January 1905, when his soldiers fired upon a crowd of protesting workers, led by Georgy Gapon, who were marching to present a petition at the Winter Palace.

===Agrarian problem===
Every year, thousands of nobles in debt mortgaged their estates to the noble land bank or sold them to municipalities, merchants, or peasants. By the time of the revolution, the nobility had sold off one-third of its land and mortgaged another third. The peasants had been freed by the emancipation reform of 1861, but their lives were generally quite limited. The government hoped to develop the peasants as a politically conservative, land-holding class by enacting laws to enable them to buy land from nobility by paying small installments over many decades.

Such land, known as &quot;allotment land&quot;, would not be owned by individual peasants but by the community of peasants; individual peasants would have rights to strips of land to be assigned to them under the open field system. A peasant could not sell or mortgage this land, so in practice he could not renounce his rights to his land, and he would be required to pay his share of redemption dues to the village commune. This plan was intended to prevent peasants from becoming part of the proletariat. However, the peasants were not given enough land to provide for their needs: 
Their earnings were often so small that they could neither buy the food they needed nor keep up the payment of taxes and redemption dues they owed the government for their land allotments. By 1903 their total arrears in payments of taxes and dues was 118 million rubles.

The situation worsened as masses of hungry peasants roamed the countryside looking for work and sometimes walked hundreds of kilometers to find it. Desperate peasants proved capable of violence. &quot;In the provinces of Kharkov and Poltava in 1902, thousands of them, ignoring restraints and authority, burst out in a rebellious fury that led to extensive destruction of property and looting of noble homes before troops could be brought to subdue and punish them.&quot;

These violent outbreaks caught the attention of the government, so it created many committees to investigate the causes. The committees concluded that no part of the countryside was prosperous; some parts, especially the fertile areas known as the &quot;black-soil region&quot;, were in decline. Although cultivated acreage had increased in the last half century, the increase had not been proportionate to the growth of the peasant population, which had doubled. &quot;There was general agreement at the turn of the century that Russia faced a grave and intensifying agrarian crisis due mainly to rural overpopulation with an annual excess of fifteen to eighteen live births over deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.&quot; The investigations revealed many difficulties but the committees could not find solutions that were both sensible and &quot;acceptable&quot; to the government.

===Nationality problem===

Russia was a multi-ethnic empire. Nineteenth-century Russians saw cultures and religions in a clear hierarchy. Non-Russian cultures were tolerated in the empire but were not necessarily respected. Culturally, Europe was favored over Asia, as was Orthodox Christianity over other religions.

For generations, Russian Jews had been considered a special problem. Jews constituted only about 4% of the population but were concentrated in the western borderlands. Like other minorities in Russia, the Jews lived &quot;miserable and circumscribed lives, forbidden to settle or acquire land outside the cities and towns, legally limited in attendance at secondary school and higher schools, virtually barred from legal professions, denied the right to vote for municipal councilors, and excluded from services in the Navy or the Guards&quot;.

The government&#x27;s treatment of Jews, although considered a separate issue, was similar to its policies in dealing with all national and religious minorities. Historian Theodore Weeks notes: &quot;Russian administrators, who never succeeded in coming up with a legal definition of &#x27;Pole&#x27;, despite the decades of restrictions on that ethnic group, regularly spoke of individuals &#x27;of Polish descent&#x27; or, alternatively, &#x27;of Russian descent&#x27;, making identity a function of birth.&quot; This policy only succeeded in producing or aggravating feelings of disloyalty. There was growing impatience with their inferior status and resentment against &quot;Russification&quot;. Russification is cultural assimilation definable as &quot;a process culminating in the disappearance of a given group as a recognizably distinct element within a larger society&quot;.

Besides the imposition of a uniform Russian culture throughout the empire, the government&#x27;s pursuit of Russification, especially during the second half of the nineteenth century, had political motives. After the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, the Russian state was compelled to take into account public opinion, but the government failed to gain the public&#x27;s support. Another motive for Russification policies was the Polish uprising of 1863. Unlike other minority nationalities, the Poles, in the eyes of the Tsar, were a direct threat to the empire&#x27;s stability. After the rebellion was crushed, the government implemented policies to reduce Polish cultural influences. In the 1870s the government began to distrust German elements on the western border. The Russian government felt that the unification of Germany would upset the power balance among the great powers of Europe and that Germany would use its strength against Russia. The government thought that the borders would be defended better if the borderland were more &quot;Russian&quot; in character. The culmination of cultural diversity created a cumbersome nationality problem that plagued the Russian government in the years leading up to the revolution.

===Labour problem===
The economic situation in Russia before the revolution presented a grim picture. The government had experimented with &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalist policies, but this strategy largely failed to gain traction within the Russian economy until the 1890s. Meanwhile, &quot;agricultural productivity stagnated, while international prices for grain dropped, and Russia&#x27;s foreign debt and need for imports grew. War and military preparations continued to consume government revenues. At the same time, the peasant taxpayers&#x27; ability to pay was strained to the utmost, leading to widespread famine in 1891.&quot;

In the 1890s, under Finance Minister Sergei Witte, a crash governmental program was proposed to promote industrialization. His policies included heavy government expenditures for railroad building and operations, subsidies and supporting services for private industrialists, high protective tariffs for Russian industries (especially heavy industry), an increase in exports, currency stabilization, and encouragement of foreign investments. His plan was successful and during the 1890s &quot;Russian industrial growth averaged 8 percent per year. Railroad mileage grew from a very substantial base by 40 percent between 1892 and 1902.&quot; Ironically, Witte&#x27;s success in implementing this program helped spur the 1905 revolution and eventually the 1917 revolution because it exacerbated social tensions. &quot;Besides dangerously concentrating a proletariat, a professional and a rebellious student body in centers of political power, industrialization infuriated both these new forces and the traditional rural classes.&quot; The government policy of financing industrialization through taxing peasants forced millions of peasants to work in towns. The &quot;peasant worker&quot; saw his labor in the factory as the means to consolidate his family&#x27;s economic position in the village and played a role in determining the social consciousness of the urban proletariat. The new concentrations and flows of peasants spread urban ideas to the countryside, breaking down isolation of peasants on communes.

Industrial workers began to feel dissatisfaction with the Tsarist government despite the protective labour laws the government decreed. Some of those laws included the prohibition of children under 12 from working, with the exception of night work in glass factories. Employment of children aged 12 to 15 was prohibited on Sundays and holidays. Workers had to be paid in cash at least once a month, and limits were placed on the size and bases of fines for tardy workers. Employers were prohibited from charging workers for the cost of lighting of the shops and plants. Despite these labour protections, the workers believed that the laws were not enough to free them from unfair and inhumane practices. At the start of the 20th century, Russian industrial workers worked on average 11-hours per day (10 hours on Saturday), factory conditions were perceived as grueling and often unsafe, and attempts at independent unions were often not accepted. Many workers were forced to work beyond the maximum of hours per day. Others were still subject to arbitrary and excessive fines for tardiness, mistakes in their work, or absence. Russian industrial workers were also the lowest-wage workers in Europe. Although the cost of living in Russia was low, &quot;the average worker&#x27;s 16 rubles per month could not buy the equal of what the French worker&#x27;s 110 francs would buy for him.&quot; Furthermore, the same labour laws prohibited the organisation of trade unions and strikes. Dissatisfaction turned into despair for many impoverished workers, which made them more sympathetic to radical ideas. These discontented, radicalized workers became key to the revolution by participating in illegal strikes and revolutionary protests.

The government responded by arresting labour agitators and enacting more &quot;paternalistic&quot; legislation. Introduced in 1900 by Sergei Zubatov, head of the Moscow security department, &quot;police socialism&quot; planned to have workers form workers&#x27; societies with police approval to &quot;provide healthful, fraternal activities and opportunities for cooperative self-help together with &#x27;protection&#x27; against influences that might have inimical effect on loyalty to job or country&quot;. Some of these groups organised in Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, Nikolaev, and Kharkov, but these groups and the idea of police socialism failed.

From 1900 to 1903, the period of industrial depression caused many firm bankruptcies and a reduction in the employment rate. Employees were restive: they would join legal organisations but turn the organisations toward an end that the organisations&#x27; sponsors did not intend. Workers used legitimate means to organise strikes or to draw support for striking workers outside these groups. A strike that began in 1902 by workers in the railroad shops in Vladikavkaz and Rostov-on-Don created such a response that by the next summer, 225,000 in various industries in southern Russia and Transcaucasia were on strike. These were not the first illegal strikes in the country&#x27;s history but their aims, and the political awareness and support among workers and non-workers, made them more troubling to the government than earlier strikes. The government responded by closing all legal organisations by the end of 1903.

===Educated class as a problem===
The Minister of the Interior, Plehve, designated schools as a pressing problem for the government, but he did not realize it was only a symptom of antigovernment feelings among the educated class. Students of universities, other schools of higher learning, and occasionally of secondary schools and theological seminaries were part of this group.

Student radicalism began around the time Tsar Alexander II came to power. Alexander abolished serfdom and enacted fundamental reforms in the legal and administrative structure of the Russian empire, which were revolutionary for their time. He lifted many restrictions on universities and abolished obligatory uniforms and military discipline. This ushered in a new freedom in the content and reading lists of academic courses. In turn, that created student subcultures, as youth were willing to live in poverty in order to receive an education. As universities expanded, there was a rapid growth of newspapers, journals, and an organisation of public lectures and professional societies. The 1860s was a time when the emergence of a new public sphere was created in social life and professional groups. This created the idea of their right to have an independent opinion.

The government was alarmed by these communities, and in 1861 tightened restrictions on admission and prohibited student organisations; these restrictions resulted in the first ever student demonstration, held in St. Petersburg, which led to a two-year closure of the university. The consequent conflict with the state was an important factor in the chronic student protests over subsequent decades. The atmosphere of the early 1860s gave rise to political engagement by students outside universities that became a tenet of student radicalism by the 1870s. Student radicals described &quot;the special duty and mission of the student as such to spread the new word of liberty. Students were called upon to extend their freedoms into society, to repay the privilege of learning by serving the people, and to become in Nikolai Ogarev&#x27;s phrase &#x27;apostles of knowledge&#x27;.&quot; During the next two decades, universities produced a significant share of Russia&#x27;s revolutionaries. Prosecution records from the 1860s and 1870s show that more than half of all political offences were committed by students despite being a minute proportion of the population. &quot;The tactics of the left-wing students proved to be remarkably effective, far beyond what any of the students would have dreamed. Sensing that neither the university administrations nor the government possessed the will or authority to enforce regulations, radicals simply went ahead with their plans to turn the schools into centres of political activity for students and non-students alike.&quot;

They took up problems that were unrelated to their &quot;proper employment&quot;, and displayed defiance and radicalism by boycotting examinations, rioting, arranging marches in sympathy with strikers and political prisoners, circulating petitions, and writing anti-government propaganda.

This disturbed the government, but it believed the cause was lack of training in patriotism and religion. Therefore, the curriculum was &quot;toughened up&quot; to emphasize classical language and mathematics in secondary schools, but defiance continued. Expulsion, exile, and forced military service also did not stop students. &quot;In fact, when the official decision to overhaul the whole educational system was finally made, in 1904, and to that end Vladimir Glazov, head of General Staff Academy, was selected as Minister of Education, the students had grown bolder and more resistant than ever.&quot;

== Rise of the opposition ==
The events of 1905 came after progressive and academic agitation for more political democracy and limits to Tsarist rule in Russia, and an increase in strikes by workers against employers for radical economic demands and union recognition, (especially in southern Russia). As an example, Trotsky who would assume a central role in the 1905 revolution, would write several proclamations urging for improved economic conditions, political rights and the use of strike action against the Tsarist regime on behalf of workers.

Many socialists view this as a period when the rising revolutionary movement was met with rising reactionary movements. As Rosa Luxemburg stated in 1906 in &quot;The Mass Strike&quot;, when collective strike activity was met with what is perceived as repression from an autocratic state, economic and political demands grew into and reinforced each other.

Russian progressives formed the Union of Zemstvo Constitutionalists in 1903 and the Union of Liberation in 1904, which called for a constitutional monarchy. Russian socialists formed two major groups: the Socialist Revolutionary Party (founded in 1902), which followed the Russian populist tradition, and the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (founded in 1898).

In late 1904 liberals started a series of banquets (modeled on the &quot;campagne des banquets&quot; leading up to the French Revolution of 1848), nominally celebrating the 40th anniversary of the liberal court statutes, but actually an attempt to circumvent laws against political gatherings. The banquets resulted in calls for political reforms and a constitution. In November 1904 a ()—a gathering of zemstvo delegates representing all levels of Russian society—called for a constitution, civil liberties and a parliament. On , the Moscow City Duma passed a resolution demanding the establishment of an elected national legislature, full freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. Similar resolutions and appeals from other city dumas and zemstvo councils followed.

Emperor Nicholas II made a move to meet many of these demands, appointing liberal Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky as Minister of the Interior after the July 1904 assassination of Vyacheslav von Plehve. On , the Emperor issued a manifesto promising the broadening of the zemstvo system and more authority for local municipal councils, insurance for industrial workers, the emancipation of Inorodtsy and the abolition of censorship. The crucial demand—that for a representative national legislature—was missing in the manifesto.

Worker strikes in the Caucasus broke out in March 1902. Strikes on the railways, originating from pay disputes, took on other issues and drew in other industries, culminating in a general strike at Rostov-on-Don in November 1902.
Daily meetings of 15,000 to 20,000 heard openly revolutionary appeals for the first time, before a massacre defeated the strikes. But reaction to the massacres brought political demands to purely economic ones. Luxemburg described the situation in 1903 by saying: &quot;the whole of South Russia in May, June and July was aflame&quot;,
including Baku (where separate wage struggles culminated in a citywide general strike) and Tiflis, where commercial workers gained a reduction in the working day, and were joined by factory workers. In 1904, massive strike waves broke out in Odessa in the spring, in Kiev in July, and in Baku in December. This all set the stage for the strikes in St. Petersburg in December 1904 to January 1905 seen as the first step in the 1905 revolution.

Another contributing factor behind the revolution was the Bloody Sunday massacre of protesters that took place in January 1905 in St. Petersburg sparked a spate of civil unrest in the Russian Empire. Lenin urged Bolsheviks to take a greater role in the events, encouraging violent insurrection. In doing so, he adopted SR slogans regarding &quot;armed insurrection&quot;, &quot;mass terror&quot;, and &quot;the expropriation of gentry land&quot;, resulting in Menshevik accusations that he had deviated from orthodox Marxism. In turn, he insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks; many Bolsheviks refused, and both groups attended the Third RSDLP Congress, held in London in April 1905 at the Brotherhood Church. Lenin presented many of his ideas in the pamphlet &quot;Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution&quot;, published in August 1905. Here, he predicted that Russia&#x27;s liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a transition to constitutional monarchy and thus betray the revolution; instead he argued that the proletariat would have to build an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish the &quot;provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.&quot;

== Start of the revolution ==

In December 1904, a strike occurred at the Putilov plant (a railway and artillery supplier) in St. Petersburg. Sympathy strikes in other parts of the city raised the number of strikers to 150,000 workers in 382 factories. By , the city had no electricity and newspaper distribution was halted. All public areas were declared closed.

Controversial Orthodox priest Georgy Gapon, who headed a police-sponsored workers&#x27; association, led a huge workers&#x27; procession to the Winter Palace to deliver a petition to the Tsar on Sunday, . The troops guarding the Palace were ordered to tell the demonstrators not to pass a certain point, according to Sergei Witte, and at some point, troops opened fire on the demonstrators, causing between 200 (according to Witte) and 1,000 deaths. The event became known as Bloody Sunday, and is considered by many scholars as the start of the active phase of the revolution.

The events in St. Petersburg provoked public indignation and a series of massive strikes that spread quickly throughout the industrial centers of the Russian Empire. Polish socialists—both the PPS and the SDKPiL—called for a general strike. By the end of January 1905, over 400,000 workers in Russian Poland were on strike (see Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)). Half of European Russia&#x27;s industrial workers went on strike in 1905, and 93.2% in Poland. There were also strikes in Finland and the Baltic coast. In Riga, 130 protesters were killed on , and in Warsaw a few days later over 100 strikers were shot on the streets. By February, there were strikes in the Caucasus, and by April, in the Urals and beyond. In March, all higher academic institutions were forcibly closed for the remainder of the year, adding radical students to the striking workers. A strike by railway workers on quickly developed into a general strike in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. This prompted the setting up of the short-lived Saint Petersburg Soviet of Workers&#x27; Delegates, an admixture of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks headed by Khrustalev-Nossar and despite the Iskra split would see the likes of Julius Martov and Georgi Plekhanov spar with Lenin. Leon Trotsky, who felt a strong connection to the Bolsheviki, had not given up a compromise but spearheaded strike action in over 200 factories. By , over 2 million workers were on strike and there were almost no active railways in all of Russia. Growing inter-ethnic confrontation throughout the Caucasus resulted in Armenian–Tatar massacres, heavily damaging the cities and the Baku oilfields.
With the unsuccessful and bloody Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) there was unrest in army reserve units. On 2 January 1905, Port Arthur was lost; in February 1905, the Russian army was defeated at Mukden, losing almost 80,000 men. On 27–28 May 1905, the Russian Baltic Fleet was defeated at Tsushima. Witte was dispatched to make peace, negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth (signed ). In 1905, there were naval mutinies at Sevastopol (see Sevastopol Uprising), Vladivostok, and Kronstadt, peaking in June with the mutiny aboard the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot;. The mutineers eventually surrendered the battleship to Romanian authorities on 8 July in exchange for asylum, then the Romanians returned her to Imperial Russian authorities on the following day. Some sources claim over 2,000 sailors died in the suppression. The mutinies were disorganised and quickly crushed. Despite these mutinies, the armed forces were largely apolitical and remained mostly loyal, if dissatisfied—and were widely used by the government to control the 1905 unrest.
Nationalist groups had been angered by the Russification undertaken since Alexander II. The Poles, Finns, and the Baltic provinces all sought autonomy, and also freedom to use their national languages and promote their own culture. Muslim groups were also active, founding the Union of the Muslims of Russia in August 1905. Certain groups took the opportunity to settle differences with each other rather than the government. Some nationalists undertook anti-Jewish pogroms, possibly with government aid, and in total over 3,000 Jews were killed.

The number of prisoners throughout the Russian Empire, which had peaked at 116,376 in 1893, fell by over a third to a record low of 75,009 in January 1905, chiefly because of several mass amnesties granted by the Tsar; the historian S G Wheatcroft has wondered what role these released criminals played in the 1905–06 social unrest.

=== Government response ===
On 12 January 1905, the Tsar appointed Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov as governor in St Petersburg and dismissed the Minister of the Interior, Pyotr Sviatopolk-Mirsky, on . He appointed a government commission &quot;to enquire without delay into the causes of discontent among the workers in the city of St Petersburg and its suburbs&quot; in view of the strike movement. The commission was headed by Senator Nikolay Shidlovsky, a member of the State Council, and included officials, chiefs of government factories, and private factory owners. It was also meant to have included workers&#x27; delegates elected according to a two-stage system. Elections of the workers delegates were, however, blocked by the socialists who wanted to divert the workers from the elections to the armed struggle. On , the commission was dissolved without having started work. Following the assassination of his uncle, the Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich, on , the Tsar made new concessions. On he published the &quot;Bulygin Rescript&quot;, which promised the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech (in the form of language rights for the Polish minority) and a reduction in the peasants&#x27; redemption payments. On , about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives held three meetings in Moscow, which passed a resolution, asking for popular representation at the national level. On , Nicholas II had received a Zemstvo deputation. Responding to speeches by Prince Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy and Mr Fyodrov, the Tsar confirmed his promise to convene an assembly of people&#x27;s representatives.

== Height of the revolution ==

Tsar Nicholas II agreed on to the creation of a State Duma of the Russian Empire but with consultative powers only. When its slight powers and limits on the electorate were revealed, unrest redoubled. The Saint Petersburg Soviet was formed and called for a general strike in October, refusal to pay taxes, and the en masse withdrawal of bank deposits.

In June and July 1905, there were many peasant uprisings in which peasants seized land and tools. Disturbances in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland culminated in June 1905 in the Łódź insurrection. Surprisingly, only one landlord was recorded as killed. Far more violence was inflicted on peasants outside the commune: 50 deaths were recorded. Anti-tsarist protests displaced onto Jewish communities in the October 1905 Kishinev pogrom.

The October Manifesto, written by Sergei Witte and Alexis Obolenskii, was presented to the Tsar on . It closely followed the demands of the Zemstvo Congress in September, granting basic civil rights, allowing the formation of political parties, extending the franchise towards universal suffrage, and establishing the Duma as the central legislative body.

The Tsar waited and argued for three days, but finally signed the manifesto on , citing his desire to avoid a massacre and his realisation that there was insufficient military force available to pursue alternative options. He regretted signing the document, saying that he felt &quot;sick with shame at this betrayal of the dynasty ... the betrayal was complete&quot;.

When the manifesto was proclaimed, there were spontaneous demonstrations of support in all the major cities. The strikes in Saint Petersburg and elsewhere officially ended or quickly collapsed. A political amnesty was also offered. The concessions came hand-in-hand with renewed, and brutal, action against the unrest. There was also a backlash from the conservative elements of society, with right-wing attacks on strikers, left-wingers, and Jews.

While the Russian liberals were satisfied by the October Manifesto and prepared for upcoming Duma elections, radical socialists and revolutionaries denounced the elections and called for an armed uprising to destroy the Empire.

Some of the November uprising of 1905 in Sevastopol, headed by retired naval Lieutenant Pyotr Schmidt, was directed against the government, while some was undirected. It included terrorism, worker strikes, peasant unrest and military mutinies, and was only suppressed after a fierce battle. The Trans-Baikal railroad fell into the hands of striker committees and demobilised soldiers returning from Manchuria after the Russo–Japanese War. The Tsar had to send a special detachment of loyal troops along the Trans-Siberian Railway to restore order.

Between , there was a general strike by Russian workers. The government sent troops on 7 December, and a bitter street-by-street fight began. A week later, the Semyonovsky Regiment was deployed, and used artillery to break up demonstrations and to shell workers&#x27; districts. On , with around a thousand people dead and parts of the city in ruins, the workers surrendered. After a final spasm in Moscow, the uprisings ended in December 1905. According to figures presented in the Duma by Professor Maksim Kovalevsky, by April 1906, more than 14,000 people had been executed and 75,000 imprisoned. Historian Brian Taylor states the number of deaths in the 1905 revolution was in the &quot;thousands&quot; and notes one source that puts the figure at over 13,000 deaths.

==Results==
Following the Revolution of 1905, the Tsar made last attempts to save his regime, and offered reforms similar to most rulers when pressured by a revolutionary movement. The military remained loyal throughout the Revolution of 1905, as shown by their shooting of revolutionaries when ordered by the Tsar, making overthrow difficult. These reforms were outlined in a precursor to the Constitution of 1906 known as the October Manifesto which created the Imperial Duma. The Russian Constitution of 1906, also known as the Fundamental Laws, set up a multiparty system and a limited constitutional monarchy. The revolutionaries were quelled and satisfied with the reforms, but it was not enough to prevent the 1917 revolution that would later topple the Tsar&#x27;s regime.

===Creation of Duma and appointment of Stolypin===
There had been earlier attempts in establishing a Russian Duma before the October Manifesto, but these attempts faced dogged resistance. One attempt in July 1905, called the Bulygin Duma, tried to reduce the assembly into a consultative body. It also proposed limiting voting rights to those with a higher property qualification, excluding industrial workers. Both sides—the opposition and the conservatives—were not pleased with the results. Another attempt in August 1905 was almost successful, but that too died when Nicholas insisted on the Duma&#x27;s functions be relegated to an advisory position. The October Manifesto, aside from granting the population the freedom of speech and assembly, proclaimed that no law would be passed without examination and approval by the Imperial Duma. The Manifesto also extended the suffrage to universal proportions, allowing for greater participation in the Duma, though the electoral law on 11 December still excluded women. Nevertheless, the tsar retained the power of veto.

Propositions for restrictions to the Duma&#x27;s legislative powers remained persistent. A decree on 20 February 1906 transformed the State Council, the advisory body, into a second chamber with legislative powers &quot;equal to those of the Duma&quot;. Not only did this transformation violate the Manifesto, but the Council became a buffer zone between the tsar and Duma, slowing whatever progress the latter could achieve. Even three days before the Duma&#x27;s first session, on 24 April 1906, the Fundamental Laws further limited the assembly&#x27;s movement by giving the tsar the sole power to appoint/dismiss ministers. Adding insult was the indication that the Tsar alone had control over many facets of political reins—all without the Duma&#x27;s expressed permission. The trap seemed perfectly set for the unsuspecting Duma: by the time the assembly convened in 27 April, it quickly found itself unable to do much without violating the Fundamental Laws. Defeated and frustrated, the majority of the assembly voted no confidence and handed in their resignations after a few weeks on 13 May.
The attacks on the Duma were not confined to its legislative powers. By the time the Duma opened, it was missing crucial support from its populace, thanks in no small part to the government&#x27;s return to Pre-Manifesto levels of suppression. The Soviets were forced to lay low for a long time, while the zemstvos turned against the Duma when the issue of land appropriation came up. The issue of land appropriation was the most contentious of the Duma&#x27;s appeals. The Duma proposed that the government distribute its treasury, &quot;monastic and imperial lands&quot;, and seize private estates as well. The Duma, in fact, was preparing to alienate some of its more affluent supporters, a decision that left the assembly without the necessary political power to be efficient.

Nicholas II remained wary of having to share power with reform-minded bureaucrats. When the pendulum in 1906 elections swung to the left, Nicholas immediately ordered the Duma&#x27;s dissolution just after 73 days. Hoping to further squeeze the life out of the assembly, he appointed a tougher prime minister in Petr Stolypin as the liberal Witte&#x27;s replacement. Much to Nicholas&#x27;s chagrin, Stolypin attempted to bring about acts of reform (land reform), while retaining measures favorable to the regime (stepping up the number of executions of revolutionaries). After the revolution subsided, he was able to bring economic growth back to Russia&#x27;s industries, a period which lasted until 1914. But Stolypin&#x27;s efforts did nothing to prevent the collapse of the monarchy, nor seemed to satisfy the conservatives. Stolypin died from a bullet wound, fired by a revolutionary, Dmitry Bogrov, on 5 September 1911.

===October Manifesto===

Even after Bloody Sunday and defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas II had been slow to offer a meaningful solution to the social and political crisis. At this point, he became more concerned with his personal affairs such as the illness of his son, whose struggle with haemophilia was overseen by Rasputin. Nicholas also refused to believe that the population was demanding changes in the autocratic regime, seeing &quot;public opinion&quot; as mainly the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; and believing himself to be the patronly &#x27;father figure&#x27; to the Russian people. Sergei Witte, the minister of Russia, frustratedly argued with the Tsar that an immediate implementation of reforms was needed to retain order in the country. It was only after the Revolution started picking up steam that Nicholas was forced to make concessions by writing the October Manifesto.

Issued on 17 October 1905, the Manifesto stated that the government would grant the population reforms such as the right to vote and to convene in assemblies. Its main provisions were:
# The granting of the population &quot;inviolable personal rights&quot; including freedom of conscience, speech, and assemblage
# Giving the population who were previously cut off from doing so participation in the newly formed Duma
# Ensuring that no law would be passed without the consent of the Imperial Duma.

Despite what seemed to be a moment for celebration for Russia&#x27;s population and the reformists, the Manifesto was rife with problems. Aside from the absence of the word &quot;constitution&quot;, one issue with the manifesto was its timing. By October 1905, Nicholas was already dealing with a revolution. Another problem surfaced in the conscience of Nicholas himself: Witte said in 1911 that the manifesto was written only to get the pressure off the monarch&#x27;s back, that it was not a &quot;voluntary act&quot;. In fact, the writers hoped that the Manifesto would sow discord into &quot;the camp of the autocracy&#x27;s enemies&quot; and bring order back to Russia.

One immediate effect it did have, for a while, was the start of the Days of Freedom, a six-week period from 17 October to early December. This period witnessed an unprecedented level of freedom on all publications—revolutionary papers, brochures, etc.—even though the tsar officially retained the power to censor provocative material. This opportunity allowed the press to address the tsar, and government officials, in a harsh, critical tone previously unheard of. The freedom of speech also opened the floodgates for meetings and organised political parties. In Moscow alone, over 400 meetings took place in the first four weeks. Some of the political parties that came out of these meetings were the Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), Social Democrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Octobrists, and the far-rightist Union of the Russian People.

Among all the groups that benefited most from the Days of Freedoms were the labour unions. In fact, the Days of Freedom witnessed unionisation in the history of the Russian Empire at its apex. At least 67 unions were established in Moscow, as well as 58 in St. Petersburg; the majority of both combined were formed in November 1905 alone. For the Soviets, it was a watershed period of time: nearly 50 of the unions in St. Petersburg came under Soviet control, while in Moscow, the Soviets had around 80,000 members. This large sector of power allowed the Soviets enough clout to form their own militias. In St. Petersburg alone, the Soviets claimed around 6,000 armed members with the purpose of protecting the meetings.

Perhaps empowered in their newfound window of opportunity, the St. Petersburg Soviets, along with other socialist parties, called for armed struggles against the Tsarist government, a war call that no doubt alarmed the government. Not only were the workers motivated, but the Days of Freedom also had an earthquake-like effect on the peasant collective as well. Seeing an opening in the autocracy&#x27;s waning authority thanks to the Manifesto, the peasants, with a political organisation, took to the streets in revolt. In response, the government exerted its forces in campaigns to subdue and repress both the peasants and the workers. Consequences were now in full force: with a pretext in their hands, the government spent the month of December 1905 regaining the level of authority once lost to Bloody Sunday.

Ironically, the writers of the October Manifesto were caught off guard by the surge in revolts. One of the main reasons for writing the October Manifesto bordered on the government&#x27;s &quot;fear of the revolutionary movement&quot;. In fact, many officials believed this fear was practically the sole reason for the Manifesto&#x27;s creation in the first place. Among those more scared was Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov, governor general of St. Petersburg and deputy minister of the interior. Trepov urged Nicholas II to stick to the principles in the Manifesto, for &quot;every retreat ... would be hazardous to the dynasty&quot;.

===Russian Constitution of 1906===
The Russian Constitution of 1906 was published on the eve of the convocation of the First Duma. The new Fundamental Law was enacted to institute promises of the October Manifesto as well as add new reforms. The Tsar was confirmed as absolute leader, with complete control of the executive, foreign policy, church, and the armed forces. The structure of the Duma was changed, becoming a lower chamber below the Council of Ministers, and was half-elected, half-appointed by the Tsar. Legislations had to be approved by the Duma, the council, and the Tsar to become law. The Fundamental State Laws were the &quot;culmination of the whole sequence of events set in motion in October 1905 and which consolidated the new &quot;status quo&quot;&quot;. The introduction of The Russian Constitution of 1906 was not simply an institution of the October Manifesto. The introduction of the constitution states (and thus emphasizes) the following:
* The Russian State is one and indivisible.
* The Grand Duchy of Finland, while comprising an inseparable part of the Russian State, is governed in its internal affairs by special decrees based on special legislation.
* The Russian language is the common language of the state, and its use is compulsory in the army, the navy and all state and public institutions. The use of local (regional) languages and dialects in state and public institutions are determined by special legislation.

The Constitution did not mention any of the provisions of the October Manifesto. While it did enact the provisions laid out previously, its sole purpose seems again to be the propaganda for the monarchy and to simply not fall back on prior promises. The provisions and the new constitutional monarchy did not satisfy Russians and Lenin. The Constitution lasted until the fall of the empire in 1917.

== Rise of political violence ==
The years 1906 and 1907 saw a decline of mass movements, strikes and protests, and a rise of overt political violence. Combat groups such as the SR Combat Organization carried out many assassinations targeting civil servants and police, and robberies. Between 1906 and 1909, revolutionaries killed 7,293 people, of whom 2,640 were officials, and wounded 8,061. Notable victims included:
* Nikolai Bobrikov – Governor-General of Finland. Killed in Helsinki (attack on 16 June).
* Vyacheslav von Plehve – Minister of Interior. Killed in Saint Petersburg.
* Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia – Killed in Moscow.
* Eliel Soisalon-Soininen – Procurator of Justice of Finland. Killed in Helsinki.
* Viktor Sakharov – former war minister. Killed in Saratov
* Admiral Chukhnin – the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. Killed in Sevastopol
* Aleksey Ignatyev – Killed in Tver

== Repression ==
The years of revolution were marked by a dramatic rise in the numbers of death sentences and executions. Different figures on the number of executions were compared by Senator Nikolai Tagantsev, and are listed in the table.


These numbers reflect only executions of civilians, and do not include a large number of summary executions by punitive army detachments and executions of military mutineers. Peter Kropotkin, an anarchist, noted that official statistics excluded executions conducted during punitive expeditions, especially in Siberia, Caucasus and the Baltic provinces. By 1906 some 4,509 political prisoners were incarcerated in Russian Poland, 20 percent of the empire&#x27;s total.

== Ivanovo Soviet ==
Ivanovo Voznesensk was known as the &#x27;Russian Manchester&#x27; for its textile mills. In 1905, its local revolutionaries were overwhelmingly Bolshevik. It was the first Bolshevik branch in which workers outnumbered intellectuals.
* 11 May 1905: The &#x27;Group&#x27;, the revolutionary leadership, called for the workers at all the textile mills to strike.
* 12 May: The strike begins. Strike leaders meet in the local woods.
* 13 May: 40,000 workers assemble before the Administration Building to give Svirskii, the regional factory inspector, a list of demands.
* 14 May: Workers&#x27; delegates are elected. Svirskii had suggested they do so, as he wanted people to negotiate with. A mass meeting is held in Administration Square. Svirskii tells them the mill owners will not meet their demands but will negotiate with elected mill delegates, who will be immune to prosecution, according to the governor.
* 15 May: Svirskii tells the strikers they can negotiate only about each factory in turn, but they can hold elections wherever. The strikers elect delegates to represent each mill while they are still out in the streets. Later the delegates elect a chairman.
* 17 May: The meetings are moved to the bank of the Talka River, on suggestion by the police chief.
* 27 May: The delegates&#x27; meeting house is closed.
* 3 June: Cossacks break up a workers&#x27; meeting, arresting over 20 men. Workers start sabotaging telephone wires and burn down a mill.
* 9 June: The police chief resigns.
* 12 June: All prisoners are released. Most mill owners flee to Moscow. Neither side gives in.
* 27 June: Workers agree to stop striking 1 July.

== Poland ==
The 1905–1907 revolution was at the time the largest wave of strikes and widest emancipatory movement Poland had ever seen, and it would remain so until the 1970s and 1980s. In 1905, 93.2% of Congress Poland&#x27;s industrial workers went on strike. The first phase of the revolution consisted primarily of mass strikes, rallies, demonstrations—later this evolved into street skirmishes with the police and army as well as bomb assassinations and robberies of transports carrying money to tsarist financial institutions.

One of the major events of that period was the insurrection in Łódź in June 1905, but unrest happened in many other areas too. Warsaw was also an active centre of resistance, particularly in terms of strikes, whereas further south the &quot;Republika Ostrowiecka&quot; and &quot;Republika Zagłębiowska&quot; were proclaimed (tsarist control was later restored in these areas when martial law was introduced). Until November 1905, Poland was at the vanguard of the revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire despite the vast military numbers thrown against it; even when the upheaval began its downfall, larger strikes happened more often in Poland than they did in other parts of the Empire in the years 1906–1907.

Due to its reach, violence, radicalism, and effects, some Polish historians even consider the events of the 1905 revolution in Poland a fourth Polish uprising against the Russian Empire. Rosa Luxemburg described Poland as &quot;one of the most explosive centres of the revolutionary movement&quot; which &quot;in 1905 marched at the head of the Russian Revolution&quot;.

== Finland ==
In the Grand Duchy of Finland, the Social Democrats organised the general strike of 1905 (). The Red Guards were formed, led by captain Johan Kock. During the general strike, the &quot;Red Declaration&quot;, written by Finnish politician and journalist Yrjö Mäkelin, was published in &quot;Tampere,&quot; demanding dissolution of the Senate of Finland, universal suffrage, political freedoms, and abolition of censorship. Leo Mechelin, leader of the constitutionalists, crafted the &quot;November Manifesto&quot;: the revolution resulted in the abolition of the Diet of Finland and of the four Estates, and to the creation of the modern Parliament of Finland. It also resulted in a temporary halt to the Russification policy that Russia had started in 1899.

On , Russian artillerymen and military engineers rose in revolt in the fortress of Sveaborg (later called Suomenlinna), Helsinki. The Finnish Red Guards supported the Sveaborg Rebellion with a general strike, but the mutiny was quelled within 60 hours by loyal troops and ships of the Baltic Fleet.

== Estonia ==

In the Governorate of Estonia, Estonians called for freedom of the press and assembly, for universal suffrage, and for national autonomy. On , the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in Tallinn in which about 8 000–10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the Estonian flag was displayed publicly for the first time. Jaan Tõnisson used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party – &quot;National Progress Party&quot;.

Another, more radical political organisation, the &quot;Estonian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Union&quot; was founded as well. The moderate supporters of Tõnisson and the more radical supporters of Jaan Teemant could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of Baltic Germans and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

== Latvia ==

Following the shooting of demonstrators in St. Petersburg, a wide-scale general strike began in Riga. On , Russian army troops opened fire on demonstrators killing 73 and injuring 200 people. During the middle of 1905, the focus of revolutionary events moved to the countryside with mass meetings and demonstrations. 470 new parish administrative bodies were elected in 94% of the parishes in Latvia. The Congress of Parish Representatives was held in Riga in November. In autumn 1905, armed conflict between the Baltic German nobility and the Latvian peasants began in the rural areas of Livonia and Courland. In Courland, the peasants seized or surrounded several towns. In Livonia, the fighters controlled the Rūjiena-Pärnu railway line. Martial law was declared in Courland in August 1905, and in Livonia in late November. Special punitive expeditions were dispatched in mid-December to suppress the movement. They executed 1170 people without trial or investigation and burned 300 peasant homes. Thousands were exiled to Siberia. Many Latvian intellectuals only escaped by fleeing to Western Europe or US. In 1906, the revolutionary movement gradually subsided.

<doc id="48740" wikidata="Q81082" url="?curid=48740" title="Henri Poincaré">
<text>Jules Henri Poincaré (, ; ; 29 April 185417 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as &quot;The Last Universalist&quot;, since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime. He has further been called &quot;the Gauss of modern mathematics&quot;. Due to his success in science, along with his influence and philosophy, he has been called &quot;the philosopher par excellence of modern science.&quot;

As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. Poincaré is regarded as the creator of the field of algebraic topology, and is further credited with introducing automorphic forms. He also made important contributions to algebraic geometry, number theory, complex analysis and Lie theory. He famously introduced the concept of the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which states that a state will eventually return arbitrarily close to its initial state after a sufficiently long time, which has far-reaching consequences. Early in the 20th century he formulated the Poincaré conjecture, which became, over time, one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It was eventually solved in 2002–2003 by Grigori Perelman. Poincaré popularized the use of non-Euclidean geometry in mathematics as well.

Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity, for which he is also credited with laying down the foundations for, further writing foundational papers in 1905. He first proposed gravitational waves (&quot;ondes gravifiques&quot;) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations, doing so in 1905. In 1912, he wrote an influential paper which provided a mathematical argument for quantum mechanics. Poincaré also laid the seeds of the discovery of radioactivity through his interest and study of X-rays, which influenced physicist Henri Becquerel, who then discovered the phenomena. The Poincaré group used in physics and mathematics was named after him, after he introduced the notion of the group.

Poincaré was considered the dominant figure in mathematics and theoretical physics during his time, and was the most respected mathematician of his time, being described as &quot;the living brain of the rational sciences&quot; by mathematician Paul Painlevé. Philosopher Karl Popper regarded Poincaré as the greatest philosopher of science of all time, with Poincaré also originating the conventionalist view in science. Poincaré was a public intellectual in his time, and personally, he believed in political equality for all, while wary of the influence of anti-intellectual positions that the Catholic Church held at the time. He served as the president of the French Academy of Sciences (1906), the president of Société astronomique de France (1901–1903), and twice the president of Société mathématique de France (1886, 1900).

==Life==
Poincaré was born on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, into an influential French family. His father Léon Poincaré (1828–1892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy. His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher Émile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri&#x27;s family was his cousin, Raymond Poincaré, a fellow member of the Académie française, who was President of France from 1913 to 1920, and three-time Prime Minister of France between 1913 and 1929.

===Education===
During his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eugénie Launois (1830–1897).

In 1862, Henri entered the Lycée in Nancy (now renamed the in his honour, along with Henri Poincaré University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lycée and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a &quot;monster of mathematics&quot; and he won first prizes in the concours général, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lycées across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as &quot;average at best&quot;. Poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties. He graduated from the Lycée in 1871 with a baccalauréat in both letters and sciences.

During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.

Poincaré entered the École Polytechnique as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (&quot;Démonstration nouvelle des propriétés de l&#x27;indicatrice d&#x27;une surface&quot;) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the École des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.

As a graduate of the École des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident.

At the same time, Poincaré was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named &quot;Sur les propriétés des fonctions définies par les équations aux différences partielles&quot;. Poincaré devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the Solar System. He graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.

===First scientific achievements===
After receiving his degree, Poincaré began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.

There, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d&#x27;Andecy (1857–1934), granddaughter of Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and great-granddaughter of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and Léon (born 1893).

Poincaré immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincaré was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in the École Polytechnique.

In 1881–1882, Poincaré created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.

===Career===
He never fully abandoned his career in the mining administration to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps des Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.

Beginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the &quot;maître de conférences d&#x27;analyse&quot; (associate professor of analysis). Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.

In 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincaré was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Académie française on 5 March 1908.

In 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden&#x27;s mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)

In 1893, Poincaré joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincaré backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude. It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)

In 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus, attacking the spurious scientific claims regarding evidence brought against Dreyfus.

Poincaré was the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.

====Students====
Poincaré had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).

=== Death ===

In 1912, Poincaré underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincaré family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris, in section 16 close to the gate Rue Émile-Richard.

A former French Minister of Education, Claude Allègre, proposed in 2004 that Poincaré be reburied in the Panthéon in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens of the highest honour.

==Work==

===Summary===
Poincaré made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, Quantum mechanics, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.

*Published an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of quantum mechanics.

===Three-body problem===
The problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the Solar System had eluded mathematicians since Newton&#x27;s time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the &quot;n&quot;-body problem, where &quot;n&quot; is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The &quot;n&quot;-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by Gösta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:

Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton&#x27;s law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly.

In case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincaré, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, &quot;This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.&quot; (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu and the book by Barrow-Green). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for &quot;n&quot; = 3 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of &quot;n&quot; &gt; 3 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s. The series solutions have very slow convergence. It would take millions of terms to determine the motion of the particles for even very short intervals of time, so they are unusable in numerical work.

===Work on relativity===

====Local time====
Poincaré&#x27;s work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell&#x27;s theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (&quot;electrons&quot; or &quot;ions&quot;), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called &quot;local time&quot; formula_1 and introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson–Morley experiment). Poincaré was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz&#x27;s theory. Poincaré as a philosopher was interested in the &quot;deeper meaning&quot;. Thus he interpreted Lorentz&#x27;s theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In (1898), Poincaré said, &quot;A little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.&quot; He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.
Based on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz&#x27;s &quot;wonderful invention&quot; of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.

====Principle of relativity and Lorentz transformations====
In 1881 Poincaré described hyperbolic geometry in terms of the hyperboloid model, formulating transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval formula_2, which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions. In addition, Poincaré&#x27;s other models of hyperbolic geometry (Poincaré disk model, Poincaré half-plane model) as well as the Beltrami–Klein model can be related to the relativistic velocity space (see Gyrovector space).

In 1892 Poincaré developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincaré sphere. It was shown that the Poincaré sphere possesses an underlying Lorentzian symmetry, by which it can be used as a geometrical representation of Lorentz transformations and velocity additions.

He discussed the &quot;principle of relative motion&quot; in two papers in 1900
and named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.
In 1905 Poincaré wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz&#x27;s paper of 1904, which Poincaré described as a &quot;paper of supreme importance&quot;. In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.
In a second letter to Lorentz, Poincaré gave his own reason why Lorentz&#x27;s time dilation factor was indeed correct after all—it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group—and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.
Poincaré later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:

The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:
::formula_3

and showed that the arbitrary function formula_4 must be unity for all formula_5 (Lorentz had set formula_6 by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincaré pointed out that the combination formula_7 is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing formula_8 as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. Poincaré expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit. So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.

====Mass–energy relation====
Like others before, Poincaré (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincaré concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (&quot;fluide fictif&quot;) with a mass density of &quot;E&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter &quot;and&quot; the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible—it&#x27;s neither created or destroyed—then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.

However, Poincaré&#x27;s resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.

Poincaré himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904). He rejected the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized his own solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:

In the above quote he refers to the Hertz assumption of total aether entrainment that was falsified by the Fizeau experiment but that experiment does indeed show that that light is partially &quot;carried along&quot; with a substance. Finally in 1908 he revisits the problem and ends with abandoning the principle of reaction altogether in favor of supporting a solution based in the inertia of aether itself.

He also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz&#x27;s variable mass formula_9, Abraham&#x27;s theory of variable mass and Kaufmann&#x27;s experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Marie Curie.

It was Albert Einstein&#x27;s concept of mass–energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount &quot;m&quot; = &quot;E&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2 that resolved Poincaré&#x27;s paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether. The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincaré&#x27;s solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincaré&#x27;s formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.

====Gravitational waves====
In 1905 Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (&quot;ondes gravifiques&quot;) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light. He wrote:
====Poincaré and Einstein====
Einstein&#x27;s first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincaré&#x27;s short paper, but before Poincaré&#x27;s longer version. Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincaré (1900) had described, but Einstein&#x27;s paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincaré never acknowledged Einstein&#x27;s work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincaré&#x27;s outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger&#x27;s general outlook to be close to his own and Poincaré&#x27;s to be close to Vaihinger&#x27;s. In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincaré posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 titled &quot;&quot;Geometrie und Erfahrung&quot; (Geometry and Experience)&quot; in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincaré as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying &quot;Lorentz had already recognized that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and Poincaré deepened this insight still further ...&quot;.

====Assessments on Poincaré and relativity====

Poincaré&#x27;s work in the development of special relativity is well recognised, though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein&#x27;s work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work. Poincaré developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the &quot;true&quot; time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincaré tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.

While this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincaré and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.

===Algebra and number theory===
Poincaré introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations. He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.

===Topology===
The subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his &quot;Erlangen Program&quot; (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term &quot;topology&quot; was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used &quot;Analysis situs&quot;. Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincaré. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.

His research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincaré proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler–Poincaré theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.

===Astronomy and celestial mechanics===

Poincaré published two now classical monographs, &quot;New Methods of Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1892–1899) and &quot;Lectures on Celestial Mechanics&quot; (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincaré showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.

These monographs include an idea of Poincaré, which later became the basis for mathematical &quot;chaos theory&quot; (see, in particular, the Poincaré recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.
Poincaré authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincaré received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).

===Differential equations and mathematical physics===
After defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincaré wrote a series of memoirs under the title &quot;On curves defined by differential equations&quot; (1881–1882). In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called &quot;qualitative theory of differential equations&quot;. Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincaré investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincaré also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.

==Character==

Poincaré&#x27;s work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincaré was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.

The mathematician Darboux claimed he was &quot;un intuitif&quot; (an intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincaré&#x27;s research demonstrated marvelous clarity and Poincaré himself wrote that he believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.

===Toulouse&#x27;s characterisation===
Poincaré&#x27;s mental organisation was interesting not only to Poincaré himself but also to Édouard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled &quot;Henri Poincaré&quot; (1910). In it, he discussed Poincaré&#x27;s regular schedule:
* He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10 a.m. and noon then again from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.
* His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.
* He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.
* His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.

These abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:
* He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.
* He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.
* He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.

In addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincaré started from basic principles each time (O&#x27;Connor et al., 2002).

His method of thinking is well summarised as:

==Legacy==
Poincaré is credited with laying the foundations of special relativity, with some arguing that he should be credited with its creation. He is said to have &quot;dominated the mathematics and the theoretical physics of his time&quot;, and that &quot;he was without a doubt the most admired mathematician while he was alive, and he remains today one of the world&#x27;s most emblematic scientific figures.&quot; Poincaré is regarded as a &quot;universal specialist&quot;, as he refined celestial mechanics, he progressed nearly all parts of mathematics of his time, including creating new subjects, is a father of special relativity, participated in all the great debates of his time in physics, was a major actor in the great epistemological debates of his day in relation to philosophy of science, and Poincaré was the one who investigated the 1879 Magny shaft firedamp explosion as an engineer. Due to the breadth of his research, Poincaré was the only member to be elected to every section of the French Academy of Sciences of the time, those being geometry, mechanics, physics, astronomy and navigation.

Physicist Henri Becquerel nominated Poincaré for a Nobel Prize in 1904, as Becquerel took note that &quot;Poincaré&#x27;s mathematical and philosophical genius surveyed all of physics and was among those that contributed most to human progress by giving researchers a solid basis for their journeys into the unknown.&quot; After his death, he was praised by many intellectual figures of his time, as the author Marie Bonaparte wrote to his widowed wife Louise that &quot;He was – as you know better than anyone – not only the greatest thinker, the most powerful genius of our time – but also a deep and incomparable heart; and having been close to him remains the precious memory of a whole life.&quot;

Mathematician E.T. Bell titled Poincaré as &quot;The Last Universalist&quot;, and noted his prowess in many fields, stating that:

When philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell was asked who was the greatest man that France had produced in modern times, he instantly replied &quot;Poincaré&quot;. Bell noted that if Poincaré had been as strong in practical science as he was in theoretical, he might have &quot;made a fourth with the incomparable three, Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss.&quot;

Bell further noted his powerful memory, one that was even superior to Leonhard Euler&#x27;s, stating that:

Bell notes the terrible eyesight of Poincaré, he almost completely remembered formulas and theorems by ear, and &quot;unable to see the board distinctly when he became a student of advanced mathematics, he sat back and listened, following and remembering perfectly without taking notes - an easy feat for him, but one incomprehensible to most mathematicians.&quot;

Henri Poincaré did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member Gösta Mittag-Leffler. The nomination archive reveals that Poincaré received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death. Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincaré. Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).

The fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincaré, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory. In Poincaré&#x27;s case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.

==Philosophy==

Poincaré had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincaré gives an interesting point of view in his 1902 book &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot;:

Poincaré believed that arithmetic is synthetic. He argued that Peano&#x27;s axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is &quot;a priori&quot; synthetic and not analytic. Poincaré then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions.

However, Poincaré did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincaré believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincaré held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as &quot;conventionalism&quot;. Poincaré believed that Newton&#x27;s first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincaré thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to non-Euclidean physical geometry.

===Free will===
Poincaré&#x27;s famous lectures before the Société de Psychologie in Paris (published as &quot;Science and Hypothesis&quot;, &quot;The Value of Science&quot;, and &quot;Science and Method&quot;) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.

Although he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincaré said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.

It is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician&#x27;s special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.
Poincaré&#x27;s two stages—random combinations followed by selection—became the basis for Daniel Dennett&#x27;s two-stage model of free will.

===Theorems===
Here is a list of theorems proved by Poincaré:

* Poincaré&#x27;s recurrence theorem: certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.
* Poincaré–Bendixson theorem: a statement about the long-term behaviour of orbits of continuous dynamical systems on the plane, cylinder, or two-sphere.
* Poincaré–Hopf theorem: a generalization of the hairy-ball theorem, which states that there is no smooth vector field on a sphere having no sources or sinks.
* Poincaré–Lefschetz duality theorem: a version of Poincaré duality in geometric topology, applying to a manifold with boundary
* Poincaré separation theorem: gives the upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix B&#x27;AB that can be considered as the orthogonal projection of a larger real symmetric matrix A onto a linear subspace spanned by the columns of B.
* Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem: every area-preserving, orientation-preserving homeomorphism of an annulus that rotates the two boundaries in opposite directions has at least two fixed points.
* Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem: an explicit description of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra.
* Poincaré–Bjerknes circulation theorem: theorem about a conservation of quantity for the rotating frame.
* Poincaré conjecture (now a theorem): Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.
* Poincaré–Miranda theorem: a generalization of the intermediate value theorem to &quot;n&quot; dimensions.

<text>The English suffixes -phobia, -phobic, -phobe (from Greek φόβος &quot;phobos&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;) occur in technical usage in psychiatry to construct words that describe irrational, abnormal, unwarranted, persistent, or disabling fear as a mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia), in chemistry to describe chemical aversions (e.g. hydrophobic), in biology to describe organisms that dislike certain conditions (e.g. acidophobia), and in medicine to describe hypersensitivity to a stimulus, usually sensory (e.g. photophobia). In common usage, they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject (e.g. homophobia). The suffix is antonymic to -phil-.

For more information on the psychiatric side, including how psychiatry groups phobias such as agoraphobia, social phobia, or simple phobia, see phobia. The following lists include words ending in &quot;-phobia&quot;, and include fears that have acquired names. In some cases, the naming of phobias has become a word game, of notable example being a 1998 humorous article published by BBC News. In some cases, a word ending in &quot;-phobia&quot; may have an antonym with the suffix &quot;-phil-&quot;, e.g. Germanophobe/Germanophile.

Many &quot;-phobia&quot; lists circulate on the Internet, with words collected from indiscriminate sources, often copying each other. Also, a number of psychiatric websites exist that at the first glance cover a huge number of phobias, but in fact use a standard text to fit any phobia and reuse it for all unusual phobias by merely changing the name. Sometimes it leads to bizarre results, such as suggestions to cure &quot;prostitute phobia&quot;. Such practice is known as content spamming and is used to attract search engines.

An article published in 1897 in &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot; noted &quot;the absurd tendency to give Greek names to objects feared (which, as Arndt says, would give us such terms as klopsophobia – fear of thieves, [&quot;sic&quot;] – fear of the number 13 ...)&quot;.


== Psychological conditions ==

Specialists may prefer to avoid the suffix &quot;-phobia&quot; and use more descriptive terms such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and avoidant personality disorder. Terms should strictly have a Greek prefix, although many are irregularly formed with Latin or even English prefixes. Many use inaccurate or imprecise prefixes, such as aerophobia (fear of air) for fear of flying.

== Cultural prejudices and discrimination ==

=== Ethnic/national/religious prejudices and discrimination ===
The suffix &quot;-phobia&quot; is used to coin terms that denote a particular anti-ethnic or anti-demographic sentiment, such as Americanophobia, Europhobia, Francophobia, Hispanophobia, and Indophobia. Often a synonym with the prefix &quot;anti-&quot; already exists (e.g. Polonophobia vs. anti-Polonism). Anti-religious sentiments are expressed in terms such as Christianophobia and Islamophobia.

== &quot;-phobia&quot; in the natural sciences ==
In the natural sciences, words with the suffix &quot;-phobia/-phobic&quot; generally describe a predisposition for avoidance and/or exclusion. For antonyms, see here
== Jocular and fictional phobias ==
* Aibohphobia – a humorous term for the fear of palindromes, which is a palindrome itself. The term is a piece of computer humor entered into the 1981 &quot;The Devil&#x27;s DP Dictionary&quot;.
* Anatidaephobia – the fictional fear that one is being watched by a duck. The word comes from the name of the family &quot;Anatidae,&quot; and was used in Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot;.
* Anoraknophobia – a portmanteau of &quot;anorak&quot; and &quot;arachnophobia&quot;. It was used in the Wallace and Gromit comic book &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;. Also the title of an album by Marillion.
* Arachibutyrophobia – fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth, from Latin &#x27; &quot;peanut&quot; and &#x27; &quot;butter&quot;. The word is used by Charles M. Schulz in a 1982 installment of his &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, and by Peter O&#x27;Donnell in his 1985 Modesty Blaise adventure novel &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Handle&quot;.
* Charlophobia – the fictional fear of any person named Charlotte or Charlie, mentioned in the comedic book &quot;A Duck is Watching Me: Strange and Unusual Phobias (2014),&quot; by Bernie Hobbs. The phobia was created to mock name bias, a form of discrimination studied by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago.
* Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia – fear of long words, from the root word combined with &quot;monstrum&quot; and &quot;hippopotamus&quot;. This was mentioned on the first episode of Series Five as a Tickle&#x27;s Teaser.
* Keanuphobia – fear of Keanu Reeves, portrayed in the Dean Koontz book, &quot;False Memory&quot;, where a woman has an irrational fear of Reeves and has to see her psychiatrist, Mark Ahriman, each week, unaware that she only has the fear in the first place because Ahriman implanted it via hypnotic suggestion to amuse himself. He calls her &quot;Keanuphobe&quot; in his head.
* Luposlipaphobia – fear of being pursued by timber wolves around a kitchen table while wearing socks on a newly waxed floor. Coined humorously by cartoonist Gary Larson for his comic The Far Side.
* Nihilophobia – fear of nothingness, from Latin &quot;nihil and&quot; &quot;nothing, none&quot;, as described by the Doctor in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Night&quot;. Voyager&#x27;s morale officer and chef Neelix has this condition, having panic attacks while the ship was traversing a dark expanse of space known as the Void. It is also the title of a 2008 album by Neuronium.
* Robophobia – irrational fear of robots and/or androids, also known as &quot;Grimwade&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;. It was first used in &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;, the fifth serial of the 14th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who.&quot;
* Semaphobia – fear of average web developers to use Semantic Web technologies.
* Venustraphobia – fear of beautiful women, according to a 1998 humorous article published by BBC News.

<text>Philip Baine Austin (April 6, 1941 – June 18, 2015) was an American comedian and writer, best known as a member of the Firesign Theatre.

==Early life and education==

Austin was born in Denver, Colorado, and later grew up in Fresno, California, attending Fresno High School. His mother was a drama teacher which influenced his upbringing as an actor. He attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, because it was nearly the most distant point in the continental United States from Fresno. He also attended Fresno State College and UCLA, but did not graduate from any of them. He was in the UCLA Drama Department at the same time as another dropout, Ray Manzarek of The Doors.

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
In Los Angeles in the late 1960s, he was one of the first apprentices for the Center Theatre Group and worked on the staff of KPFK radio in Los Angeles. At KPFK he worked with other staffers David Ossman and Peter Bergman who hosted Radio Free Oz on that station. Along with Bergman&#x27;s friend Phil Proctor, they formed The Firesign Theatre.

Starting as live radio actors, the group would go on to record a series of surrealistic comedy albums that were a hit amongst an underground audience. Austin played the group&#x27;s best-known creation, private investigator Nick Danger. Other prominent roles were as (Happy) Harry Cox, the narrator of &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot; and Bebop Loco/Lobo on &quot;Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death&quot;. He had also served as the troupe&#x27;s musician and record producer.

=== Short story writer ===
His collection of short stories, &quot;Tales of the Old Detective and Other Big Fat Lies&quot;, is published by Audio Editions. Two of his stories appear in the third volume of &quot;Mirth of a Nation&quot;.

=== Record albums ===
Austin also wrote a solo work, &quot;Roller Maidens From Outer Space&quot;, and directed (and acted in) &quot;Eat Or Be Eaten&quot;.

Stage versions of &quot;Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers&quot;; &quot;The Further Adventures of Nick Danger, Third Eye&quot;; &quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot;; and &quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot; are published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc.

== Death ==
Austin died at his home in Fox Island, Washington, on June 18, 2015, at the age of 74. The cause of death was originally given as cardiac arrest, but this was later changed to an aneurysm. When he died, his wife Oona mentioned that Austin also had been diagnosed with cancer months before.

<doc id="48755" wikidata="Q696116" url="?curid=48755" title="Neo-fascism">
<text>Neo-fascism is a post-World War II far-right ideology which includes significant elements of fascism. Neo-fascism usually includes ultranationalism, ultraconservatism, racial supremacy, right-wing populism, authoritarianism, nativism, xenophobia, and anti-immigration sentiment, as well as opposition to social democracy, parliamentarianism, Marxism, communism, socialism, liberalism, neoliberalism, and liberal democracy. 

Allegations that a group is neo-fascist may be hotly contested, especially when the term is used as a political epithet. Some post-World War II regimes have been described as neo-fascist due to their authoritarian nature, and sometimes due to their fascination with and sympathy towards fascist ideology and rituals.

== History ==

According to Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, the neo-fascist ideology emerged in 1942, after Nazi Germany invaded the USSR and decided to reorient its propaganda on a Europeanist ground. Europe then became both the myth and the utopia of the neo-fascists, who abandoned previous theories of racial inequalities within the white race to share a common euro-nationalist stance after World War II, embodied in Oswald Mosley&#x27;s Europe a Nation policy. The following chronology can therefore be delineated: an ideological gestation before 1919; the historical experience of fascism between 1919 and 1942, unfolded in several phases; and finally neo-fascism from 1942 onward.

Drawing inspiration from the Italian Social Republic, institutional neo-fascism took the form of the Italian Social Movement (MSI). It became one of the chief reference points for the European far-right until the late 1980s, and &quot;the best (and only) example of a Neofascist party&quot;, in the words of political scientist Cas Mudde. At the initiative of the MSI, the European Social Movement was established in 1951 as a pan-European organization of like-minded neo-fascist groups and figures such as the Francoist Falange, Maurice Bardèche, Per Engdahl, and Oswald Mosley. Other organizations like Jeune Nation called in the late 1950s for an extra-parliamentarian insurrection against the regime in what amounts to a remnant of pre-war fascist strategies. The main driving force of neo-fascist movements was what they saw as the defense of a Western civilization from the rise of both communism and the Third World, in some cases the loss of the colonial empire.

In 1961, Bardèche redefined the nature of fascism in a book deemed influential in the European far-right at large entitled (&quot;What Is Fascism?&quot;). He argued that previous fascists had essentially made two mistakes in that they focused their efforts on the methods rather than the original &quot;idea&quot;; and they wrongly believed that fascist society could be achieved via the nation-state as opposed to the construction of Europe. According to him, fascism could survive the 20th century in a new metapolitical guise if its theorists succeed in building inventive methods adapted to the changes of their times; the aim being the promotion of the core politico-cultural fascist project rather than vain attempts to revive doomed regimes: In addition, Bardèche wrote: &quot;The single party, the secret police, the public displays of Caesarism, even the presence of a Führer are not necessarily attributes of fascism. ... The famous fascist methods are constantly revised and will continue to be revised. More important than the mechanism is the idea which fascism has created for itself of man and freedom. ... With another name, another face, and with nothing which betrays the projection from the past, with the form of a child we do not recognize and the head of a young Medusa, the Order of Sparta will be reborn: and paradoxically it will, without doubt, be the last bastion of Freedom and the sweetness of living.&quot;

In the spirit of Bardèche&#x27;s strategy of disguise through framework change, the MSI had developed a policy of &quot;inserimento&quot; (insertion, entryism), which relied on gaining political acceptance via the cooperation with other parties within the democratic system. In the political context of the Cold War, anti-communism began to replace anti-fascism as the dominant trend in liberal democracies. In Italy, the MSI became a support group in parliament for the Christian Democratic government in the late 1950s–early 1960s, but was forced back into &quot;political ghetto&quot; after anti-fascist protests and violent street clashes occurred between radical leftist and far-right groups, leading to the demise of the short-lived fascist-backed Tambroni Cabinet in July 1960.

According to psychologist David Pavón-Cuéllar of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, the emergence of neoliberalism in the late-twentieth century prompted neoliberalist politicians to utilize neo-fascism by authoritatively removing all limits to capital (including labor laws, social rights and tariffs), through the aestheticization of politics and by using the narcissism of small differences to find a target for hate to exploit in order to maintain a social hierarchy instead of protecting all individuals.

== Causes and description ==
A number of historians and political scientists have pointed out that the situations in a number of European countries in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular France, Germany and Italy, were in some significant ways analogous to the conditions in Europe in the period between World War I and World War II that gave rise to fascism in its many national guises. Constant economic crises including high unemployment, a resurgence of nationalism, an increase in ethnic conflicts, and the geo-political weakness of national regimes were all present, and while not an exact one-to-one correspondence, circumstances were similar enough to promote the beginning of neo-fascism as a new fascist movement. Because intense nationalism is almost always a part of neo-fascism, the parties which make up this movement are not pan-European, but are specific to each country they arise in; other than this, the neo-fascist parties and other groups have many ideological traits in common.

While certainly fascistic in nature, it is claimed by some that there are differences between neo-fascism and what can be called &quot;historical fascism&quot;, or the kind of neo-fascism which came about in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Some historians claim that contemporary neo-fascist parties are not anti-democratic because they operate within their country&#x27;s political system. Whether that is a significant difference between neo-fascism and historical fascism is doubted by other scholars, who point out that Hitler worked within the existing political system of the Weimar Republic to obtain power, although it took an anti-democratic but constitutional process in the form of presidential appointment rather than election through the Reichstag. Others point to the current neo-fascists not being totalitarian in nature, but the organization of their parties along the lines of the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; would seem to indicate otherwise. Historian Stanley G. Payne claims that the differences in current circumstance to that of the interwar years, and the strengthening of democracy in European countries since the end of the war prevents a general return of historical fascism, and causes true neo-fascist groups to be small and remain on the fringe. For Payne, groups like the National Front in France are not neo-fascists in nature, but are merely &quot;right radical parties&quot; that will, in the course of time, moderate their positions in order to achieve electoral victory.

The problem of immigrants, both legal and illegal or irregular, whether called &quot;foreigners&quot;, &quot;foreign workers&quot;, &quot;economic refugees&quot;, &quot;ethnic minorities&quot;, &quot;asylum seekers&quot;, or &quot;aliens&quot;, is a core neo-fascist issue, intimately tied to their nativism, ultranationalism, and xenophobia, but the specifics differ somewhat from country to country due to prevailing circumstances. In general, the anti-immigrant impetus is strong when the economy is weak or unemployment is high, and people fear that outsiders are taking their jobs. Because of this, neo-fascist parties have more electoral traction during hard economic times. Again, this mirrors the situation in the interwar years, when, for instance, Germany suffered from incredible hyperinflation and many people had their life savings swept away. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, some neo-fascist groups likewise argued for a Third Position as an alternative to market capitalism.

In contemporary Europe, mainstream political parties see the electoral advantage the neo-fascist and far-right parties get from their strong emphasis on the supposed problem of the outsider, and are then tempted to co-opt the issue by moving somewhat to the right on the immigrant issue, hoping to slough off some voters from the hard right. In the absence in post-war Europe of a strong socialist movement, this has the tendency to move the political centre to the right overall.

While both historical fascism and contemporary neo-fascism are xenophobic, nativist and anti-immigrant, neo-fascist leaders are careful not to present these views in so strong a manner as to draw obvious parallels to historical events. Both Jean-Marie Le Pen of France&#x27;s National Front and Jörg Haider&#x27;s Freedom Party of Austria, in the words of historian Tony Judt, &quot;revealed [their] prejudices only indirectly&quot;. Jews would not be castigated as a group, but a person would be specifically named as a danger who just happened to be a Jew. The public presentation of their leaders is one principal difference between the neo-fascists and historical fascists: their programs have been &quot;finely honed and &#x27;modernized&#x27;&quot; to appeal to the electorate, a &quot;far-right ideology with a democratic veneer&quot;. Modern neo-fascists do not appear in &quot;jackboots and brownshirts&quot;, but in suits and ties. The choice is deliberate, as the leaders of the various groups work to differentiate themselves from the brutish leaders of historical fascism and also to hide whatever bloodlines and connections tie the current leaders to the historical fascist movements. When these become public, as they did in the case of Haider, it can lead to their decline and fall.

== International networks ==
In 1951, the New European Order (NEO) neo-fascist European-wide alliance was set up to promote pan-European nationalism. It was a more radical splinter group of the European Social Movement. The NEO had its origins in the 1951 Malmö conference, when a group of rebels led by René Binet and Maurice Bardèche refused to join the European Social Movement as they felt that it did not go far enough in terms of racialism and anti-communism. As a result, Binet joined with Gaston-Armand Amaudruz in a second meeting that same year in Zürich to set up a second group pledged to wage war on communists and non-white people.
Several Cold War regimes and international neo-fascist movements collaborated in operations such as assassinations and false flag bombings. Stefano Delle Chiaie, who was involved in Italy&#x27;s Years of Lead, took part in Operation Condor; organizing the 1976 assassination attempt on Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton. Vincenzo Vinciguerra escaped to Franquist Spain with the help of the SISMI, following the 1972 Peteano attack, for which he was sentenced to life. Along with Delle Chiaie, Vinciguerra testified in Rome in December 1995 before judge María Servini de Cubría, stating that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and US expatriate DINA agent Michael Townley were directly involved in General Carlos Prats&#x27; assassination. Michael Townley was sentenced in Italy to 15 years of prison for having served as intermediary between the DINA and the Italian neo-fascists.

The regimes of Francoist Spain, Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s Chile and Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s Paraguay participated together in Operation Condor, which targeted political opponents worldwide. During the Cold War, these international operations gave rise to some cooperation between various neo-fascist elements engaged in a &quot;Crusade against Communism&quot;. Anti-Fidel Castro terrorist Luis Posada Carriles was condemned for the Cubana Flight 455 bombing on 6 October 1976. According to the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, this bombing was decided on at the same meeting during which it was decided to target Chilean former minister Orlando Letelier, who was assassinated on 21 September 1976. Carriles wrote in his autobiography that &quot;we the Cubans didn&#x27;t oppose ourselves to an isolated tyranny, nor to a particular system of our fatherland, but that we had in front of us a colossal enemy, whose main head was in Moscow, with its tentacles dangerously extended on all the planet.&quot;
== Europe ==
=== Finland ===
In Finland, neo-fascism is often connected to the 1930s and 1940s fascist and pro-Nazi Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (IKL), its youth movement Blues-and-Blacks and its predecessor Lapua Movement. Post-war fascist groups such as Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (1993), Patriotic Popular Front, Patriotic National Movement, Blue-and-Black Movement and many others consciously copy the style of the movement and look up to its leaders as inspiration. A Finns Party councillor and police officer in Seinäjoki caused small scandal wearing the fascist blue-and-black uniform.

=== France ===

In France, the far-right National Rally party is of neo-fascist origin and is frequently accused of promoting anti-semitism and xenophobia. The party was founded in 1972 to unify the French nationalist movement by Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was its leader until his resignation in 2011. Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s daughter, Marine Le Pen, has also been the party&#x27;s leader and Marine Le Pen&#x27;s niece, Marion Maréchal has repeated anti-Islam rhetoric such as &quot;We know what we are and we know what we are not. We are not an Islamic nation.&quot; Pierre Bousquet, a co-founder, was in the Nazi Waffen-SS during World War II.

=== Portugal ===
After the fall of authoritarianism in Portugal after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, several neo-fascist groups arose such as the New Order (Portugal) which was created in 1978. A report by the European Parliament defined the ideology of the New Order as revolutionary fascist and hyper-nationalist. The group also had connections to Fuerza Nueva in Spain. The New Order was disbanded in 1982, however its activities continued to as late as 1985.

=== Greece ===
After the onset of the Great Recession and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the Golden Dawn, widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in Greece&#x27;s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn&#x27;s leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization. In October, 2020, the court declared Golden Dawn to be a criminal organization, convicting 68 members of various crimes including murder. However, far-right politics continue to be strong in Greece, such as Ilias Kasidiaris&#x27; National Party – Greeks, an Ultranationalist party. In 2021, Greek neo-Nazi youth attacked a rival group at a school in Greece.

=== Italy ===
Italy was broadly divided into two political blocs following World War II: the Christian Democrats, who remained in power until the 1990s, and the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which was very strong immediately after the war and achieved a large consensus during the 1970s. With the beginning of the Cold War, the American and British governments turned a blind eye to the refusal of Italian authorities to honor requested extraditions of Italian war criminals to Yugoslavia, which they feared would benefit the PCI. With no event such as the Nuremberg trials taking place for Italian war crimes, the collective memory of the crimes committed by Italian fascists was excluded from public media, from textbooks in Italian schools, and even from the academic discourse on the Western side of the Iron Curtain throughout the Cold War. The PCI was expelled from power in May 1947, a month before the Paris Conference on the Marshall Plan, along with the French Communist Party (PCF).

In 1946, a group of Italian fascist soldiers founded the Italian Social Movement (MSI) to continue advocating the ideas of Benito Mussolini. The leader of the MSI was Giorgio Almirante, who remained at the head of the party until his death in 1988. Despite attempts in the 1970s towards a &quot;historic compromise&quot; between the PCI and the DC, the PCI did not have a role in executive power until the 1980s. In December 1970, Junio Valerio Borghese attempted, along with Stefano Delle Chiaie, the &quot;Borghese Coup&quot; which was supposed to install a neo-fascist regime. Neo-fascist groups took part in various false flag terrorist attacks, starting with the December 1969 Piazza Fontana massacre, for which Vincenzo Vinciguerra was convicted, and they are usually considered to have stopped with the 1980 Bologna railway bombing.

In 1987, the reins of the MSI party were taken by Gianfranco Fini, under whom in 1995 it was dissolved and transformed into the National Alliance (AN). The party led by Fini distanced itself from Mussolini and fascism and made efforts to improve its relations with the Jewish community, becoming a conservative right-wing party until its merger with Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia into the centre-right party The People of Freedom in 2009. Neo-fascist parties in Italy include the Tricolour Flame (&quot;Fiamma Tricolore&quot;), the New Force (&quot;Forza Nuova&quot;), the National Social Front (&quot;Fronte Sociale Nazionale&quot;), and CasaPound. The national-conservative Brothers of Italy (FdI), main heirs of MSI and AN, has been described as neo-fascist by several academics, and it has some neo-fascist factions within their internal organization. The results of the 2022 Italian general election, in which FdI became the first party, have been variously described as Italy&#x27;s first far-right-led government in the republican era and its most right-wing government since World War II. The Russia-Ukraine war has divided the Italian far right, including neo-fascists, into three clusters: the pro-Western and Atlanticist extreme right (e.g. &quot;CasaPound&quot;), nostalgic and pro-Putin neo-fascism (New Force), and an ideologically evolving collection of National Bolshevik and Eurasianist militants. Recent studies have studied the geopolitical role of Italian neofascism with some groups participating with CIA-backing in the Strategy of Tension during the Cold War where terrorists actions were aimed to keep Italy in NATO and prevent the Communist Party from coming to power 

=== Romania ===

In Romania, the ultra-nationalist movement which allied itself with the Axis powers and German National Socialism was the Iron Guard, also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael. There are some modern political organisations which consider themselves heirs of Legionarism, this includes Noua Dreaptă and the Everything For the Country Party, founded by former Iron Guard members. The latter organisation was outlawed in 2015. Aside, from these Romanian organisations, the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement representing ultra-nationalism from the Hungarian minority is also present, especially in Transylvania. Other nationalistic and irredentist groups such as the Greater Romania Party do not originate from Legionarism, but in fact grew out of national communist tendencies from the era of Nicolae Ceaușescu (the party was founded by his &quot;court poet&quot; Corneliu Vadim Tudor).

The Romanian Hearth Union (UVR), which had around 4 million supporters in 1992, has been described as neofascist. Its political branch was the Romanian National Unity Party, but had also ties to the Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), Greater Romania Party (PRM) and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania (PDAR). One of the founders of the UVR was the Romanian President Ion Iliescu, who was still its member in 2005.

=== Russia ===

In 1990, Vladimir Zhirinovsky founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Its leader opposes democratic values, human rights, a multiparty system, and the rule of law. Encyclopedia Britannica considers Zhirinovsky to be a neo-fascist. Zhirinovsky endorsed the forcible re-occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and suggested nuclear waste should be dumped there. During the First Chechen War in the mid-1990s, he advocated hitting some Chechen villages with tactical nuclear weapons.

The Russian National Unity was a paramilitary organization which was founded by Alexander Barkashov in 1990. It used a left-pointed swastika and emphasizes the &quot;primary importance&quot; of Russian blood. Concerning Adolf Hitler, the organizations&#x27;s leader Barkashov declared: &quot;I consider [Hitler] a great hero of the German nation and of all white races. He succeeded in inspiring the entire nation to fight against degradation and the washing away of national values.&quot; Before it was banned in 1999, and breakup in late 2000, the group estimated to have had approximately 20,000 to 25,000 members. Alexander Barkashov along with other members of the Russian National Unity have engaged in religious activities and pro-Russian activism in the Russian-Ukrainian War.

=== Serbia ===
A neo-fascist organization in Serbia was Obraz, which was banned on 12 June 2012 by the Constitutional Court of Serbia.

Earlier, on 18 June 1990, Vojislav Šešelj organized the Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP) though it was not permitted official registration due to its obvious Chetnik identification. On 23 February 1991, it merged with the National Radical Party (NRS), establishing the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) with Šešelj as president and Tomislav Nikolić as vice president. It was a Chetnik party, oriented towards neo-fascism with a striving for the territorial expansion of Serbia.

=== Slovakia ===
Kotleba – People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia is a far-right political party with views that are considered extremist and fascist. The Party&#x27;s leader, Marian Kotleba, is a former neo-Nazi, who once wore a uniform modelled on that of the Hlinka Guard, the militia of the 1939–45 Nazi-sponsored Slovak State. He opposes Romani people, immigrants, the Slovak National Uprising, NATO, the United States, and the European Union. The party also endorses the clerical fascist war criminal and former Slovak President Jozef Tiso.

In 2003, Kotleba founded the far-right political party Slovak Community (Slovak: &quot;Slovenská Pospolitosť&quot;). In 2007, the Slovak interior ministry banned the party from running and campaigning in elections. In spite of this ban, Kotleba&#x27;s party got 8.04% of votes in the Slovak 2016 parliamentary elections. As of December 2022, voter support has dropped significantly to about 3.1%, under the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.

=== Turkey ===

Grey Wolves is a Turkish ultranationalist and neo-fascist youth organization. It is the &quot;unofficial militant arm&quot; of the Nationalist Movement Party. The Grey Wolves have been accused of terrorism. According to Turkish authorities, the organization carried out 694 murders during the late-1970s political violence in Turkey, between 1974 and 1980.

The nationalist political party MHP founded by Alparslan Türkeş is also sometimes described as neo-fascist.

=== United Kingdom ===
The British National Party (BNP) is a nationalist party in the United Kingdom which espoused the ideology of fascism and anti-immigration. In the 2009 European elections, it gained two members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including former party leader Nick Griffin. Other British organisations described as fascist or neo-fascist include the National Front, Combat 18, the English Defence League, and Britain First.

== Americas ==
=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, a notable advocate of neo-fascism was president María Estela Martínez de Perón, who applied anti-communist policies under the fascist police organization Triple A and economic market opening policies. Perón made a direct apology to fascism by performing the Roman salute in an appearance on the national radio network. The National Reorganization Process is also considered a neo-fascist or fascist dictatorship.

=== Brazil ===

The Brazilian government of Jair Bolsonaro is cited as the rising point of neo-fascism in South America in the 21st century, based on the denial of science, bellicose rhetoric and authoritarian measures that withdraw rights from the population linked to a strongly neoliberal economic policy. As a result of factors such as opposition to Workers&#x27; Party, fear and reaction to the 2013 protests, as well as the economic crises of 2008 and 2014, Jair Bolsonaro emerged as a viable option, not because of a well-defined strategic project, but almost accidentally. In this way, the multiplicity of groups that make up the Bolsonarism, the different wings (military, ideological, religious, capital, etc.) present pragmatic disagreements, strategies, objectives and distinct methods. The core of this Brazilian neo-fascism converged its interests and rhetoric with Pentecostal religious fundamentalism and both allied themselves with military sectors and liberal think tanks, so that within bolsonarism there is a power bloc made up of non-fascist conservatives and far-right neo-fascists; although still without the support of the broad and fanatical mass movement which was the basis of European fascism.

=== United States ===
Groups which are identified as neo-fascist in the United States generally include neo-Nazi organizations and movements such as the Proud Boys, the National Alliance, and the American Nazi Party. The Institute for Historical Review publishes negationist historical papers which are often of an antisemitic nature. The alt-right—a loosely connected coalition of individuals and organizations which advocates a wide range of far-right ideas, from neoreactionaries to white nationalists—is often included under the umbrella term &quot;neo-fascist&quot;, because alt-right individuals and organizations advocate a radical form of authoritarian ultranationalism.

== Oceania ==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the Australian perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, was an admitted fascist who followed eco-fascism and admired Oswald Mosley. Mosley was the leader of the British fascist organization called the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s, and he is quoted in the shooter&#x27;s manifesto &quot;The Great Replacement&quot; (named after the French far-right theory of the same name).

== Africa ==
=== South Africa ===
The Economic Freedom Fighters are a self-described pan-Africanist political party founded in 2013 by the expelled former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) President Julius Malema, and his allies. Malema and the party have frequently courted controversy for engaging in anti-White and anti-Indian racism. In November 2019, the Professor of International Relations at University of the Witwatersrand, Vishwas Satgar, defined them as a manifestation of a new phenomena, &#x27;Black Neofascism&#x27;.

== Asia ==
=== India ===


=== Indonesia ===
Adolf Hitler&#x27;s propaganda which advocated the hegemony of &quot;Greater Germany&quot; inspired similar ideas of &quot;Indonesia Mulia&quot; (esteemed Indonesia) and &quot;Indonesia Raya&quot; (great Indonesia) in the former Dutch colony. The first fascist party was the Partai Fasis Indonesia (PFI). Sukarno admired Nazi Germany under Hitler and its vision of happiness for all: &quot;It&#x27;s in the Third Reich that the Germans will see Germany at the apex above other nations in this world,&quot; he said in 1963. He stated that Hitler was &#x27;extraordinarily clever&#x27; in &#x27;depicting his ideals&#x27;: he spoke about Hitler&#x27;s rhetorical skills, but denied any association with Nazism as an ideology, saying that Indonesian nationalism was not as narrow as Nazi nationalism.

=== Japan ===

After World War II, neo-fascism and ultra-nationalism were ostracized from mainstream politics in Germany, while in Japan, they were partially related to major right-wing conservative politics. Since 2006, all prime ministers of Japan&#x27;s LDP have been members of far-right ultranationalist Nippon Kaigi.

=== Mongolia ===
With Mongolia located between the larger nations Russia and China, ethnic insecurities have driven many Mongolians to neo-fascism, expressing nationalism centered around Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler. Groups advocating these ideologies include Blue Mongolia, Dayar Mongol, and Mongolian National Union.

===Pakistan===

Pakistan&#x27;s Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan is considered fascist by some analysts because of its engagement in Islamic extremism.

=== Taiwan ===

The National Socialism Association (NSA) is a neo-fascist political organization founded in Taiwan in September 2006 by Hsu Na-chi (許娜琦), a 22-year-old female political science graduate of Soochow University. The NSA views Adolf Hitler as its leader and often uses the slogan &quot;Long live Hitler&quot;. This has brought them condemnation from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights centre.

<text>The Battle of Lesnaya was one of the major battles of the Great Northern War. It took place on between a Russian army of between 17,000 and 29,000 men commanded by Peter I of Russia, Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn, Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov, Rudolph Felix Bauer and Nikolai Grigorovitj von Werden and a Swedish army between 12,500 and 16,000 men commanded by Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt and Berndt Otto Stackelberg, at the village of Lesnaya, located close to the border between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russian Empire (now the village of Lyasnaya, Mogilev Region, Belarus). The Swedes were escorting a supply column of more than 4,500 wagons for their main army in Ukraine.

Peter I intercepted Lewenhaupt&#x27;s column before it reached the safety of Charles XII, the Swedish king, with the intention of destroying it. After eight hours of fighting, with heavy casualties, neither side stood as winner. As the night approached the Russians decided to withdraw to the nearest forest where they would stay until next morning to continue the fight. The Swedes however stayed in their battle formations for hours during the night, in case of a renewed attack. With no sign of further combat and intelligence saying further Russian reinforcements had arrived, the Swedes in turn withdrew from the place of battle, in order to continue the march towards the main army. Fearing a full-scale Russian pursuit, Lewenhaupt decided to burn or abandon most of the wagons and cannons in order to increase speed. While doing this many of the Swedish soldiers decided to loot the abandoned wagons and get drunk, thousands got lost in the woods, many of whom fell victim to Russian irregular cavalry. Lewenhaupt soon crossed the river of Sozh with the rest of his army, to find himself relatively safe. After some days he met up with Charles XII at Rukova with very few wagons left and only half of his initial army. The two soon continued their march towards Ukraine, eventually finding themselves at the Battle of Poltava and the surrender at Perevolochna which severely crippled the Swedish army and is known for being the turning point of the war.

==Background==

In 1700 Sweden, under Charles XII, was attacked by a coalition of Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Denmark–Norway under Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under Peter I swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.

Denmark–Norway was quickly knocked out of the war by a bold Swedish landing on Humlebæk resulting in the Peace of Travendal. After this the Russians were forced to abandon their campaign in Ingria after their crushing defeat in the battle of Narva. The Swedes next beat the Saxons, Poles and Russians at the battle of Düna. Soon Sweden invaded the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in order to remove Augustus from the Polish throne. The subsequent conflict became known as the Swedish invasion of Poland. After several defeats in the battles of Kliszów, Kraków, Pultusk and Toruń, Augustus was finally dethroned in favor of a monarch installed by the Swedes, Stanisław Leszczyński who was crowned king in 1705. During this time, the Russians had been able to capture several Swedish possessions in their Baltic Dominions, among others, the fortresses of Nöteborg, Nyenskans, Dorpat and Narva.

In 1705 the two sides prepared for a final confrontation in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russians intervened with full force in order to put Augustus back on the throne. After the battles of Gemauerthof, Warsaw, Grodno and Fraustadt the campaign was decided in favor of the Swedes who chased their enemies out of Poland in 1706 and subsequently invaded Saxony, where Augustus saw himself defeated and forced to make peace. Seeing how only one major threat remained, the Swedes decided to invade Russia in 1707. After some time of fighting against the Russians under Peter I, the Swedish king soon called upon reinforcements from Livonia where Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt was acting Commander-in-chief.

==Prelude==
In early April 1708, the governor of Riga, Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt visited Charles XII at the Royal army&#x27;s winter quarters in Radoszkowice to discuss strategy and receive orders for the ongoing campaign against Russia. Here he was instructed to obtain a large amount of supplies and wagons that could be sufficient for the main army for about three weeks. Once having collected the supplies Lewenhaupt would assemble as much men as possible from the area, without leaving the garrisons completely stripped. Lewenhaupt would then use these troops to escort the convoy and rendezvous with Charles&#x27; main army at Mogilev, in early August.

In May same year, Lewenhaupt returned to Riga in order to complete the task, which proved far from easy. The near lands had suffered many campaigns in the years of the Great Northern War and so much was drained of needed resources. In early June, the column—of which Lewenhaupt was gathering—was ordered to start campaigning to reach Charles XII in Mogilev, according to schedule. However, the convoy was nowhere ready to leave because of the difficulties assembling it. Only in the beginning of July it was &quot;ready&quot;, having then suffered three to four weeks behind the schedule and a significant shortage of men as 20,000 men were expected, but only 13,000 soldiers proved able to march.
===Lewenhaupt&#x27;s convoy===
The march turned out slower than expected, torrential rain turned the roads into mud, streams became over flooded which turned out to be a major task to cross and so, unfortunately for Lewenhaupt and Charles, the expected time of arrival kept moving back. However, after several weeks of waiting and no words heard from Lewenhaupt, there was a twist to the plans as Charles found his position in Mogilev unsustainable and instead on September 26, decided to abandon his camps and march South towards Severia in Ukraine, hoping to reach that rich granary before winter. During this time Lewenhaupt was about 135 kilometers (90 miles) away from Charles and on September 28, he received new orders to rendezvous at Starodub and started marching south himself. His convoy passed between Mogilev and Gorki heading for Propoisk on the river Sozh. By October 3, Lewenhaupt had crossed the Dnieper and headed south, the crossing itself has to be considered a &quot;military masterpiece&quot;. Having observed these movements, Peter I dispatched an army under Boris Sheremetev after Charles and gathered a force of his own to intercept with Lewenhaupt. The Russians made contact with Lewenhaupt&#x27;s convoy on October 6, and immediately started harassing it, forcing the Swedes to march in defensive formation across difficult terrain while the numbers of shadowing Russian troops steady grew.

Peter I, who overestimated the Swedish force being 16,000 men strong, had gathered numbers far superior to those of Lewenhaupt and was eager to catch his convoy while it was still out of reach of Charles&#x27; main army and safety. He planned to destroy the convoy before its crossing of the river Sozh where it would otherwise reach—as Peter thought—the protection of the main army (the Russians had misleading reports saying Charles was 25 kilometers away from Sozh and not 120 as they had previously presumed). On October 7, the Russians in the area were large enough that they posed a considerable threat to the convoy and so the two sides confronted each other for some time at the village of Belitsa. Subsequently, however, Lewenhaupt ordered a cavalry attack consisting of 4,000 men on the equally numbered Russian dragoons who were facing them, the Russian horse did not desire a fight and instead started retreating, persecuted by their enemies for a good four–kilometers step. In this encounter losses amounted to more than 40 Russians killed and three to eleven captured, to four wounded Swedes, a real battle did not develop as both sides parted and the confrontation ended with the quick cavalry skirmish. The Swedes however, received intelligence from the captured Russians saying the Tsar was following Lewenhaupt with a force of about 20,000 cavalry, 12,000 infantry and four guns. Later during the day, the vanguard of the convoy reached the small village of Lesnaya and there made preparations to set camp for the rest of the army, accordingly.

The next morning, Lewenhaupt, who during this time stayed with his rearguard, would once again find himself confronted as the Russians stepped up their efforts to harass the back of the convoy as it made its crossing over at Dolgij Moch, towards Lesnaya. Here the Russians under Mikhail Golitsyn and Alexander Menshikov attacked him on two fronts over the river of Resta. The engagement concluded in a standoff after four hours of musket and artillery exchange in which the Swedes successfully denied every attempt made by the Russians to cross the river for the convoy. Later the same day, Lewenhaupt reached the village of Lesnaya with most of his army and was within a day&#x27;s march from Propoisk. By now he knew that Peter I was in the area with a fairly large amount of Russian troops. But he did not know exactly how large the Russian army was or if more units were on their way. Once he reached Propoisk he could cross the Sozh river and achieve relative safety in case he was the target of the whole Russian force.

==Battle==

On October 9, the Russians gathered all their available forces to attack the Swedes in the rear as they were crossing the stream of Lesnjanka at the village of Lesnaya, to march south against Propoisk in order to reach safety by crossing the river of Sozh. Thousands of wagons made for slow progress and bottlenecks and the scattered Swedish army was by then very vulnerable to Russian attacks. Furthermore, Bauer put a small detachment of 1,000 dragoons along with a portion of irregular troops at Propoisk to further stall the Swedish advance. The Swedish vanguard of 800 men soon stumbled upon this unit which did not hesitate to open fire. The sudden engagement put a halt to the Swedish convoy with its vanguard put in slight confusion as there was uncertainty regarding the size or position of the Russians at Propoisk. Decision was made to await orders from Lewenhaupt before committing to any course of action. In the meantime, Peter I took the advantage and pressed home the assault, marching with the majority of his troops towards Lesnaya and the rest of the Swedish convoy deployed there (at least one third of the convoy still remained at Lesnaya). Unaware of these developments, the Swedes were put in–between two forces, with an enemy no longer contented with harassment, but a decisive battle.

===Opposing forces===
The Swedish army was commanded by General Lewenhaupt with Berndt Otto Stackelberg assisting, it totaled around 12,500 men with 6 eight–pounder and 10 or 11 four–pounder guns. Of these, at least 2,900 men were ordered to protect and maintain the baggage convoy consisting of at least 4,500 wagons. This resulted in a reduced force of combat personal as the regiments had to be stripped on men. The exact location of the troops at the start of the battle is not certain, however, between 4,500 and 7,000 men remained on the north side of the Lesnjanka stream facing the Russian main army. About 900 of these were detached even further to the north at &quot;the Middlefield&quot; working as an outpost in order to stall possible Russian attacks. The rest of the army were on the other side of the stream towards the south, facing Propoisk and would intervene in the battle later as Lewenhaupt requested reinforcements.

The Russian army was commanded by Tsar Peter I and consisted of three divisions under generals Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn, Aleksandr Menshikov, Christian Felix Bauer and Nikolai Grigorovitj von Werden. In an operational stance, the army totaled between 26,500 and 29,000 men, including between 2,500 and 5,000 irregulars (Cossacks and Kalmyks, also referred to as &quot;light cavalry&quot;), or 900 to 10,000 according to other estimates, and more than 90 artillery pieces (30 cannons and 60 six–pounder mortars). However, the division under Werden would only enjoy limited to no engagement as these troops arrived at the end of the battle. The intention of Peter I was to attack Lewenhaupt with 13,000 regular soldiers along with thousands of irregulars initially available, in order to pin him down long enough for the rest of the army to arrive. The closest division available was that of Bauer at Berezovka who marched with about 4,976 men along with thousands of irregulars, about 900 of these had been detached at Propoisk and were the ones halting the Swedish vanguard as it tried to reach the town, the rest would find themselves at the battle–site later on during the day. The last division marching towards the battle was located at Patskovo, led by Werden and consisted of about 6,191 men, however, as previously noted, these would only take limited part in the action.

===Russian attack at the Middlefield===
Peter I initially split his 13,000 men into two columns, the western one consisting of 5,910 men under himself with Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn assisting (in reality, Golitsyn commanded this group and Peter I worked as his assistant) and the eastern one with 7,040 soldiers led by Aleksandr Menshikov. The two columns along with the irregulars, marched toward &quot;the Middlefield&quot; between the northern and southern forest fringes. Lewenhaupt&#x27;s army was behind the southern fringe and Peter I attacked from the north. Menshikov&#x27;s force traversed two kilometers of road while Peter I struggled to penetrate three kilometers of dense forest.
Around 11:00, the battle began. Peter I&#x27;s column under Menshikov had reached the &quot;Middlefield&quot; from the north-west, finding the 900 Swedes deployed there. Unfortunately for Menshikov, the commander of the heavily outnumbered Swedish outpost, Lieutenant Colonel Freijbourg, seized the initiative and launched a &quot;Carolean-style&quot; surprise attack which threw the Russian column into confusion, while the sudden musket and cannon fire alerted the nearby main Swedish force. After this initial success, the Swedes were forced to retreat with many wounded through the southern fringe of the forest, where they were relieved by five fresh battalions under the command of Berndt Otto Stackelberg which had marched from Lesnaya.

Meanwhile, Tsar Peter&#x27;s right column had reached the Crossroads and traversed the marshes of Krivl, just south of the &quot;Middlefield&quot;, close to where Menshikov&#x27;s column had been in action. Having Peter to their left flank and Menshikov to the front, Stackelberg&#x27;s five Swedish battalions were now fighting two Russian columns numbering 13,000 in all. Six other Swedish battalions were on their way to the battle zone. The Russians at the Crossroads under Peter were almost routed by the Swedes and could have faced a crushing defeat, had not the Russian Guards halted their advance. The fighting at the Crossroads surged back and forth. The Russian line was strengthened by six artillery pieces. However, the Swedes who themselves had no artillery in this particular fight, were able to capture four of them and block Peter&#x27;s progress at the Krivl bridge.
Facing the Swedish right flank at the &quot;Middlefield&quot;, Menshikov&#x27;s guardsmen then executed a successful flanking maneuver, forcing the five Swedish battalions to retreat into the southern fringe of the forest and prepare to receive the expected Russian onslaught. Their departure left unguarded a bridge near the &quot;Crossroads&quot;, leaving it clear for Russian troops to march out and form up &quot;en masse&quot;. Thus trapped in a &quot;pincer movement&quot;, hemmed in and outnumbered, Stackelberg—against the wishes of Lewenhaupt—ordered an orderly withdrawal. The six Swedish battalions which were yet to arrive on their march through the forest, were also ordered to retreat, an action which isolated and exposed Hälsinge&#x27;s second battalion which had previously routed the Russians and now came close to being annihilated by them.

Lewenhaupt (who sought to gather his cavalry to support the Swedish infantry during the fighting at the &quot;Middlefield&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot;) came under attack by Russian dragoons who swept eastward through the southern fringe of the forest and headed for the Swedish dragoons deployed east of Lesnaya, on the open field. The Russians had some success at first, but as soon as the main bulk of the Swedish cavalry arrived and charged in typical Carolean wedge formation the Russian cavalry was being repulsed and quickly broke.

Tsar Peter with his Russian infantry and dragoons had now pushed away the last retreating Swedes and had full control over the &quot;southern forest edge&quot;. The Russians now strove to reach the &quot;Lesnaya field&quot; between the forest and the village of Lesnaya, to block the bridge over which the Swedes might obtain further reinforcements. (A company of 1,000 cavalry had already managed to get back to assist in the fight at Lesnaya.) A Swedish counter-offensive to push the Russians out of the forest was now ordered by Lewenhaupt, who had been very disappointed by Stackelberg&#x27;s decision to retreat. The Swedes counterattacked with the support of 16 artillery pieces from Lesnaya. However the Russian troops, backed by their own 30 cannons, were too strong and the Swedes had to fall back.
===Fighting at Lesnaya===

The Swedes retreated almost to the village of Lesnaya and the Russians followed them to the adjacent open terrain, intending to launch a decisive attack from there. However, both sides being exhausted by the day&#x27;s intense combat, hostilities were ceased at about 15:00 when, separated by only 150–200 meters, the two sides sank down on the field, facing each other, and rested. During this extraordinary interlude, in which only three Russian cannons sounded off, the two armies distributed food, water and ammunition to their ranks, issued orders and deployed reinforcements in preparation for the final conflict. Somehow during this remarkable phase, the Russian General Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt was shot and mortally wounded as he rode back and forth in a provocative manner between the two armies. He died of his wounds four days later. The hour-long pause concluded at about 16:00, with the arrival, after a long march, of Bauer&#x27;s company of 4,000 Russian dragoons.

At a little past 16:00, the Swedes opened fire, with cannons positioned 600 meters from the southern forest edge, on the newly arrived dragoons, who were then attaching themselves to the Russians&#x27; left flank. The Russian dragoons under Bauer then—without awaiting orders from Peter I—charged against the Swedes, supported by most of the other Russian troops. The open terrain gave the Swedish army opportunity to closely coordinate its infantry and cavalry, an advantage which they gratefully seized. Repeatedly, Russian front line troops retreated from infantry &quot;Gå–På&quot; shock attacks only to find themselves under immediate attack from the rear by Swedish cavalry. However, this could only be a temporary advantage in view of the Russian reserve strength, reportedly three battalions deep by this time, enabling an irresistible grinding advance.

The Russian right flank under Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn moved to secure the sole bridge across the Lesnjanka in order to prevent the flow of Swedish reinforcements across it, while seeking to trap them with their backs to the river. However, the bridge was ferociously defended and the Russians were beaten off, suffering heavy losses. At this time, both sides were inconvenienced by the weather; cold with overcast cloud cover most of the day, it gradually began to rain in which the rain quickly turned into a sudden freak snowstorm. A rare weather event for early–October, even in Russia. At 17:00, Lewenhaupt ordered a concerted attack which, however, was blunted by a tactic of continuous fire which the Russians had devised to counter the Swedish &quot;Gå–På&quot; onslaught. The Swedes took heavy casualties and were driven further back towards the village. Their line was also split in two, one side against the Lesnaya (east of the bridge) and the other against the forest to the west. The all–important bridge was on the brink of being taken when it was saved by the arrival of 900 Swedish dragoons from across the river, whose fierce onslaught drove the Russians back. At 19:00 when night fell, the Russians left the field and drew back to the forest fringe. The Swedes stood in their battle formations for several hours, expecting a night attack which did not come.

==Aftermath==

For a few hours the Swedes remained in their positions in case of a renewed attack and to convince the Russians that they intended to stay. Subsequently, Lewenhaupt decided to withdraw his army under the cover of the darkness and continue on his march against Propoisk. One major reason for this decision is said to have been a report coming from a captured Russian officer speaking about recent Russian reinforcements consisting of up to 10,000 men referring to the more than 6,000 strong infantry division under Nikolai Grigorovitj von Werden. Each unit slowly made its way across the stream as they were covered by the remaining units. During this progress, a number of wagons broke and partially blocked the road where the Swedish artillery was moving down, so it was decided a number of these would be sunk in the mud (to prevent them falling in Russian hands) as they were hard bringing in the rapid march. Having successfully crossed the stream with all his troops, Lewenhaupt continued towards Propoisk. However, this withdrawal was the beginning of the end for a large part of his army.
===Swedish disaster===
Despite the difficult condition, having men lost in the woods during the march, the Swedes reached Propoisk, only to find that the town and bridge had been burned down. This was most likely done by Bauer&#x27;s detachment as they were still blocking the crossing. By now the Swedish army was disintegrating into a mob as fear grew, possibly of being trapped between Peter&#x27;s army behind them and Bauer&#x27;s detachment. There were also no suited material for building a bridge. The Swedes saw the risk in having the Russian army pursue them from behind and so Lewenhaupt decided that everything that could be carried be taken from the wagons, subsequently all wagons but a few, were burned and the bulk of the essential supplies within. This resulted in that a large part of the army took the opportunity to get drunk and so was left for the enemy to catch, others decided that they were better off surrendering or try to reach home by themselves. The Swedes mustered about 3,451 infantry and 3,052 cavalry at Propoisk who were in good condition to fight. Lewenhaupt decided that all the combatants would be mounted on the remaining horses to increase the speed of the march. Between 1,000 and 1,500 wounded and sick soldiers were left at Propoisk as these seemed unable to follow the pace Lewenhaupt now made in order to reach the main army. The rest were missing, perhaps as many as 4,000 men. The next morning the Russians caught up with the soldiers at Propoisk which had now increased to 3,000 men as more stragglers had joined its defenses. The Russians demanded their surrender, however as the Swedes refused and instead answered with musket fire, they soon assaulted the town. After an hour or so long defense, the Russians gained the upper hand and pushed the Swedes out of the town, further to the river of Soz, where they could escape the onslaught. The Russians were content with this and proceeded to round up any deserters they could find, however, they did not attempt to confront the main body of Lewenhaupt&#x27;s army as they were allowed to withdraw unmolested.

The following day Lewenhaupt found a crossing over the river Sozh and over the next two days the soldiers swam across the river to relative safety. By now order had been restored in the Swedish army and all signs of Russian pursuit had gone. The army—now without any artillery or wagon train—made good speed to reach its rendezvous with Charles&#x27; army at Starodub. During their way, on October 19, the Swedish rearguard was attacked by reportedly 4,000 Russians at the village of Lysjtjitji. After a sharp engagement the Russians were driven off with the cost of slightly more than 30 killed and 50 wounded Swedes. On October 23, Lewenhaupt&#x27;s troops reached the main army at Rukova. Having only 6,000 men left in his lines with very few of the sufficient wagons, from the train. Subsequently, Charles XII continued the march towards Ukraine where he found the condition of supplying his army better but also because a possible alliance with the Cossack hetman, Ivan Mazepa. The campaign would however end with the disastrous Swedish defeat at Poltava and the surrender of the whole army at Perevolochna, except for a few who followed the king into exile in the Ottoman Empire.
===Modern look===
Lesnaya is often seen as the first great Russian victory of the war and the first indication of the final result of the campaign, in Russia it is said to be the &quot;mother of Poltava&quot;. The battle was certainly proclaimed as a Russian triumph at the time, but in modern view, this may not be the case. The victorious Russian army had suffered considerable losses throughout the battle and did not manage to succeed with their goal, to crush the Lewenhaupt&#x27;s army. Neither did it seriously pursue the retreating Swedish army, instead they contented themselves with catching the stragglers and march in the opposite direction of Lewenhaupt to celebrate their victory. Tsar Peter arranged for the news of the victory to be spread as much as possibly through official declarations and leaflets. At first the Russian version of events claimed they had completely destroyed a superior force, it soon became clear that this was not true so they subsequently modified it down to only equal odds. But the official declarations, leaflets etc., had already been dispatched and still influence the view of the battle today.

The two sides were in fact not equal in numbers, they only appear so in many accounts because the numbers given usually only count the initial Russian forces under the Tsar without taking in account the irregulars that accompanied the force or the later arrival of Bauer&#x27;s command. Sometimes the Swedish units are also assumed to have been at full strength at the battle. Also while the initial Russian forces were about the same strength as the whole Swedish army, they did not all participate in the fighting. The Russians, in fact enjoyed a considerable numerical advantage in all stages of the battle, yet they had not been able to defeat their enemy. Similarly the Swedes were greatly constrained during the battle by the need to protect the vital wagons and their supplies.

===Casualties===
The estimated number of casualties sustained by both sides during the battle varies widely, depending on the source.

Swedish casualties, according to General Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt, numbered not much more than 1,000 men during the battle itself, with a total of 1,674 dead and captured in the battle &quot;and&quot; on the road towards Propoisk. Overall, he claims, the casualties could not exceed 3,000 men in the battle &quot;and&quot; the following days (with the events at Propoisk), however, these figures are regarded as questionable and too low, according to the Swedish and Russian writers Einar Lyth and Pavel Konovalchuk. According to Lewenhaupt&#x27;s Lieutenant, Friedrich Christoph von Weihe, the Swedish losses in killed amounted to 2,000 men in the battle along with a number of captured. In total, Weihe estimates that there were 3,800 Swedish casualties in the battle &quot;and&quot; in the following days. Robert Petre, a second-lieutenant in the Swedish army and veteran soldier in the Hälsinge Regiment, however, puts the total Swedish casualties at 4,549 men. According to the Russian official description regarding the Swedish casualties, 8,000 were killed on the battlefield and a total of 3,500 captured soon thereafter, other sources claim 6,700 Swedes killed and wounded in the battle and another 5,000 in the pursuit, numbers which are proven unrealistic and impossible in regards to the initial strength of the army. Gaston Bodart estimated the Swedish losses at 6,000. Michel Glaeser estimated the Swedish losses at 3,000 dead, but clarified that the figures may be questionable.

Later attempts have been made by authors trying to calculate the Swedish casualties using the initial strength of the force as basis. Lewenhaupt said there were less than 10,914 men present under his command, Weihe and Petre in turn claimed there were 11,450 and 12,950 men, respectively, at the beginning of the march from Riga in early July. Nicholas Dorrell, a student in history, estimates the Swedish force at about 12,500 men strong in the battle, in an attempt to apply &quot;marching losses&quot; to the army. In regards to this, 6,500 Swedes were patterned after the battle in &quot;condition to fight&quot; at Propoisk, according to Petre (of which above 6,000 made it to the main army under Charles XII), about 1,000–1,500 wounded and sick Swedish soldiers along with some stragglers were left at Propoisk, of which the majority were later either killed or captured by Russian cavalry, according to Russian sources. Between 2,500 and 3,300 soldiers went missing, of which most marched on their own back towards Sweden, between 1,250 and 1,500 of these arrived and the other perished during the march due to wounds, sickness, starvation or exhaustion, or possible Cossack attacks.

Einar Lyth and Pavel Konovalchuk make an estimation calculated out of these numbers in their book &quot;Vägen till Poltava. Slaget vid Lesnaja 1708 (The road to Poltava. The battle of Lesnaya 1708)&quot; using the initial strength presented by Petre of 13,000 men, which concludes up to 4,000 Swedes killed, captured or dispersed in total, during the battle and the days after and no more than 2,500 men killed or captured in the battle itself. Using the same calculation on the number of 12,500 Swedes presented by Dorrell, the total losses would amount to 3,500 men and 2,000 in the battle &quot;and&quot; on the road towards Propoisk (similar estimation to that of Weihe), applying a rough estimation of 1,000–1,500 wounded to this number, representing the large numbers of wounded left at Propoisk and the ones being wounded while marching back towards Sweden, there&#x27;s a possibility that the Swedes suffered 3,000–3,500 men dead, wounded and captured in the battle alone. Another estimation is made by the Russian historian Vladimir A. Artamonov in his book &quot;The Dawn of the Poltava Victory: The Battle of Lesnaya&quot;, where the author estimates the Swedish casualties at 3,873 dead and wounded in the battle and another 877 captured afterwards, totaling losses of 4,750 Swedish soldiers, also here, using Petre&#x27;s number of 12,950 Swedish soldiers as the basis for the calculation.
Swedish historian claims that no more than 6,500 of Lewenhaupt&#x27;s men reached Charles XII&#x27;s camp after the battle, and that, while the Swedes officially declared themselves victorious, the immediate effects of the battle forced Charles XII to abandon his planned offensive through Kaluga. Russian historian Alexei Shkvarov estimates that, with 6,000 out of 12,950 Swedes reaching Charles XII, 6,396 were lost during all hostilities, including the persecution. It is, however, unknown if he includes the thousands of Swedes who made it back to Sweden in his calculation. &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot; He also estimates the losses of the Swedes at 6,400 people.

Russian casualties, according to Russian official claims, amounted to about 1,111 dead and another 2,856 wounded in the battle, figures which are disputed as &quot;incomplete and contradictory&quot;, according to the Russian and Swedish writers Pavel Konovalchuk and Einar Lyth. This figure was also used by Gaston Bodart in his &quot;Militär-historisches Kriegs-Lexikon&quot;. Alexander Gordon, an officer of Scottish descent who served with the Russian army during the war, wrote a book on the history of Peter the Great, in which he puts the Russian casualties at about 3,000 killed and 4,000 wounded. According to the Russian field marshal Boris Sheremetev, the battle had cost Russia 8,000 of its best troops; author Paul Bushkovitch called this a &quot;wild exaggeration&quot; in his biography about the Tsar. Historian Pavel Krotov called the official casualty figures &quot;slightly underestimated&quot; and based on reports from individual units involved in the battle brought the number of casualties to 4,081 losses, including 1,227 killed and 2,734 wounded.

Swedish official reports declared that more than 20,000 Russians died in the battle, which is considered to be a highly unlikely number by most authors. Lewenhaupt initially estimated more than 6,000 dead and wounded Russians during the battle, but later increased that number to 9,000 dead and wounded, claiming that this estimate was reported to him by Russian officers, while he was in captivity in Moscow. Artamonov questions the reliability of this claim. Another Swedish source, Gustaf Adlerfelt, a court historian of Charles XII, declared that the Russians lost 6,000 men killed and many more wounded, referring to the &quot;confession&quot; of a captured Russian Adjutant-General named Schultz.
