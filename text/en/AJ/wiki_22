<text>In computers, case sensitivity defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct (case-sensitive) or equivalent (case-insensitive). For instance, when users interested in learning about dogs search an e-book, &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;Dog&quot; are of the same significance to them. Thus, they request a case-insensitive search. But when they search an online encyclopedia for information about the United Nations, for example, or something with no ambiguity regarding capitalization and ambiguity between two or more terms cut down by capitalization, they may prefer a case-sensitive search.

==Areas of significance==
Case sensitivity may differ depending on the situation:

* Searching: Users expect information retrieval systems to be able to have correct case sensitivity depending on the nature of an operation. Users looking for the word &quot;dog&quot; in an online journal probably do not wish to differentiate between &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;Dog&quot;, as this is a writing distinction; the word should be matched whether it appears at the beginning of a sentence or not. On the other hand, users looking for information about a brand name, trademark, human name, or city name may be interested in performing a case-sensitive operation to filter out irrelevant results. For example, somebody searching for the name &quot;Jade&quot; would not want to find references to the mineral called &quot;jade&quot;. On the English Wikipedia, for example, a search for friendly fire returns the military article, but Friendly Fire (capitalized &quot;Fire&quot;) returns the disambiguation page.
* Usernames: Authentication systems usually treat usernames as case-insensitive to make them easier to remember, reducing typing complexity, and eliminate the possibility of both mistakes and fraud when two usernames are identical in every aspect except the case of one of their letters. However, these systems are not case-blind. They preserve the case of the characters in the name so that users may choose an aesthetically pleasing username combination.
* Passwords: Authentication systems usually treat passwords as case-sensitive. This enables the users to increase the complexity of their passwords.
* File names: Traditionally, Unix-like operating systems treat file names case-sensitively while Microsoft Windows is case-insensitive but, for most file systems, case-preserving. For more details, see below.
* Variable names: Some programming languages are case-sensitive for their variable names while others are not. For more details, see below.
* URLs: The &quot;path&quot;, &quot;query&quot;, &quot;fragment&quot;, and &quot;authority&quot; sections of a URL may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on the receiving web server. The &quot;scheme&quot; and &quot;host&quot; parts, however, are strictly lowercase.

==In programming languages==
Some programming languages are case-sensitive for their identifiers (C, C++, Java, C#, Verilog, Ruby, Python and Swift). Others are case-insensitive (i.e., not case-sensitive), such as ABAP, Ada, most BASICs (an exception being BBC BASIC), Common Lisp, Fortran, SQL (for the syntax, and for some vendor implementations, e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, the data itself) Pascal, Rexx and ooRexx. There are also languages, such as Haskell, Prolog, and Go, in which the capitalisation of an identifier encodes information about its semantics. Some other programming languages have varying case sensitivity; in PHP, for example, variable names are case-sensitive but function names are not case-sensitive. This means that if a function is defined in lowercase, it can be called in uppercase, but if a variable is defined in lowercase, it cannot be referred to in uppercase. Nim is case-insensitive and ignores underscores, as long as the first characters match.

==In text search==
A text search operation could be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, depending on the system, application, or context. The user can in many cases specify whether a search is sensitive to case, e.g. in most text editors, word processors, and Web browsers. A case-insensitive search is more comprehensive, finding &quot;Language&quot; (at the beginning of a sentence), &quot;language&quot;, and &quot;LANGUAGE&quot; (in a title in capitals); a case-sensitive search will find the computer language &quot;BASIC&quot; but exclude most of the many unwanted instances of the word. For example, the Google Search engine is basically case-insensitive, with no option for case-sensitive search. In Oracle SQL, most operations and searches are case-sensitive by default, while in most other DBMSes, SQL searches are case-insensitive by default.

Case-insensitive operations are sometimes said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lowercase letters coincide.

==In filesystems==
In filesystems in Unix-like systems, filenames are usually case-sensitive (there can be separate readme.txt and Readme.txt files in the same directory). MacOS is somewhat unusual in that, by default, it uses HFS+ and APFS in a case-insensitive (so that there cannot be a readme.txt and a Readme.txt in the same directory) but case-preserving mode (so that a file created as readme.txt is shown as readme.txt and a file created as Readme.txt is shown as Readme.txt) by default. This causes some issues for developers and power users, because most file systems in other Unix-like environments are case-sensitive, and, for example, a source code tree for software for Unix-like systems might have both a file named Makefile and a file named makefile in the same directory. In addition, some Mac Installers assume case insensitivity and fail on case-sensitive file systems.

The older MS-DOS filesystems FAT12 and FAT16 were case-insensitive and not case-preserving, so that a file whose name is entered as readme.txt or ReadMe.txt is saved as README.TXT. Later, with VFAT in Windows 95 the FAT file systems became case-preserving as an extension of supporting long filenames. Later Windows file systems such as NTFS are internally case-sensitive, and a readme.txt and a Readme.txt can coexist in the same directory. However, for practical purposes filenames behave as case-insensitive as far as users and most software are concerned. This can cause problems for developers or software coming from Unix-like environments, similar to the problems with macOS case-insensitive file systems.

<doc id="46064" wikidata="Q1501981" url="?curid=46064" title="Story of O">
<text>Story of O (, ) is an erotic novel written by French author Anne Desclos under the pen name Pauline Réage, with the original French text published in 1954 by Jean-Jacques Pauvert.

Desclos did not reveal herself as the author until 1994, 40 years after the initial publication. Desclos stated she wrote the novel as a series of love letters to her lover Jean Paulhan, who had admired the work of the Marquis de Sade. The novel shares with the latter themes such as love, dominance, and submission.

== Plot ==
&quot;Story of O&quot; is a tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse, offering herself to any male who belongs to the same secret society as her lover. She is regularly stripped, blindfolded, chained, and whipped; her anus is widened by increasingly large plugs; her labium is pierced and her buttocks are branded.

The story begins when O&#x27;s lover, René, brings her to the château in Roissy, where she is trained to serve the members of an elite club. After this initial training, as a demonstration of their bond and his generosity, René hands O to his elder stepbrother Sir Stephen, a more severe master. René wants O to learn to serve someone whom she does not love, and someone who does not love her. Over the course of this training, O falls in love with Sir Stephen and believes him to be in love with her as well. During the summer, Sir Stephen sends O to an old mansion in Samois solely inhabited by women for advanced training and body modifications related to submission. There she agrees to receive permanent marks of Sir Stephen&#x27;s ownership, in the form of a brand and a steel tag hanging from a labia piercing.

Meanwhile René has encouraged O to seduce Jacqueline, a vain fashion model, and lure her to Roissy. Jacqueline is repulsed when she first sees O&#x27;s chains and scars, although O herself is proud of her condition as a willing slave. But Jacqueline&#x27;s younger half-sister becomes enamored of O, and begs to be taken to Roissy.

At the climax, O is presented as a sexual slave, nude but for an owl-like mask and a leash attached to her piercing, before a large party of guests who treat her solely as an object. Afterward, she is shared by Sir Stephen and an associate of his who is referred to only as &quot;The Commander&quot;.

Some early editions included several different variations of an epilogue which note that Sir Stephen later abandoned O, though there is debate as to whether Desclos intended it to be included in the finished work; in one such version, O is so distraught by the threat of this abandonment that she insists she would rather die and asks for permission to commit suicide, which is granted.


== Publishing history ==
In February 1955, &quot;Story of O&quot; won the French literature prize Prix des Deux Magots, but the French authorities still brought obscenity charges against the publisher. The charges were rejected by the courts, but a publicity ban was imposed for a number of years.

Olympia Press published the first English edition in 1965. Eliot Fremont-Smith (of &quot;The New York Times&quot;) called its publication &quot;a significant event&quot;.

==Criticism==
A critical view of the novel is that it is about, and derives its erotic power from, the ultimate objectification of a woman. The heroine has the shortest possible name. Though this is in fact a shortening of &quot;Odile&quot;, it could also stand for &quot;object&quot; or &quot;orifice&quot;, an O being a symbolic representation of any &quot;hole&quot;. The novel was strongly criticized by many feminists, who felt it glorified the abuse of women. An article by Susan Griffin that appears in &quot;Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis&quot; (reprinted from Griffin’s book &quot;Pornography and Silence&quot; with an introduction) criticizes the novel; Griffin argues that &quot;Story of O&quot; shows &quot;how a pornographic society turns a woman&#x27;s heart against herself.&quot;

When the film &quot;Story of O&quot; was released, &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; magazine ran a feature on the novel and film. This resulted in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; being picketed by feminists from the group Mouvement de libération des femmes, who found the novel and film objectionable. Journalist François Chalais also criticized &quot;Story of O&quot;, claiming the novel glorified violence; he described the novel as &quot;bringing the Gestapo into the boudoir&quot;.

== Hidden identities ==
The book&#x27;s author Anne Desclos used a pen name, then later used another pen name, before finally, just before her death, revealing her true identity. Her lover, Jean Paulhan, wrote the preface as if the author were unknown to him.

According to Geraldine Bedell, writing in 2004, &quot;Pauline Réage, the author, was a pseudonym, and many people thought that the book could only have been written by a man. The writer&#x27;s true identity was not revealed until ten years ago, when, in an interview with John de St. Jorre, a British journalist and sometime foreign correspondent of &quot;The Observer&quot;, an impeccably dressed 86-year-old intellectual called Dominique Aury acknowledged that the fantasies of castles, masks and debauchery were hers.&quot; According to several other sources, however, Dominique Aury was itself a pseudonym of Anne Desclos, born 23 September 1907 in Rochefort-sur-Mer, France, and deceased 26 April 1998 (at age 90) in Paris.

The Grove Press edition (U.S., 1965) was translated by editor Richard Seaver (who had lived in France for many years) under the pseudonym Sabine d&#x27;Estrée.

=== Jean Paulhan ===
Jean Paulhan, the author&#x27;s lover and the person to whom she wrote &quot;Story of O&quot; in the form of love letters, wrote the preface, &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot;. Paulhan admired the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s work and told Desclos that a woman could not write like Sade. Desclos took this as a challenge and wrote the book. Paulhan was so impressed that he sent it to a publisher. In the preface, he goes out of his way to appear as if he does not know who wrote it. In one part he says, &quot;But from the beginning to end, the story of O is managed rather like some brilliant feat. It reminds you more of a speech than of a mere effusion; of a letter rather than a secret diary. But to whom is the letter addressed? Whom is the speech trying to convince? Whom can we ask? I don&#x27;t even know who you are. That you are a woman I have little doubt.&quot; Paulhan also explains his own belief that the themes in the book depict the true nature of women. At times, the preface (when read with the knowledge of the relationship between Paulhan and the author), seems to be a continuation of the conversation between them.

In an interview Paulhan explained that O, in a religious-like obsession, was seeking the loss of responsibility for her body and mind much like many religious women seek to surrender themselves to the mercy of God. In both cases it is the joy of destruction. Paulhan was also quoted: &quot;To be killed by someone you love strikes me as the epitome of ecstasy&quot;. Discussing the ending, Paulhan states, &quot;I too was surprised by the end. And nothing you can say will convince me that it is the real end. That in reality (so to speak) your heroine convinces Sir Stephen to consent to her death.&quot;

One critic has seen Paulhan&#x27;s essay as consistent with other themes in his work, including his interest in erotica, his &quot;mystification&quot; of love and sexual relationships, and a view of women that is arguably sexist.

== Legacy ==
Emmanuelle Arsan claimed the &quot;Story of O&quot; inspired her to write her own erotic novel &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; (1967).

A sequel to &quot;Story of O&quot;, &quot;Retour à Roissy&quot; (&quot;Return to Roissy,&quot; but often translated as &quot;Return to the Chateau&quot;, &quot;Continuing the Story of O&quot;), was published in 1969 in French, again with Jean-Jacques Pauvert, &quot;éditeur&quot;. It was published again in English by Grove Press, Inc., in 1971. It is not known whether this work is by the same author as the original.

The town Samois-sur-Seine is mentioned in &quot;Story of O&quot; as the location of the fictional mansion managed by Anne-Marie, a lesbian dominatrix. In 1978, the name Samois was adopted by a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983. It was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States.

In 2007, the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Pauline Reage (a pen name of Anne Desclos, author of &quot;Story of O&quot;) award for fiction novel.

In 2020, Anne Desclos was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===

American experimental director Kenneth Anger made a 20-minute short film version, &quot;l&#x27;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot;, in 1961.

French director Henri-Georges Clouzot wanted to adapt the novel to film for many years, which was eventually done by director Just Jaeckin in 1975 as &quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot; (&quot;Story of O&quot;) produced by Eric Rochat and Gérard Lorin, starring Corinne Cléry and Udo Kier. The film met with far less acclaim than the book. In the United Kingdom it was refused a certificate by the BBFC, and was not passed until February 2000.

In 1975, American director Gerard Damiano, well known for &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; (1973), created the movie &quot;The Story of Joanna&quot;, highly influenced by the &quot;Story of O&quot;, by combining motifs from one of the book&#x27;s chapters and from Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot;.

In 1979, Danish director Lars von Trier made the short movie entitled &quot;Menthe – la bienheureuse&quot;, as an homage to &quot;Story of O&quot;. His 2005 film &quot;Manderlay&quot; was also inspired by the book, particularly Paulhan&#x27;s introduction.

Five years later, in 1984, actress Sandra Wey starred as &quot;O&quot; in &quot;Story of O - Chapter 2&quot;, written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat.

In 1992, a Brazilian miniseries in 10 episodes entitled &quot;A História de O&quot; starring Claudia Cepeda was written, directed and produced by Eric Rochat, who was the producer of the original 1975 movie.

In 2002, another version of &quot;O&quot; was released, called &quot;The Story of O: Untold Pleasures&quot;, with Danielle Ciardi playing the title character.

===Comics===
In 1975, it was adapted for comics by the Italian artist Guido Crepax. Both the original and Crepax&#x27;s adaptation were parodied for comics in 2007 by Charles Alverson and John Linton Roberson.

=== Documentaries ===
&quot;Writer of O&quot;, a 2004 documentary film by , mixed interviews with re-enactments of certain scenes from the book. In the documentary, the real author of &quot;Story of O&quot;, Dominique Aury (actually a pen name of Anne Desclos), talks about the book &quot;A Girl in Love&quot;. This book was written about how &quot;Story of O&quot; was written.

A documentary was also made for BBC Radio 4 entitled &quot;The Story of O: The Vice Francaise&quot;, presented by Rowan Pelling, former editor of the &quot;Erotic Review&quot;, which looked at the history of the book and its author Anne Desclos.

&quot;&quot;, a documentary film by Maya Gallus produced by Red Queen Productions in 1997, featured the final interview with 90-year-old Dominique Aury (a pen name of &quot;Story of O&quot; author Anne Desclos) before she died. In the film, she recounts the extraordinary love story behind &quot;Story of O&quot; and marvels that she has reached such a grand age.

<text>Gábor Szegő () (January 20, 1895 – August 7, 1985) was a Hungarian-American mathematician. He was one of the foremost mathematical analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and Toeplitz matrices building on the work of his contemporary Otto Toeplitz.

==Life==
Szegő was born in Kunhegyes, Austria-Hungary (today Hungary), into a Jewish family as the son of Adolf Szegő and Hermina Neuman. He married the chemist Anna Elisabeth Neményi in 1919, with whom he had two children.

In 1912 he started studies in mathematical physics at the University of Budapest, with summer visits to the University of Berlin and the University of Göttingen, where he attended lectures by Frobenius and Hilbert, amongst others. In Budapest he was taught mainly by Fejér, Beke, Kürschák and Bauer and made the acquaintance of his future collaborators George Pólya and Michael Fekete. His studies were interrupted in 1915 by World War I, in which he served in the infantry, artillery and air corps.
In 1918 while stationed in Vienna, he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Vienna for his work on Toeplitz determinants. He received his Privat-Dozent from the University of Berlin in 1921, where he stayed until being appointed as successor to Knopp at the University of Königsberg in 1926. Intolerable working conditions during the Nazi regime resulted in a temporary position at the Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1936, before his appointment as chairman of the mathematics department at Stanford University in 1938, where he helped build up the department until his retirement in 1966. He died in Palo Alto, California. His doctoral students include Paul Rosenbloom and Joseph Ullman. The Gábor Szegö Prize, Szegő Gábor Primary School, and Szegő Gábor Matematikaverseny (a mathematics competition in his former school) are all named in his honor.

==Works==
Szegő&#x27;s most important work was in analysis. He was one of the foremost analysts of his generation and made fundamental contributions to the theory of Toeplitz matrices and orthogonal polynomials. He wrote over 130 papers in several languages. Each of his four books, several written in collaboration with others, has become a classic in its field. The monograph &quot;Orthogonal polynomials&quot;, published in 1939, contains much of his research and has had a profound influence in many areas of applied mathematics, including theoretical physics, stochastic processes and numerical analysis.

==Tutoring von Neumann==
At the age of 15, the young John von Neumann, recognised as a mathematical prodigy, was sent to study advanced calculus under Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded by von Neumann&#x27;s mathematical talent and speed that, as recalled by his wife, he came back home with tears in his eyes. Szegő subsequently visited the von Neumann house twice a week to tutor the child prodigy. Some of von Neumann&#x27;s instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father&#x27;s stationery, are now on display at the von Neumann archive at Budapest.

==Honours==

Amongst the many honours received during his lifetime were:

* Julius König Prize of the Hungarian Mathematical Society (1928)
* Member of the Königsberger Gelehrten Gesellschaft (1928)
* Corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1960)
* Honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1965)

<text>Pope Nicholas IV (; born Girolamo Masci; 30 September 1227 – 4 April 1292) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 22 February 1288 to his death, on 4 April 1292. He was the first Franciscan to be elected pope.

==Early life==
Jerome Masci (Girolamo Masci) was born on 30 September 1227 at Lisciano, near Ascoli Piceno. He was a pious, peace-loving man whose goals as a Franciscan friar were to protect the Church, promote the crusades, and root out heresy. According to Heinrich of Rebdorf, he was a Doctor of Theology. As a Franciscan friar, he had been elected the Order&#x27;s superior (minister) for Dalmatia during the Franciscan general chapter held at Pisa in 1272. Pope Gregory X (1271-1276), was sending a legate to the Byzantine emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, in 1272, to invite the participation of Byzantine prelates in the Second Council of Lyons. The pope&#x27;s ambition was to achieve a reunion of Eastern and Western Christendom. St Bonaventure, then minister general of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans), was asked to select four Franciscans to accompany the legation as nuncios. He chose Friar Jerome Masci as one of the four. When Bonaventure died suddenly during the fifth session of the Order&#x27;s General Chapter at Lyons on 15 July 1274, Friar Jerome Masci was elected to succeed him as the Franciscan minister general, even though he was absent at the time, only then returning with the Byzantine delegates from the embassy to Constantinople.

Jerome was the associate of John of Vercelli, master general of the Dominican Order, when the latter was sent by Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Caetani Orsini) on 15 October 1277, to arrange a peace between Philip IV of France and Alfonso III of Aragon. Jerome and John of Vercelli were again appointed to the same task on 4 April 1278. At the same time, Jerome was ordered to continue for the time being as the Franciscan Minister General.

In 1278 Jerome was made cardinal priest by Pope Nicholas III, and at some point after 16 May 1279 was assigned the titular church of Santa Pudenziana. Even after his appointment as a cardinal, he was allowed to remain as minister general of the Franciscans until the next general chapter. In the event, however, he was unable to attend the chapter for reasons of ill health, as a letter of apology of Pope Nicholas III, written in May 1279, indicates. On 12 April 1281 he was promoted to cardinal bishop of Palestrina by Pope Martin IV.

==Pontificate==

===Papal conclave===
After the death of Pope Honorius IV on 3 April 1287, a conclave was held in Rome, at the papal palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill, where Pope Honorius had died. This was in accordance with the Constitution &quot;Ubi periculum&quot; of Pope Gregory X. At the beginning, in April, there were thirteen cardinals in Rome; three cardinals—Gerardo Bianchi, Giovanni Boccamati, and Jean Cholet—did not attend at all. The Sacred College was for a time hopelessly divided in its selection of a successor. When six of the electors died during the year 1287 (Ancher Pantaleon, Geoffrey de Bar, Hugh of Evesham, Giordano Orsini, Comes de Casanate, and Goffredo of Alatri—some, at least, carried off by fever), the others, with the sole exception of Jerome Masci, left the conclave and returned to their homes. It was not until the following year that they reassembled. The electors at that time were seven in number: Jerome Masci, along with Latino Malabranca, Bentivenga de Bentivengis, Bernard de Languissel, Matteo Rosso Orsini, Giacomo Colonna, and Benedetto Caetani. On 15 February 1288, the survivors unanimously elected Jerome Masci, to the papacy on the first scrutiny. It is said that the cardinals were impressed by his steadfastness in remaining at the papal palace, but there is no real documentation as to their motives. As he admitted in his electoral manifesto, Cardinal Masci was extremely reluctant to accept, and indeed he persisted in his refusal for an entire week. Finally, on 22 February, he gave in and agreed. He became the first Franciscan pope and chose the name Nicholas IV in remembrance of Nicholas III, who had made him a cardinal.

===New cardinals===

Given the considerable losses to the numbers of the Sacred College in 1286 and 1287, it is not surprising that Nicholas IV quickly proceeded to fill vacancies. What is surprising is that he did not even reach the number of cardinals who were alive under Honorius IV, let alone exceed it. On 16 May 1288, he named six new cardinals: Bernardus Calliensis, Bishop of Osimo (who died in 1291), Hugues Aiscelin (Seguin) de Billon, OP, of the diocese of Clermont in the Auvergne; Matthew of Aquasparta in Tuscany, minister general of the Franciscans since 1287; Pietro Peregrosso of Milan, the vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church; Napoleone Orsini; and Pietro Colonna.

Nicholas IV issued an important constitution on 18 July 1289, which granted to the cardinals one-half of all income accruing to the Holy See and a share in the financial management, thereby paving the way for that independence of the College of Cardinals which, in the following century, was to be of detriment to the papacy.

===Actions===

In regard to the question of the Sicilian succession, as feudal suzerain of the kingdom, Nicholas annulled the treaty, concluded in 1288 through the mediation of Edward I of England, which confirmed James II of Aragon in the possession of the island of Sicily. This treaty had not properly seen to papal interests. In May 1289 he crowned Charles II as king of Sicily after the latter had expressly recognized papal suzerainty, and in February 1291 concluded a treaty with Kings Alfonso III of Aragon and Philip IV of France looking toward the expulsion of James from Sicily.

In 1288 Nicholas met with the Nestorian Christian Rabban Bar Sauma from China.

In August 1290 he granted the status of &quot;studium generale&quot; to the university that King Denis of Portugal has just founded a few months earlier in the city of Lisbon.

The loss of Acre in 1291 stirred Nicholas IV to renewed enthusiasm for a crusade. He sent missionaries, among them the Franciscan John of Monte Corvino, to labour among the Bulgarians, Ethiopians, Mongols, Tatars and Chinese.

==Death==
Nicholas IV died in Rome on 4 April 1292, in the palace which he had built next to the Liberian Basilica (S. Maria Maggiore). He was buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. His epitaph reads: &quot;Here lies Nicolas IV son of St. Francis&quot; (&quot;Hic requiescit / Nicolaus PP Quartus / Filius Beati Francisci&quot;).

The 1291–92 &quot;Taxatio&quot; he initiated, which was a detailed valuation for ecclesiastical taxation of English and Welsh parish churches and prebends, remains an important source document for the medieval period. An edition was reprinted by the Record Commission in 1802 as &quot;Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae Auctoritate&quot;.

<text>Kazimierz Kuratowski (; 2 February 1896 – 18 June 1980) was a Polish mathematician and logician. He was one of the leading representatives of the Warsaw School of Mathematics. He worked as a professor at the University of Warsaw and at the Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN). Between 1946 and 1953, he served as President of the Polish Mathematical Society.

He is primarily known for his contributions to set theory, topology, measure theory and graph theory. Some of the notable mathematical concepts bearing Kuratowski&#x27;s name include Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, Kuratowski closure axioms, Kuratowski-Zorn lemma and Kuratowski&#x27;s intersection theorem.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Kazimierz Kuratowski was born in Warsaw, (then part of Congress Poland controlled by the Russian Empire), on 2 February 1896. He was a son of Marek Kuratow, a barrister, and Róża Karzewska. He completed a Warsaw secondary school, which was named after general Paweł Chrzanowski. In 1913, he enrolled in an engineering course at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, in part because he did not wish to study in Russian; instruction in Polish was prohibited. He completed only one year of study when the outbreak of World War I precluded any further enrolment. In 1915, Russian forces withdrew from Warsaw and Warsaw University was reopened with Polish as the language of instruction. Kuratowski restarted his university education there the same year, this time in mathematics. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1921, in the newly established Second Polish Republic.

===Doctoral thesis===
In autumn 1921 Kuratowski was awarded the Ph.D. degree for his groundbreaking work. His thesis statement consisted of two parts. One was devoted to an axiomatic construction of topology via the closure axioms. This first part (republished in a slightly modified form in 1922) has been cited in hundreds of scientific articles.

The second part of Kuratowski&#x27;s thesis was devoted to continua irreducible between two points. This was the subject of a French doctoral thesis written by Zygmunt Janiszewski. Since Janiszewski was deceased, Kuratowski&#x27;s supervisor was Stefan Mazurkiewicz. Kuratowski&#x27;s thesis solved certain problems in set theory raised by a Belgian mathematician, Charles-Jean Étienne Gustave Nicolas, Baron de la Vallée Poussin.

===Academic career until World War II===
Two years later, in 1923, Kuratowski was appointed deputy professor of mathematics at Warsaw University. He was then appointed a full professor of mathematics at Lwów Polytechnic in Lwów, in 1927. He was the head of the Mathematics department there until 1933. Kuratowski was also dean of the department twice. In 1929, Kuratowski became a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society

While Kuratowski associated with many of the scholars of the Lwów School of Mathematics, such as Stefan Banach and Stanislaw Ulam, and the circle of mathematicians based around the Scottish Café he kept close connections with Warsaw. Kuratowski left Lwów for Warsaw in 1934, before the famous Scottish Book was begun (in 1935), hence did not contribute any problems to it. He did however, collaborate closely with Banach in solving important problems in measure theory.

In 1934 he was appointed the professor at Warsaw University. A year later Kuratowski was nominated as the head of the Mathematics department there. From 1936 to 1939 he was secretary of the Mathematics Committee in The Council of Science and Applied Sciences.

===During and after the war===
During World War II, he gave lectures at the underground university in Warsaw, since higher education for Poles was forbidden under German occupation.

In February 1945, Kuratowski started to lecture at the reopened Warsaw University. In 1945, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Learning, in 1946 he was appointed vice-president of the Mathematics department at Warsaw University, and from 1949 he was chosen to be the vice-president of Warsaw Scientific Society. In 1952 he became a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, of which he was the vice-president from 1957 to 1968.

After World War II, Kuratowski was actively involved in the rebuilding of scientific life in Poland. He helped to establish the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. From 1948 until 1967 Kuratowski was director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and was also a long-time chairman of the Polish and International Mathematics Societies. He served as vice-president of the International Mathematical Union (1963–1966) as well as president of the Scientific Council of the State Institute of Mathematics (1968–1980). From 1948 to 1980 he was the head of the topology section. One of his students was Andrzej Mostowski.

==Legacy==
Kazimierz Kuratowski was one of a celebrated group of Polish mathematicians who would meet at Lwów&#x27;s Scottish Café. He was a president of the Polish Mathematical Society (PTM) and a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (TNW). What is more, he was chief editor in &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, a series of publications in &quot;Polish Mathematical Society Annals&quot;. Furthermore, Kuratowski worked as an editor in the Polish Academy of Sciences Bulletin. He was also one of the writers of the Mathematical monographs, which were created in cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN). High quality research monographs of the representatives of Warsaw&#x27;s and Lwów&#x27;s School of Mathematics, which concerned all areas of pure and applied mathematics, were published in these volumes.

Kazimierz Kuratowski was an active member of many scientific societies and foreign scientific academies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

===Kazimierz Kuratowski Prize===
In 1981, IMPAN, the Polish Mathematical Society, and Kuratowski&#x27;s daughter Zofia Kuratowska established a prize in his name, the Kuratowski Prize, for achievements in mathematics to people under the age of 30 years. The prize is considered the most prestigious of awards for young Polish mathematicians; past recipients have included Józef H. Przytycki, Mariusz Lemańczyk, Tomasz Łuczak, Mikołaj Bojańczyk, and Wojciech Samotij.

==Research==

Kuratowski&#x27;s research mainly focused on abstract topological and metric structures. He implemented the closure axioms (known in mathematical circles as the Kuratowski closure axioms). This was fundamental for the development of topological space theory and irreducible continuum theory between two points. The most valuable results, which were obtained by Kuratowski after the war are those that concern the relationship between topology and analytic functions (theory), and also research in the field of cutting Euclidean spaces. Together with Ulam, who was Kuratowski&#x27;s most talented student during the Lwów Period, he introduced the concept of so-called quasi homeomorphism that opened up a new field in topological studies.
Kuratowski&#x27;s research in the field of measure theory, including research with Banach and Tarski, was continued by many students. Moreover, with Alfred Tarski and Wacław Sierpiński he provided most of the theory concerning Polish spaces (that are indeed named after these mathematicians and their legacy). Knaster and Kuratowski brought a comprehensive and precise study to connected components theory. It was applied to issues such as cutting-plane, with the paradoxical examples of connected components.

Kuratowski proved the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (often called just Zorn&#x27;s lemma) in 1922. This result has important connections to many basic theorems. Zorn gave its application in 1935. Kuratowski implemented many concepts in set theory and topology. In many cases, Kuratowski established new terminologies and symbolisms.
His contributions to mathematics include:
* a characterization of topological spaces which are now called the Kuratowski closure axioms;
* proof of the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma;
* in graph theory, the characterization of planar graphs now known as Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem;
* identification of the ordered pair formula_1 with the set formula_2
* the Kuratowski finite set definition, see Kuratowski-finite;
* introduction of the Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm;
* Kuratowski&#x27;s closure-complement problem;
* Kuratowski&#x27;s free set theorem;
* Kuratowski&#x27;s intersection theorem;
* Knaster-Kuratowski fan;
* Kuratowski-Ulam theorem;
* Kuratowski convergence of subsets of metric spaces;
* the Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem;

Kuratowski&#x27;s post-war works were mainly focused on three strands:
* The development of homotopy in continuous functions.
* The construction of connected space theory in higher dimensions.
* The uniform depiction of cutting Euclidean spaces by any of its subsets, based on the properties of continuous transformations of these sets.

==Publications==
Among over 170 published works are valuable monographs and books including Topologie (Vol. I, 1933, translated into English and Russian, and Vol. II, 1950) and Introduction to Set Theory and Topology (Vol. I, 1952, translated into English, French, Spanish, and Bulgarian). He authored &quot;A Half Century of Polish Mathematics 1920-1970: Remembrances and Reflections&quot; (1973) and &quot;Notes to his autobiography&quot; (1981). The latter was published posthumously thanks to Kuratowski&#x27;s daughter Zofia Kuratowska, who prepared his notes for printing. Kazimierz Kuratowski represented Polish mathematics in the International Mathematical Union where he was vice president from 1963 to 1966. What is more, he participated in numerous international congresses and lectured at dozens of universities around the world. He was an honorary causa doctor at the Universities in Glasgow, Prague, Wroclaw, and Paris. He received the highest national awards, as well as a gold medal of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, and the Polish Academy of Science. Kuratowski died on 18 June 1980 in Warsaw.

<text>Pope Lucius II (died 15 February 1145), born Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 March 1144 to his death in 1145. His pontificate was notable for the unrest in Rome associated with the Commune of Rome and its attempts to wrest control of the city from the papacy. He supported Empress Matilda&#x27;s claim to England in the Anarchy, and had a tense relationship with King Roger II of Sicily.

==Early life==
Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, the son of Orso Caccianemici was born in Bologna. He was for many years a canon of the Basilica di San Frediano before his elevation by Pope Honorius II to cardinal priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in 1124. During this time there he renovated the basilica, attached a body of regular canons and improved its revenue stream. After his election as pope, he presented to the church a copy of the Gospels bound with plates of gold and adorned with jewels, as well as an altar-cover and two chased silver-gilt ampullae for use at Mass. Honorius also appointed him the librarian of the Diocese of Rome before appointing him papal legate in Germany in 1125. While there, he helped support the candidacy of Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III as well as appointing Saint Norbert of Xanten as the Archbishop of Magdeburg. In 1128, Gherardo was sent to Benevento to govern the city, which had overthrown the previous rector.

In 1130 he was again appointed legate to Germany by Pope Innocent II, where he was instrumental in convincing Lothair III to make two expeditions to Italy for the purpose of protecting Pope Innocent II against the Antipope Anacletus II. He had a further period as legate to Germany in 1135–36. He was one of the principal negotiators with Lothair III in attempting to force the monks of Monte Cassino to submit themselves to the authority of the papacy. In addition, he was sent to Salerno to negotiate the end of the schism involving Anacletus II with King Roger II of Sicily. As a principal supporter of Pope Innocent II, the pope rewarded him for his efforts by appointing him papal chancellor. After the papal election of 1144, Gherardo was elected as Lucius II and consecrated on 12 March 1144. He probably took his name in honor of Pope Lucius I, who was commemorated a few days prior to Gherardo&#x27;s consecration.

==Pontificate==
===Relations with England and Portugal===
Lucius was involved in the usual running of church business throughout medieval Christendom. In England, he granted a number of privileges to bishops, monasteries and churches, including exempting the monastery of St. Edmund from all subjection to the secular authorities. He also dispatched a papal legate, Igmarus (or Hincmar), to England, charged to investigate the request of Bernard, Bishop of St David&#x27;s, to elevate his see to the rank of metropolitan bishop, and to take the pallium to Archbishop William of York. Regarding the political situation in England, he took the side of the Empress Matilda over the rights to the English crown.

Early in his reign, Lucius received a request from prominent members of the town of Lucca to become the suzerain of the castle within the town in order to protect it from the war between Lucca and Pisa. Lucius received it on 18 March 1144 and, for a payment of ten pounds of gold, agreed to defend it on his behalf. Lucius then returned the castle to them as a fief.

Meanwhile, in Portugal, King Afonso I, eager to maintain the newly established independence of Portugal from the Kingdom of León, offered to do homage to Lucius, as he had done to Pope Innocent II, and to make the pope the feudal suzerain of his lands. He offered Lucius his territory and a yearly tribute of four ounces of gold in exchange for the defence and support of the Apostolic See. Although Lucius accepted Afonso&#x27;s feudal homage on 1 May 1144, and excused him from appearing in person, he did not acknowledge Afonso as King of Portugal, but instead as &quot;Dux Portugallensis&quot;. The royal title would eventually be conferred by Pope Alexander III.

Finally, the city of Corneto, formally belonging to the Papal States, was restored to the papacy during Lucius’ pontificate by a formal deed on 20 November 1144.

===Conflict with Roger II of Sicily===
Although Lucius had been the friend of King Roger II of Sicily and godparent to one of his children, the situation between the two deteriorated. The two parties met at Ceprano in June 1144 to clarify the duties of Roger as a vassal of the Holy See. Lucius demanded the return of the principality of Capua, while Roger instead wanted additional territory that formed part of the Papal States in the south. Lucius II, on the advice of his cardinals, was unwilling to accept Roger&#x27;s demands and rejected them. Infuriated, King Roger returned to Sicily and asked his son Duke Roger III of Apulia to invade Campania. Duke Roger did as he was asked, and sent his general Robert of Selby against Lucius, ravaging the country as far north as Ferentino. This forced the Romans to capitulate, and in September 1144, Lucius agreed to Roger&#x27;s terms, negotiating a seven-year truce. The Normans in return withdrew back to their conquered territories and promised not to attack Benevento or any other papal territory.

===Emergence of the Roman Commune===

This surrender on the part of Lucius II gave an opportunity for members of the Roman Senate to reassert their ancient independence and authority and to erect a revolutionary republic at Rome which sought to deprive the pope of his temporal power. The principal groups involved in this movement were the merchants and artisans, while the urban nobility kept their neutrality.

The Senate, which practically took all temporal power from the pope during the pontificate of Innocent II, had been managed with considerable skill and firmness by Lucius at the beginning of his pontificate, convincing many senators to either leave the Capitoline Hill or to lay down their magisterium. Now, encouraged by Lucius II&#x27;s defeat, the Senate, led by Giordano Pierleoni, brother of the former Antipope Anacletus II, rebelled against Lucius II, driving out the papal prefects and establishing the Commune of Rome. They demanded the pope abandon all governmental duties, and that he would retain only ecclesiastical taxes and voluntary tributes. The Senate took over powers to elect magistrates and strike its own coinage. At first, Lucius asked for Roger II&#x27;s aid, but Roger, still annoyed that Lucius had not fully recognised his kingship, withheld his assistance. Lucius then turned for help to Conrad, King of the Romans, and on December 1144 wrote to him pleading for military assistance against the Senate and the Patrician Giordano Pierleoni. Lucius was supported by Bernard of Clairvaux, who also wrote to Conrad, asking for him to intervene.

While waiting for Conrad&#x27;s reply, Lucius decided to take matters into his own hands. Turning to the Roman aristocracy, in particular the Frangipani family, he gave them the fortress of the Circus Maximus on 31 January 1145, allowing them complete control of the southern portion of the Palatine Hill. The Roman Forum had become a battleground, and the confusion prevented Lucius from travelling to the Aventine Hill to ordain the abbot of San Saba on 20 January 1145.

Finally, Lucius marched against the Senatorial positions on the Capitol with a small army. He was driven back by Giordano, and according to Godfrey of Viterbo, he was seriously injured during this battle (by a thrown stone). He did not recover from his injuries and died on 15 February 1145 at San Gregorio Magno al Celio, where he was under the protection of the neighbouring Frangipani fortress.

Lucius II was buried at St John Lateran in the circular portico behind the apse. His heraldic badge was a shield of argent, with a bear rampant of proper sable.

<text>Halteres (; singular halter or haltere) (from , hand-held weights to give an impetus in leaping) are a pair of small club-shaped organs on the body of two orders of flying insects that provide information about body rotations during flight. Insects of the large order Diptera (flies) have halteres which evolved from a pair of ancestral hindwings, while males of the much smaller order Strepsiptera (stylops) have halteres which evolved from a pair of ancestral forewings.

Halteres oscillate rapidly along with the wings and operate like vibrating structure gyroscopes: any rotation of the plane of oscillation causes a force on the vibrating halteres by the Coriolis effect. The insect detects this force with sensory organs called campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs located at the base of the halteres and uses this information to interpret and correct its position in space. Halteres provide rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, as well as to the muscles responsible for stabilizing the head.

==Background==

The majority of insects have two pairs of wings. Flies possess only one set of lift-generating wings and one set of halteres. The order name for flies, &quot;Diptera&quot;, literally means &quot;two wings&quot;, but there is another order of insect which has evolved flight with only two wings: strepsipterans, or stylops; they are the only other organisms that possess two wings and two halteres. The strepsipterans have adapted their forewings into halteres, whereas dipterans have adapted their hindwings into halteres. This unique structure which detects rotations/perturbations during flight has never been described in nature elsewhere, though many flying insects have been shown to detect Coriolis forces from their non-specialised wings.

Halteres are able to sense small deviations in body position using the gyroscopic properties of moving mass. What this means is that halteres beat up and down in time with the flapping of the wings along a linear pathway, but when the fly&#x27;s body begins to rotate, the path of the beating halteres also changes. Now, instead of the halteres following a linear path, they begin to follow a curved path. The larger the perturbation they experience, the farther the halteres move from their original linear path. During these periods, the haltere is no longer moving in only two directions (up and down), but four (up, down, left, and right). The force exerted on the halteres in response to this left right movement is known as Coriolis force and can be produced when any moving object is rotated in the three directions of rotation, yaw, pitch or roll (see figure). When this occurs, tiny bell-shaped structures at the base of the haltere experience strain as the haltere stalk bends in their direction. The nervous system can then transform the bending of these hairs into electrical signals, which the fly interprets as body rotation information. The fly uses this information to make corrections to its position and thereby restabilizes itself during flight. Further details explaining the dynamics and physiology of halteres are described below.

Halteres are typically only associated with flight stabilization, but their ability to detect body rotations can elicit compensatory reactions not only from the wing steering muscles, but also from neck muscles which are responsible for head position and gaze. Halteres may also be useful for other behaviors. Certain species of flies have been observed to oscillate their halteres while walking in addition to oscillating them during flight. In these individuals, halteres could thus be detecting sensory information during walking behavior as well. When the halteres are removed, these insects perform more poorly at certain walking challenges. However, how haltere information is processed and used during walking remains, with few exceptions, unclear. Specific examples of what has been found are described below.

==History==
Halteres were first documented by William Derham in 1714. He discovered that flies were unable to remain airborne when their halteres were surgically removed, but otherwise behaved normally. This result was initially attributed to the haltere&#x27;s ability to sense and maintain equilibrium. In 1917 v. Buddenbrock asserted that something else was responsible for the flies&#x27; loss of flight ability. He claimed that the halteres should instead be considered &quot;stimulation organs&quot;. In other words, that the activity of the halteres energized the wing muscular system, so that they acted as an on/off switch for flight. V. Buddenbrock attempted to show that activation of the halteres would stimulate the central nervous system into a state of activity which allowed the wings to produce flight behavior. It has since been concluded that this is not in fact true, and that the original assertion that halteres act as balance organs is the correct one. V. Buddenbrock was able to show that immediately after haltere removal flies were unable to produce normal wing movements. This was later explained by the fact that allowing flies a few minutes recovery time post-surgery resulted in total recovery of normal flight muscle control. Further, in an interesting side experiment performed by Pringle (1938), when a thread was attached to the abdomen of haltereless flies, relatively stable flight was again achieved. The thread in these experiments presumably aided in keeping the fly from rotating (similar to the way a heavy basket below a hot air balloon prevents the balloon from tipping), which supported the hypothesis that halteres are responsible for sensing body rotations.

The original balancer theory, which was postulated by Pringle (1948), only accounted for forces produced in two directions. Pringle claimed that yaw was the only direction of rotation that flies used their halteres to detect. Using high speed video analysis, Faust (1952) demonstrated that this was not the case and that halteres are capable of detecting all three directions of rotation. In response to this new discovery, Pringle reexamined his previous assumption and came to the conclusion that flies were capable of detecting all three directions of rotation simply by comparing inputs from the left and right sides of the body. Of course, this is not the actual mechanism by which flies detect rotation. Different fields of sensory organs located in different regions at the base of each haltere detect the different directions of rotation, which also explains why flies with one haltere are still able to fly without issue.

==Evolution==

It is generally accepted that the halteres evolved from the non-flight wings of insects – the hind-wings of Diptera and the fore wings of Strepsiptera respectively. Their movement, structure, function and development all support this hypothesis. Characterizations of the arrangement of sensory organs known as campaniform sensilla, found at the base of the haltere, show many similarities to those found at the base of the hindwings in other insects. The sensilla are arranged in a way so similar to that of hindwings, that were the halteres to be replaced with wings, the forces produced would still be sufficient to activate the same sensory organs. Genetic studies have also brought to light many similarities between halteres and hindwings. In fact, haltere development has been traced back to a single gene (Ubx), which when deactivated results in the formation of a hindwing instead. Because just a single gene is responsible for this change, it is easy to imagine a small mutation here leading to the formation of the first halteres.

===Convergent evolution===

Though no other structure with entirely the same function and morphology as halteres has been observed in nature, they have evolved at least twice in the class Insecta, once in the order Diptera and again in Strepsiptera. Another structure in the class Insecta also exists whose primary function is not the same as halteres, but that additionally serves a similar balancing function. This occurs in the order Lepidoptera and refers to the antennae of moths and butterflies.

====Strepsipteran haltere====

Strepsipterans are a unique group of insects with major sexual dimorphism. The females spend their entire lives in a grub-like state, parasitizing larger insects. The only time they ever come out of their host insect is to extend their fused heads and thoraces for males to notice. The males are also parasites, but they eventually will leave their host to seek their female counterparts. Because of this, they still retain the ability to fly. Male strepsipterans uniquely possess two hindwings, while their forewings have taken on the club-like form of halteres. Though strepsipterans are very difficult to locate and are additionally rather short-lived, Pix &quot;et al.&quot; (1993) confirmed that the specialized forewings that male Strepsiptera possess perform the same function as dipteran halteres. Rotational movements of the body combined with the oscillating halteres produce Coriolis forces that can be detected by fields of mechanosensors (campaniform sensilla) located at the base of the halteres. Using functional morphology and behavior studies, Pix &quot;et al.&quot; showed that these sensors then transmit body position information to the head and abdomen to produce compensatory movements. For simplicity, the remainder of this article will refer only to dipteran halteres.

====Lepidopteran antennae====

Certain lepidopterans (moths and butterflies) exhibit small amplitude oscillation of their antennae at constant angles during flight. Antennal movements in lepidopterans were originally hypothesized to aid in wind or gravity perception. A study performed using the hawk moth, &quot;Manduca sexta&quot;, confirmed that these tiny, antennal oscillations were actually contributing to body rotation sensation.

Sane &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) determined that antennae were responsible for flight stabilization in hawk moths by removing the long part of the antenna (the flagellum), then reattaching it to determine its influence on flight performance. When the flagella were removed, the moths were no longer able to maintain stable flight. After reattachment of the flagella, flight performance was restored. The source of this difference was determined to be mechanosensory. There are two sets of mechanosensory organs located at the base of the lepidopteran antenna, Böhm&#x27;s bristles and the Johnston organ. These fields of receptors respond to different directions of antennal movements. Antennae are also capable of sensing odor, humidity, and temperature. Sane &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) was able to demonstrate that it was the mechanosensors that were responsible for flight stability as opposed to the other sensory organs, because when the flagella were removed and then reattached, all antennal nerves were severed excluding those at the base (Böhm&#x27;s bristles and the Johnston organ).

==Genetics==

In segmented organisms there are genes called Hox genes, which determine the development of serial homologs, or repeating structures within an organism (e.g. jointed appendages of arthropods or vertebrae in mammals). In insects, the thorax is separated into different segments. One of the things that the Hox gene &quot;Ultrabithorax (Ubx)&quot; is responsible for, is specifying the identity of the third thoracic segment of their body. Proper hindwing development in a number of insect species is dependent on &quot;Ubx&quot;, including butterflies, beetles, and flies. In fruit flies, (&quot;Ubx&quot;) is responsible for the formation of the halteres during metamorphosis. If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully formed wing. This single homeotic gene change results in a radically different phenotype, but also begins to give us some insight into how the ancestors of flies&#x27; hindwings may have originally evolved into halteres.

Though it is clear that &quot;Ubx&quot; is the primary gene responsible for hindwing formation, Ubx also regulates other genes once expressed. Weatherbee (1998) postulated that differences in &quot;Ubx&quot; expression patterns or levels may not be responsible for the observed physiological changes. Instead, he suggested that &quot;Ubx&quot;-regulated target gene sets were the direct source of the observed changes. Several &quot;Ubx&quot;-regulated target genes have been identified, including two direct targets, &quot;spalt&quot; and &quot;knot&quot;, which are expressed in the wing and repressed in halteres, and which are not affected by extradenticle. Other genes which are expressed in wings and repressed in halteres have also been identified, but whether or not they act as direct targets of &quot;Ubx&quot; regulation are still unknown.

==Dynamics==

Dipteran insects along with the majority of other insect orders use what are known as indirect flight muscles to accomplish flight. Indirect insect flight muscles are composed of two sets of perpendicular muscles (see left figure) that are attached to the thorax (instead of directly to the wing base as is the case for direct flight muscles). When the first set of muscles contracts, they deform the body of the insect and compress its thorax vertically, which lifts the wings. When the first set of muscles relaxes and the second set contracts, the thorax is squeezed in the opposite direction, which extends the body vertically and moves the wings downward. The below figure demonstrates this movement with only the first set of muscles.

The movement of the wings and the halteres are mechanically coupled. Sane &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) demonstrated that in freshly killed flies, without any neural input, the movement of wings was still coupled with the movement of halteres. When a forcep was used to manually move a wing up and down, not only did the opposite wing move in synchrony, the halteres also beat in antiphase with both wings. The source of this coupling however, was not between the muscles which control the halteres and those that control the wings. Instead, two small ridges of cuticle known as the subepimeral ridges were found to be responsible. These ridges connect the right wing to the right haltere and the left wing to the left haltere.

Each side of the body must be synchronized and the two sides are also coupled. That is, the left and right wings and thus the left and right halteres always beat at the same frequency. However, the amplitude of the wingbeat does not always have to be the same on the left and right side. This is what allows the flies to turn and is accomplished using a gearbox, much like what you would find in an automobile. This gearbox can change the maximum amplitude of the wing movement and determine its speed of motion. The wings of flies even have a clutch structure at their base. The clutch moves between grooves in the gearbox, to engage and disengage the wing muscles and also modulate the wingbeat amplitude. When the amplitude of the left wing is less than the right, the fly will make a left turn. Even though haltere movement is controlled by separate muscles than the wings, because the wings are mechanically coupled with the halteres, changes in wingbeat frequency extend to the haltere-beat frequency as well, but haltere beat amplitude does not change.

Although halteres are coupled with the wings and with each other during flight, some flies oscillate their halteres while walking (without oscillating their wings). Because the haltere muscles are tiny in comparison to the flight muscles, flight muscle activity completely overshadows that of the haltere muscles during flight. It is unknown how haltere muscle activity during flight differs from walking. The left and right halteres show much more variable phase relationships while walking compared with flying, which may indicate decoupling of the left and right haltere muscles.

===Differences between species===

Although halteres are always synchronized with the movements of the wings, the phase at which they oscillate differs between species. Brachyceran flies (short-antennaed) oscillate their halteres almost exactly opposite their wings (180 degrees). More ancient suborders such as the Nematocerans (long-antennaed flies), which for example include crane flies and mosquitoes, exhibit a variety of wing-haltere phasing. These observed differences in wing-haltere coordination suggest that differences in sensory neuron output also exist between species. This means that the decoding mechanisms used by the central nervous system to interpret such movements and produce adequate motor output probably also vary depending on phylogeny.

==Morphology==

The general structure of halteres are well recognized, but much variability exists between species. The more ancient family groups, such as Tipuloidea (crane flies), possess halteres with rather long stalks. This causes the haltere bulbs to be much further from the body and easily visible to the naked eye. More derived families, such as Calliphoridae (blow flies), have developed specialized structures called &quot;calyptrae&quot; or &quot;squama&quot;, which are tiny flaps of wing, that cover the haltere. Pringle (1948) hypothesized that they prevented wind turbulence from affecting haltere movements, allowing more precise detection of body position, but this was never tested. The stalk of the haltere is also not always straight. Instead, the stalk&#x27;s shape in more derived families tends to be reflective of the body shape of the individual. This minimizes the amount of air space between end-knobs and the sides of the abdomen and thorax. In these families, the halteres beat so close to the body that the distance between haltere and thorax is a fraction of the diameter of the haltere bulb. An extreme example of this trait is in the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), where the bulb of the haltere is positioned nearly perpendicular to the stalk.

Flies typically hold their halteres at a 90-degree offset. To visualize this, if you were to imagine a person holding their arms out sideways, this would be a 180-degree offset. If that person then moved their arms backward so that the angle created between their fingertips and spine was 90 degrees, this would be a 90-degree offset. The halteres of flies work the same way. They are positioned behind their bodies, forming a 90-degree angle between the haltere bulbs and the center of their thorax. It is necessary for the halteres to be positioned like this in order to detect the three axes of motion. Those axes are yaw, pitch and roll, as illustrated in the above figure (Directions of rotation). The mechanoreceptors at the base of the halteres are only able to measure force in two directions (horizontal and vertical), so a single haltere is only able to measure rotations along two of the three axes. Because the halteres are set at different angles (90-degree offset), they also beat along two separate horizontal and vertical axes. This gives them the ability to acquire information from two non-parallel planes and allows sensation of rotation in all three directions. However, flies are most sensitive to pitch.
===Neurophysiology===

When halteres are experimentally induced to flap, volleys of action potentials within the haltere nerve occur in synchrony with the haltere-beat frequency. When flies are then rotated, these volleys break down, likely in response to different groups of sensilla being activated to inform the fly of its recently changed body position. Haltere afferents have also been shown to terminate in the mesothoracic neuropil where flight muscle neurons are located. Haltere afferent activity responding to rotations and wing steering behavior converge in this processing region.

====The haltere nerve====

Sensory inputs from five sensory fields located at the base of the haltere all converge onto one nerve, the haltere nerve. How these sensory fields are organized at the level of the central nervous system is currently unknown. It has been determined that those five sensory fields all project to the thorax in a &quot;region-specific&quot; way and afferents originating from the forewing were also shown to converge in the same regions. Not every specific target for the haltere afferents have been determined, but a few connections between motor neurons known to be involved in wing steering control and particular haltere sensory fields have been identified, particularly one synapse between the haltere nerve and a wing steering motor neuron known as mnb1.

===Muscles===

Flies use indirect flight muscles to accomplish wing movement, and the beating haltere movements are driven by the same group of muscles (see dynamics section). In addition to the indirect flight muscles which are responsible for the flapping motion, there are also steering muscle which control the rotation/angle of the wings. Because halteres evolved from hindwings, the same complement of steering muscles exists for the other directions of movement as well. Chan &quot;et al.&quot; (1998) identified 10 direct control muscles in the haltere similar to those found in the forewing. In 1998, Chan and Dickinson proposed that the planned haltere movements (without external forces acting on them) were what initiated planned turns. To explain this, imagine a fly that wishes to turn to the right. Unfortunately, as soon as it does, the halteres sense a body rotation and reflexively correct the turn, preventing the fly from changing direction. Chan and Dickinson (1998) suggested that what the fly does to prevent this from occurring is to first move its halteres as if it were being pushed in the opposite direction that it wants to go. The fly has not moved, but the halteres have sensed a perturbation. This would allow the haltere-initiated reflex to occur, correcting the imagined perturbation. The fly would then be able to execute its turn in the desired direction. This is not how flies actually turn. Mureli and Fox (2015) showed that flies are still capable of performing planned turns even when their halteres have been removed entirely.
===Campaniform sensilla===

The way in which rotation sensation is accomplished is that there are five distinct sensory fields located at the base of the haltere. These fields, which actually contain the majority of campaniform sensilla found on the exoskeleton of blowflies (more than 400 campaniform sensilla per haltere), are activated in response to strain created by movements at the haltere base in different directions (due to Coriolis forces acting on the end knobs). Campaniform sensilla are cap-shaped protrusions located on the surface of the exoskeleton (cuticle) of insects. Attached inside the cap is the tip of a dendritic projection (or sensory nerve fiber). The outer segment of the dendritic projection is attached to the inside surface of the cap. When the haltere is pushed to one side, the cuticle of the insect bends and the surface of the cap is distorted. The inner dendrite is able to detect this distortion and convert it to an electrical signal which is sent to the central nervous system to be interpreted.

===Chordotonal organs===

Chordotonal organs detect and transmit distortions in their position/shape in the same way that campaniform sensilla do. They differ slightly at their site of detection. Chordotonal organs, unlike campaniform sensilla, exist beneath the cuticle and typically respond to stretch as opposed to distortion or bending. Their sensory nerve endings attach between two internal points and when those points are stretched, the difference in length is what is detected and transformed into electrical signaling. There are far fewer chordotonal organs at the base of the haltere than campaniform sensilla (on the order of hundreds), so it is assumed that they are far less important for detecting and transmitting rotational information from haltere movements.

==Role in visual processing==

===Head stabilization===
Insect eyes are unable to move independently of the head. In order for flies to stabilize their visual fields, they must adjust the position of their entire head. Sensory inputs detected by halteres not only determine the position of the body, but also, the position of the head, which can move independently from the body. Halteres are particularly useful for detecting fast perturbations during flight and only respond to angular velocities (speeds of rotation) above a certain threshold. When flies are focused on an object in front of them and their body is rotated, they are able to maintain their head position so that the object remains focused and upright. Hengstenberg (1988) found that in the roll direction of rotation, the flies&#x27; ability to maintain their head position in response to body motion was only observed at speeds above 50 degrees per second and their ability peaked at 1500 degrees per second. When halteres were removed at the bulb (to retain intact sensory organs at the base) the fly&#x27;s ability to perceive roll movements at high angular velocities disappeared.

Halteres and vision both play a role in stabilizing the head. Flies are also able to perform compensatory head movements to stabilize their vision without the use of their halteres. When the visual field is artificially rotated around a fly at slower angular velocities, head stabilization still occurs. Head stabilization outputs due to optical inputs alone are slower to respond, but also last longer than those due to haltere inputs. From this result it can be concluded that although halteres are required for detecting fast rotations, the visual system is adept by itself at sensing and correcting for slower body movements. Thus, the visual and mechanosensory (halteres) systems work together to stabilize the visual field of the animal: first, by quickly responding to fast changes (halteres), and second, by maintaining that response until it is corrected (vision).

===Visual-motor integration===

Flies rely on both visual information from their compound eyes and mechanical input from their halteres. Sherman and Dickinson (2002) discovered that the responsiveness of the halteres and eyes are tuned to complementary speeds of rotation. Responses to body rotations detected via the visual system are greatest at slow speeds and decrease with increased angular velocity. In contrast, body rotations detected by the halteres elicit the greatest responses at higher angular velocities and degrade as the speed of rotation decreases. The integration of these two separately tuned sensors allows the flies to detect a wide range of angular velocities in all three directions of rotation.

Two main aspects of the visual field have been used to study fly vision, figure and background. Figures are the objects that the fly is focused on and background represents everything else. When haltere bulbs are removed from tethered flying flies, they are still able to track moving figures, but they struggle to stabilize moving backgrounds. If a static figure is placed in the field of view of a fly, its ability to stabilize a moving background is restored. This indicates that although halteres are not required for motion vision processing, they do contribute to it in a context-dependent manner, even when the behavior is separated from body rotations. Context determines whether the fly will use its halteres or vision as the primary source of body/head position information.

==Non-flying haltere activity==
The necessity of halteres in flight has been well documented, yet little is known about their use in other behaviors such as walking. Certain flies in the families Muscidae, Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Micropezidae have been documented to oscillate their wings while walking in addition to during flight. The oscillation of the haltere is similar in amplitude and frequency during walking and flight for these flies, and the halteres always oscillate when walking or when flying. All other families of Diptera never oscillate their halteres while walking, but always do so while flying. Flesh flies are among those that oscillate their halteres while walking, and also perform more poorly at certain walking tasks when their halteres are removed. In contrast, fruit flies, which do not oscillate their halteres when walking, do not exhibit any differences in ability when their halteres are removed. This indicates that haltere inputs are behaviorally relevant to those species which oscillate them while walking and that they aid those individuals in walking behavior. Flies in the Calyptratae clade which include common flies like house flies, blow flies, and flesh flies also use their halteres during takeoff, whereas non-Calyptratae flies do not. Calyptratae flies are able to take off around five times faster than other flies. Calyptratae flies lacking halteres take a lot longer to become airborne, but takeoff time is not affected in non-Calyptratae flies without halteres. Stability during takeoff also suffers with haltere removal, but only in Calyptratae flies.

<doc id="46083" wikidata="Q23054" url="?curid=46083" title="Halley's Comet">
<text>Halley&#x27;s Comet is a short-period comet that is consistently visible to the naked eye from Earth, appearing every 72–80 years, though with the majority of recorded apparations (25 of 30) occurring after 75–77 years. It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061. Officially designated 1P/Halley, it is also commonly called Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley. 

Halley&#x27;s periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC, but it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet. As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley.

During its 1986 visit to the inner Solar System, Halley&#x27;s Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by a spacecraft, &quot;Giotto&quot;, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported several longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple&#x27;s &quot;dirty snowball&quot; model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices—such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia—and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.

==Pronunciation==
Comet Halley is usually pronounced , rhyming with &quot;valley&quot;, or sometimes , rhyming with &quot;daily&quot;. As to the surname Halley, Colin Ronan, one of Edmond Halley&#x27;s biographers, preferred , rhyming with &quot;crawly&quot;. Spellings of Halley&#x27;s name during his lifetime included &quot;Hailey&quot;, &quot;Haley&quot;, &quot;Hayley&quot;, &quot;Halley&quot;, &quot;Haly&quot;, &quot;Hawley&quot;, and &quot;Hawly&quot;, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain, but the version rhyming with &quot;valley&quot; seems to be preferred by current bearers of the surname.

==Computation of orbit==
Halley was the first comet to be recognised as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. This idea was disproven in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System. In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton&#x27;s Comet), he was initially unable to completely reconcile comets into his model.
Ultimately, it was Newton&#x27;s friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 &quot;Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets&quot;, used Newton&#x27;s new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits. Having compiled a list of 24 comet observations, he calculated that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets that had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler). Halley thus concluded that all three comets were the same object returning about every 76 years, a period that has since been found to vary between 72 and 80 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758. He had personally observed the comet around perihelion in September 1682, but died in 1742 before he could observe its predicted return.

Halley&#x27;s prediction of the comet&#x27;s return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. Other observers from throughout Europe and its colonies sent confirmations to Paris after the comet brightened early the following year. In the Americas, John Winthrop lectured at Harvard University to explain the implications of the comet&#x27;s reappearance for Newtonian mechanics and natural theology.

Another independent recognition that the comet had returned was made by the Jamaican astronomer Francis Williams, but his observations did not reach Europe. A unique portrait commissioned by Williams demonstrates the impact of the comet&#x27;s return on period astronomers. Williams&#x27; hand rests on the page of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; with procedures to predict comet sightings. The white smudge in the sky is probably a depiction of Halley&#x27;s comet relative to the constellations in March 1759, and the chord hanging above the book likely represents the comet&#x27;s orbit. In 2024, using X-ray imaging, the painting was shown to depict the field of stars in which the comet would have been visible in 1759. Williams likely commissioned the portrait to commemorate his observations.

The comet did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a delay of 618 days. This effect was computed before its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet&#x27;s return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley&#x27;s honour by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1759.

Some scholars have proposed that first-century Mesopotamian astronomers already had recognised Halley&#x27;s Comet as periodic. This theory notes a passage in the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Horayot that refers to &quot;a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err&quot;. It has also been suggested that the passage may have referred to the variable star Mira, whose brightness oscillates in a period of sixty years.

Researchers in 1981 attempting to calculate the past orbits of Halley by numerical integration starting from accurate observations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could not produce accurate results further back than 837 owing to a close approach to Earth in that year. It was necessary to use ancient Chinese comet observations to constrain their calculations.

==Orbit and origin==

Halley&#x27;s orbital period has varied between 74 and 80 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, the point in the comet&#x27;s orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is . This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is , roughly the orbital distance of Pluto. Unlike the overwhelming majority of objects in the Solar System, Halley&#x27;s orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun&#x27;s north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. This is usually represented as 162°, to account for Halley&#x27;s retrograde orbit. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of . Because its orbit comes close to Earth&#x27;s in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October.

Halley is classified as a &quot;periodic&quot; or &quot;short-period comet&quot;: one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less. This contrasts it with long-period comets, whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic comets have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley&#x27;s orbit is atypical. Most short-period comets (those with orbital periods shorter than 20 years and inclinations of 30 degrees or less) are called Jupiter-family comets. Those resembling Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets. , 105 Halley-type comets have been observed, compared with 816 identified Jupiter-family comets.

The orbits of the Halley-type comets suggest that they were originally long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by the gravity of the giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies around 20,000–50,000 au from the Sun. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 au (Neptune&#x27;s orbit) and 50 au from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley&#x27;s was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.

Halley has probably been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, although it is not possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion passage of four days on average.

In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitold Vecheslavov performed an analysis of 46 apparitions of Halley&#x27;s Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations, which showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley&#x27;s projected dynamical lifetime is estimated to be about 10 million years. The dynamics of its orbit can be approximately described by a two-dimensional symplectic map, known as the Kepler map, a solution to the restricted three-body problem for highly eccentric orbits. Based on records from the 1910 apparition, David Hughes calculated in 1985 that Halley&#x27;s nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80 to 90% over the last 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions, and that it will most likely disappear completely after another 2,300 perihelion passages. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, within the next few tens of thousands of years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years.

==Structure and composition==

The &quot;Giotto&quot; and &quot;Vega&quot; missions gave planetary scientists their first view of Halley&#x27;s surface and structure. The nucleus is a conglomerate of ices and dust, often referred to as a &quot;dirty snowball&quot;. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other ices) begin to sublimate from the surface. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, at distances up to from the nucleus. Sublimation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionised by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma&#x27;s ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100 million kilometres into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.

Despite the vast size of its coma, Halley&#x27;s nucleus is relatively small: barely long, wide and perhaps thick. Based on a reanalysis of images taken by the &quot;Giotto&quot; and &quot;Vega&quot; spacecraft, Lamy et al. determined an effective diameter of . Its shape has been variously compared to that of a peanut, a potato, or an avocado. Its mass is roughly 2.2 kg, with an average density of about . The low density indicates that it is made of a large number of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a structure known as a rubble pile. Ground-based observations of coma brightness suggested that Halley&#x27;s rotation period was about 7.4 days. Images taken by the various spacecraft, along with observations of the jets and shell, suggested a period of 52 hours. Given the irregular shape of the nucleus, Halley&#x27;s rotation is likely to be complex. The flyby images revealed an extremely varied topography, with hills, mountains, ridges, depressions, and at least one crater.

Halley&#x27;s day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapour, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles were found to be primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles ranged in size down to the limits of detection (≈0.001 μm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth&#x27;s ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley&#x27;s deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth&#x27;s oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth&#x27;s water.

&quot;Giotto&quot; provided the first evidence in support of Fred Whipple&#x27;s &quot;dirty snowball&quot; hypothesis for comet construction; Whipple postulated that comets are icy objects warmed by the Sun as they approach the inner Solar System, causing ices on their surfaces to sublime (change directly from a solid to a gas), and jets of volatile material to burst outward, creating the coma. &quot;Giotto&quot; showed that this model was broadly correct, though with modifications. Halley&#x27;s albedo, for instance, is about 4%, meaning that it reflects only 4% of the sunlight hitting it – about what one would expect for coal. Thus, despite astronomers predicting that Halley would have an albedo of about 0.17 (roughly equivalent to bare soil), Halley&#x27;s Comet is in fact pitch black. The &quot;dirty ices&quot; on the surface sublime at temperatures between in sections of higher albedo to at low albedo; &quot;Vega 1&quot; found Halley&#x27;s surface temperature to be in the range . This suggested that only 10% of Halley&#x27;s surface was active, and that large portions of it were coated in a layer of dark dust that retained heat. Together, these observations suggested that Halley was in fact predominantly composed of non-volatile materials, and thus more closely resembled a &quot;snowy dirtball&quot; than a &quot;dirty snowball&quot;.

==History==
===Before 1066===
The first certain appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet in the historical record is a description from 240 BC, in the Chinese chronicle &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; or &quot;Shiji&quot;, which describes a comet that appeared in the east and moved north. The only surviving record of the 164 BC apparition is found on two fragmentary Babylonian tablets, which were rediscovered in August 1984 in the collection of the British Museum.

The apparition of 87 BC was recorded in Babylonian tablets which state that the comet was seen &quot;day beyond day&quot; for a month. This appearance may be recalled in the representation of Tigranes the Great, an Armenian king who is depicted on coins with a crown that features, according to Vahe Gurzadyan and R. Vardanyan, &quot;a star with a curved tail [that] may represent the passage of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 87 BC.&quot; Gurzadyan and Vardanyan argue that &quot;Tigranes could have seen Halley&#x27;s Comet when it passed closest to the Sun on August 6 in 87 BC&quot; as the comet would have been a &quot;most recordable event&quot;; for ancient Armenians it could have heralded the New Era of the brilliant King of Kings.

The apparition of 12 BC was recorded in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; by Chinese astronomers of the Han dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16 au of Earth. According to the Roman historian Cassius Dio, a comet appeared suspended over Rome for several days portending the death of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in that year. Halley&#x27;s appearance in 12 BC, only a few years distant from the conventionally assigned date of the birth of Jesus Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus&#x27;s birth.

If Yehoshua ben Hananiah&#x27;s reference to &quot;a star which arises once in seventy years and misleads the sailors&quot; refers to Halley&#x27;s Comet, he can only have witnessed the 66 AD appearance. Another possible report comes from Jewish historian Josephus, who wrote that in 66 AD &quot;The signs ... were so evident, and did so plainly foretell their future desolation ... there was a star resembling a sword, which stood over the city, and a comet, that continued a whole year&quot;. This portent was in reference to the city of Jerusalem and the First Jewish–Roman War.

The 141 AD apparition was recorded in Chinese chronicles, with observations of a bluish white comet on 27 March and 16, 22 and 23 April. The early Tamil bards of southern India (c. 1st - 4th century CE) also describe a certain relatable event.

The 374 AD and 607 approaches each came within 0.09 au of Earth. The 451 AD apparition was said to herald the defeat of Attila the Hun at the Battle of Chalons.

The 684 AD apparition was reported in Chinese records as the &quot;broom star&quot;.

The 760 AD apparition was recorded in the &quot;Zuqnin Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s entry for &quot;iyyōr&quot; 1071 SE (May 760 AD), calling it a &quot;white sign&quot;:

In 837 AD, Halley&#x27;s Comet may have passed as close as from Earth, by far its closest approach. Its tail may have stretched 60 degrees across the sky. It was recorded by astronomers in China, Japan, Germany, the Byzantine Empire, and the Middle East; Emperor Louis the Pious observed this appearance and devoted himself to prayer and penance, fearing that &quot;by this token a change in the realm and the death of a prince are made known&quot;.

In 912 AD, Halley is recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, which states &quot;A dark and rainy year. A comet appeared.&quot;

===1066===

In 1066, the comet was seen in England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings and William the Conqueror claimed the throne. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus, and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10 au of Earth at that time.

This appearance of the comet is also noted in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Eilmer of Malmesbury may have seen Halley in 989 and 1066, as recorded by William of Malmesbury:

Not long after, a comet, portending (they say) a change in governments, appeared, trailing its long flaming hair through the empty sky: concerning which there was a fine saying of a monk of our monastery called Æthelmær. Crouching in terror at the sight of the gleaming star, &quot;You&#x27;ve come, have you?&quot;, he said. &quot;You&#x27;ve come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.&quot;

The Irish &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; recorded the comet as &quot;A star [that] appeared on the seventh of the Calends of May, on Tuesday after Little Easter, than whose light the brilliance or light of The Moon was not greater; and it was visible to all in this manner till the end of four nights afterwards.&quot; Chaco Native Americans in New Mexico may have recorded the 1066 apparition in their petroglyphs.

The Italo-Byzantine chronicle of Lupus the Protospatharios mentions that a &quot;comet-star&quot; appeared in the sky in the year 1067 (the chronicle is erroneous, as the event occurred in 1066, and by Robert he means William).

The Emperor Constantine Ducas died in the month of May, and his son Michael received the Empire. And in this year there appeared a comet star, and the Norman count Robert [sic] fought a battle with Harold, King of the English, and Robert was victorious and became king over the people of the English.

===1145–1378===
The 1145 apparition may have been recorded by the monk Eadwine.

According to legend, Genghis Khan was inspired to turn his conquests toward Europe by the westward-seeming trajectory of the 1222 apparition. In Korea, the comet was reportedly visible during the daylight on 9 September 1222.

The 1301 apparition was visually spectacular, and may be the first that resulted in convincing portraits of a particular comet. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani wrote that the comet left &quot;great trails of fumes behind&quot;, and that it remained visible from September 1301 until January 1302. It was seen by the artist Giotto di Bondone, who represented the Star of Bethlehem as a fire-coloured comet in the Nativity section of his Arena Chapel cycle, completed in 1305. Giotto&#x27;s depiction includes details of the coma, a sweeping tail, and the central condensation. According to the art historian Roberta Olson, it is much more accurate than other contemporary descriptions, and was not equaled in painting until the 19th century. Olson&#x27;s identification of Halley&#x27;s Comet in Giotto&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; is what inspired the European Space Agency to name their mission to the comet &quot;Giotto&quot;, after the artist.

Halley&#x27;s 1378 appearance is recorded in the &quot;Annales Mediolanenses&quot; as well as in East Asian sources.

===1456===

In 1456, the year of Halley&#x27;s next apparition, the Ottoman Empire invaded the Kingdom of Hungary, culminating in the siege of Belgrade in July of that year. In a papal bull, Pope Callixtus III ordered special prayers be said for the city&#x27;s protection. In 1470, the humanist scholar Bartolomeo Platina wrote in his &quot;&quot; that,

A hairy and fiery star having then made its appearance for several days, the mathematicians declared that there would follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He would turn all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.

Platina&#x27;s account is not mentioned in official records. In the 18th century, a Frenchman further embellished the story, in anger at the Church, by claiming that the Pope had &quot;excommunicated&quot; the comet, though this story was most likely his own invention.

Halley&#x27;s apparition of 1456 was also witnessed in Kashmir and depicted in great detail by Śrīvara, a Sanskrit poet and biographer to the Sultans of Kashmir. He read the apparition as a cometary portent of doom foreshadowing the imminent fall of Sultan Zayn al-Abidin (AD 1418/1420–1470).

After witnessing a bright light in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley&#x27;s Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr. City of Light) and made it his capital for the remainder of his reign.

===1531-1759===
Petrus Apianus and Girolamo Fracastoro described the comet&#x27;s visit in 1531, with the former even including graphics in his publication. Through his observations, Apianus was able to prove that a comet&#x27;s tail always points away from the Sun.

In the Sikh scriptures of the Guru Granth Sahib, the founder of the faith Guru Nanak makes reference to &quot;a long star that has risen&quot; at Ang 1110, and it is believed by some Sikh scholars to be a reference to Halley&#x27;s appearance in 1531.

Halley&#x27;s periodic returns have been subject to scientific investigation since the 16th century. The three apparitions from 1531 to 1682 were noted by Edmond Halley, enabling him to predict it would return. One key breakthrough occurred when Halley talked with Newton about his ideas of the laws of motion. Newton also helped Halley get John Flamsteed&#x27;s data on the 1682 apparition. By studying data on the 1531, 1607, and 1682 comets, he came to the conclusion these were the same comet, and presented his findings in 1696.

One difficulty was accounting for variations in the comet&#x27;s orbital period, which was over a year longer between 1531 and 1607 than it was between 1607 and 1682. Newton had theorised that such delays were caused by the gravity of other comets, but Halley found that Jupiter and Saturn would cause the appropriate delays. In the decades that followed, more refined mathematics would be worked on, notable by Paris Observatory; the work on Halley also provided a boost to Newton and Kepler&#x27;s rules for celestial motions. (See also computation of orbit.)

===1835===
At Markree Observatory in Ireland, Edward Joshua Cooper used a Cauchoix of Paris lens telescope with an aperture of to sketch Halley&#x27;s comet in 1835. The same apparition was sketched by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. Observations of streams of vapour prompted Bessel to propose that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet&#x27;s orbit.
An interview in 1910, of someone who was a teenager at the time of the 1835 apparition had this to say:

They go on to describe the comet&#x27;s tail as being more broad and not as long as the comet of 1843 they had also witnessed.

Famous astronomers across the world made observations starting August 1835, including Struve at Dorpat observatory, and Sir John Herschel, who made of observations from the Cape of Good Hope. In the United States telescopic observations were made from Yale College. The new observations helped confirm early appearances of this comet including its 1456 and 1378 apparitions.

At Yale College in Connecticut, the comet was first reported on 31 August 1835 by astronomers D. Olmstead and E. Loomis. In Canada reports were made from Newfoundland and also Quebec. Reports came in from all over by later 1835, and often reported in newspapers of this time in Canada.

Several accounts of the 1835 apparition were made by observers who survived until the 1910 return, where increased interest in the comet led to their being interviewed.

The time to Halley&#x27;s return in 1910 would be only 74.42 years, one of the shortest known periods of its return, which is calculated to be as long as 79 years owing to the effects of the planets.

At Paris Observatory Halley&#x27;s Comet 1835 apparition was observed with a Lerebours telescope of aperture by the astronomer François Arago. Arago recorded polarimetric observations of Halley, and suggested that the tail might be sunlight reflecting off a sparsely distributed material; he had earlier made similar observations of Comet Tralles of 1819.

===1910===

The 1910 approach, which came into naked-eye view around 10 April and came to perihelion on 20 April, was notable for several reasons: it was the first approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 au, making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet. One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen, which led press to misquote the astronomer Camille Flammarion by stating he claimed that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas &quot;would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet&quot;. Despite reassurances from scientists that the gas would not inflict harm on Earth, the damage had already been done with members of the public panic buying gas masks and quack &quot;anti-comet pills&quot;.

The comet added to the unrest in China on the eve of the Xinhai Revolution that would end the last dynasty in 1911. As James Hutson, a missionary in Sichuan Province at the time, recorded:

&quot;The people believe that it indicates calamity such as war, fire, pestilence, and a change of dynasty. In some places on certain days the doors were unopened for half a day, no water was carried and many did not even drink water as it was rumoured that pestilential vapour was being poured down upon the earth from the comet.&quot;

The 1910 visitation coincided with a visit from Hedley Churchward, the first known English Muslim to make the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. His explanation of its scientific predictability did not meet with favour in the Holy City.

The comet was used in an advertising campaign of Le Bon Marché, a well-known department store in Paris.

The comet was also fertile ground for hoaxes. One that reached major newspapers claimed that the Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma religious group, attempted to sacrifice a virgin to ward off the impending disaster, but were stopped by the police.

American satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet&#x27;s perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said,

I came in with Halley&#x27;s comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don&#x27;t go out with Halley&#x27;s comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: &quot;Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.&quot;

Twain died on 21 April 1910, the day following the comet&#x27;s subsequent perihelion. The 1985 fantasy film &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; was inspired by the quotation.

Halley&#x27;s 1910 apparition is distinct from the Great Daylight Comet of 1910, which surpassed Halley in brilliance and was visible in broad daylight for a short period, approximately four months before Halley made its appearance.

===1986===

The 1986 apparition of Halley&#x27;s Comet was the least favourable on record. In February 1986, the comet and the Earth were on opposite sides of the Sun, creating the worst possible viewing circumstances for Earth observers during the previous 2,000 years. Halley&#x27;s closest approach was 0.42 au. Additionally, increased light pollution from urbanisation caused many people to fail in attempts to see the comet. With the help of binoculars, observation from areas outside cities was more successful. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April 1986, with best opportunities occurring when the comet could be sighted close to the horizon at dawn and dusk, if not obscured by clouds.

The approach of the comet was first detected by astronomers David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1 m Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera.

The first visual observation of the comet on its 1986 return was by an amateur astronomer, Stephen James O&#x27;Meara, on 24 January 1985. O&#x27;Meara used a home-built telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. The first to observe Halley&#x27;s Comet with the naked eye during its 1986 apparition were Stephen Edberg (then serving as the coordinator for amateur observations at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris on 8 November 1985.

The 1986 apparition gave scientists the opportunity to study the comet closely, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet &quot;Vega 1&quot; probe began returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, captured the first-ever image of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March. It was followed by the &quot;Vega 2&quot; probe, making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the &quot;Giotto&quot; space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet&#x27;s nucleus. There also were two Japanese probes, &quot;Suisei&quot; and &quot;Sakigake&quot;. Unofficially, the numerous probes became known as the Halley Armada.

Based on data retrieved by the largest ultraviolet space telescope of the time, &quot;Astron&quot;, in December 1985, a group of Soviet scientists developed a model of the comet&#x27;s coma. The comet also was observed from space by the &quot;International Cometary Explorer&quot; (ICE). Originally launched as the &quot;International Sun-Earth Explorer 3&quot;, the spacecraft was renamed, and departed the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in 1982 in order to intercept the comets 21P/Giacobini-Zinner and Halley. ICE flew through the tail of Halley&#x27;s Comet, coming within about of the nucleus on 28 March 1986.

Two U.S. Space Shuttle missions—STS-51-L and STS-61-E—had been scheduled to observe Halley&#x27;s Comet from low Earth orbit. The STS-51-L mission carried the &quot;Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy&quot; (Spartan Halley) satellite, also called the &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet Experiment Deployable&quot; (HCED). The mission to capture the ultraviolet spectrum of the comet ended in disaster when the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disintegrated in flight, killing all seven astronauts onboard. Scheduled for March 1986, STS-61-E was a &quot;Columbia&quot; mission carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet, but the mission was cancelled following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and ASTRO-1 would not fly until late 1990 on STS-35.

In Japan, the comet was observed by Emperor Hirohito, who was 84. He had already seen it in 1910 when he was 8. He became one of the few people in human history to have seen Halley&#x27;s Comet on two different cycles.

===After 1986===
On 12 February 1991, at a distance of from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months. The comet released dust with a total mass of about 108 kg, which spread into an elongated cloud roughly by in size. The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from about magnitude 25 to magnitude 19. Comets rarely show outburst activity at distances beyond 5 au from the Sun. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the outburst, ranging from interaction with the solar wind to a collision with an undiscovered asteroid. The most likely explanation is a combination of two effects, the polymerisation of hydrogen cyanide and a phase transition of amorphous water ice, which raised the temperature of the nucleus enough for some of the more volatile compounds on its surface to sublime.

Halley was most recently observed in 2003 by three of the Very Large Telescopes at Paranal, Chile, when Halley&#x27;s magnitude was 28.2. The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet had ever been imaged, in order to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects. Astronomers are now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.

On 9 December 2023, Halley&#x27;s Comet reached the farthest and slowest point in its orbit from the Sun when it was travelling at with respect to the Sun.

=== 2061 ===
The next perihelion of Halley&#x27;s Comet is predicted for 28 July 2061, when it will be better positioned for observation than during the 1985–1986 apparition, as it will be on the same side of the Sun as Earth. The closest approach to Earth will be one day after perihelion. It is expected to have an apparent magnitude of −0.3, compared with only +2.1 for the 1986 apparition. On 9 September 2060, Halley will pass within of Jupiter, and then on 20 August 2061 will pass within of Venus.

===2134===
Halley will come to perihelion on 27 March 2134. Then on 7 May 2134, Halley will pass within of Earth. Its apparent magnitude is expected to be −2.0.

===Apparitions===
Halley&#x27;s calculations enabled the comet&#x27;s earlier appearances to be found in the historical record. The following table sets out the astronomical designations for every apparition of Halley&#x27;s Comet from 240 BC, the earliest documented sighting.

In the designations, &quot;1P/&quot; refers to Halley&#x27;s Comet; the first periodic comet discovered. The number represents the year, with negatives representing BC. The letter-number combination indicates which it was of the comets observed for a given segment of the year, divided into 24 equal parts. The Roman numeral indicates which comet past perihelion it was for a given year, while the lower-case letter indicates which comet it was for a given year overall. The perihelion dates farther from the present are approximate, mainly because of uncertainties in the modelling of non-gravitational effects. Perihelion dates of 1531 and earlier are in the Julian calendar, while perihelion dates 1607 and after are in the Gregorian calendar. The perihelion dates for some of the early apparitions (particularly before 837 AD) are uncertain by a couple of days. While Halley&#x27;s Comet usually peaks at around 0th magnitude, there are indications that the comet got considerably brighter than that in the past.

<text>An eared seal, otariid, or otary is any member of the marine mammal family Otariidae, one of three groupings of pinnipeds. They comprise 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans, the southern Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.

The words &quot;otariid&quot; and &quot;otary&quot; come from the Greek &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;little ear&quot;, referring to the small but visible external ear flaps (pinnae), which distinguishes them from the phocids.

Morphological and molecular evidence supports a monophyletic origin of pinnipeds, sharing a common ancestor with Musteloidea, though an earlier hypothesis suggested that Otаriidae are descended from a common ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Debate remains as to whether the phocids diverged from the otariids before or after the walrus.

Otariids arose in the Miocene (15–17 million years ago) in the North Pacific, diversifying rapidly into the Southern Hemisphere, where most species now live. The earliest known fossil otariid is &quot;Eotaria crypta&quot; from southern California, while the genus &quot;Callorhinus&quot; (northern fur seal) has the oldest fossil record of any living otariid, extending to the middle Pliocene. It probably arose from the extinct fur seal genus &quot;Thalassoleon&quot;.

Traditionally, otariids had been subdivided into the fur seal (Arctocephalinae) and sea lion (Otariinae) subfamilies, with the major distinction between them being the presence of a thick underfur layer in the former. Under this categorization, the fur seals comprised two genera: &quot;Callorhinus&quot; in the North Pacific with a single representative, the northern fur seal (&quot;C. ursinus&quot;), and eight species in the Southern Hemisphere under the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;; while the sea lions comprise five species under five genera. Recent analyses of the genetic evidence suggests that &quot;Callorhinus ursinus&quot; is in fact more closely related to several sea lion species. Furthermore, many of the Otariinae appear to be more phylogenetically distinct than previously assumed; for example, the Japanese sea lion (&quot;Zalophus japonicus&quot;) is now considered a separate species, rather than a subspecies of the California sea lion (&quot;Zalophus californius&quot;). 

In light of this evidence, the subfamily separation has been removed entirely and the family Otariidae has been organized into seven genera with 16 species and two subspecies.
Nonetheless, because of morphological and behavioral similarities among the &quot;fur seals&quot; and &quot;sea lions&quot;, these remain useful categories when discussing differences between groups of species. Compared to sea lions, fur seals are generally smaller, exhibit greater sexual dimorphism, eat smaller prey and go on longer foraging trips; and, of course, there is the contrast between the coarse short sea lion hair and the fur seal&#x27;s fur.
==Anatomy and appearance==
Otariids have proportionately much larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles than phocids, and have the ability to turn their hind limbs forward and walk on all fours, making them far more maneuverable on land. They are generally considered to be less adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, since they breed primarily on land and haul out more frequently than true seals. However, they can attain higher bursts of speed and have greater maneuverability in the water. Their swimming power derives from the use of flippers more so than the sinuous whole-body movements typical of phocids and walruses.

Otariids are further distinguished by a more dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, and the aforementioned visible external pinnae. Their postcanine teeth are generally simple and conical in shape. The dental formula for eared seals is: . Sea lions are covered with coarse guard hairs, while fur seals have a thick underfur, which has historically made them the objects of commercial exploitation.

Male otariids range in size from the Galápagos fur seal, smallest of all otariids, to the over 1,000-kg (2,200-lb) Steller sea lion. Mature male otariids weigh two to six times as much as females, with proportionately larger heads, necks, and chests, making them the most sexually dimorphic of all mammals.

==Behavior==
All otariids breed on land during well-defined breeding seasons. Except for the Australian sea lion, which has an atypical 17.5 month breeding cycle, they form strictly annual aggregations on beaches or rocky substrates, often on islands. All species are polygynous; i.e. successful males breed with several females. In most species, males arrive at breeding sites first and establish and maintain territories through vocal and visual displays and occasional fighting. Females typically arrive on shore a day or so before giving birth. While considered social animals, no permanent hierarchies or statuses are established on the colonies. The extent to which males control females or territories varies between species. Thus, the northern fur seal and the South American sea lion tend to herd specific harem-associated females, occasionally injuring them, while the Steller sea lion and the New Zealand sea lion control spatial territories, but do not generally interfere with the movement of the females. Female New Zealand sea lions are the only otrariids that move up to into forests to protect their pups during the breeding season.

Otariids are carnivorous, feeding on fish, squid and krill. Sea lions tend to feed closer to shore in upwelling zones, feeding on larger fish, while the smaller fur seals tend to take longer, offshore foraging trips and can subsist on large numbers of smaller prey items. They are visual feeders. Some females are capable of dives of up to .

Although the two subfamilies of otariids, the Otariinae (sea lions) and Arctocephalinae (fur seals), are still widely used, recent molecular studies have demonstrated that they may be invalid. Instead, they suggest three clades within the family; one consisting of the northern sea lions (&quot;Eumetopias&quot; and &quot;Zalophus&quot;), one of the northern fur seal (&quot;Callorhinus&quot;) and its extinct relatives, and the third of all the remaining Southern Hemisphere species.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pardubice&quot; is derived from the personal Polish name Porydęb. It was the name of the leader of the monks who came here from Poland. For the first time the name was recorded in the form of &quot;Pordobice&quot;.

==Geography==

Pardubice is located about east of Prague. The city lies at the confluence of the Elbe and Chrudimka rivers. There are several fishponds, artificial lakes and oxbow lakes of the Elbe in the municipal territory.

Pardubice is located in a predominantly flat agricultural lansdscape in the East Elbe Table, in the eastern part of the Polabí lowland. The highest point is the hill Stropinský vrch at above sea level, located on the southeastern municipal border.

===Climate===
Pardubice&#x27;s climate is classified as oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dcbo&quot;). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 29 December 1996 to on 28 July 2013.

==History==

The first written mention of Pardubice is from 1295, when Pope Boniface VIII took over the protection of the local Church of Saint Bartholomew with the order of Canons Regular of the Penitence of the Blessed Martyrs. In the first half of the 14th century, the settlement was acquired by a noble family, later known as Lords of Pardubice. In 1340, when Pardubice was inherited by Arnošt of Pardubice, it was first referred to as a city.

In 1491, Pardubice was bought by Vilém II of Pernštejn, who continued to expand the city and made significant impact on its prosperity. He chose Pardubice as the centre of his estate and began to build a city that corresponded to his status. The Pernštejn family had the entire historic centre with the Renaissance square built. They also had rebuilt the medieval castle into a comfortable fortified residence. In 1560, the Pernštejns were forced to sell the estate to Emperor Ferdinand I because of debts.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city was besieged by the army of General Lennart Torstensson, but was not conquered.

An important milestone in the history of the city was the year 1845, when the railway from Prague to Olomouc was finished. Pardubice became an important railway junction, which led to the development of the food, engineering and chemical industries, and subsequently the development of social and cultural life. In 1874, the Velká pardubická steeplechase horse race took place for the first time. In 1910, Jan Kašpar made here the first successful flight in Czech lands and a year later he made history by flying the first long-haul flight from Pardubice to Prague.

Until 1918, the city was part of Austria Hungary. The seat of the Pardubice district, it was one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

In the interwar period, Pardubice continued to develop until its heyday ended with the advent of World War II. During the war, the city was damaged by air strikes of the Allies, and the Fanto Werke refinery was repeatedly bombed during the oil campaign.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Pardubice is known as an industrial city. The dominant industries are chemical industry, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Tesla electronics manufacturer operated here in 1921–1989. In 2000, Foxconn established a production plant in its former premises. This electronics manufacturer is the largest employer in Pardubice.

Pardubice has a long tradition in the chemical industry. It is represented by the Paramo refinery, which was founded by David Fanto in 1889. Today it is owned by Orlen Unipetrol. In Pardubice-Semtín there are the companies Explosia (a manufacturer of explosives founded in 1920, which is associated with the invention of Semtex plastic explosive) and its subsidiary Synthesia (manufacturer of cellulose, pigments and dyes, and organic compounds, established in 1929).

For centuries, Pardubice have been known for the production of gingerbread. The gingerbread guild was established in the 16th century. The first factory was founded in 1913. Since 2008, Pardubice gingerbread is a protected geographical indication by the European Union.

==Transport==

Pardubice is located at the crossroads of three main roads: the I/2, which connects Pardubice with Prague; the I/36 from Pardubice to Rychnov nad Kněžnou District; and the I/37, which connects Hradec Králové with Žďár nad Sázavou and the D1 motorway.

Pardubice main railway station is an important railway junction. Pardubice has direct railway connection with many cities, including Prague, Brno, Olomouc, Ostrava and Liberec in the Czech Republic, Bratislava, Žilina and Košice in Slovakia, Budapest in Hungary, and Vienna and Graz in Austria. The territory of Pardubice is served by eight train stations and stops.

Pardubice is served by Pardubice Airport, which is used as both military and civilian international airport.

Intra-city transport is provided by the company Dopravní podnik města Pardubic a.s., which is owned by the city of Pardubice. In addition to buses, trolleybuses also provide intra-city transport. Trolleybus service was started in 1952. There are 12 trolleybus lines in operation.

==Education==
Pardubice is home to University of Pardubice. It was founded in 1950 as Chemical College and is mainly focused on fields historically associated with the city, such as the chemical industry and transportation.

==Sport==
The city was first represented in the top national football competition by SK Pardubice in the 1930s and 1940s. Later VCHZ Pardubice played in the top national league in the 1968–69 season. Nowadays the city is represented by FK Pardubice, which plays in the Czech First League. Women&#x27;s team plays in the Czech Women&#x27;s First League.

The ice hockey club HC Dynamo Pardubice plays in the Czech Extraliga. The team plays its home games at Enteria arena.

The basketball team is BK JIP Pardubice, playing in the National Basketball League.

Pardubice is also represented in the Czech rink bandy league.

Pardubice hosts two world-famous sporting events each year. The Velká pardubická steeplechase was first held in 1874 and is one of the most famous horse races in Europe. The second event is the Golden Helmet of Pardubice, a motorcycle speedway competition held at the Svítkov Stadium. The Golden Helmet has been run since 1929 is one of the oldest individual titles in world speedway. AMK Zlatá Přilba Pardubice is a speedway team that race at the Svítkov Stadium.

The Czech Open international chess and games festival has been held in Pardubice since 1990. The city was also known for the Czech Open in golf, but it was last held in 2011.

==Sights==
The landmark and symbol of Pardubice is the Green Gate as a remnant of the city&#x27;s fortifications. It is a Renaissance gate with a façade decorated by a relief designed by Mikoláš Aleš, which depicts the Lords of Pardubice. Behind the gate is a high tower that serves as a lookout tower. In its interior there is also an exposition with the history and legends of the city.

Pardubice Castle was built at the end of the 13th century and rebuilt in the Renaissance style at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. Massive fortifications are preserved around the castle. Today the castle houses the Museum of East Bohemia in Pardubice and Gallery of East Bohemia in Pardubice.

The original Church of Saint Bartholomew was built in 1295 and destroyed during the Hussite Wars. The today&#x27;s Church of Saint Bartholomew was built together with a monastery in 1507–1514. It was used as a burial place of the Pernštejn family. In the interior there is a valuable main altar with the painting &quot;The Passion of St. Bartholomew&quot; from 1692 by Michael Willmann and a painting decoration by Mikoláš Aleš.

The Church of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary was founded by Arnošt of Pardubice before 1359. Its present late Gothic and Renaissance appearance dates from the first half of the 16th century. Until 1786, the church belonged to a Minorite monastery, from which time there are extensive underground tombs under the church.

The House at Jonáš is one of the most treasured burgher houses in Pardubice. It was built after the fire that hit the city in 1507. It is known for its façade, decorated with a stucco relief from 1797, showing a biblical scene of a whale swallowing the prophet Jonah. The premises of the house are used by the Gallery of East Bohemia in Pardubice.

The Zámeček Memorial is a place of reverence that commemorates execution of 194 people in 1942. The place is a national cultural monument and at its centrepiece is a granite monument dating from 1949.

<doc id="46089" wikidata="Q167654" url="?curid=46089" title="Frans Hals">
<text>Frans Hals the Elder (, ; ; – 26 August 1666) was a Dutch Golden Age painter. He lived and worked in Haarlem, a city in which the local authority of the day frowned on religious painting in places of worship but citizens liked to decorate their homes with works of art. Hals was highly sought after by wealthy burgher commissioners of individual, married-couple, family, and institutional-group portraits. He also painted tronies for the general market.

There were two quite distinct schools of portraiture in 17th-century Haarlem: the neat (represented, for example, by Verspronck); and a looser, more painterly style at which Frans Hals excelled. Some of Hals&#x27;s portrait work is characterised by a subdued palette, reflecting the politely serious tones of his fashionable clients&#x27; wardrobe. In contrast, the personalities he paints are full of life, typically with a friendly glint in the eye or the glimmer of a smile on the lips.

Hals was born at Antwerp in the Spanish-occupied southern Netherlands, but because of the chaos wrought there by the Spanish at that time, his family moved to Haarlem when he was little. Many of his Haarlem clients were also émigrés from the South.

==Biography==
Hals was born in 1582 or 1583 in Antwerp, then in the Spanish Netherlands, as the son of cloth merchant Franchois Fransz Hals van Mechelen ( 1542–1610) and his second wife Adriaentje van Geertenryck. Like many, Hals&#x27;s parents fled during the Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585) from the south to Haarlem in the new Dutch Republic in the north, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Hals studied under Flemish émigré Karel van Mander, whose Mannerist influence, however, is barely noticeable in Hals&#x27;s work.

In 1610, Hals became a member of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke, and he started to earn money as an art restorer for the town council. He worked on their large art collection, which Karel van Mander had described in his &quot;Schilderboeck&quot; (&quot;Painter&#x27;s Book&quot;) published in Haarlem in 1604. The most notable works were those of Geertgen tot Sint Jans, Jan van Scorel, and Jan Mostaert that hung in the St John&#x27;s Church in Haarlem. The restoration work was paid for by the council. The council had confiscated all Catholic religious art in the &quot;Haarlemse Noon&quot;, although it did not formally possess the entire collection until 1625, when the city fathers had decided which were suitable for the town hall. The remaining art, which was considered too Roman Catholic, was sold to Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen, a fellow guild member, on condition that he remove it from Haarlem. It was in this cultural context that Hals began his career in portraiture, since the market had disappeared for religious themes.

The earliest known example of Hals&#x27;s art is the portrait of &quot;Jacobus Zaffius&quot; (1611). His &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; came with the life-sized group portrait &quot;The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616&quot;. His most famous sitter was &quot;René Descartes&quot;, whom he painted in 1649.

Frans Hals married his first wife Anneke Harmensdochter around 1610. Frans was of Catholic birth, however, so their marriage was recorded in the city hall and not in church. Unfortunately, the exact date is unknown because the older marriage records of the Haarlem city hall before 1688 have not been preserved. Anneke was born 2 January 1590 as the daughter of bleacher Harmen Dircksz and Pietertje Claesdr Ghijblant, and her maternal grandfather, linen producer Claes Ghijblant of Spaarne 42, bequeathed the couple the grave in the Grote Kerk church where both are buried, though Frans took over 40 years to join his first wife there. Anneke died in 1615, shortly after the birth of their third child and, of the three, Harmen survived infancy and one had died before Hals&#x27;s second marriage. 

As biographer Seymour Slive has pointed out, older stories of Hals abusing his first wife were confused with another Haarlem resident of the same name. Indeed, at the time of these charges, the artist had no wife to mistreat, as Anneke had died in May 1615. Similarly, historical accounts of Hals&#x27;s propensity for drink were largely based on embellished anecdotes of his early biographers like Arnold Houbraken; there is no direct evidence that Hals did drink heavily. After his first wife died, Hals took on the young daughter of a fishmonger to look after his children and, in 1617, he married Lysbeth Reyniers. They married in Spaarndam, a small village outside the banns of Haarlem, because she was already eight months pregnant. Hals was a devoted father, and they went on to have eight children.

Contemporaries such as Rembrandt moved their households according to the caprices of their patrons, but Hals remained in Haarlem and insisted that his customers come to him. According to the Haarlem archives, a schutterstuk that Hals started in Amsterdam was finished by Pieter Codde because Hals refused to paint in Amsterdam, insisting that the militiamen come to Haarlem to sit for their portraits. For this reason, we can be sure that all sitters were either from Haarlem or were visiting Haarlem when they had their portraits made.

Hals&#x27;s work was in demand through much of his life, but he lived so long that he eventually went out of style as a painter and experienced financial difficulties. In addition to his painting, he worked as a restorer, art dealer, and art tax expert for the city councilors. His creditors took him to court several times, and he sold his belongings to settle his debt with a baker in 1652. The inventory of the property seized mentions only three mattresses and bolsters, an armoire, a table, and five pictures (these were by himself, his sons, van Mander, and Maarten van Heemskerck). Left destitute, he was given an annuity of 200 florins in 1664 by the municipality.

The Dutch nation fought for independence during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and Hals was a member of the local schutterij, a military guild. He included a self-portrait in his 1639 painting of the St Joris company, according to its 19th-century painting frame. (It has not been possible to confirm this.) It was not common for ordinary members to be painted, as that privilege was reserved for the officers. Hals painted the company three times. He was also a member of a local chamber of rhetoric, and in 1644 he became chairman of the Guild of St Luke.

Frans Hals died in Haarlem in 1666 and was buried in the Grote Kerk church. He had been receiving a city pension, which was highly unusual and a sign of the esteem with which he was regarded. After his death, his widow applied for aid and was admitted to the local almshouse, where she later died.

==Artistic career==

Hals is best known for his portraits, mainly of wealthy citizens such as Pieter van den Broecke and Isaac Massa, whom he painted three times. He also painted large group portraits for local civic guards and for the regents of local hospitals. He was a Dutch Golden Age painter who practiced an intimate realism with a radically free approach. His pictures illustrate the various strata of society: banquets or meetings of officers, guildsmen, local councilmen from mayors to clerks, itinerant players and singers, gentlemen, fishwives, and tavern heroes. In his group portraits, such as &quot;The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627&quot;, Hals captures each character in a different manner. The faces are not idealized and are clearly distinguishable, with their personalities revealed in a variety of poses and facial expressions.

Hals was fond of daylight and silvery sheen, while Rembrandt used golden glow effects based upon artificial contrasts of low light in immeasurable gloom. Hals seized a moment in the life of his subjects with rare intuition. What nature displayed in that moment he reproduced thoroughly in a delicate scale of color and with mastery over every form of expression. He became so clever that exact tone, light and shade, and modeling were obtained with a few marked and fluid strokes of the brush. He became a popular portrait painter and painted the wealthy of Haarlem on special occasions. He won many commissions for wedding portraits (the husband is traditionally situated on the left, and the wife situated on the right). His double portrait of the newly married Olycans hang side by side in the Mauritshuis, but many of his wedding portrait pairs have since been split up and are rarely seen together.

==Wedding portraits==

The only record of his work in the first decade of his independent activity is an engraving by Jan van de Velde copied from the lost portrait of &quot;The Minister Johannes Bogardus&quot;. Early works by Hals show him as a careful draughtsman capable of great finish yet spirited, such as &quot;Two singing boys with a lute and a music book&quot; and &quot;Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia&quot; (1616). The flesh that he painted is pastose and burnished, less clear than it subsequently became. Later, he became more effective, displayed more freedom of hand and a greater command of effect.

During this period, he painted the full-length portrait of Madame van Beresteyn (Louvre) and a full-length portrait of Willem van Heythuysen posing with a sword. Both these pictures are equalled by the other &quot;Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia&quot; (with different portraits) and the &quot;same militia in 1627&quot; and &quot;Banquet of the Officers of the St Hadrian Militia&quot; of 1633. A similar painting with the date of 1639 suggests some study of Rembrandt masterpieces, and a similar influence is apparent in a group portrait of 1641 representing the regents of the St Elisabeth Gasthuis and in his 1639 portrait of Maria Voogt at Amsterdam.

From 1620 till 1640, he painted many double portraits of married couples on separate panels, the man on the left panel and his wife on the right panel. Only once did Hals portray a couple on a single canvas: &quot;Couple in a garden: Wedding portrait of Isaac Abrahamsz. Massa and Beatrix van der Laan&quot;, (, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).

His style changed throughout his life. Paintings of vivid color were gradually replaced by pieces where mostly black came to dominate. This was probably due to the sober dress of his Protestant sitters, more than any personal preference. One simple way to observe this change is to look at all of the portraits that he painted through the years with his trademark pose leaning over the back of a chair:
==Portrait painter==
Later in his life, his brush strokes became looser, fine detail becoming less important than the overall impression. His earlier pieces radiated gaiety and liveliness, while his later portraits emphasized the stature and dignity of the people portrayed. This austerity is displayed in &quot;Regents of the St Elizabeth Hospital&quot; in 1641 and, two decades later, &quot;The Regents&quot; and &quot;Regentesses of the Old Men&#x27;s Almshouse&quot; (), which are masterpieces of color, though in substance all but monochromes. His restricted palette is particularly noticeable in his flesh tints, which became greyer from year to year, until finally the shadows were painted in almost absolute black, as in the &quot;Tymane Oosdorp&quot;.

This tendency coincides with the period when Hals gained fewer commissions from the wealthy, and some historians have suggested that a reason for his predilection for black and white pigment was the low price of these colors as compared with the costly lakes and carmines. Both conclusions are probably correct, however, because Hals did not travel to his sitters, unlike his contemporaries, but let them come to him. This was good for business because he was exceptionally quick and efficient in his own well-fitted studio, but it was bad for business when Haarlem fell on hard times.

As a portrait painter, Hals had scarcely the psychological insight of a Rembrandt or Velázquez, though in a few works, like the &quot;Admiral de Ruyter&quot;, the &quot;Jacob Olycan&quot;, and the &quot;Albert van der Meer&quot; paintings, he reveals a searching analysis of character which has little in common with the instantaneous expression of his character portraits. In these, he generally sets upon the canvas the fleeting aspect of the various stages of merriment, from the subtle, half ironic smile that quivers round the lips of the curiously misnamed &quot;Laughing Cavalier&quot; to the grin of the &quot;Malle Babbe&quot;. To this group of pictures belong the &quot;Lute Player&quot;, the &quot;Gypsy Girl&quot; and the &quot;Laughing Fisherboy&quot;, whilst the &quot;Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen&quot; and the somewhat confused group of the &quot;Beresteyn Family&quot; at the Louvre show a similar tendency. Far less scattered in arrangement than this Beresteyn group, and in every respect one of the most masterly of Hals&#x27;s achievements is the group called &quot;The Painter and his Family&quot;, which was almost unknown until it appeared at the winter exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1906.

According to the Frans Hals catalogue raisonné, 1974, 222 known paintings can be ascribed to Hals. This list was compiled by Seymour Slive in 1970−1974 who also wrote an exhibition catalogue in 1989 and produced an update to his catalogue raisonné work in 2014. In 1989, another authority on Hals, Claus Grimm, disagreed with Slive and published a shorter &quot;œuvre&quot; of 145 paintings in his &quot;Frans Hals. Das Gesamtwerk&quot;.

It is not known whether Hals ever painted landscapes, still lifes or narrative pieces, but it is unlikely. His debut for Haarlem society in 1616 with his large group portrait for the St George militia shows all three disciplines, but if that painting was his signboard for future commissions, it seems he was subsequently only hired for portraits. Many artists in the 17th century in Holland opted to specialise, and Hals also appears to have been a pure portrait specialist.

==Painting technique==
Hals was a master of a technique that utilized something previously seen as a flaw in painting, the visible brushstroke. The soft curling lines of Hals&#x27;s brush are always clear upon the surface: &quot;materially just lying there, flat, while conjuring substance and space in the eye.&quot;
In this way his style was similar to Édouard Manet; in fact, Hals was described by author Raymond Cogniat as &quot;the Manet of his day.&quot; Lively and exciting, the technique can appear &quot;ostensibly slapdash&quot; – people often think that Hals &#x27;threw&#x27; his works &#x27;in one toss&#x27; (&quot;aus einem Guss&quot;) onto the canvas. This impression is not correct. Hals did occasionally paint without underdrawings or underpainting (&quot;alla prima&quot;), but most of the works were created in successive layers, as was customary at that time. Sometimes a drawing was made with chalk or paint on top of a grey or pink undercoat, and was then more or less filled in, in stages. It does seem that Hals usually applied his underpainting very loosely: he was a virtuoso from the beginning. This applies, of course, particularly to his genre works and his somewhat later, mature works. Hals displayed tremendous daring, great courage and virtuosity, and had a great capacity to pull back his hands from the canvas, or panel, at the moment of the most telling statement. He didn&#x27;t &#x27;paint them to death&#x27;, as many of his contemporaries did, in their great accuracy and diligence whether requested by their clients or not.

In the 17th century his first biographer, Schrevelius wrote: &quot;An unusual manner of painting, all his own, surpassing almost everyone,&quot; on Hals&#x27;s painting methods. For that matter, schematic painting was not Hals&#x27;s own idea (the approach already existed in 16th century Italy), and Hals was probably inspired by Flemish contemporaries, Rubens and Van Dyck, in his painting method. Haarlem resident Theodorus Schrevelius was struck by the vitality of Hals&#x27;s portraits which reflected &#x27;such power and life&#x27; that the painter &#x27;seems to challenge nature with his brush&#x27;.

==Influence==
Frans influenced his brother Dirck Hals (born at Haarlem, 1591–1656), who was also a painter. Additionally, five of his sons became painters:
*Harmen Hals (1611–1669)
*Frans Hals the Younger (1618–1669)
*Jan Hals (1620–1654)
*Reynier Hals (1627–1672)
*Nicolaes Hals (1628–1686)

Though most of his sons became portrait painters, some of them took up still-life painting or architectural studies and landscapes. Still lifes formerly attributed to his son Frans II have since been re-attributed to other painters, however. Hals painted a young woman reaching into a basket in a still life market scene by Claes van Heussen.

Other contemporary painters who took inspiration from Hals were, with the main cities they were based in:
*Jan Miense Molenaer (1609–1668), Haarlem and Amsterdam
*Judith Leyster (wife of Molenaer, 1609–1660), Haarlem and Amsterdam
*Adriaen van Ostade (1610–1685), Haarlem
*Adriaen Brouwer (1605–1638), mostly Antwerp
*Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck (1597–1662), Haarlem
*Bartholomeus van der Helst (1613–1670), Amsterdam
*Cornelis de Bie (1621–1664), Amsterdam

Hals had a large workshop in Haarlem and many students, though 19th century biographers questioned some of his pupils, since their painting styles were so dissimilar to Hals. In his &quot;De Groote Schouburgh&quot; (1718–21), Arnold Houbraken mentions Philips Wouwerman, Adriaen Brouwer, Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten, Adriaen van Ostade and Dirck van Delen as students. Vincent Laurensz van der Vinne was also a student, according to his diary with notes left by his son Laurens Vincentsz van der Vinne. Roestraten was not only a student (the Haarlem archives contain a notarised document, which supports this fact), but he also became a son-in-law of Hals when he married his daughter Adriaentje. The Haarlem portrait painter, Johannes Verspronck, one of about 10 competing portraitists in Haarlem at the time, possibly studied for some time with Hals.

In terms of style, the closest to Hals&#x27;s work is the handful of paintings that are ascribed to Judith Leyster, which she often signed. She also &#x27;qualifies&#x27; as a possible student, as does her husband, the painter Jan Miense Molenaer.

In the 19th century, his technique influenced the work of impressionists and realists including Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Charles-François Daubigny, Max Liebermann, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Gustave Courbet, and in the Netherlands, Jacobus van Looy and Isaac Israëls. Lovis Corinth named Hals as his biggest influence.

The Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo: &#x27;What a joy it is to see a Frans Hals, how different it is from the paintings – so many of them – where everything is carefully smoothed out in the same manner.&#x27; Hals chose not to give a smooth finish to his painting, as most of his contemporaries did, but mimicked the vitality of his subject by using smears, lines, spots, large patches of color and hardly any details.

==Legacy==

The 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has an article on Frans Hals by Paul George Konody, who observes: Hals&#x27;s reputation waned after his death and for two centuries he was held in such poor esteem that some of his paintings, which are now among the proudest possessions of public galleries, were sold at auction for a few pounds or even shillings. The portrait of Johannes Acronius realized five shillings at the Enschede sale in 1786. The &quot;Portrait of Willem van Heythuysen&quot; at the Alte Pinakothek sold in 1800 for £4: 5s (£4.25 in decimal notation).

Nevertheless, Hals&#x27;s art did not go altogether unappreciated in the time between his death in 1666 and the 1860s. In his &quot;Groote Schouburgh&quot; (1718–1721), Arnold Houbraken recorded Hals&#x27;s life and praised his style, adding that the figures in one of the large group portraits: &quot;... zoo kragtig en natuurlyk geschildert zyn, dat zy de aanschouwers schynen te willen aanspreken&quot; (&quot;... are painted so powerfully and naturally, they seem to want to talk to us&quot;). Dutch artists known to have admired Hals enough to make copies of his paintings include Cornelis van Noorde (1731–1795) and Wybrand Hendricks (1744–1831). Empress Catherine the Great (reigned 1762–1796) acquired ten Hals works for her collection. Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806) visited the Alte Pinakothek to copy Hals&#x27;s work, and Hals&#x27;s influence is apparent in Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;portraits de fantaisie&quot;. Antoine Watteau (1684–1721) made study sketches after Hals. At the Royal Academy in London, Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792) lectured on Hals in 1774, praising his handling of faces and the consequent remarkable individuality of his portraits. Reynolds was less enthusiastic about Hals&#x27;s characteristic loose finish, which he thought betrayed impatience. Subsequently, in 1781 Reynolds visited the Hals collection then at Haarlem Town Hall (now at the Frans Hals Museum) and soon after bought two Hals works. Reynolds&#x27;s biographer James Northcote (1736–1831), who was a fellow portraitist, remarked that Hals could have caught a bird in flight, grasping it, as it were, from life – something he said Titian would not have been capable of.

Starting at the middle of the 1860s his prestige rose again thanks to the efforts of critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger. With his rehabilitation in public esteem came the enormous rise in value, and, at the Secretan sale in 1889, the portrait of Pieter van den Broecke was bid up to 4,420 francs, while in 1908 the National Gallery paid £25,000 for the large family group from the collection of Lord Talbot de Malahide.

Hals&#x27;s work remains admired, particularly with young painters who can find many lessons about practical technique from his unconcealed brushstrokes. Hals&#x27;s works have found their way to countless cities all over the world and into museum collections. From the late 19th century, they were collected everywhere—from Antwerp to Toronto, and from London to New York. Many of his paintings were then sold to American collectors.

Several of his most important works are owned by the town council of Haarlem. They are now at the Frans Hals Museum in the Groot Heiligland, Haarlem. Before 1913 they hung in the Town Hall, where Impressionists went to see them.

The Hals crater on Mercury is named in his honour.

Hals was pictured on the Netherlands&#x27; 10-guilder banknote of 1968.

&quot;The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616&quot; appears on the restaurant wall in the 1989 Peter Greenaway film &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot;.

<text>Grasse (; Provençal in classical norm or in Mistralian norm ; traditional ) is the only subprefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d&#x27;Azur region on the French Riviera. In 2017, the commune had a population of 50,396.

Considered the world&#x27;s capital of perfume, Grasse obtained two flowers in the &quot;Concours des villes et villages fleuris&quot; and was made &quot;Ville d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire&quot; (City of Art and History).

==Festivals==
There is an annual &quot;Fête du Jasmin&quot; or &quot;La Jasminade&quot;, at the beginning of August. The first festival was on August 3–4, 1946. Decorated floats drive through the town, with young women in skimpy costumes on board, throwing flowers into the crowd. Garlands of jasmine decorate the town centre, and the fire department fills a fire truck with jasmine-infused water to spray on the crowds. There are fireworks, free parties, folk music groups and street performers. There is also an annual international exhibition of roses (&quot;Expo Rose&quot;) held in May each year.

==Transport==
Grasse station offers railway connections with Cannes, Nice and Ventimiglia. From 1909 to 1938, the town centre was connected to the railway station by the Grasse Funicular.

==Perfume==

Grasse has had a prospering perfume industry since the end of the 18th century. Grasse is the centre of the French perfume industry and is known as the world&#x27;s perfume capital (&quot;la capitale mondiale des parfums&quot;). Many &quot;noses&quot; (or, in French, &quot;les nez&quot; (plural)/&quot;le nez&quot; (singular)) are trained or have spent time in Grasse to distinguish over 2,000 kinds of scents. Grasse produces over two-thirds of France&#x27;s natural aromas (for perfume and for food flavourings). This industry turns over more than 600 million euros a year. Grasse&#x27;s particular microclimate encouraged the flower farming industry. It is warm and sufficiently inland to be sheltered from the sea air. There is an abundance of water, thanks to its location in the hills and the 1860 construction of the Siagne canal for irrigation purposes. The town is above sea level and from the coast (Côte d&#x27;Azur). Jasmine, a key ingredient of many perfumes, was brought to southern France by the Moors in the 16th century. Twenty-seven tonnes of jasmine are now harvested in Grasse annually. There are numerous old &#x27;parfumeries&#x27; in Grasse, such as Galimard, Molinard and Fragonard, each with tours and a museum.

The trade in leather and tanning work developed during the twelfth century around the small canal that runs through the city. This activity produced a strong unpleasant odour. At the time of the Renaissance perfume manufacturers began production of gloves, handbags and belt (clothing), to meet the new fashion from Italy with the entourage of Queen Catherine de Medici.

The countryside around the city began to grow fields of flowers, offering new scents from the city. In 1614, the king recognized the new corporation of &quot;glovers perfumers&quot;.
In the middle of the eighteenth century, the perfumery was experiencing a very important development. Leading companies dating from this period includes the oldest French perfumerie, and third oldest parfumerie in Europe, Galimard established in 1747. Introduction of new production methods turned perfume making into a real industry that could adapt to new market demands.

In the nineteenth century, the raw materials began to be imported from abroad. During the twentieth century the creation of synthetic products brought the democratization and affordability of perfumes and their spin-offs; (shampoos and deodorants, cream (pharmaceutical) and detergents, food flavouring for cookies, ice cream and dairy products, beverages, convenience foods, confectionery, preserves and syrups).
In 1905, six hundred tons of flowers were harvested while in the 1940s, five thousand tons were produced annually. However, in early 2000, production was less than 30 tons for all flowers combined.

===Historical activity===
In the Middle Ages, Grasse specialised in leather tanning. Once tanned, the hides were often exported to Genoa or Pisa, cities that shared a commercial alliance with Grasse. Several centuries of this intense activity witnessed many technological advances within tanning industries. The hides of Grasse acquired a reputation for high quality. But the leather smelled bad, something that did not please the glove wearing nobility. This is when Jean de Galimard, a tanner in Grasse, came up with the idea of scented leather gloves. He offered a pair of scented gloves to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, who was seduced by the gift. Thereafter, the product spread through the Royal Court and high society, and this made a worldwide reputation for Grasse. The seventeenth century became the heyday of &quot;Glovers Perfumers&quot;; however, high taxes on leather and competition from Nice brought a decline for the leather industry in Grasse, and production of leather fragrance ceased. The rare scents from the Grasse (lavender, myrtle, jasmine, rose, orange blossom and wild mimosa) did win the title for the Grasse as the perfume capital of the world. Harvesting jasmine was a labour-intensive business only a few decades ago. Flowers had to be hand picked at dawn, when their scent is the most developed and immediately to be treated by cold enfleurage.

===Modern industry===

A network of sixty companies employs 3,500 people in the city and surrounding area. Additionally, about 10,000 residents of Grasse are indirectly employed by the perfume industry. Almost half of the business tax for the city comes from the perfume sector and that is ahead of tourism and services. The main activity of perfumery in Grasse is in the production of natural raw materials (essential oils, concretes, absolutes, resinoids and molecular distillation) and the production of concentrate, also called the juice. A concentrate is the main product that when diluted in at least 80% alcohol provides a perfume. Also, food flavourings, which have developed since the 1970s, account for over half of production output today.

This represents almost half of the production of French perfumes and aromas and around 7-8% of total global activity. However, during the 1960s and 1970s large international groups gradually bought up local family factories (Chiris, Givaudan-Roure and Lautier, for example). Soon after their production was often relocated overseas. Just 30 years ago most companies were focused on the production of raw materials. However, an overwhelming majority of the modern fragrances contain synthetic chemicals in part or in whole. Grasse perfume companies have therefore adapted by turning to aromatic synthesis and especially to food flavourings and successfully ended a long stagnation. The Grasse perfume industry cannot compete against large chemical multinationals, but it benefits greatly from the advantage of its knowledge of raw materials, facilities, contractors, etc. In addition, major brands such as Dior and Chanel have their own plantations of roses and jasmine in the vicinity of Grasse.

===Perfumeries===
Three perfumeries, Fragonard, Molinard and Galimard opened their doors to the public and offer free tours that explain the processes of producing a perfume. It is possible to create one&#x27;s own perfume, eau de perfume or eau de toilette and participate in all stages of manufacture from picking flowers to bottling.

* Galimard Perfumery, established in 1747 by Jean de Galimard, provided the Royal Court with ointments and perfumes. It is the third oldest perfume company in the world after Farina gegenüber and Floris of London and was revived after the war by Gaston de Fontmichel and Joseph Roux.
* Molinard was established in 1849 and their perfume bottles were made of Baccarat crystal and Lalique glass. Clients can create their own personalised perfume during the Tarinology fragrance course workshop.
* The Fragonard Perfumery was established in 1926 in one of the oldest factories in the city. Its museum displays rare objects that explain the history of perfumery, covering 5,000 years.
* International Perfume Museum. Opened in 1989, the museum traces the evolution of techniques during the 5,000-year history of perfumery and the large contribution of the Grasse area to perfume making. It was renovated and expanded (doubling in size) between 2007 and 2008.

<doc id="46093" wikidata="Q35851" url="?curid=46093" title="Bill Hicks">
<text>William Melvin Hicks (December 16, 1961 – February 26, 1994) was an American stand-up comedian and satirist. His material — encompassing a wide range of social issues including religion, politics, and philosophy — was controversial and often steeped in dark comedy.

At the age of 16, Hicks began performing at the Comedy Workshop in Houston, Texas. During the 1980s, he toured the United States extensively and made a number of high-profile television appearances, but he amassed a significant fan base in the United Kingdom, filling large venues during his 1991 tour. He also achieved some recognition as a guitarist and songwriter.

Hicks died of pancreatic cancer on February 26, 1994, at the age of 32. In subsequent years, his work gained significant acclaim in creative circles—particularly after a series of posthumous album releases—and he developed a substantial cult following. In 2007, he was number six on Channel 4&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics&quot;, and rose to No. 4 on the 2010 list. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him number 13 on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.

==Early life==
Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the son of James Melvin &quot;Jim&quot; Hicks (1923–2006) and Mary (Reese) Hicks. He had an older sister, Lynn, and an older brother, Steve. The family lived in Alabama, Florida, and New Jersey before settling in Houston, Texas, when Hicks was seven years old. He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating Woody Allen and Richard Pryor, and wrote routines with his friend Dwight Slade. While attending Stratford High School, he began performing comedy (mostly derivations of Woody Allen material) for his classmates. At home, he wrote his own one-liners and slid them under the bedroom door of Steve, who he thought was a genius, for critical analysis. Steve told him, &quot;Keep it up. You&#x27;re really good at this.&quot;

Early on, Hicks began to mock his family&#x27;s Southern Baptist religious beliefs. He joked to the &quot;Houston Post&quot; in 1987, &quot;We were Yuppie Baptists. We worried about things like, &#x27;If you scratch your neighbor&#x27;s Subaru, should you leave a note?&#x27;&quot; Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father:

He was close with his family his whole life, though, and he did not reject spiritual ideology itself; throughout his life, he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to Transcendental Meditation and other forms of spirituality. Over one Thanksgiving weekend, he took Hicks and Dwight to a Transcendental Meditation residence course in Galveston. Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a psychoanalyst at age 17. According to Hicks, the analyst took him aside after the first group session and told him, &quot;You can continue coming if you want to, but it&#x27;s them, not you.&quot;

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Hicks was associated with the Texas Outlaw Comics group developed at the Comedy Workshop in Houston in the 1980s.

===California and New York===
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled. His career experienced an upturn in 1987, however, when he appeared on Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s &quot;Young Comedians Special&quot;. The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year. On the album &quot;Relentless&quot;, he jokes that he quit using drugs because &quot;once you&#x27;ve been taken aboard a UFO, it&#x27;s kind of hard to top that&quot;, although in his performances he continued to enthusiastically praise the virtues of LSD, marijuana, and psychedelic mushrooms.

He eventually fell back to chain smoking, a theme that figured heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.

In 1988, Hicks signed with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.

On the track &quot;Modern Bummer&quot; of his 1990 album &quot;Dangerous&quot;, Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1989, he released his first video, &quot;Sane Man&quot;; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.

===Early fame===
In 1990, Hicks released his first album, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, performed on the HBO special &quot;One Night Stand&quot; and at Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; festival. Hicks was later engaged to his manager, Colleen McGarr, who booked him there. He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in London&#x27;s West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991. That year, he returned to &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; and filmed his second video, &quot;Relentless.&quot;

Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the &quot;Marble Head Johnson&quot; album in 1992, collaborating with Houston high school friend Kevin Booth and Austin, Texas, drummer Pat Brown. During the same year, he toured the UK, where he recorded the &quot;Revelations&quot; video for Britain&#x27;s Channel 4. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Ride.&quot; Also in that tour, he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD titled &quot;Salvation.&quot; Hicks was voted &quot;Hot Standup Comic&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1993.

===Hicks and Tool===
Progressive metal band Tool invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 Lollapalooza appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a contact lens he had lost. Thousands of people complied.

Members of Tool felt that Hicks and they &quot;were resonating similar concepts&quot;. Intending to raise awareness about Hicks&#x27;s material and ideas, Tool dedicated their triple-platinum album &quot;Ænima&quot; (1996) to Hicks. Both the lenticular casing of the &quot;Ænima&quot; album packaging and the chorus of the title track &quot;Ænema&quot; make reference to a sketch from Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; album, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Ænima&quot;″s final track, &quot;Third Eye&quot;, contains samples from Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot; albums.

An alternate version of the &quot;Ænima&quot; artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him &quot;Another Dead Hero&quot;, and mentions of Hicks are found both in the liner notes and on the record.

===Censorship and aftermath===
In 1984, Hicks had been invited to appear on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. NBC had a policy that no jokes about the handicapped could be aired, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as &quot;wheelchair&quot;.

On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on CBS, where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast. At that point, it was the only occasion where a comedian&#x27;s entire routine was cut after taping. His stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Letterman&#x27;s producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the anti-abortion movement, was unsuitable for broadcast. Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision. Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way the situation had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again. Hicks was undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final &quot;Late Show&quot; appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman and most others outside of Hicks&#x27;s family. He would die less than four months later.

Letterman aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hicks&#x27;s mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks&#x27;s set from the 1993 show. &quot;It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill,&quot; he said, after the set aired, &quot;because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that&quot;.

===Denis Leary&#x27;s plagiarism===
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian Denis Leary, but in 1993, he was angered by Leary&#x27;s album &quot;No Cure for Cancer&quot;, which featured lines and subject matter similar to his own routine. According to &quot;American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story&quot; by Cynthia True, hearing the album had infuriated Hicks. &quot;All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary&#x27;s lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bill&#x27;s act and &quot;recorded&quot; it.&quot; As a result, the friendship ended abruptly.

At least three stand-up comedians have stated on-record that Leary stole Hicks&#x27;s material, and copied his persona and attitude. In an interview, when Hicks was asked why he had quit smoking, he answered, &quot;I just wanted to see if Denis would, too.&quot; In another interview, Hicks said, &quot;I have a scoop for you. I stole [Leary&#x27;s] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did.&quot; During a 2003 Comedy Central Roast of Leary, comedian Lenny Clarke said that a carton of cigarettes from Hicks was backstage, with the message, &quot;Wish I had gotten these to you sooner.&quot; This joke was cut from the final broadcast.

&quot;American Scream&quot; describes an incident in the plagiarism controversy:

==Material and style==
Hicks&#x27; performance style was seen as a play on his audience&#x27;s emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the existential nature of &quot;accepted truth&quot;. One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):

American philosopher and ethnomycologist Terence McKenna was a frequent source of Hicks&#x27; most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; Hicks infamously acted out an abridged version of McKenna&#x27;s &quot;Stoned Ape&quot; model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.

Another of Hicks&#x27; most-delivered lines was given during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, Folks&quot;). After a heckler repeatedly shouted &quot;Free Bird&quot;, Hicks screamed, &quot;Hitler had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!&quot; Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased genocide against the whole of humanity.

Much of Hicks&#x27; routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. In an interview recorded after one of Hicks&#x27; shows in Santa Monica and aired as part of the six-episode BBC Two series &quot;Funny Business&quot; in 1992, Hicks was asked if audiences got upset by what he said on stage. He responded by saying that occasionally audience members did not find his material funny but that not only would it be impossible to please everyone, it was not his responsibility to do so. He recounted an instance in which an audience member snidely told him &quot;We don&#x27;t come to comedy to think!&quot; &quot;Gee, where do you go to think?&quot; mused Hicks. &quot;I&#x27;ll meet you there. We don&#x27;t have to do this here!&quot; When one of the interviewers then asked whether there was not a halfway point between pleasing and offending audiences, Hicks pushed back, replying &quot;But my way &quot;is&quot; halfway between. I mean, this is a night club and, you know, these are adults, what do you expect? What you&#x27;re going to see on TV? No. This isn&#x27;t TV live. And also, it&#x27;s my show. What am I supposed to do? Change my own outlook and my beliefs? To be what to them?&quot; Arguing that to simply give audiences what they wanted would be a form of condescension, Hicks explained that his approach was instead to speak to audiences on equal footing, as though they were his friends. When one of the interviewers challenged that audiences just wanted to be entertained, an exasperated Hicks asked, &quot;When did thinking not become entertaining? ... What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to go out and tickle them individually? We have to express an idea here.&quot;

Hicks was strongly against political correctness, and jokingly stated that the politically correct should be &quot;hunted down and killed&quot;.

Hicks often discussed popular conspiracy theories in his performances, most notably the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He mocked the Warren Report and the official version of Lee Harvey Oswald as a &quot;lone nut assassin&quot;. He also questioned the guilt of David Koresh and the Branch Davidian compound during the Waco Siege. Hicks ended some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock &quot;assassination&quot; of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.

==Illness and death==
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that had spread to his liver.
He still toured and also recorded his album, &quot;Arizona Bay&quot;, while receiving weekly chemotherapy. 

Following his cancer diagnosis, Hicks often joked that any given performance could be his last. The public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at Caroline&#x27;s in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents&#x27; house in Little Rock shortly thereafter. 

In his last weeks, Hicks re-read J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and made telephone calls to friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14, 1994. He died on February 26 at the age of 32, and was buried in the family grave plot in Magnolia Cemetery, Leakesville, Mississippi. 

In early 1995, Hicks&#x27;s family released a brief essay he had written weeks before his death:
==Legacy==
Hicks&#x27; albums &quot;Arizona Bay&quot; and &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot; were released posthumously in 1997 on the Voices imprint of the Rykodisc label. &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Relentless&quot; were re-released simultaneously.

At the time of his death, Hicks was working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, titled &quot;Counts of the Netherworld&quot; for Channel 4. The budget and concept had been approved, and a pilot was filmed. The &quot;Counts of the Netherworld&quot; pilot was shown at the various Tenth-Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. 

In a 2005 poll to find the Comedian&#x27;s Comedian, comedians and comedy insiders voted Hicks 13th on their list of &quot;The Top 20 Greatest Comedy Acts Ever&quot;. In &quot;Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time&quot; (2004), Hicks was ranked 19th. In March 2007, he was voted sixth on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 list of the 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comics, and rose to number four on the 2010 list.

Devotees have incorporated Hicks&#x27;s words, image, and attitude into their own creations. By means of audio sampling, fragments of his rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of Super Furry Animals&#x27; &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; and Adam Freeland&#x27;s &quot;We Want Your Soul&quot;. His influence on the band Tool is well documented as he is sampled at the beginning of their song &quot;Third Eye&quot;&quot;Ænima&quot; (1996); he &quot;appears&quot; on the Fila Brazillia album &quot;Maim That Tune&quot; (1995) and on SPA&#x27;s eponymously titled album &quot;SPA&quot; (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; the British band Radiohead&#x27;s second album &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995) is also dedicated to his memory. Hicks&#x27; joke &quot;It&#x27;s always funny until someone gets hurt; then it&#x27;s just hilarious&quot; is used as the chorus of Faith No More&#x27;s song &quot;Ricochet&quot;, from their 1995 album &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime&quot;. American indie rock band Built to Spill&#x27;s song &quot;Planting Seeds&quot; on its 2009 album &quot;There Is No Enemy&quot; alludes to Hicks&#x27;s routine on advertising and marketing, which appears on the performance film &quot;Bill Hicks: Revelations&quot;. Singer/songwriter Tom Waits listed &quot;Rant in E-Minor&quot; as one of his 20 most cherished albums of all time.

Comedians who have cited Hicks as an inspiration include Joe Rogan, Dave Attell, Lewis Black, Patton Oswalt, David Cross, Russell Brand, Ron White, Frankie Boyle, Jimmy Dore, Lee Camp and Brendon Burns. The political cartoonist &quot;Mr. Fish&quot; described in 2022 how he learned from Hicks. 

British actor Chas Early portrayed Hicks in the one-man stage show &quot;Bill Hicks: Slight Return&quot;, which premiered in 2004. The show was co-written by Early and Richard Hurst, and imagined Hicks&#x27;s view of the world 10 years after his death.

Hicks is mentioned in the 1999 British film &quot;Human Traffic&quot;. In the movie, the young and hip club-going protagonist, &quot;Jip&quot;, praises Hicks as an alternative thinker, and explains that he needs to get a regular infusion of Hicks&#x27;s insights. Before leaving his house to start on the movie&#x27;s main adventure, Jip states: &quot;... first a daily injection of the late prophet Bill Hicks ... just to remind me not to take life too seriously.&quot; He then watches a clip of one of Hicks&#x27;s rants about drugs, and how they had never affected him badly.

On February 25, 2004, British MP Stephen Pound tabled an early day motion titled &quot;Anniversary of the Death of Bill Hicks&quot; (EDM 678 of the 2003–04 session), the text of which reads:

Hicks appeared in a flashback scene in writer Garth Ennis&#x27;s Vertigo comic-book series &quot;Preacher&quot;, in the story &quot;Underworld&quot; in issue No. 31 (Nov. 1997).

===Criticism ===

Some comedians and writers have been critical of Hicks&#x27;s legacy since his death. Jimmy Carr, in his book &quot;The Naked Jape&quot; (co-written with Lucy Greeves), wrote that Hicks &quot;was one of the most celebrated recent exponents of loud, impassioned political stand-up. When Hicks got it right, when he resisted the cheap shock tactics and hit his evangelical peak, it was awesome... But the truth is that even Hicks missed his mark a lot of the time, resulting in an act that was neither funny nor moving.&quot; Stewart Lee said Hicks&#x27;s &quot;first two albums have dated badly, with their adolescent potshots at inoffensive figures from popular culture, and self-conscious rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll cool.&quot;

Dara Ó Briain has criticised what he calls &quot;the hagiography that surrounds Bill Hicks&quot;, saying that &quot;Hicks has become the poster boy for a rock-journalism view of comedy, one that thinks that the only decent comedy is a very angry kind. Which is absolute nonsense and has become a complete cliche in the industry.&quot;

Russell Crowe announced in 2012 that he would direct a Bill Hicks biopic. Crowe was originally thought to be playing the comedian, but Mark Staufer, the actor&#x27;s schoolmate and writer on the film, suggested the part remained open for casting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was frequently mentioned as a choice by fans. Production was expected to start in 2013, but as of 2018 no further announcements regarding the film&#x27;s progress have been made.

On October 28, 2018, it was announced that Richard Linklater was set to direct a biopic about Bill Hicks for the film production company Focus Features. As of December 2024, the project remains in development according to IMDB.

<text>In mathematical logic, Russell&#x27;s paradox (also known as Russell&#x27;s antinomy) is a set-theoretic paradox published by the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell, in 1901. Russell&#x27;s paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions. According to the unrestricted comprehension principle, for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property. Let &quot;R&quot; be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. (This set is sometimes called &quot;the Russell set&quot;.) If &quot;R&quot; is not a member of itself, then its definition entails that it is a member of itself; yet, if it is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself, since it is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. The resulting contradiction is Russell&#x27;s paradox. In symbols:
: formula_1

Russell also showed that a version of the paradox could be derived in the axiomatic system constructed by the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege, hence undermining Frege&#x27;s attempt to reduce mathematics to logic and calling into question the logicist programme. Two influential ways of avoiding the paradox were both proposed in 1908: Russell&#x27;s own type theory and the Zermelo set theory. In particular, Zermelo&#x27;s axioms restricted the unlimited comprehension principle. With the additional contributions of Abraham Fraenkel, Zermelo set theory developed into the now-standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (commonly known as ZFC when including the axiom of choice). The main difference between Russell&#x27;s and Zermelo&#x27;s solution to the paradox is that Zermelo modified the axioms of set theory while maintaining a standard logical language, while Russell modified the logical language itself. The language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem, turned out to be that of first-order logic.

The paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of Göttingen. At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor – considered the founder of modern set theory – had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.

== Informal presentation ==
Most sets commonly encountered are not members of themselves. Let us call a set &quot;normal&quot; if it is not a member of itself, and &quot;abnormal&quot; if it is a member of itself. Clearly every set must be either normal or abnormal. For example, consider the set of all squares in a plane. This set is not itself a square in the plane, thus it is not a member of itself and is therefore normal. In contrast, the complementary set that contains everything which is not a square in the plane is itself not a square in the plane, and so it is one of its own members and is therefore abnormal.

Now we consider the set of all normal sets, &quot;R&quot;, and try to determine whether &quot;R&quot; is normal or abnormal. If &quot;R&quot; were normal, it would be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be abnormal; on the other hand if &quot;R&quot; were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets (itself), and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that &quot;R&quot; is neither normal nor abnormal: Russell&#x27;s paradox.

== Formal presentation ==
The term &quot;naive set theory&quot; is used in various ways. In one usage, naive set theory is a formal theory, that is formulated in a first-order language with a binary non-logical predicate formula_2, and that includes the axiom of extensionality:
: formula_3
and the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension:
: formula_4
for any predicate formula_5 with as a free variable inside formula_5. Substitute formula_7 for formula_8 to get
: formula_9

Then by existential instantiation (reusing the symbol formula_10) and universal instantiation we have
: formula_11
a contradiction. Therefore, this naive set theory is inconsistent.

== Philosophical implications ==
Prior to Russell&#x27;s paradox (and to other similar paradoxes discovered around the time, such as the Burali-Forti paradox), a common conception of the idea of set was the &quot;extensional concept of set&quot;, as recounted by von Neumann and Morgenstern:

In particular, there was no distinction between sets and proper classes as collections of objects. Additionally, the existence of each of the elements of a collection was seen as sufficient for the existence of the set of said elements. However, paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s and Burali-Forti&#x27;s showed the impossibility of this conception of set, by examples of collections of objects that do not form sets, despite all said objects being existent.

== Set-theoretic responses ==
From the principle of explosion of classical logic, &quot;any&quot; proposition can be proved from a contradiction. Therefore, the presence of contradictions like Russell&#x27;s paradox in an axiomatic set theory is disastrous; since if any formula can be proved true it destroys the conventional meaning of truth and falsity. Further, since set theory was seen as the basis for an axiomatic development of all other branches of mathematics, Russell&#x27;s paradox threatened the foundations of mathematics as a whole. This motivated a great deal of research around the turn of the 20th century to develop a consistent (contradiction-free) set theory.

In 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed an axiomatization of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his axiom of separation (&quot;Aussonderung&quot;). (Avoiding paradox was not Zermelo&#x27;s original intention, but instead to document which assumptions he used in proving the well-ordering theorem.) Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by Abraham Fraenkel, Thoralf Skolem, and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called ZFC. This theory became widely accepted once Zermelo&#x27;s axiom of choice ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical axiomatic set theory down to the present day.

ZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set &quot;X&quot;, any subset of &quot;X&quot; definable using first-order logic exists. The object &quot;R&quot; defined by Russell&#x27;s paradox above cannot be constructed as a subset of any set &quot;X&quot;, and is therefore not a set in ZFC. In some extensions of ZFC, notably in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, objects like &quot;R&quot; are called proper classes.

ZFC is silent about types, although the cumulative hierarchy has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem&#x27;s formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As José Ferreirós notes, Zermelo insisted instead that &quot;propositional functions (conditions or predicates) used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be &#x27;entirely &quot;arbitrary&quot;″ [ganz &quot;beliebig&quot;]&quot;; the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include higher-order quantification in order to avoid Skolem&#x27;s paradox. Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced (apparently independently of von Neumann), the axiom of foundation, thus—as Ferreirós observes—&quot;by forbidding &#x27;circular&#x27; and &#x27;ungrounded&#x27; sets, it [ZFC] incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT [type theory]—the principle of the types of arguments&quot;. This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreirós writes that &quot;Zermelo&#x27;s &#x27;layers&#x27; are essentially the same as the types in the contemporary versions of simple TT [type theory] offered by Gödel and Tarski. One can describe the cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. (Once we have adopted an impredicative standpoint, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is not unnatural to accept transfinite types.) Thus, simple TT and ZFC could now be regarded as systems that &#x27;talk&#x27; essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order &#x27;description&#x27; of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is shown by the existence of countable models (Skolem&#x27;s paradox), but it enjoys some important advantages.&quot;

In ZFC, given a set &quot;A&quot;, it is possible to define a set &quot;B&quot; that consists of exactly the sets in &quot;A&quot; that are not members of themselves. &quot;B&quot; cannot be in &quot;A&quot; by the same reasoning in Russell&#x27;s Paradox. This variation of Russell&#x27;s paradox shows that no set contains everything.

Through the work of Zermelo and others, especially John von Neumann, the structure of what some see as the &quot;natural&quot; objects described by ZFC eventually became clear: they are the elements of the von Neumann universe, &quot;V&quot;, built up from the empty set by transfinitely iterating the power set operation. It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russell&#x27;s paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of &quot;V&quot;. Whether it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics.

Other solutions to Russell&#x27;s paradox, with an underlying strategy closer to that of type theory, include Quine&#x27;s New Foundations and Scott–Potter set theory. Yet another approach is to define multiple membership relation with appropriately modified comprehension scheme, as in the Double extension set theory.

== History ==
Russell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901. By his own account in his 1919 &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&quot;, he &quot;attempted to discover some flaw in Cantor&#x27;s proof that there is no greatest cardinal&quot;. In a 1902 letter, he announced the discovery to Gottlob Frege of the paradox in Frege&#x27;s 1879 &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Frege&#x27;s definition of function:

Russell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot;, where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox:

Russell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot;. Frege responded to Russell very quickly; his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoort&#x27;s commentary in Heijenoort 1967:126–127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox, and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;, but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory. For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the doctrine of types.

Ernst Zermelo in his (1908) &quot;A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering&quot; (published at the same time he published &quot;the first axiomatic set theory&quot;) laid claim to prior discovery of the antinomy in Cantor&#x27;s naive set theory. He states: &quot;And yet, even the elementary form that Russell9 gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them [J. König, Jourdain, F. Bernstein] that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set&quot;. Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim:

Frege sent a copy of his &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot; to Hilbert; as noted above, Frege&#x27;s last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Frege&#x27;s last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russell&#x27;s paradox, &quot;I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago&quot;. A written account of Zermelo&#x27;s actual argument was discovered in the &quot;Nachlass&quot; of Edmund Husserl.

In 1923, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed to &quot;dispose&quot; of Russell&#x27;s paradox as follows:
The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition F(F(fx)), in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(fx) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter &#x27;F&#x27; is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of F(Fu) we write (do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu. That disposes of Russell&#x27;s paradox. (&quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;, 3.333)
Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems.

In any event, Kurt Gödel in 1930–31 proved that while the logic of much of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, now known as first-order logic, is complete, Peano arithmetic is necessarily incomplete if it is consistent. This is very widely—though not universally—regarded as having shown the logicist program of Frege to be impossible to complete.

In 2001, A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russell&#x27;s paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published.

== Applied versions ==

There are some versions of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, a similar paradox begins to emerge.

An easy refutation of the &quot;layman&#x27;s versions&quot; such as the barber paradox seems to be that no such barber exists, or that the barber is not a man, and so can exist without paradox. The whole point of Russell&#x27;s paradox is that the answer &quot;such a set does not exist&quot; means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference between the statements &quot;such a set does not exist&quot; and &quot;it is an empty set&quot;. It is like the difference between saying &quot;There is no bucket&quot; and saying &quot;The bucket is empty&quot;.

A notable exception to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber&#x27;s paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and &quot;cannot&quot;) exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word.

One way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows: Suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the library&#x27;s books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness; while others leave it out as it being one of the library&#x27;s books is self evident. Now imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master catalogues—one of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that do not.

The question is: should these master catalogues list themselves? The &#x27;catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves&#x27; is no problem. If the librarian does not include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If he does include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves. However, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, he is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the &#x27;catalogue of all catalogues that do not list themselves&#x27;, the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belong in the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves.

== Applications and related topics ==

=== Russell-like paradoxes ===
As illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russell&#x27;s paradox is not hard to extend. Take:
* A transitive verb , that can be applied to its substantive form.

Form the sentence:
: The er that s all (and only those) who do not themselves,

Sometimes the &quot;all&quot; is replaced by &quot;all ers&quot;.

An example would be &quot;paint&quot;:
: The &quot;paint&quot;er that &quot;paint&quot;s all (and only those) that do not &quot;paint&quot; themselves.
or &quot;elect&quot;
: The &quot;elect&quot;or (representative), that &quot;elect&quot;s all that do not &quot;elect&quot; themselves.

In the Season 8 episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;The Skywalker Intrusion&quot;, Sheldon Cooper analyzes the song &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;, concluding that the lyrics present a musical example of Russell&#x27;s Paradox.

Paradoxes that fall in this scheme include:
* The barber with &quot;shave&quot;.
* The original Russell&#x27;s paradox with &quot;contain&quot;: The container (Set) that contains all (containers) that do not contain themselves.
* The Grelling–Nelson paradox with &quot;describer&quot;: The describer (word) that describes all words, that do not describe themselves.
* Richard&#x27;s paradox with &quot;denote&quot;: The denoter (number) that denotes all denoters (numbers) that do not denote themselves. (In this paradox, all descriptions of numbers get an assigned number. The term &quot;that denotes all denoters (numbers) that do not denote themselves&quot; is here called &quot;Richardian&quot;.)
* &quot;I am lying.&quot;, namely the liar paradox and Epimenides paradox, whose origins are ancient
* Russell–Myhill paradox

== Related paradoxes ==
* The Burali-Forti paradox, about the order type of all well-orderings
* The Kleene–Rosser paradox, showing that the original lambda calculus is inconsistent, by means of a self-negating statement

<doc id="46096" wikidata="Q757290" url="?curid=46096" title="Simpson's paradox">
<text>Simpson&#x27;s paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics, and is particularly problematic when frequency data are unduly given causal interpretations. The paradox can be resolved when confounding variables and causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling (e.g., through cluster analysis).

Simpson&#x27;s paradox has been used to illustrate the kind of misleading results that the misuse of statistics can generate.

Edward H. Simpson first described this phenomenon in a technical paper in 1951, but the statisticians Karl Pearson (in 1899) and Udny Yule (in 1903) had mentioned similar effects earlier. The name &quot;Simpson&#x27;s paradox&quot; was introduced by Colin R. Blyth in 1972. It is also referred to as Simpson&#x27;s reversal, the Yule–Simpson effect, the amalgamation paradox, or the reversal paradox.

Mathematician Jordan Ellenberg argues that Simpson&#x27;s paradox is misnamed as &quot;there&#x27;s no contradiction involved, just two different ways to think about the same data&quot; and suggests that its lesson &quot;isn&#x27;t really to tell us which viewpoint to take but to insist that we keep both the parts and the whole in mind at once.&quot;

== Examples ==

===UC Berkeley gender bias===
One of the best-known examples of Simpson&#x27;s paradox comes from a study of gender bias among graduate school admissions to University of California, Berkeley. The admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large that it was unlikely to be due to chance.

However, when taking into account the information about departments being applied to, the different rejection percentages reveal the different difficulty of getting into the department, and at the same time it showed that women tended to apply to more competitive departments with lower rates of admission, even among qualified applicants (such as in the English department), whereas men tended to apply to less competitive departments with higher rates of admission (such as in the engineering department). The pooled and corrected data showed a &quot;small but statistically significant bias in favor of women&quot;.

The data from the six largest departments are listed below:

The entire data showed total of 4 out of 85 departments to be significantly biased against women, while 6 to be significantly biased against men (not all present in the &#x27;six largest departments&#x27; table above). Notably, the numbers of biased departments were not the basis for the conclusion, but rather it was the gender admissions pooled across all departments, while weighing by each department&#x27;s rejection rate across all of its applicants.

===Kidney stone treatment===
Another example comes from a real-life medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones. The table below shows the success rates (the term &quot;success rate&quot; here actually means the success proportion) and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes open surgical procedures and Treatment B includes closed surgical procedures. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of success cases over the total size of the group.
The paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B appears to be more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, the &quot;lurking&quot; variable (or confounding variable) causing the paradox is the size of the stones, which was not previously known to researchers to be important until its effects were included.

Which treatment is considered better is determined by which success ratio (successes/total) is larger. The reversal of the inequality between the two ratios when considering the combined data, which creates Simpson&#x27;s paradox, happens because two effects occur together:
# The sizes of the groups, which are combined when the lurking variable is ignored, are very different. Doctors tend to give cases with large stones the better treatment A, and the cases with small stones the inferior treatment B. Therefore, the totals are dominated by groups 3 and 2, and not by the two much smaller groups 1 and 4.
# The lurking variable, stone size, has a large effect on the ratios; i.e., the success rate is more strongly influenced by the severity of the case than by the choice of treatment. Therefore, the group of patients with large stones using treatment A (group 3) does worse than the group with small stones, even if the latter used the inferior treatment B (group 2).
Based on these effects, the paradoxical result is seen to arise because the effect of the size of the stones overwhelms the benefits of the better treatment (A). In short, the less effective treatment B appeared to be more effective because it was applied more frequently to the small stones cases, which were easier to treat.

Jaynes argues that the correct conclusion is that though treatment A remains noticeably better than treatment B, the kidney stone size is more important.

===Batting averages===
A common example of Simpson&#x27;s paradox involves the batting averages of players in professional baseball. It is possible for one player to have a higher batting average than another player each year for a number of years, but to have a lower batting average across all of those years. This phenomenon can occur when there are large differences in the number of at bats between the years. Mathematician Ken Ross demonstrated this using the batting average of two baseball players, Derek Jeter and David Justice, during the years 1995 and 1996:

In both 1995 and 1996, Justice had a higher batting average (in bold type) than Jeter did. However, when the two baseball seasons are combined, Jeter shows a higher batting average than Justice. According to Ross, this phenomenon would be observed about once per year among the possible pairs of players.

==Vector interpretation==

Simpson&#x27;s paradox can also be illustrated using a 2-dimensional vector space. A success rate of formula_1 (i.e., &quot;successes/attempts&quot;) can be represented by a vector formula_2, with a slope of formula_1. A steeper vector then represents a greater success rate. If two rates formula_4 and formula_5 are combined, as in the examples given above, the result can be represented by the sum of the vectors formula_6 and formula_7, which according to the parallelogram rule is the vector formula_8, with slope formula_9.

Simpson&#x27;s paradox says that even if a vector formula_10 (in orange in figure) has a smaller slope than another vector formula_11 (in blue), and formula_12 has a smaller slope than formula_13, the sum of the two vectors formula_14 can potentially still have a larger slope than the sum of the two vectors formula_15, as shown in the example. For this to occur one of the orange vectors must have a greater slope than one of the blue vectors (here formula_12 and formula_11), and these will generally be longer than the alternatively subscripted vectors – thereby dominating the overall comparison.

==Correlation between variables==
Simpson&#x27;s reversal can also arise in correlations, in which two variables appear to have (say) a positive correlation towards one another, when in fact they have a negative correlation, the reversal having been brought about by a &quot;lurking&quot; confounder. Berman et al. give an example from economics, where a dataset suggests overall demand is positively correlated with price (that is, higher prices lead to &quot;more&quot; demand), in contradiction of expectation. Analysis reveals time to be the confounding variable: plotting both price and demand against time reveals the expected negative correlation over various periods, which then reverses to become positive if the influence of time is ignored by simply plotting demand against price.

==Psychology==
Psychological interest in Simpson&#x27;s paradox seeks to explain why people deem sign reversal to be impossible at first. The question is where people get this strong intuition from, and how it is encoded in the mind.

Simpson&#x27;s paradox demonstrates that this intuition cannot be derived from either classical logic or probability calculus alone, and thus led philosophers to speculate that it is supported by an innate causal logic that guides people in reasoning about actions and their consequences. Savage&#x27;s sure-thing principle is an example of what such logic may entail. A qualified version of Savage&#x27;s sure thing principle can indeed be derived from Pearl&#x27;s &quot;do&quot;-calculus and reads: &quot;An action &quot;A&quot; that increases the probability of an event &quot;B&quot; in each subpopulation &quot;Ci&quot; of &quot;C&quot; must also increase the probability of &quot;B&quot; in the population as a whole, provided that the action does not change the distribution of the subpopulations.&quot; This suggests that knowledge about actions and consequences is stored in a form resembling Causal Bayesian Networks.

==Probability==
A paper by Pavlides and Perlman presents a proof, due to Hadjicostas, that in a random 2 × 2 × 2 table with uniform distribution, Simpson&#x27;s paradox will occur with a probability of exactly . A study by Kock suggests that the probability that Simpson&#x27;s paradox would occur at random in path models (i.e., models generated by path analysis) with two predictors and one criterion variable is approximately 12.8 percent; slightly higher than 1 occurrence per 8 path models.

== Simpson&#x27;s second paradox ==
A second, less well-known paradox was also discussed in Simpson&#x27;s 1951 paper. It can occur when the &quot;sensible interpretation&quot; is not necessarily found in the separated data, like in the Kidney Stone example, but can instead reside in the combined data. Whether the partitioned or combined form of the data should be used hinges on the process giving rise to the data, meaning the correct interpretation of the data cannot always be determined by simply observing the tables.

Judea Pearl has shown that, in order for the partitioned data to represent the correct causal relationships between any two variables, formula_18 and formula_19, the partitioning variables must satisfy a graphical condition called &quot;back-door criterion&quot;:
# They must block all spurious paths between formula_18 and formula_19
# No variable can be affected by formula_18
This criterion provides an algorithmic solution to Simpson&#x27;s second paradox, and explains why the correct interpretation cannot be determined by data alone; two different graphs, both compatible with the data, may dictate two different back-door criteria.

When the back-door criterion is satisfied by a set &quot;Z&quot; of covariates, the adjustment formula (see Confounding) gives the correct causal effect of &quot;X&quot; on &quot;Y&quot;. If no such set exists, Pearl&#x27;s &quot;do&quot;-calculus can be invoked to discover other ways of estimating the causal effect. The completeness of &quot;do&quot;-calculus can be viewed as offering a complete resolution of the Simpson&#x27;s paradox.

== Criticism ==
One criticism is that the paradox is not really a paradox at all, but rather a failure to properly account for confounding variables or to consider causal relationships between variables. Focus on the paradox may distract from these more important statistical issues.

Another criticism of the apparent Simpson&#x27;s paradox is that it may be a result of the specific way that data are stratified or grouped. The phenomenon may disappear or even reverse if the data is stratified differently or if different confounding variables are considered. Simpson&#x27;s example actually highlighted a phenomenon called noncollapsibility, which occurs when subgroups with high proportions do not make simple averages when combined. This suggests that the paradox may not be a universal phenomenon, but rather a specific instance of a more general statistical issue.

Despite these criticisms, the apparent Simpson&#x27;s paradox remains a popular and intriguing topic in statistics and data analysis. It continues to be studied and debated by researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields, and it serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of careful statistical analysis and the potential pitfalls of simplistic interpretations of data.

<text>A green party is a formally organized political party based on the principles of green politics, such as environmentalism and social justice.

Green party platforms typically embrace social democratic economic policies and form coalitions with other left-wing parties.

Green parties exist in nearly 90 countries around the world, many of which are members of Global Greens.

==Definitions==
There are distinctions between &quot;green&quot; parties and &quot;Green&quot; parties. Any party, faction, or politician may be labeled &quot;green&quot; if it emphasizes environmental causes. In contrast, formally organized Green parties may follow an ideology that includes not only environmentalism, but often also other concerns such as social justice and consensus decision-making. The Global Greens Charter lists six guiding principles which are ecological wisdom, social justice, participatory democracy, nonviolence, sustainability and respect for diversity.

==History==
Political parties campaigning on a predominantly environmental platform arose in the early 1970s in various parts of the world.

The world&#x27;s first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the United Tasmania Group, which contested the April 1972 state election in Tasmania, Australia, and the Values Party of New Zealand, which contested the November 1972 New Zealand general election. Their use of the name &#x27;Green&#x27; derived from the &#x27;Green Bans&#x27;: an Australian movement of building workers who refused to build on sites of cultural and environmental significance.

The first green party in Europe was the Popular Movement for the Environment, founded in 1972 in the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel. The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the Ecology Party and then the Green Party. Several other local political groups were founded in the beginning of the 1970s. Fons Sprangers was probably the first Green mayor in the world, elected in 1970 in Meer, and active until 2020 for the Flemish Greens. The first political party to use the name &quot;Green&quot; seems to have been the Lower Saxon &quot;Green List for Environmental Protection&quot;, founded on 1 September 1977.

The first Green Party to achieve national prominence was the German Green Party, famous for their opposition to nuclear power, as well as an expression of anti-centralist and pacifist values traditional to greens. They were founded in 1980 and have been in coalition governments at state level for some years. They were in federal government with the Social Democratic Party of Germany in a so-called Red-Green alliance from 1998 to 2005. In 2001, they reached an agreement to end reliance on nuclear power in Germany, and agreed to remain in coalition and support the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in the 2001 Afghan War. This put them at odds with many Greens worldwide.

In Finland, in 1995, the Finnish Green Party was the first European Green party to be part of a national Cabinet. Other Green parties that have participated in government at national level include the Groen! (formerly Agalev) and Ecolo in Belgium, The Greens in France and the Green Party in Ireland. In the Netherlands GroenLinks (&quot;GreenLeft&quot;) was founded in 1990 from four small left-wing parties and is now a stable faction in the Dutch parliament. The Australian Greens supported a Labor minority government from 2010 to 2013, and have participated in several state governments.

In 2022 Denmark, the Green Party The Alternative has only one Parliament member, having dropped from the previous nine, and five local parliaments members. In 2022 Portugal, the Green Party People-Animals-Nature also has only one Parliament member, having dropped from the previous four, and another in the Madeira Regional Parliament, while its two other Green parties, Partido da Terra and Partido Ecologista &quot;Os Verdes&quot;, only have, respectively, two councilpeople and one mayor.

Around the world, individuals have formed many Green parties over the last thirty years. Green parties now exist in most countries with democratic systems, from Canada to Peru, from Norway to South Africa, from Ireland to Mongolia. There is Green representation at national, regional and local levels in many countries around the world.

Most of the Green parties are formed to win elections, and so organize themselves by the presented electoral or political districts. But that does not apply universally: The Green Party of Alaska is organized along bioregional lines to practice bioregional democracy.

=== Support ===
Academic research has uncovered striking international consistency in the typical demographic and attitudinal profile of Green party supporters. In particular, Green voters tend to be young, highly educated, disproportionately female, and employed in the social and cultural services (healthcare, teaching, the arts, etc.), whilst also displaying above-average levels of environmentalism and social liberalism, as well as being left-leaning. Additionally, Green parties also tend to attract greater levels of support in countries defined by high levels of economic development and low levels of unemployment, as well as the presence of tangible environmental disputes (such as nuclear power production) and active major party competition on the environmental issue. The former two factors are believed to generate cohorts of voters with enough material security to devote their attention to &#x27;higher&#x27; goals such as environmentalism; the latter two help raise the profile of the Green&#x27;s own policy positions and statements (providing that the major parties do not act so quickly to the rising salience of environmentalism as to usurp the issue entirely and completely preempt the development of a separate ecological party). Their supporters sometimes blame the economical system for the environmental issues neglecting any green free-market liberal capitalist alternatives.

===Alliances===
Depending on local conditions or issues, platforms and alliances may vary. In line with the goal of democracy, neighboring ecoregions may require different policies or protections.

Green parties are often formed in a given jurisdiction by a coalition of scientific ecologists, community environmentalists, and local (or national) leftist groups or groups concerned with peace or citizens rights.

A Red-Green alliance is an alliance between Green parties and social democratic parties. Such alliances are typically formed for the purpose of elections (mostly in first-past-the-post election systems), or, after elections, for the purpose of forming a government.

Some Greens, such as those in Hawaii, find more effective alliances (Blue-Green alliance) or indigenous peoples – who seek to prevent disruption of traditional ways of life or to save ecological resources they depend on. Although Greens find much to support in fostering these types of alliances with groups of historically different backgrounds, they also feel strongly about forming diverse communities through encouragement of diversity in social and economic demographics in communities, 

Alliances often highlight strategic differences between participating in parties and advancing the values of the Green movement. For example, Greens became allied with centre-right parties to oust the centre-left ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party of Mexico. Ralph Nader, the 2000 presidential nominee of the U.S. Greens, campaigned with ultra-conservative Pat Buchanan on joint issues such as farm policy and bans on corporate funding of election campaigns, although this &quot;alliance&quot; between Nader and Buchanan was very specifically limited to the purpose of showing that there was broad support for certain specific issues, across the political spectrum.

U.S. Greens grew dramatically throughout 2001. However, stable coalitions (such as that in Germany) tend to be formed between elections with left-wing parties on social issues, and &#x27;the grassroots right&#x27; on such issues as irresponsible corporate subsidies and public ethics.

On 13 June 2007, the Irish Green Party, represented by six members of parliament or TDs, agreed to go into a coalition government for the first time in their history, with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats (the Progressive Democrats later dissolved as a party, though their members remained in parliament). The Green Party held two Cabinet seats, as well as two junior ministries, until their withdrawal from government in January 2011. They lost all of their six seats in the following month&#x27;s general election, but won two in the 2016 general election, and twelve seats in the 2020 general election, and entered government again in June 2020.

In the Czech Republic, the Green Party was part of the governing coalition, together with the conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) and the Christian Democrats (KDU–ČSL) from January 2007 until the government collapsed in March 2009.

Green parties often have to join coalitions/alliances with other parties within parliament as they rarely get a large share of the vote (rarely polling above 10% at a national level). Their involvement in coalition governments is important in getting environmental issues on the political agenda, however they are often limited in the amount that they can succeed given they are not the majority within the alliance.

==Green parties==
===Africa===
Some national Green parties began forming in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, but they often struggled to gain influence.

Wangari Maathai was perhaps the most prominent and successful member of a Green party in Africa: after founding the Green Belt Movement and the Mazingira Green Party of Kenya, she was elected to the Kenyan Parliament in 2002, became an assistant minister for Environmental and Natural Resources, and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. Other African Green parties that have achieved parliamentary representation include Les Verts Fraternels of Mauritius, and Frank Habineza&#x27;s Democratic Green Party of Rwanda. In Senegal, Green party leader Haïdar el Ali was appointed Minister for Ecology in 2012.

===Asia and Oceania===

====Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu====

Green parties have achieved national or state parliamentary representation in New Zealand, Australia and Vanuatu. In New Zealand the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand currently holds 15 seats in the New Zealand House of Representatives after the 2023 general election. The Australian Greens hold 11 seats in the Australian Senate and 4 seats in the Australian House of Representatives. Since 2004, they have received more votes than any other third party in every federal election. They also have representation in the upper and lower houses of state parliaments of five states and in the unicameral chamber of one territory. Greens also hold representative positions in local government across New Zealand and Australia (where a number of local government authorities are controlled by Green councilors). The Greens took the seat of Melbourne from the Australian Labor Party in 2010 with candidate Adam Bandt. This was the first time the Greens have won a Lower House seat at a general election (although they have previously won two seats at by-elections).

Proportional representation in the Australian Senate and in New Zealand has strengthened the position of the Australian Greens and the Green Party of New Zealand and enabled them to participate directly in legislatures and policy-making committees. In countries following British-style &#x27;first past the post&#x27; electoral rules, Green parties face barriers to gaining federal or provincial/regional/state seats. The Australian Labor Party&#x27;s practice of allocating a portion of ALP ticket votes to Australian Greens has helped bring AG candidates into parliament.

In the 2008 ACT election in Australia, the Greens won 15.6% of the vote, winning 4 out of 17 seats. Shane Rattenbury was elected the speaker of the assembly, the first time a Green party member had held such a position in any parliament or assembly in Australia. However, they retained only one seat at the 2012 election in the same territory.

The Green Confederation (&quot;Confédération Verte&quot;) in Vanuatu won 3 out of 52 seats in the last general election in October 2012. Its most prominent member is Moana Carcasses Kalosil, who became prime minister in March 2013. Carcasses, a Green liberal, does not lead a Green government, but a broad coalition government in which he is the only Green minister.

There is a Papua New Guinea Greens Party, but it does not have any members in Parliament. There was briefly a Green Party in Fiji from 2008 to 2013; as Parliament was suspended by the military regime during this time, the party was not able to take part in any election before all parties were deregistered in 2013.

====Lebanon====
The Green Party of Lebanon was founded in 2008 as a secular party. Its first president was Philippe Skaff, CEO of Grey Advertising. The party debuted with the May 2010 municipal elections. In 2011, the party became the first political party in Lebanon to elect a female leader when Nada Zaarour was elected its president.

====Pakistan====
The Green Party of Pakistan was founded in 2002.

====Taiwan====
The Green Party Taiwan was founded in 1996. It is a small party which have often associated with Democratic Progressive Party, a major political party in Taiwan.

===Europe===

====Belgian and German roots====
The first green parties in Europe were founded in the late 1970s, following the rise of environmental awareness and the development of new social movements. Green parties in Belgium first made a breakthrough. Belgium had Green members of parliament elected first in the 1970s, and with seats on the local council, held the balance of power in the city of Liege, so were the first to go into coalition with the ruling party on that council. In 1979 political campaigns and dissident groups feeling underrepresented in west German politics formed a coalition to contest the 1979 elections to the European Parliament.

Although they did not win any seats, the groups in this association formally agreed to become a party and won a breakthrough in the German national elections of 1983. They were not the first Green Party in Europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been, because they attracted the most media attention. This was partly due to their charismatic leader Petra Kelly, a German who was of interest to the American media because she had an American step-father. Since its foundation in 1980 and merger with Alliance 90 after the German reunification, Kelly&#x27;s party, now named Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens, has become one of Europe&#x27;s most important Green parties. It played an important role in the formation of national-level Green parties in other countries such as Spain as well. The forerunner of the Green Party in the United Kingdom was the PEOPLE Party, formed in Coventry in 1972. It changed its name to the Ecology Party in 1973 and the Green Party in 1985.

====1984–1989: A new political force====
In 1984 Greens agreed a common platform for the European Parliament Elections and the first Green Members of the European Parliament were elected here. Germany, a stronghold of the Green movement, elected seven MEPs; two more came from Belgium and two from the Netherlands. As those eleven MEPs did not entitle the Greens to form a parliamentary group on their own, they concluded an alliance with MEPs from Italy, Denmark, and regionalists from Flanders and Ireland to form the GRAEL (Green Alternative European Link) group, also known as the Rainbow Group. Politically they engaged in the fight against environmental pollution, nuclear energy (1986 saw the Chernobyl disaster), the promotion of animal protection and the campaign against the demolition of Brussels by speculation fuelled by the presence of the European institutions.

====Since the 1990s ====

After years of co-operation between the national Green parties, they formed a pan-European alliance that unites most European Green parties. The Greens are a party within the European parliament with 46 seats, as of June 2009. It has a long-standing alliance with the European Free Alliance (EFA), an alliance of &quot;stateless nations&quot;, such as the Welsh nationalist Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party. Together European Green Party/EFA have 58 seats and they are the fourth largest party in the European Parliament.

While on many issues European Greens practice the same policies, one issue divides European Green parties: the European Union. Some Green parties, like the Dutch GreenLeft, the Green Party of England and Wales, the Swiss Green Party, the Irish Green Party and the German Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens, are pro-European while some, like the Green party in Sweden, are moderately eurosceptic.

Some Green parties have been part of governing coalitions. The first one was the Finnish Green League that entered government in 1995. The Italian Federation of the Greens, the French Greens, the German Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens and both Belgian Green parties, the French-speaking Ecolo and the Dutch-speaking Agalev were part of government during the late 1990s. Most successful was the Latvian Green Party, who supplied the Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004. The Swedish Green Party was a long-term supporter of the social-democratic minority government until the election 2006 when the social-democratic party lost. The Irish Green Party is currently in government, having entered a coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in June 2020, with three cabinet positions. It was previously in a coalition government with Fianna Fáil from 2007 until January 2011 when the party withdrew their support for the ruling coalition.
In Scandinavia, left-wing socialist parties have formed the Nordic Green Left Alliance. These parties have the same ideals as European Greens. However, they do not cooperate with the Global Greens or European Greens, but instead form a combined parliamentary group with the Party of the European Left, which unites communists and post-communists. There is one exception, in 2004 the MEP for Danish Socialist People&#x27;s Party has left the Nordic Green Left parliamentary group and has joined the Green parliamentary group in the European parliament. The Socialist People&#x27;s Party is currently an observer at the European Green Party and the Global Greens. Outside of Scandinavia, in 2004, Latvia became the first country in the world to have a Green politician become Head of Government, but in 2006 the Green Party received only 16.71 percent of the vote. In the Estonia 2007 parliamentary elections, the Estonian Greens won 7.1 percent of the vote, and a mandate for six seats in the country&#x27;s parliament, the Riigikogu. Other significant electoral results for European green parties include Germany&#x27;s Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens in the 2002 federal election and France&#x27;s Europe Ecology – The Greens in the 2012 legislative election, in which they both won more seats than any other third party.
In some countries Greens have found it difficult to win any representation in the national parliament. Three reasons can be found for this. It includes countries with a first past the post electoral system, such as the United Kingdom. However, despite the first past the post system in the United Kingdom, the Green Party of England and Wales won their first seat in the House of Commons when Caroline Lucas won the seat of Brighton Pavilion in 2010. In July 2024, after a targeted campaign, 4 Green MPs were elected in Bristol Central, Waveney Valley, North Herefordshire and Brighton Pavilion. The Scottish Greens have had success in the devolved Scottish Parliament having recently signed a deal to enter a governing coalition, whilst the Green Party Northern Ireland has had success in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and local elections where the first-past-the-post system is not used. In countries where a party with similar ideals is stronger, such as Norway and Denmark, Green parties tend to perform worse. In some Eastern European countries, like Romania, Green parties are still in the process of formation and have therefore not gained enough support. In Poland the Green Party, registered in 2004, won their first three seats in the Sejm in 2019. The Green Party of Bulgaria was founded in Sofia in 1989 by Aleksandar Karakachanov. Green Movement (ZD) was a member of an anti-corruption coalition - Democratic Bulgaria (DB). Ecoglasnost is a member of the BSP for Bulgaria coalition. For the elections in 2022, the Party of the Greens (Партия на зелените, ПнЗ, PnZ) joined the Bulgarian Rise coalition.

The European Green Party has worked to support weak Green parties in European countries. Until recently, they were giving support to Green parties in the Mediterranean countries. These Green parties are now making electoral gains, e.g. in Spain, Greece and Republic of Cyprus, or getting organized to do so, e.g. in Malta. Therefore, the EGP is now turning its attention to Eastern Europe – all these countries have Green parties, but in materially poor Eastern Europe the success of Green Parties is patchy except for Hungary, where the local Green party, Politics Can Be Different (LMP), has been elected to parliament and many city councils.

In 2021 Croatian local elections We can! party became the largest political party in the Zagreb Assembly, winning 23 seats in total. Their mayoral candidate Tomislav Tomašević won a landslide victory on 31 May.

====Germany====

As mentioned above, the German green party holds strong influence in terms of green politics in Europe. The German green party: Alliance 90/The Greens (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) was founded in 1993 after the West German green party (Die Grünen, formed in 1980) and the East German green party (Bündnis 90, formed in 1990) joined after the reunification of Germany.

in 1998, Alliance 90/The Greens joined a coalition government with the SPD, forming a Red-Green alliance that would last until 2005. In order to agree to the coalition, Alliance 90/The Greens had 3 priorities: to reduce unemployment, close nuclear-power stations/Germany to not rely on nuclear power, and for citizenship laws to be reformed. The coalition remained in place following the 2002 election. However, green policies were no longer considered to be a focal point so much, with unemployment growing and other economic issues being more pressing, leading to the rise of the CDU/CSU, and the eventual loss of a majority in parliament.

====Turkey====
Greens and the Left Party of the Future is a left-libertarian and green party in Turkey. It was founded on 25 November 2012 as a merger of the Greens Party and the Equality and Democracy Party.

Prominent members include Murat Belge, left-liberal political author and columnist for &quot;Taraf&quot;; Kutluğ Ataman, filmmaker and contemporary artist; and Ufuk Uras, former Istanbul deputy and president of the Freedom and Solidarity Party.

The party is one of the participants in the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Congress, a political initiative instrumental in founding the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party in 2012.

The Greens, along with feminists, left YSGP en masse in 2016, citing its lack of democratic decision making practices. They and a new generation of activists reestablished the Green Party (Yeşiller) in 2020.

===North America===
As of the 41st general election in Canada, held on May 2, 2011, there was only one federally elected member of the Green Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, its leader Elizabeth May. However, at the dissolution of the 41st Parliament on August 2, 2015, the Green Party of Canada held two seats in the House of Commons, the second seat belonging to formerly Independent MP Bruce Hyer who was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the NDP in 2011. Only May won re-election to the 42nd parliament. Mike Morrice was elected to the 43rd parliament, returning Greens to two seats. There remains no federal representation by the Green Party of the United States in the U.S. Congress. Accordingly, in these countries, Green parties focus on electoral reform. In Mexico, however, the &quot;Partido Verde Ecologista,&quot; often abbreviated as PVEM, has 17 deputies and four senators in Congress as a result of the 2006 elections. Nevertheless, some of its political practices such as plead in favor of the death penalty in Mexico, led to the European Green Party&#x27;s withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.

====Canada====

The first Green parties in Canada (both federal and provincial) were founded in 1983. The strongest provincial Green parties are the Green Party of British Columbia, the Green Party of Ontario, the Green Party of New Brunswick, and the Green Party of Prince Edward Island which was elected the Official Opposition in the 2019 election. The first ever BC Green MLA was elected in 2013, and in 2017 they helped the minority NDP form government. In 2014 a Green MLA was elected to the New Brunswick legislature, in 2015 a Green MLA was elected to the Prince Edward Island Legislature, and in 2018 Mike Schreiner became the first Green MPP elected to the Ontario provincial legislature. Federally, the Green Party of Canada received 6.49% of the popular vote and a record three seats in Parliament during the 2019 federal election, breaking ground in Atlantic Canada with the election of Jenica Atwin as the first federal Green from outside of British Columbia. This is up from one seat (later two) and 3.91% won in the 2015 federal election. Although Elizabeth May (the leader of the GPC from 2006 to 2019) was the first elected Member of Parliament, the first seat was gained in the House of Commons on August 30, 2008, when sitting Independent MP Blair Wilson joined the party. As of September 2020, May continues to sit as a Member of Parliament for Saanich-Gulf Islands and has exerted a considerable amount of legislative influence on a number of issues ranging from denying unanimous consent for military intervention in Libya, playing a central role in exposing changes to environmental legislation hidden in the omnibus Budget Bill C-38, to introducing a private member&#x27;s bill to develop a national strategy on Lyme disease. Mike Morrice joined May in Parliament in 2021 representing Kitchener Centre and has been active on disability issues.

In the 2008 Vancouver municipal election, Stuart Mackinnon, a member of the Vancouver Green Party, was elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. Since that time former Green Party of British Columbia leader, and deputy-leader of the federal Green party, Adriane Carr won the Greens&#x27; first seat on Vancouver City Council, in 2011 municipal elections.

====United States====
In the United States, Greens first ran for public office in 1985. Since then, the Green Party of the United States has claimed electoral victories at the municipal, county and state levels. The first U.S. Greens to be elected were David Conley and Frank Koehn in Wisconsin 1986. Each was elected to a position on the County Board of Supervisors in Douglas and Bayfield counties respectively. Keiko Bonk was first elected in 1992 in Hawaii County, becoming Official Chairwoman in 1995. The first Green Party mayor was Kelly Weaverling, elected in Cordova, AK in 1991.

As of April 2018, 156 Greens held elective office across the US in 19 states. The states with the largest numbers of Green elected officials are California (68), Connecticut (15), and Pennsylvania (15). Titles of offices held include: Alderman, Auditor, Board of Appeals, Board of Finance, Board of Selectmen, Borough Council, Budget Committee, Circuit Court Judge, City Council, Common Council, Community College District Board of Trustees, Community Service Board, Conservation Congress, Constable, County Board of Supervisors, County Supervisor, Fire Commission, Fire District Board, Inspector of Elections, Judge of Elections, Mayor, Neighborhood Council Board, Park District, Parks and Recreation District Board, Library Board, Planning Board, Public Housing Authority Resident Advisory Board, Public Service District, Rent Stabilization Board, Sanitary District Board, School Board, Soil and Water Conservation Board, State Representative, Town Council, Transit District Board, Village Trustee, Water District Board, and Zoning Board of Appeals. As of October 2016, 100 Greens held elected office across the US. The first US Green elected to a state legislature was Audie Bock in 1999, to the California State Assembly, followed by John Eder to the Maine House of Representatives in 2002 and 2004 and Richard Carroll to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2008. While in office in 2003 in the New Jersey General Assembly, incumbent Matt Ahearn made a party switch to Green for the remainder of his term.

The Green Party has contested seven presidential elections: in 1996 and 2000 with Ralph Nader for president and Winona LaDuke as vice president, in 2004 with David Cobb for president and Pat LaMarche for vice president, and in 2008 with Cynthia McKinney for president and Rosa Clemente for vice president. In 2000, Nader received more votes for president than any Green Party candidate before or since. Jill Stein ran for president on the Green ticket in 2012, 2016 and 2024; the vice-presidential candidates were Cheri Honkala in 2012, Ajamu Baraka in 2016 and Butch Ware in 2024. Stein, who received over one million votes in the 2016 race, led unsuccessful attempts toward 2016 election recounts in three states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In 2020, Howie Hawkins, a founder of the Green Party, was the party&#x27;s presidential nominee.

===South America===

====Brazil====
The Brazilian Green Party was constituted after the military dictatorship period and, like other Green Parties around the world, is committed to establishing a set of policies on ensuring social-equity and sustainable development. One of the party&#x27;s founding members was the journalist and former anti-dictatorship revolutionary Fernando Gabeira, Alfredo Sirkis and Carlos Minc. Among the main items on the Green Party&#x27;s agenda are federalism, environmentalism, human rights, a form of direct democracy, parliamentarism, welfare, civil liberties, pacifism and marijuana legalization under specific conditions.

Green Party&#x27;s candidate Marina Silva won 19.33% of the vote in the first round of the 2010 Brazilian presidential election (more than any other third party), taking enough votes from Dilma Rousseff of the incumbent PT to prevent her from achieving the majority of the vote needed to avoid a second round. Success in the legislature amounted to winning 2 more seats for a total of 15 in the Chamber of Deputies and the loss of their only senate seat.

Marina Silva left the party the following year.

In the 2014 presidential election the Green Party&#x27;s candidate Eduardo Jorge received 0,61% of the vote. He garnered attention for campaigning on a progressive platform supporting policies such as cannabis legalization and the decriminalization of abortion. Because of his perceived eccentricity and spontaneity while participating in the televised debates, Jorge became the subject of several memes on the internet. The party elected 6 federal deputies and 1 senator.

In 2016, the Greens in Congress voted in favour of the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. The party later went on to support president Michel Temer who succeeded her.

For the 2018 presidential election the party formed the coalition &quot;United to transform Brazil&quot; with the Sustainability Network (REDE), in support of the candidacy of Marina Silva in her third run for the presidency. Eduardo Jorge was chosen as her running mate. Despite faring well in the initial polls, Silva ultimately received 1% of the vote. The party elected 4 federal deputies.

====Colombia====
In the 1990s, the Oxygen Green Party was created under the leadership of Ingrid Betancourt but dissolved after her infamous kidnapping. Later, the Visionaries Party was created by Antanas Mockus whose ideals earned him the Bogotá Mayoral Office twice.
In the 2010 Colombian presidential election a green party has been created under the name Colombian Green Party, with former Bogotá mayor Antanas Mockus being the leader.

==Green parties in government==
While most green parties remain minor parties, some have entered into national coalition governments. The following table lists green parties that have entered into government at the national level. It does not include the green conservative parties of Latvia and Lithuania. It also excludes parties that were elected into government as a minor partner in an electoral alliance, such as the Italian Federation of the Greens which governed as a small part of the Olive Tree and Union alliances.

<text>The barber paradox is a puzzle derived from Russell&#x27;s paradox. It was used by Bertrand Russell as an illustration of the paradox, though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him. The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible. Specifically, it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself, which implies that no such barber exists.

== Paradox ==
The barber is the &quot;one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves&quot;. The question is, does the barber shave himself?

Any answer to this question results in a contradiction:
# The barber cannot shave himself, as he only shaves those who do &quot;not&quot; shave themselves. Thus, if he shaves himself he ceases to be the barber specified.
# Conversely, if the barber does not shave himself, then he fits into the group of people who the specified barber would shave, and thus, as that barber, he must shave himself.

In its original form, this paradox has no solution, as no such barber can exist. The question is a loaded question in that it assumes the existence of a barber who could not exist, which is a vacuous proposition, and hence false. There are other non-paradoxical variations, but those are different.

== History ==

This paradox is often incorrectly attributed to Bertrand Russell (e.g., by Martin Gardner in &quot;Aha!&quot;). It was suggested to Russell as an alternative form of Russell&#x27;s paradox, which Russell had devised to show that set theory as it was used by Georg Cantor and Gottlob Frege contained contradictions. However, Russell denied that the Barber&#x27;s paradox was an instance of his own:

This point is elaborated further under Applied versions of Russell&#x27;s paradox.

== In first-order logic ==

: formula_1

This sentence says that a barber exists. Its truth value is false, as the existential clause is unsatisfiable (a contradiction) because of the universal quantifier formula_2. The universally quantified will include every single element in the domain, including our infamous barber . So when the value is assigned to , the sentence in the universal quantifier can be rewritten to formula_3, which is an instance of the contradiction formula_4. Since the sentence is false for the biconditional, the entire universal clause is false. Since the existential clause is a conjunction with one operand that is false, the entire sentence is false. Another way to show this is to negate the entire sentence and arrive at a tautology. Nobody is such a barber, so there is no solution to the paradox.

<doc id="46105" wikidata="Q244655" url="?curid=46105" title="Indigo children">
<text>Indigo children, according to a pseudoscientific New Age concept, are children who are believed to possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities. The idea is based on concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe, who wrote that she had been noticing indigo children beginning in the late 1960s. Her ideas were further developed by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences, and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution to the belief that they are more empathetic and creative than their peers.

No scientific studies give credibility to the existence of indigo children or their traits. Some parents choose to label their children who have been diagnosed with learning disabilities as an indigo child to alternatively diagnose them. Critics view this as a way for parents to avoid considering pediatric treatment or a psychiatric diagnosis. Some lists of traits used to describe indigo children have also been criticized for being vague enough to be applied to most people, a form of the Forer effect.

== Origins ==
The term &quot;indigo children&quot; originated with parapsychologist and self-described synesthete and psychic Nancy Ann Tappe, who developed the concept in the 1970s. In 1982 Tappe published a comb-bound version which she expanded and republished in paperback in 1986 as &quot;Understanding Your Life Thru Color&quot;. In these works Tappe introduced the concept of &quot;life colors&quot;, defined in &quot;Understanding Your Life Thru Color&quot; as &quot;the single color of the aura that remains constant in most people from the cradle to the grave&quot;. The concept of &quot;life colors&quot; was popularized nationally by Tappe&#x27;s student Barbara Bowers, who published &quot;What Color Is Your Aura?: Personality Spectrums for Understanding and Growth&quot; in 1989, and by Bowers&#x27; student Pamala Oslie, who published &quot;Life Colors: What the Colors in Your Aura Reveal&quot; in 1991.

Tappe stated that during the late 1960s and early 1970s she began noticing that many children were being born with indigo auras (or, in her terminology, with indigo as their &quot;life color&quot;). The idea was later popularized by the 1998 book &quot;The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived&quot;, written by husband and wife self-help lecturers Lee Carroll and Jan Tober.

In 2002, the first international conference on indigo children was held in Hawaii, drawing 600 attendees, and there have been subsequent conferences in Florida, Oregon, and elsewhere. Several films have been produced on the subject, including two films by New Age writer James Twyman: a 2003 feature film &quot;Indigo&quot; and a 2006 documentary &quot;The Indigo Evolution&quot;.

Sarah W. Whedon suggests in a 2009 article in &quot;Nova Religio&quot; that the social construction of indigo children is a response to an &quot;apparent crisis of American childhood&quot; in the form of increased youth violence and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Whedon believes parents label their children as &quot;indigo&quot; to provide an alternative explanation for their children&#x27;s improper behavior, which is stemming from ADHD.

== Attributed characteristics ==
Descriptions of indigo children include that they:
* Are empathic, curious, and strong-willed
* Are often perceived by friends and family as being strange
* Possess a clear sense of self-definition and purpose
* Show a strong innate subconscious spirituality from early childhood (which, however, does not necessarily imply a direct interest in spiritual or religious areas)
* Have a strong feeling of entitlement, or deserving to be here

Other attributed traits include:
* High intelligence quotient
* Inherent intuitive ability
* Resistance to rigid, control-based paradigms of authority

According to Tober and Carroll, indigo children may function poorly in conventional schools due to their rejection of rigid authority, their being smarter or more spiritually mature than their teachers, and their lack of response to guilt-, fear- or manipulation-based discipline.

According to research psychologist Russell Barkley, the New Age movement has yet to produce empirical evidence of the existence of indigo children, as the traits most commonly attributed to them are closely aligned with the Forer effect—so vague that they could describe nearly anyone. Many critics see the concept of indigo children as made up of extremely general traits, a sham diagnosis that is an alternative to a medical diagnosis, with a complete lack of science or studies to support it.

===Indigo as an alternative to diagnosis===
Retired professor of philosophy and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll notes that many of the commentators on the indigo phenomenon are of varying qualifications and expertise, and parents may prefer labeling their child an indigo as an alternative to a diagnosis that implies poor parenting, narcissistic parenting, damage, or mental illness. This is a belief echoed by academic psychologists. Some mental health experts are concerned that labeling a disruptive child an &quot;indigo&quot; may delay proper diagnosis and treatment that could help the child or look into the parenting style that may be causing the behavior. Others have stated that many of the traits of indigo children could be more prosaically interpreted as simple unruliness and alertness.

=== Relationship to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Many children labeled indigo by their parents are diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tober and Carroll&#x27;s book &quot;The Indigo Children&quot; linked the concept with diagnosis of ADHD. David Cohen points out that labeling a child an indigo is an alternative to a diagnosis that implies mental illness, which may appeal to many parents. Cohen has stated, &quot;The view in medicine is that ADHD is a defect. It&#x27;s a disorder. If you&#x27;re a parent, the idea of &#x27;gifted&#x27; is much more appealing than the idea of a disorder.&quot; Linking the concept of indigo children with the distaste for the use of Ritalin to control ADHD, Robert Todd Carroll states &quot;The hype and near-hysteria surrounding the use of Ritalin has contributed to an atmosphere that makes it possible for a book like &quot;Indigo Children&quot; to be taken seriously. Given the choice, who wouldn&#x27;t rather believe their children are special and chosen for some high mission rather than that they have a brain disorder?&quot; Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, states that concerns regarding the overmedicalization of children are legitimate but even gifted children with ADHD learn better with more structure rather than less, even if the structure initially causes difficulties. Many labeled as indigo children are or have been home schooled. Many children labeled as indigo children have the same identifying criteria as those children who have experienced being raised by a narcissistic parent, and are considered to have been emotionally abused.

A 2011 study suggested parents of children with ADHD who label their children as &quot;indigos&quot; may perceive problematic behaviors emblematic of ADHD to be more positive and experience less frustration and disappointment, though they still experience more negative emotions and conflicts than parents of children without a diagnosis.

===Relation to autism===
Crystal children, a concept related to indigo children, has been linked to the autism spectrum. Proponents recategorize autistic symptoms as telepathic powers, and attempt to reconceptualize “the autistic traits associated with them as part of a positive identity&quot;. Autism researcher Mitzi Waltz states that there may be inherent dangers to these beliefs, leading parents to deny the existence of impairments, avoid proven treatments and spend considerable money on unhelpful interventions. Waltz states that &quot;Parents may also transmit belief systems to the child that are self-aggrandizing, confusing, or potentially frightening&quot;.

== Commercialization ==

The concept of indigo children has been criticized for being less about children and their needs, and more about the profits to be made by self-styled experts in book and video sales as well as lucrative counseling sessions, summer camps, conferences and speaking engagements.

== Discussion as a new religious movement ==
Nancy Ann Tappe originally noted that one type of Indigo child (the &quot;interdimensional child&quot;), despite being seen as a bully, was expected to lead new religious movements.

One pagan author, Lorna Tedder, anecdotally notes that every pagan woman she knew who had or was going to have a child believed their child was an Indigo child.

S. Zohreh Kermani states that &quot;Despite their problems with authority, uncontrollable tempers, and overbearing egos, Indigo Children are many pagan parents&#x27; ideal offspring: sensitive, psychic, and strong willed&quot;, but also notes the concept is less about the child&#x27;s psychic abilities than the parent&#x27;s own hopes and desire for &quot;distinction from the less-evolved masses.&quot;

Daniel Kline, in an essay titled &quot;The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse&quot;, notes that the magical belief that the innocence of children equates to spiritual powers has existed for centuries, and that the indigo child movement is rooted in a religious rejection of science-based medicine. In particular, he wrote that Nancy Ann Tappe derived some of her ideas from Charles Webster Leadbeater (her main innovation being emphasizing the connection between children and the color indigo), and that the New Age adoption of the concept is a reaction against diagnoses of ADHD and autism. Kline also discusses how Carroll and Tober have tried to distance themselves from religious beliefs about indigo children in order to maintain control of the concept (even recanting their previous affirmations about auras), and how skeptics and New Agers alike both make rhetorical appeals to science (despite the latter&#x27;s rejection of it) to legitimize their ideological beliefs regarding the existence of indigo children.

At the 2014 University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas, anthropologist Beth Singler discussed how the term indigo children functioned as a new religious movement, along with Jediism. Singler&#x27;s work focuses on the Indigo movement as a part of an overall discussion on &quot;wider moral children, parenting, the diagnosis of conditions such as ADHD and autism and conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and vaccinations.&quot;

<doc id="46106" wikidata="Q2292040" url="?curid=46106" title="The Skeptic's Dictionary">
<text>The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary is a collection of cross-referenced skeptical essays by Robert Todd Carroll, published on his website skepdic.com and in a printed book. The skepdic.com site was launched in 1994 and the book was published in 2003 with nearly 400 entries. As of January 2011 the website has over 700 entries. A comprehensive single-volume guides to skeptical information on pseudoscientific, paranormal, and occult topics, the bibliography contains some seven hundred references for more detailed information. According to the back cover of the book, the on-line version receives approximately 500,000 hits per month.

&quot;The Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; is, according to its foreword, intended to be a small counterbalance to the voluminous occult and paranormal literature; not to present a balanced view of occult subjects.

==Contents==
According to Carroll,
:“The Skeptic’s Dictionary is aimed at four distinct audiences: the open-minded seeker, who makes no commitment to or disavowal of occult claims; the soft skeptic, who is more prone to doubt than to believe; the hardened skeptic, who has strong disbelief about all things occult; and the believing doubter, who is prone to believe but has some doubts. The one group this book is not aimed at is the &#x27;true believer&#x27; in the occult. If you have no skepticism in you, this book is not for you.”

Carroll defines each of these categories, explaining how and why, in his opinion, his dictionary may be of interest, use, and benefit to each of them. He also defines the term “skepticism” as he uses it and identifies two types of skeptic, the Apollonian, who is “committed to clarity and rationality” and the Dionysian, who is “committed to passion and instinct.” William James, Bertrand Russell, and Friedrich Nietzsche exemplify the Apollonian skeptic, Carroll says, and Charles Sanders Peirce, Tertullian, Søren Kierkegaard, and Blaise Pascal are Dionysian skeptics.

The articles in the book are in several categories:

* Alternative medicine
* Cryptozoology
* Extraterrestrials and UFOs
* Frauds and hoaxes
* Junk science and pseudoscience
* Logic and perception
* New Age beliefs
* The paranormal and the occult
* Science and philosophy
* The supernatural and the metaphysical.

Print versions are available in Dutch, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. Numerous entries have been translated for the Internet in several other languages. A newsletter keeps interested parties up to date on new entries and an archived list of previous newsletters is available online. Norcross et al. state that Carroll has made considerable progress in exposing pseudoscience and quackery.

==Reception==
Roy Herbert&#x27;s review of the paperback version written for the &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine commented that &quot;it is an amazing assembly, elegantly written and level-headed, with a wry remark here and there&quot;, and that &quot;this superb work is likely to be used so often that it is a pity it is a softback book.&quot;. Skeptical Inquirer stated that it was &quot;a book that should be a staple of everyone’s diet-part of the package we are given at birth to help us avoid the dangers and pitfalls of living in a world riddled with bad ideas and empty promises...&quot;. It was also described by Gary Jason, a Philosophy professor at California State University as &quot;... a good reference book for a critical thinking class.&quot;

<doc id="46112" wikidata="Q124490" url="?curid=46112" title="Violence">
<text>Violence is often defined as the use of physical force or power by humans to cause harm and degradation to other living beings, such as humiliation, pain, injury, disablement, damage to property and ultimately death, as well as destruction to a society&#x27;s living environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as &quot;the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.&quot; There is growing recognition among researchers and practitioners of the need to include violence that does not necessarily result in injury or death.
Violence in many forms can be preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc. have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.

== Types ==

The World Health Organization (WHO) divides violence into three broad categories:
* self-directed violence
* interpersonal violence
* collective violence

This initial categorization differentiates between violence that a person inflicts upon themself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations.

Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.

=== Self-directed ===
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and self-abuse. The former includes suicidal thoughts, attempted suicides—also called &quot;para suicide&quot; or &quot;deliberate self-injury&quot; in some countries—and suicide itself. Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as self-mutilation.

=== Collective ===
Collective violence is the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as members of a group – whether this group is transitory or has a more permanent identity – against another group or set of individuals in order
to achieve political, economic or social objectives.

Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states. Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence. Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by armed groups. There may be multiple determinants of violence against civilians in such situations. Economic violence includes attacks motivated by economic gain—such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation. Clearly, acts committed by domestic and subnational groups can have multiple motives. Slow violence is a long-duration form of violence which is often invisible (at least to those not impacted by it), such as environmental degradation, pollution and climate change.

=== Warfare ===

War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government. It is the most extreme form of collective violence.
War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as war of aggression to conquer territory or loot resources, in national self-defence or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to secede from it. There are also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.

Since the Industrial Revolution the lethality of modern warfare has grown. World War I casualties were over 40 million and World War II casualties were over 70 million.

=== Interpersonal ===

Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and intimate partner violence—that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home. Community violence—violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home. The former group includes forms of violence such as child abuse and child corporal punishment, intimate partner violence and abuse of the elderly. The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, rape or sexual assault by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes. When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.

==== Violence against children ====
Violence against children includes all forms of violence against people under 18 years old, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers.

Exposure to any form of trauma, particularly in childhood, can increase the risk of mental illness and suicide; smoking, alcohol and substance abuse; chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes and cancer; and social problems such as poverty, crime and violence.

Globally, it is estimated that up to 1 billion children aged 2–17 years, have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or neglect in the past year.

Most violence against children involves at least one of six main types of interpersonal violence that tend to occur at different stages in a child’s development.

===== Maltreatment =====

Maltreatment (including violent punishment) involves physical, sexual and psychological/emotional violence; and neglect of infants, children and adolescents by parents, caregivers and other authority figures, most often in the home but also in settings such as schools and orphanages. It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other child exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child&#x27;s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.

Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences. It is complex and difficult to study.

There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment. Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.

Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.g. school, job, and relationship difficulties). These can ultimately slow a country&#x27;s economic and social development. Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach. Effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills. Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.

===== Bullying =====

Bullying (including cyber-bullying) is unwanted aggressive behaviour by another child or group of children who are neither siblings nor in a romantic relationship with the victim. It involves repeated physical, psychological or social harm, and often takes place in schools and other settings where children gather, and online.

===== Youth violence =====
Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years. Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from bullying and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.

Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year (&quot;Global Burden of Disease&quot;, World Health Organization, 2008). For each young person killed, 20–40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment. Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person&#x27;s psychological and social functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.

Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns. Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results. Similarly, urban renewal projects such as business improvement districts have shown a reduction in youth violence.

Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.g. physical attacks, bullying, rape), and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies. According to researchers in 2018, &quot;More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence.&quot; The violence &quot;can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life.&quot; Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it.

Youth violence impacts individuals, their families, and society. Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up. Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills. Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence. This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills. Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child&#x27;s brain. &quot;Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate. They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships.&quot; Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode). &quot;Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems. They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;.

It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short- and long-term negative effects (e.g., poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety). By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they&#x27;ve experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated. As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently. Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced. &quot;Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves&quot;.

Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions. Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.

Youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people. This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences. Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort. Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance. In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them. Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session. Many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence. This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House&quot;. These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence. If the youth do not have a safe place to go after school hours they will likely get into trouble, receive poor grades, drop out of school and use drugs and alcohol. The gangs look for youth who do not have positive influences in their life and need protection. This is why these programs are so important for the youth to have a safe environment rather than resorting to the streets.

===== Intimate partner violence =====

Intimate partner violence (or domestic violence) involves physical, sexual and emotional violence by an intimate partner or ex-partner. Although males can also be victims, intimate partner violence disproportionately affects females. It commonly occurs against girls within child marriages and early/forced marriages. Among romantically involved but unmarried adolescents it is sometimes called “dating violence”.

===== Sexual violence =====

Sexual violence includes non-consensual completed or attempted sexual contact and acts of a sexual nature not involving contact (such as voyeurism or sexual harassment); acts of sexual trafficking committed against someone who is unable to consent or refuse; and online exploitation.

===== Emotional or psychological violence =====

Emotional or psychological violence includes restricting a child’s movements, denigration, ridicule, threats and intimidation, discrimination, rejection and other non-physical forms of hostile treatment.

==== Intimate partner ====
Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings. A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70% (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. A growing body of research on men and intimate partner violence focuses on men as both perpetrators and victims of violence, as well as on how to involve men and boys in anti-violence work.

Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs. These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction. Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and antisocial personality disorder.

A recent theory named &quot;The Criminal Spin&quot; suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence. A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.

The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships. Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies—those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.

==== Sexual ====
Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person&#x27;s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.

Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.3 and 11.5% of women reported experiencing sexual violence. Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence. If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking, drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life. It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.

Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for domestic violence. Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective. School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research. To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.

==== Elder maltreatment ====

Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.

While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities. Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.

Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.g. stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups. Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.

=== Targeted ===
Several rare but painful episodes of assassination, attempted assassination and school shootings at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks. These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called &quot;targeted violence,&quot; described the &quot;path to violence&quot; of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators. A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just &quot;come out of the blue&quot;.

=== Everyday ===
As an anthropological concept, &quot;everyday violence&quot; may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices. Latin America and the Caribbean, the region with the highest murder rate in the world, experienced more than 2.5 million murders between 2000 and 2017.

== Prevalence ==

Injuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries; however, they are not evenly distributed across or within countries. Violence-related injuries kill 1.25 million people every year, as of 2024. This is relatively similar to 2014 (1.3 million people or 2.5% of global mortality), 2013 (1.28 million people) and 1990 (1.13 million people). For people aged 15–44 years, violence is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, as of 2014. Between 1990 and 2013, age-standardised death rates fell for self-harm and interpersonal violence. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to suicide, 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence and legal intervention. For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors&#x27; appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. It&#x27;s particularly the case if it happened in childhood.
In 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes.

== Philosophical perspectives ==

Some philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent. Slavoj Žižek in his book &quot;Violence&quot; stated that &quot;something violent is the very symbolization of a thing.&quot; An ontological perspective considers the harm inflicted by the very interpretation of the world as a form of violence that is distinct from physical violence in that it is possible to avoid physical violence whereas some ontological violence is intrinsic to all knowledge.

Both Foucault and Arendt considered the relationship between power and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct.

In feminist philosophy, epistemic violence is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance. Some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups.

Brad Evans states that violence &quot;represents a violation in the very conditions constituting what it means to be human as such&quot;, &quot;is always an attack upon a person&#x27;s dignity, their sense of selfhood, and their future&quot;, and &quot;is both an ontological crime ... and a form of political ruination&quot;.

== Factors and models of understanding ==
Violence cannot be attributed to solely protective factors or risk factors. Both of these factor groups are equally important in the prevention, intervention, and treatment of violence as a whole. The CDC outlines several risk and protective factors for youth violence at the individual, family, social and community levels.

Individual risk factors include poor behavioral control, high emotional stress, low IQ, and antisocial beliefs or attitudes. Family risk factors include authoritarian childrearing attitudes, inconsistent disciplinary practices, low emotional attachment to parents or caregivers, and low parental income and involvement. Social risk factors include social rejection, poor academic performance and commitment to school, and gang involvement or association with delinquent peers. Community risk factors include poverty, low community participation, and diminished economic opportunities.

On the other hand, individual protective factors include an intolerance towards deviance, higher IQ and GPA, elevated popularity and social skills, as well as religious beliefs. Family protective factors include a connectedness and ability to discuss issues with family members or adults, parent/family use of constructive coping strategies, and consistent parental presence during at least one of the following: when awakening, when arriving home from school, at dinner time, or when going to bed. Social protective factors include quality school relationships, close relationships with non-deviant peers, involvement in prosocial activities, and exposure to school climates that are: well supervised, use clear behavior rules and disciplinary approaches, and engage parents with teachers.

With many conceptual factors that occur at varying levels in the lives of those impacted, the exact causes of violence are complex. To represent this complexity, the ecological, or social ecological model is often used. The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:

The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), genetics, brain lesions, personality disorders, substance abuse, and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.

The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends. In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person&#x27;s risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence. For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship. In elder abuse, important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.

The third level explores the community context—i.e., schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty. All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.

Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.

=== Child-rearing ===
While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of corporal punishment of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies. For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 pre-industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war. In the United States, domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses. The American family violence researcher Murray A. Straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms &quot;the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families&quot;, whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.

=== Psychology ===
The causes of violent behavior in people are often a topic of research in psychology. Neurobiologist Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, &quot;violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person.&quot;

Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans. Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.

Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as &quot;violent&quot;. For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as &quot;violent&quot;, though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently. Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.

The concept of violence normalization is known as socially sanctioned, or structural violence and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior. It has been discussed at length by researchers in sociology, medical anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, and bioarchaeology.

Evolutionary psychology offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as sexual jealousy in humans, child abuse, and homicide. Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most mammal species and use violence in specific situations. He writes that &quot;Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children.&quot;

Goetz writes that most homicides seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death. He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status. If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual. At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.

=== Media ===

Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists. Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression, this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and was rejected by the US Supreme Court in the Brown v EMA case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.

=== Mental disorders ===
== Prevention ==
The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began. It is used in various degrees in most countries.

===Public awareness campaigns===
Cities and counties throughout the United States organize &quot;Violence Prevention Months&quot; where the mayor, by proclamation, or the county, by a resolution, encourage the private, community and public sectors to engage in activities that raise awareness that violence is not acceptable through art, music, lectures and events. For example, Violence Prevention Month coordinator, Karen Earle Lile in Contra Costa County, California created a Wall of Life, where children drew pictures that were put up in the walls of banks and public spaces, displaying a child&#x27;s view of violence they had witnessed and how it affected them, in an effort to draw attention to how violence affects the community, not just the people involved.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
A review of scientific literature by the World Health Organization on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness. These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.

==== Child–caregiver relationships ====
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme and the Triple P (Parenting Program). There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.

==== Life skills in youth ====
Evidence shows that the life skills acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects. Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.

==== Gender equality ====
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent violence against women by promoting gender equality. For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence. School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.

==== Cultural norms ====
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence. Interventions that challenge cultural and social norms supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak. The effectiveness of interventions addressing dating violence and sexual abuse among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.

==== Support programmes ====
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next. Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services; psychosocial interventions—such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy—to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim, to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.

=== Collective violence ===
Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking. However, policies that facilitate reductions in poverty, that make decision-making more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended. When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.

=== Criminal justice ===

One of the main functions of law is to regulate violence. Sociologist Max Weber stated that the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force to cause harm practised within the confines of a specific territory. Law enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society. Governments regulate the use of violence through legal systems governing individuals and political authorities, including the police and military. Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the police power, to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.

However, German political theorist Hannah Arendt noted: &quot;Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ... Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future. No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate&quot;. Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power. Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.
In the 20th century in acts of democide governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through police brutality, execution, massacre, slave labour camps, and sometimes through intentional famine.

Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in self-defense are usually classified as crimes, although not all crimes are violent crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classifies violence resulting in homicide into criminal homicide and justifiable homicide (e.g. self-defense).

The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that &quot;justice is done&quot;. The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice&#x27;s approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system&#x27;s main tasks is to &quot;do justice&quot;, i.e. to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately. To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.

The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators. One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes—through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one&#x27;s psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).

In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs. For instance, much of community and problem-oriented policing aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it—and not to increase the number of arrests. Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency. Juvenile justice systems—an important component of criminal justice systems—are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention. In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children&#x27;s access to guns and teach conflict resolution. Despite this, force is used routinely against juveniles by police. In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the &quot;Blueprints for violence prevention&quot; programme at the University of Colorado Boulder.

=== Public health ===
The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention. Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations. The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics. Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response. It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely &quot;criminal&quot; or &quot;medical&quot; problems. The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the Social ecological model.

From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
* Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
* Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.
* Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.

A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.e. stopping them from occurring in the first place. Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention. Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible &quot;symptoms&quot;. This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.

The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
# Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.
# Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.
# Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.
# Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes. Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared. This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.

In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health. The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences. In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases. In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to &quot;extending life&quot; or to a &quot;complete state of well-being&quot;. He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.

However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level. This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.

The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.25 which declared violence &quot;a leading worldwide public health problem&quot; and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels. The World Health Organization&#x27;s initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).

The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments. First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it. The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work. Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach. Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places—which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries—than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse—which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence. Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.

=== Human rights ===

The human rights approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence. It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, autonomy and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to privacy; and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. These human rights are enshrined in international and regional treaties and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women. The Convention on the Rights of the Child in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

=== Geographical context ===

Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, &quot;appears whenever power is in jeopardy&quot; and &quot;in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles&quot;. Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories—direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence. Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that &quot;geography came late to theorizing violence&quot; in comparison to other social sciences. Social and human geography, rooted in the humanist, Marxist, and feminist subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice. Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence. Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.

Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection &quot;Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence&quot;, which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present. Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play. When &quot;modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law&quot;, the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben&#x27;s concepts of state of exception and &quot;homo sacer&quot; are useful to consider within a geography of violence. The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government&#x27;s lager or concentration camp can occur). However, when this &quot;in limbo&quot; reality is designed to be in place &quot;until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself&quot;. For Agamben, the physical space of the camp &quot;is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space&quot;. At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by &quot;juridical procedures and deployments of power&quot; that &quot;no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime&quot;; in other words, people become only &quot;homo sacer&quot;. Guantanamo Bay could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.

In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence. About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at Choeung Ek, which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the Killing Fields. The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made &quot;homo sacer&quot; in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben&#x27;s concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot&#x27;s &quot;ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative&quot;, he &quot;dismantled the country&#x27;s existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area&quot;. Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When &quot;symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down&quot;, cultural violence (defined as when &quot;any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence&quot;) is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.

Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography. However, Adriana Cavarero notes that, &quot;as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language&quot;. Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as &quot;horrorism&quot;; that is, &quot;as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name&quot;. With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.

== Epidemiology ==
As of 2010, all forms of violence resulted in about 1.34 million deaths up from about 1 million in 1990. Suicide accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000. Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.

By way of comparison, the 1.5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.34 million), road traffic injuries (1.21 million), and malaria (830&#x27;000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.77 million).

For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries. In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention. Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.

=== Self-directed violence ===
In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide. Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group. These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than suicide. Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030. Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.

=== Interpersonal violence ===
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region. In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa. Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality. Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries. Homicide rates differ markedly by age and sex. Gender differences are least marked for children. For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.

Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.

Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent. Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused. A WHO multi-country study found that between 15 and 71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.

=== Collective violence ===
Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict. For example, between 1976 and 2008, African Americans were victims of 329,825 homicides. Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.0 per 100,000 population between 2004 and 2007. This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.6 per 100,000 people. This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence. Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high. In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people. This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.

== History ==
Scientific evidence for warfare has come from settled, sedentary communities. Some studies argue humans have a predisposition for violence (chimpanzees, also great apes, have been known to kill members of competing groups for resources like food). A comparison across mammal species found that humans have a paleolithic adult homicide rate of about 2%. This would be lower than some other animals, but still high. However, this study took into account the infanticide rate by some other animals such as meerkats, but not of humans, where estimates of children killed by infanticide in the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras vary from 15 to 50 percent. Other evidence suggests that organized, large-scale, militaristic, or regular human-on-human violence was absent for the vast majority of the human timeline, and is first documented to have started only relatively recently in the Holocene, an epoch that began about 11,700 years ago, probably with the advent of higher population densities due to sedentism. Social anthropologist Douglas P. Fry writes that scholars are divided on the origins of possible increase of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: 

Jared Diamond in his books &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; and &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states. For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.

In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the post-colonial perspective. The trend, starting in archaeology and spreading to anthropology reached its height in the late half of the 20th century. However, some newer research in archaeology and bioarchaeology may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon. According to the book &quot;The Bioarchaeology of Violence&quot; violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.

Lawrence H. Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in &quot;War Before Civilization&quot; that 87% of tribal societies were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously. He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize endemic warfare, produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare. &quot;Primitive Warfare&quot; of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.

Fry explores Keeley&#x27;s argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence. Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, &quot;by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states&quot; and that &quot;many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years.&quot;

The relatively peaceful period since World War II is known as the Long Peace.

=== &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot; ===
Steven Pinker&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;, argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia. He argues for a paleolithic homicide rate of 15%.

Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times. A few centuries ago, for example, genocide was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it. Cannibalism and slavery have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years, and capital punishment is now banned in many countries. According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century. Pinker&#x27;s analyses have also been criticized, concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining.

Pinker&#x27;s observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of Norbert Elias, who attributes the decline to a &quot;civilizing process&quot;, in which the state&#x27;s monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or &quot;figurations&quot;, and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts. According to a 2010 study, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.

Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past. They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at homicide rates of death due to warfare, but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.

== Society and culture ==

Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences. Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death. The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.

=== Economic effects ===
In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.

Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy. Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions. One of the possible proves might be the study of Baten and Gust that used &quot;regicide&quot; as measurement unit to approximate the influence of interpersonal violence and depict the influence of high interpersonal violence on economic development and level of investments. The results of the research prove the correlation of the human capital and the interpersonal violence.

In 2016, the Institute for Economics and Peace, released the Economic Value of Peace report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.6 trillion in purchasing power parity terms.

=== Religion and politics ===


Religious and political ideologies have been the cause of interpersonal violence throughout history. Ideologues often falsely accuse others of violence, such as the ancient blood libel against Jews, the medieval accusations of casting witchcraft spells against women, and modern accusations of satanic ritual abuse against day care center owners and others.

Both supporters and opponents of the 21st-century War on terrorism regard it largely as an ideological and religious war. In 2007, US politician John Edwards said &quot;the War on Terror was nothing more than a &quot;slogan&quot; and &quot;a bumper sticker.&quot;&quot; In 1992, former research fellow with the US Cato Institute, Leon Hadar, considered that it wasn&#x27;t &quot;in America&#x27;s interest to launch a crusade for democracy, neither is it in her interest to be perceived as the guarantor of the status quo and the major obstacle to reform&quot;.

Vittorio Bufacchi describes two different modern concepts of violence, one the &quot;minimalist conception&quot; of violence as an intentional act of excessive or destructive force, the other the &quot;comprehensive conception&quot; which includes violations of rights, including a long list of human needs.

Anti-capitalists say that capitalism is violent, that private property and profit survive only because police violence defends them, and that capitalist economies need war to expand. In this view, capitalism results in a form of structural violence that stems from inequality, environmental damage, and the exploitation of women and people of colour.

Frantz Fanon critiqued the violence of colonialism and wrote about the counter violence of the &quot;colonized victims.&quot;

Throughout history, most religions and individuals like Mahatma Gandhi have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely nonviolent means. Gandhi himself once wrote: &quot;A society organized and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest anarchy.&quot; Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of voluntarism, mutualism, anarchism and libertarianism.

<text>Eratosthenes of Cyrene (; ;  – ) was an Ancient Greek polymath: a mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. His work is comparable to what is now known as the study of geography, and he introduced some of the terminology still used today, even coining the terms geography and geographer.

He is best known for being the first person known to calculate the Earth&#x27;s circumference, which he did by using the extensive survey results he could access in his role at the Library. His calculation was remarkably accurate (his error margin turned out to be less than 1%). He was the first to calculate Earth&#x27;s axial tilt, which similarly proved to have remarkable accuracy. He created the first global projection of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.

Eratosthenes was the founder of scientific chronology; he used Egyptian and Persian records to estimate the dates of the main events of the Trojan War, dating the sack of Troy to 1183 BC. In number theory, he introduced the sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient method of identifying prime numbers and composite numbers.

He was a figure of influence in many fields who yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world. His devotees nicknamed him &quot;Pentathlos&quot; after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Yet, according to an entry in the &quot;Suda&quot; (a 10th-century encyclopedia), some critics scorned him, calling him &quot;Number 2&quot; because he always came in second in all his endeavours.

==Life==
The son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in Cyrene. Now part of modern-day Libya, Cyrene had been founded by Greeks centuries earlier and became the capital of Pentapolis (North Africa), a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, Berenice, Ptolemias, and Apollonia. Alexander the Great conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and silphium, a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine. Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek at the time, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local gymnasium, where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.
Eratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught Stoicism by its founder, Zeno of Citium, in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life. He then studied under Aristo of Chios, who led a more cynical school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the Platonic Academy, who was Arcesilaus of Pitane. His interest in Plato led him to write his first work at a scholarly level, &quot;Platonikos&quot;, inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato&#x27;s philosophies. Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under Callimachus. He wrote poems: one in hexameters called &quot;Hermes&quot;, illustrating the god&#x27;s life history; and another in elegiacs, called &quot;Erigone&quot;, describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden Erigone (daughter of Icarius). He wrote &quot;Chronographies&quot;, a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the Trojan War. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy. George Syncellus was later able to preserve from &quot;Chronographies&quot; a list of 38 kings of the Egyptian Thebes. Eratosthenes also wrote &quot;Olympic Victors&quot;, a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities.

These works and his great poetic abilities led the king Ptolemy III Euergetes to seek to place him as a librarian at the Library of Alexandria in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy&#x27;s invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet Apollonius Rhodius had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including Ptolemy IV Philopator who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library&#x27;s holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the original or the copy.
He sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the Library of Pergamum. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.

Eratosthenes made several important contributions to mathematics and science, and was a friend of Archimedes. Around 255 BC, he invented the armillary sphere. In &quot;On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies&quot;, Cleomedes credited him with having calculated the Earth&#x27;s circumference around 240 BC, with high accuracy.

Eratosthenes believed there was both good and bad in every nation and criticized Aristotle for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and barbarians, as well as for arguing that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure. As he aged, he contracted ophthalmia, becoming blind around 195 BC. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194 BC at the age of 82 in Alexandria.

==Scholarly career==
===Measurement of Earth&#x27;s circumference===

The measurement of Earth&#x27;s circumference is the most famous among the results obtained by Eratosthenes, who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 stadia (), with an error on the real value between −2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between ). Eratosthenes described his arc measurement technique, in a book entitled &quot;&quot;, which has not been preserved. However, a simplified version of the method has been preserved, as described by Cleomedes. Modern day measurements of the actual circumference around the equator is , and passing through the poles the circumference is . 

The simplified method works by considering two cities along the same meridian and measuring both the distance between them and the difference in angles of the shadows cast by the sun on a vertical rod (a gnomon) in each city at noon on the summer solstice. The two cities used were Alexandria and Syene (modern Aswan), and the distance between the cities was measured by professional bematists. A geometric calculation reveals that the circumference of the Earth is the distance between the two cities divided by the difference in shadow angles expressed as a fraction of one turn.

===Geography===

Eratosthenes now continued from his knowledge about the Earth. Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format. In his three-volume work &quot;Geography&quot; (), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones: two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics. This book is the first recorded instance of many terms still in use today, including the name of the discipline geography. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one&#x27;s distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the &quot;Geography&quot; the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown, which had never been achieved before. However, his &quot;Geography&quot; has been lost to history, although fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like Pliny, Polybius, Strabo, and Marcianus. While this work is the earliest we can trace certain ideas, words, and concepts in the historical record, earlier contributions may have been lost to history. 
* The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced Homer as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer&#x27;s topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to be legitimate. He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he thought of Earth as an immovable globe while its surface was changing. He hypothesized that at one time the Mediterranean had been a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it and that it only became connected to the ocean to the west when a passage opened up sometime in its history.
* The second book contains his calculation of the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, &quot;The world was grasped.&quot; Here Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, wherein at noon each summer solstice, the Sun&#x27;s rays shone straight down into the city-center well. This book would now be considered a text on mathematical geography.
* His third book of the &quot;Geography&quot; contained political geography. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough and can be considered the beginning of geography. For this, Eratosthenes was named the &quot;Father of Modern Geography.&quot;

According to Strabo, Eratosthenes argued against the Greek-Barbarian dichotomy. He says Alexander ignored his advisers by his regard for all people with law and government. Strabo says that Eratosthenes was wrong to claim that Alexander had disregarded the counsel of his advisers. Strabo argues it was Alexander&#x27;s interpretation of their &quot;real intent&quot; in recognizing that &quot;in some people there prevail the law-abiding and the political instinct, and the qualities associated with education and powers of speech&quot;.

===Achievements===
Eratosthenes was described by the Suda Lexicon as a Πένταθλος (Pentathlos) which can be translated as &quot;All-Rounded&quot;, for he was skilled in a variety of things; he was a true polymath. His opponents nicknamed him &quot;Number 2&quot; because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information but never achieved the highest rank in anything; Strabo accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians.
* Eusebius of Caesarea in his &quot;Preparatio Evangelica&quot; includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances (Book XV, Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;of stadia myriads 400 and 80,000&quot;) and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974–1991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or &quot;400 and 80,000&quot; myriad. With a stade of , 804,000,000 stadia is , approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.
* Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun&#x27;s diameter. According to Macrobius, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth. The actual figure is approximately 109 times.
* During his time at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the ecliptic of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days.
* He was also very proud of his solution for Doubling the Cube. His motivation was that he wanted to produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram. Archimedes was Eratosthenes&#x27; friend and he, too, worked on the war instrument with mathematics. Archimedes dedicated his book &quot;The Method&quot; to Eratosthenes, knowing his love for learning and mathematics.

===Number theory===

Eratosthenes proposed a simple algorithm for finding prime numbers. This algorithm is known in mathematics as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους), one of a number of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, &quot;i.e.&quot;, not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve&#x27;s key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.

==Works==
Eratosthenes was one of the most eminent scholars of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topicsgeography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. There are no documents left of his work after the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.

<text>Major-General Iona Timofeevich Nikitchenko (Russian: Иона Тимофеевич Никитченко; 28 June 1895 – 22 April 1967) was a Russian judge who served on the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. He later served on the International Military Tribunal during the Nuremberg trials as a judge for the Soviet Union.

==Early life and career==
Iona Nikitchenko was born to a peasant family in khutor Tuzlukov (now Rostov Oblast). He studied at his local Agricultural Institute and from 1916 was a Bolshevik. His court experience started in May 1920 when he was appointed as the chairman-deputy of the Military Court of Semirechye Army Group during the Civil War. During the Russian Civil War, he participated on the frontlines in Central Asia. In 1924, he was appointed as the member of the Military Court Collegiate of the Moscow Military District.

As deputy chairman of Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, Nikitchenko presided over some of the most notorious of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s show trials during the Great Purges from 1936 to 1938 and notably sentenced Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev.

==Nuremberg trials==
Nikitchenko was one of the three main drafters of the London Charter. He was also the Soviet Union&#x27;s judge at the Nuremberg trials and was president for the session at Berlin. Nikitchenko&#x27;s prejudices were evident from the outset. Before the Tribunal had convened, Nikitchenko explained the Soviet perspective of the trials:&quot;We are dealing here with the chief war criminals who have already been convicted and whose conviction has been already announced by both the Moscow and Crimea [Yalta] declarations by the heads of the [Allied] governments... The whole idea is to secure quick and just punishment for the crime.&quot;

Nikitchenko dissented against the acquittals of Hjalmar Schacht, Franz von Papen and Hans Fritzsche; he also argued for a death sentence for Rudolf Hess, who was ultimately sentenced to life in prison by the tribunal. Nikitchenko said, in the lead-up to the trials, &quot;If... the judge is supposed to be impartial, it would only lead to unnecessary delays.&quot; Nikitchenko also found the majority judgments incorrect with regard to the Reich Cabinet, the German General Staff and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Having never before written a dissenting opinion—these being unheard of in Soviet jurisprudence—and being unsure of the form of such an opinion, Nikitchenko was assisted in writing his dissents by his fellow judge Norman Birkett.

Nikitchenko feared a compromise on too lenient a level. At the point of final deliberation he reexamined Hess&#x27; case and voted for a life sentence so that the opportunity for Hess to get away with a lesser degree of punishment did not occur.

== Later career ==

In March 1946, Nikitchenko was re-elected to the Supreme Court of the USSR, and until July 1949 he worked as deputy chairman of this body. From August 1949 to September 1951, head of the department of linear water transport vessels of the Ministry of Justice. He retired in 1951. 

Iona Nikitchenko died in 1967 and was buried at the Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>Range coding (or range encoding) is an entropy coding method defined by G. Nigel N. Martin in a 1979 paper, which effectively rediscovered the FIFO arithmetic code first introduced by Richard Clark Pasco in 1976. Given a stream of symbols and their probabilities, a range coder produces a space-efficient stream of bits to represent these symbols and, given the stream and the probabilities, a range decoder reverses the process.

Range coding is very similar to arithmetic coding, except that coding is done with digits in any base, instead of with bits, and so it is faster when using larger bases (e.g. a byte) at small cost in compression efficiency. After the expiration of the first (1978) arithmetic coding patent, range coding appeared to clearly be free of patent encumbrances. This particularly drove interest in the technique in the open source community. Since that time, patents on various well-known arithmetic coding techniques have also expired.

== How range coding works ==

Range coding conceptually encodes all the symbols of the message into one number, unlike Huffman coding which assigns each symbol a bit-pattern and concatenates all the bit-patterns together. Thus range coding can achieve greater compression ratios than the one-bit-per-symbol lower bound on Huffman coding and it does not suffer the inefficiencies that Huffman does when dealing with probabilities that are not an exact power of two.

The central concept behind range coding is this: given a large-enough range of integers, and a probability estimation for the symbols, the initial range can easily be divided into sub-ranges whose sizes are proportional to the probability of the symbol they represent. Each symbol of the message can then be encoded in turn, by reducing the current range down to just that sub-range which corresponds to the next symbol to be encoded. The decoder must have the same probability estimation the encoder used, which can either be sent in advance, derived from already transferred data or be part of the compressor and decompressor.

When all symbols have been encoded, merely identifying the sub-range is enough to communicate the entire message (presuming of course that the decoder is somehow notified when it has extracted the entire message). A single integer is actually sufficient to identify the sub-range, and it may not even be necessary to transmit the entire integer; if there is a sequence of digits such that every integer beginning with that prefix falls within the sub-range, then the prefix alone is all that&#x27;s needed to identify the sub-range and thus transmit the message.

=== Example ===
Suppose we want to encode the message &quot;AABA&lt;EOM&gt;&quot;, where &lt;EOM&gt; is the end-of-message symbol. For this example it is assumed that the decoder knows that we intend to encode exactly five symbols in the base 10 number system (allowing for 105 different combinations of symbols with the range [0, 100000)) using the probability distribution {A: .60; B: .20; &lt;EOM&gt;: .20}. The encoder breaks down the range [0, 100000) into three subranges:

 A: [ 0, 60000)
 B: [ 60000, 80000)
 &lt;EOM&gt;: [ 80000, 100000)

Since our first symbol is an A, it reduces our initial range down to [0, 60000). The second symbol choice leaves us with three sub-ranges of this range. We show them following the already-encoded &#x27;A&#x27;:

 AA: [ 0, 36000)
 AB: [ 36000, 48000)
 A&lt;EOM&gt;: [ 48000, 60000)

With two symbols encoded, our range is now [0, 36000) and our third symbol leads to the following choices:

 AAA: [ 0, 21600)
 AAB: [ 21600, 28800)
 AA&lt;EOM&gt;: [ 28800, 36000)

This time it is the second of our three choices that represent the message we want to encode, and our range becomes [21600, 28800). It may look harder to determine our sub-ranges in this case, but it is actually not: we can merely subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to determine that there are 7200 numbers in our range; that the first 4320 of them represent 0.60 of the total, the next 1440 represent the next 0.20, and the remaining 1440 represent the remaining 0.20 of the total. Adding back the lower bound gives us our ranges:

 AABA: [21600, 25920)
 AABB: [25920, 27360)
 AAB&lt;EOM&gt;: [27360, 28800)

Finally, with our range narrowed down to [21600, 25920), we have just one more symbol to encode. Using the same technique as before for dividing up the range between the lower and upper bound, we find the three sub-ranges are:

 AABAA: [21600, 24192)
 AABAB: [24192, 25056)
 AABA&lt;EOM&gt;: [25056, 25920)

And since &lt;EOM&gt; is our final symbol, our final range is [25056, 25920). Because all five-digit integers starting with &quot;251&quot; fall within our final range, it is one of the three-digit prefixes we could transmit that would unambiguously convey our original message. (The fact that there are actually eight such prefixes in all implies we still have inefficiencies. They have been introduced by our use of base 10 rather than base 2.)

The central problem may appear to be selecting an initial range large enough that no matter how many symbols we have to encode, we will always have a current range large enough to divide into non-zero sub-ranges. In practice, however, this is not a problem, because instead of starting with a very large range and gradually narrowing it down, the encoder works with a smaller range of numbers at any given time. After some number of digits have been encoded, the leftmost digits will not change. In the example after coding just three symbols, we already knew that our final result would start with &quot;2&quot;. More digits are shifted in on the right as digits on the left are sent off. This is illustrated in the following code:
int low = 0;
int range = 100000;

void Run()
 Encode(0, 6, 10); // A
 Encode(0, 6, 10); // A
 Encode(6, 2, 10); // B
 Encode(0, 6, 10); // A
 Encode(8, 2, 10); // &lt;EOM&gt;

 // emit final digits - see below
 while (range &lt; 10000)
 EmitDigit();

 low += 10000;
 EmitDigit();

void EmitDigit()
 Console.Write(low / 10000);
 low = (low % 10000) * 10;
 range *= 10;

void Encode(int start, int size, int total)
 // adjust the range based on the symbol interval
 range /= total;
 low += start * range;
 range *= size;

 // check if left-most digit is same throughout range
 while (low / 10000 == (low + range) / 10000)
 EmitDigit();

 // readjust range - see reason for this below
 if (range &lt; 1000)
 EmitDigit();
 EmitDigit();
 range = 100000 - low;
}
To finish off we may need to emit a few extra digits. The top digit of codice_1 is probably too small so we need to increment it, but we have to make sure we don&#x27;t increment it past codice_2. So first we need to make sure codice_3 is large enough.
// emit final digits
while (range &lt; 10000)
 EmitDigit();

low += 10000;
EmitDigit();
One problem that can occur with the codice_4 function above is that codice_3 might become very small but codice_1 and codice_2 still have differing first digits. This could result in the interval having insufficient precision to distinguish between all of the symbols in the alphabet. When this happens we need to fudge a little, output the first couple of digits even though we might be off by one, and re-adjust the range to give us as much room as possible.

For example, imagine the input stream has led the encoder to the right-open interval [59888, 60188), that is, codice_8 and codice_9. The trick is to narrow down the interval to [59888, 60000) = [59888, 59999], which allows the encoder to emit two of the left-most digits of codice_1, and readjust the interval to [88800, 99999] = [88800, 100000), that is, codice_11 and codice_12.

The decoder will be following the same steps so it will know when it needs to do this to keep in sync.
// this goes just before the end of Encode() above
if (range &lt; 1000)
 EmitDigit();
 EmitDigit();
 range = 100000 - low;


Base 10 was used in this example, but a real implementation would just use binary, with the full range of the native integer data type. Instead of codice_13 and codice_14 you would likely use hexadecimal constants such as codice_15 and codice_16. Instead of emitting a digit at a time you would emit a byte at a time and use a byte-shift operation instead of multiplying by 10.

Decoding uses exactly the same algorithm with the addition of keeping track of the current codice_17 value consisting of the digits read from the compressor. Instead of emitting the top digit of codice_1 you just throw it away, but you also shift out the top digit of codice_17 and shift in a new digit read from the compressor. Use codice_20 below instead of codice_21.
int code = 0;
int low = 0;
int range = 1;

void InitializeDecoder()
 AppendDigit(); // with this example code, only 1 of these is actually needed
 AppendDigit();
 AppendDigit();
 AppendDigit();
 AppendDigit();

void AppendDigit()
 code = (code % 10000) * 10 + ReadNextDigit();
 low = (low % 10000) * 10;
 range *= 10;

void Decode(int start, int size, int total) // Decode is same as Encode with EmitDigit replaced by AppendDigit
 // adjust the range based on the symbol interval
 range /= total;
 low += start * range;
 range *= size;

 // check if left-most digit is same throughout range
 while (low / 10000 == (low + range) / 10000)
 AppendDigit();

 // readjust range - see reason for this below
 if (range &lt; 1000)
 AppendDigit();
 AppendDigit();
 range = 100000 - low;
}
In order to determine which probability intervals to apply, the decoder needs to look at the current value of codice_17 within the interval [low, low+range) and decide which symbol this represents.
void Run()
 int start = 0;
 int size;
 int total = 10;
 InitializeDecoder(); // need to get range/total &gt;0
 while (start &lt; 8) // stop when receive EOM
 int v = GetValue(total); // code is in what symbol range?
 switch (v) // convert value to symbol
 case 0:
 case 1:
 case 2:
 case 3:
 case 4:
 case 5: start=0; size=6; Console.Write(&quot;A&quot;); break;
 case 6:
 case 7: start=6; size=2; Console.Write(&quot;B&quot;); break;
 default: start=8; size=2; Console.WriteLine(&quot;&quot;);
 Decode(start, size, total);
}

int GetValue(int total)
 return (code - low) / (range / total);


For the AABA&lt;EOM&gt; example above, this would return a value in the range 0 to 9. Values 0 through 5 would represent A, 6 and 7 would represent B, and 8 and 9 would represent &lt;EOM&gt;.

== Relationship with arithmetic coding ==
Arithmetic coding is the same as range coding, but with the integers taken as being the numerators of fractions. These fractions have an implicit, common denominator, such that all the fractions fall in the range [0,1). Accordingly, the resulting arithmetic code is interpreted as beginning with an implicit &quot;0&quot;. As these are just different interpretations of the same coding methods, and as the resulting arithmetic and range codes are identical, each arithmetic coder is its corresponding range encoder, and vice versa. In other words, arithmetic coding and range coding are just two, slightly different ways of understanding the same thing.

In practice, though, so-called range &quot;encoders&quot; tend to be implemented pretty much as described in Martin&#x27;s paper, while arithmetic coders more generally tend not to be called range encoders. An often noted feature of such range encoders is the tendency to perform renormalization a byte at a time, rather than one bit at a time (as is usually the case). In other words, range encoders tend to use bytes as coding digits, rather than bits. While this does reduce the amount of compression that can be achieved by a very small amount, it is faster than when performing renormalization for each bit.

<text>Karl Brandt (8 January 1904 – 2 June 1948) was a German physician and &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) officer in Nazi Germany. Trained in surgery, Brandt joined the Nazi Party in 1932 and became Adolf Hitler&#x27;s escort doctor in August 1934. A member of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle at the Berghof, he was selected by Philipp Bouhler, the head of Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery, to administer the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; euthanasia program. Brandt was later appointed the Reich Commissioner of Health and Emergency Services (&quot;Bevollmächtigter für das Sanitäts- und Gesundheitswesen&quot;). Accused of involvement in human experimentation and other war crimes, Brandt was indicted in late 1946 and faced trial before a U.S. military tribunal along with 22 others in the Doctors&#x27; Trial. He was convicted, sentenced to death, and hanged on 2 June 1948.

==Early life==
Brandt was born in Mulhouse in the then German Alsace-Lorraine territory (now in Haut-Rhin, France) into the family of a Prussian Army officer. He became a medical doctor and surgeon in 1928, specializing in head and spinal injuries. He joined the Nazi Party in January 1932, and first met Hitler in the summer of 1932. He became a member of the SA in 1933 and a member of the SS on 29 July 1934; appointed the officer rank of &quot;Untersturmführer&quot;. From the summer of 1934 forward, he was Hitler&#x27;s &quot;escort physician&quot;. Karl Brandt married Anni Rehborn, a champion swimmer, on 17 March 1934. They had one child, Karl Adolf Brandt (born 4 October 1935). Brandt was of the Protestant faith.

==Career in Nazi Germany==
In the context of the 1933 Nazi Germany law &quot;Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses&quot; (Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring), Brandt was one of the medical scientists who performed abortions in great numbers on women deemed genetically disordered, mentally or physically disabled or racially deficient, or whose unborn fetuses were expected to develop such genetic &quot;defects&quot;. These abortions had been legalized, as long as no healthy Aryan fetuses were aborted. On 25 July 1939, Brandt authorized the first euthanization of the Nazi eugenics program, that of Gerhard Kretschmar, a 5-month-old disabled German infant.

On 1 September 1939, Brandt was appointed by Hitler as co-head of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; euthanasia program, with Philipp Bouhler. Additional power was afforded Brandt when on 28 July 1942, he was appointed Commissioner of Health and Emergency Services (&quot;Bevollmächtigter für das Sanitäts- und Gesundheitswesen&quot;) by Hitler and was thereafter only bound by the Führer&#x27;s instructions. He received regular promotions in the SS; by April 1944, Brandt was a SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; in the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; and a SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; in the Waffen-SS. On 16 April 1945, he was arrested by the Gestapo for moving his family out of Berlin so they could surrender to American forces. Brandt was condemned to death by a military court and then sent to Kiel. He was released from arrest by order of Karl Dönitz on 2 May. He was placed under arrest by the British on 23 May.

==Brandt&#x27;s medical ethics==
Brandt&#x27;s medical ethics, particularly regarding euthanasia, were influenced by Alfred Hoche, whose courses he attended. Like many other German doctors of the period, Brandt came to believe that the health of society as a whole should take precedence over that of its individual members. Because society was viewed as an organism that had to be cured, its weakest, most invalid and incurable members were only parts that should be removed. Such hapless creatures should therefore be granted a &quot;merciful death&quot; (&quot;Gnadentod&quot;). In addition to these considerations, Brandt&#x27;s explanation at his trial for his criminal actions – particularly ordering experimentation on human beings – was that &quot;... Any personal code of ethics must give way to the total character of the war&quot;. Historian Horst Freyhofer asserts that, in the absence of at least Brandt&#x27;s tacit approval, it is highly unlikely that the grotesque and cruel medical experiments for which the Nazi doctors are infamous, could have been performed. Brandt and Hitler discussed multiple killing techniques during the initial planning of the euthanasia program, during which Hitler asked Brandt, &quot;which is the most humane way?&quot; Brandt suggested the use of carbon monoxide gas, to which Hitler gave his approval. Hitler instructed Brandt to contact other physicians and begin to coordinate the mass killings.

== Life in the inner circle ==

Karl Brandt and his wife Anni were members of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle at Berchtesgaden where Hitler maintained his private residence known as the Berghof. This very exclusive group functioned as Hitler&#x27;s de facto family circle. It included Eva Braun, Albert Speer, his wife Margarete, Theodor Morell, Martin Bormann, Hitler&#x27;s photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler&#x27;s adjutants and his secretaries. Brandt and Hitler&#x27;s chief architect Albert Speer were good friends as the two shared technocratic dispositions about their work. Brandt looked at killing &quot;useless eaters&quot; and the disabled as a means to an end, namely in the interest of public health. Similarly, Speer viewed the use of concentration camp slave labor for his defense and building projects in much the same way. As members of this inner circle, the Brandts had a residence near the Berghof and spent considerable time there when Hitler was present. Despite Brandt&#x27;s closeness to Hitler, the dictator was furious when he learned shortly before the end of the war that the doctor had sent Anni and their son toward the American lines in hopes of evading capture by the Russians. Hitler charged him with treason and Brandt underwent a summary trial and was sentenced to death. Only the intervention of Heinrich Himmler and Speer saved him from execution at that time.

==Trial and execution==

Brandt was tried along with twenty-two others at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg, Germany. The trial was officially titled &quot;United States of America v. Karl Brandt et al.&quot;, but is more commonly referred to as the &quot;Doctors&#x27; Trial&quot;; it began on 9 December 1946. He was charged with four counts:

#Conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity as described in counts 2 and 3; 
#War crimes: performing medical experiments, without the subjects&#x27; consent, on prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, in the course of which experiments the defendants committed murders, brutalities, cruelties, tortures, atrocities, and other inhuman acts. Also planning and performing the mass murder of prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, stigmatized as aged, insane, incurably ill, deformed, and so on, by gas, lethal injections, and diverse other means in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums during the Euthanasia Program and participating in the mass murder of concentration camp inmates; 
#Crimes against humanity: committing crimes described under count 2 also on German nationals; 
#Membership in a criminal organization, the SS. The charges against him included special responsibility for, and participation in, Freezing, Malaria, LOST Gas, Sulfanilamide, Bone, Muscle and Nerve Regeneration and Bone Transplantation, Sea-Water, Epidemic Jaundice, Sterilization, and Typhus Experiments.

As chief of counsel for the prosecution Telford Taylor put it:&quot;The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A handful only are still alive; a few of the survivors will appear in this courtroom. But most of these miserable victims were slaughtered outright or died in the course of the tortures to which they were subjected. For the most part they are nameless dead. To their murderers, these wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.&quot;After a defence led by Robert Servatius, on 19 August 1947, Brandt was found guilty on counts 2-4 of the indictment. With six others, he was sentenced to death. Numerous pleas for clemency on Brandt&#x27;s behalf were made by dozens of people, including representatives of the churches, such as Eugen Gerstenmaier, the chairman of the relief organization of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Amongst Brandt&#x27;s advocates were numerous medical health professionals, such as surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch, renowned pathologist Robert Roesle, the pharmacologist Wolfgang Hübner, the gynaecologist Walter Stoeckel, and the historian of medicine Paul Diepgen. Other noted petitioners included various other physiologists, pathologists and surgeons. Ultimately, Lucius D. Clay, the governor of the American occupation zone in Germany, rejected all pleas for mercy. He confirmed the death sentence for Brandt, as well as those for his codefendants.

Clay stated:&quot;Regardless of what inner convictions Dr Brandt may have held, he was directly responsible for much of the suffering and death caused to the unfortunate concentration camp victims chosen to be used as subjects in brutal medical experiments. In justice to these persons who underwent torture and death, I am unable to grant clemency in this case.&quot;

Brandt and six other defendants were executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison on 2 June 1948. While on the gallows, he remarked: &quot;It is no shame to stand upon the scaffold. This is nothing but political revenge. I have served my Fatherland as others before me.&quot; As he continued to talk, prison officials told him he&#x27;d run out of time and that he needed to stop. However, Brandt refused to end his speech. Eventually, a hood was placed over his head while he continued to talk and he was hanged.

<text>The 3D ACIS Modeler (ACIS) is a geometric modeling kernel developed by Spatial Corporation (formerly Spatial Technology), part of Dassault Systèmes. ACIS is used by software developers in industries such as computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, computer-aided engineering, architecture, engineering and construction, coordinate-measuring machine, 3D animation, and shipbuilding. ACIS provides software developers and manufacturers the underlying 3D modeling functionality.

ACIS features an object-oriented C++ architecture with 3D modelling capabilities. ACIS is used to construct applications with hybrid modeling features, since it integrates wireframe model, surface, and solid modeling functionality with both manifold and non-manifold topology, and a set of geometric operations.

== History ==

As a geometric kernel, ACIS is a second generation system, coming after the first generation Romulus.
There are several versions about what the word ACIS actually stands for, or whether it is an acronym at all. The most popular version is that ACIS stands for &quot;Alan, Charles, Ian&#x27;s System&quot; (Alan Grayer, Charles Lang and Ian Braid as part of Three-Space Ltd.), or &quot;Alan, Charles, Ian and Spatial&quot; (as the system was later on sold to Spatial Technology, now Spatial Corp). According to a close source the name actually stands for &quot;Alan, Charles, Ian, Sowar&quot;, with Sowar coming from Dick Sowar, founder of Spatial Technology. However, when asked, the creators of ACIS would simply suggest that its name was derived from Greek mythology (See also Acis).

In 1985 Alan Grayer, Charles Lang and Ian Braid (creators of Romulus and Romulus-D) formed Three-Space Ltd. (Cambridge, England) which had been retained by Dick Sowar&#x27;s Spatial Technology (which had been founded by Sowar in 1986) to develop the ACIS solid modeling kernel for Spatial Technology&#x27;s Strata CAM software. The first version of ACIS was released in 1989 and was licensed by HP for integration into its ME CAD software.

In late 2000, around the time when Spatial was acquired by Dassault Systèmes, the ACIS file format changed slightly and was no longer openly published.

== Architecture ==

A software component is a functionally specialized unit of software—a collection of software items (functions, classes, etc.) grouped together to serve some distinct purpose. It serves as a constituent part of a whole software system or product. A product is one or more software components that are assembled together and sold as a package. Components can be arranged in different combinations to form different products.

The ACIS product line is designed using software component technology, which allows an application to use only the components it requires. In some cases, more than one component is available (either from Spatial or third party vendors) for a given purpose, so application developers can use the component that best meets their needs. For example, several rendering components are available from Spatial, and developers use the one that works best for their platform or application.

=== Supported Platforms and Operating Systems ===
== Functionality ==

=== ACIS Modeler ===
ACIS core functionality can be subclassified into three categories, namely:

==== 3D Modelling ====
* Extrude/revolve/sweep sets of 2D curves into complex surfaces or solids.
* Fillet and chamfer between faces and along edges in surface and solid models.
* Fit surfaces to a closed network of curves.
* Generate patterns of repetitive shapes.
* Hollow solids and thicken surfaces.
* Interactively bend, twist, stretch, and warp combinations of curves, surfaces, and solids.
* Intersect/subtract/unite any combination of curves, surfaces, and solids.
* Loft surfaces to fit a set of profile curves.
* Taper/offset/move surfaces in a model.

==== 3D Model Management ====

* Attach user-defined data to any level of a model.
* Track geometry and topology changes.
* Calculate mass and volume.
* Model sub-regions of a solid using cellular topology.
* Unlimited undo/redo with independent history streams.

==== 3D Model Visualization ====
* Tessellate surface geometry into polygonal mesh representation.
* Create advanced surfacing capabilities with the optional Deformable Modeling component.
* Generate precise 2D projections with hidden line removal using optional PHL V5 component.
* Develop graphical applications

=== ACIS Modeler Extensions ===
; CGM Polyhedra: CGM Polyhedra is an add-on to the 3D ACIS Modeler combining polyhedral and B-rep modeling. Utilizing the same interfaces that 3D ACIS Modeler users are already familiar with, existing and new customers can integrate approximated polyhedral data to their 3D printing, subtractive manufacturing, analysis, and other workflows.

; 3D Deformable Modeling: 3D Deformable Modeling is an interactive sculpting tool for shaping 3D models. Included as part of Spatial&#x27;s suite of 3D modeling development technologies, 3D Deformable Modeling uses local and global editing features that allow for the creation and manipulation of free-form B-spline and NURBS curves and surfaces.

; Advanced Covering: Advanced Covering is a feature of Deformable Modeling that is now available as a standalone add-on for the 3D ACIS Modeler. This single API uses algorithms to create n-sided surfaces that meet user-specified tolerances for position and continuity on boundaries and on optional internal guiding geometry. Advanced Covering allows a surface to be fit onto circuits (collections of edges that form closed loops) in solid or wire bodies, which is useful in consumer product design. Among other uses, Advanced Covering can be used for end-capping, post-translation corrections, and surface definition from curve data.

; Defeaturing: Defeaturing automatically identifies and removes small features that computer aided engineering analysts typically want to eliminate from the 3D model prior to meshing. Analysts frequently work from the same models that are used for design and manufacture, but these models often carry much more detail than is necessary for simulation or analysis purposes. By removing unnecessary detail, defeaturing simplifies the model, a process that typically is done manually at significant cost.

; CGM HLR: CGM HLR is a hidden line removal (HLR) technology from Spatial based on CATIA V6 technology. CGM HLR is an ACIS-dependent development technology - an ACIS license is required. Though 3D is now the de facto CAD standard in most engineering disciplines, 2D still has a place in industries such as technical illustration, manufacturing, and architecture. Since 3D models are the typical primary output for CAD design, users in these industries require an efficient and accurate method of generating 2D computational drawings directly from the 3D models. Hidden line removal (HLR) is an important aspect of creating an accurate 2D representation from a 3D model. Using HLR, the converted model only displays those parts visible from a given perspective; hidden (or occluded) edges normally included in a 3D model representation are removed, or drawn in a line style that indicates their obscured position.

== File format ==

=== Save File Types ===
ACIS supports two kinds of save files, Standard ACIS Text (SAT), and Standard ACIS Binary (SAB). The two formats store identical information, so the term SAT file is generally used to refer to either when no distinction is needed.

SAT files are ASCII text files that may be viewed with a simple text editor. A SAT file contains carriage returns, white space and other formatting that makes it readable to the human eye. A SAT file has a .sat file extension.

SAB files cannot be viewed with a simple text editor and are meant for compactness and not for human readability. A SAB file has a .sab file extension. A SAB file uses delimiters between elements and binary tags, without additional formatting.

=== Structure of the Save File ===

Specification of SAT format for version 7.0 (circa 2001) has been made publicly available. This allowed external applications, even those not based on ACIS, accessing the data stored in such files. The basic information needed to understand the SAT file format, such as the structure of the save file format, how the data is encapsulated, the types of data written, subtypes and references, is available from this document. However the newer version of ACIS use modified format of SAT files whose specification is not publicly available. Thus reading of modern SAT files requires either using native ACIS library or reverse engineering of the format.

A save file contains:
* a three-line header
* entity records, representing the bulk of the data
* optionally, a begin history data marker
* optionally, old entity records needed for history and rollback
* optionally, an end history data marker
* an end marker

Beginning with ACIS Release 6.3, it is required that the product ID and units be populated for the file header before you can save a SAT file.

== Version Numbers and ACIS Releases ==
ACIS is currently being developed by Spatial. They maintain the concept of a current version (release) number in ACIS, as well as a save version number. The save version allows one to create a SAT save file that can be read by a previous version of ACIS.

Beginning with ACIS Release 4.0, the SAT save file format did not change with minor releases, only with major releases. This allowed applications that are based upon the same major version of ACIS to exchange data without being concerned about the save version. To provide this interoperability in a simple implementation, ACIS save files have contained a symbol that accurately identified the major version number, but not the minor version. This meant that applications created using the same major version of ACIS would produce compatible save files, regardless of their minor versions. This was accomplished by simply not incrementing the internal minor version number between major versions.

Beginning with Release 7.0, ACIS started again providing accurate major, minor, and point version numbers. Beginning with Release 2016 1.0 in September, 2015, Spatial updated to Semantic Versioning, and now describes versions by the model year and major, minor and point releases within that model year.

To summarize how release numbers and SAT changes are related:
* Major release: SAT file changes may be made; significant functionality changes likely; may require significant changes to existing applications
* Minor release: No SAT file changes are made; may provide new functionality; may require some minimal changes to existing applications
* Point release: Minor changes only (bug fixes). (Also known as service packs).

== Adoption ==
In 2023 Alibre Design, BricsCAD,
SpaceClaim, TurboCAD, Cimatron, Viacad, SharkCad and Vertex all used ACIS as their geometric kernel/engine.

<text>Mustard gas or sulfur mustard are names commonly used for the organosulfur chemical compound bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, which has the chemical structure S(CH2CH2Cl)2, as well as other species. In the wider sense, compounds with the substituents are known as &quot;sulfur mustards&quot; or &quot;nitrogen mustards&quot;, respectively, where X = Cl or Br. Such compounds are potent alkylating agents, making mustard gas acutely and severely toxic. Mustard gas is a carcinogen. There is no preventative agent against mustard gas, with protection depending entirely on skin and airways protection, and no antidote exists for mustard poisoning.

Also known as mustard agents, this family of compounds comprises infamous cytotoxins and blister agents with a long history of use as chemical weapons. The name &quot;mustard gas&quot; is technically incorrect; the substances, when dispersed, are often not gases but a fine mist of liquid droplets that can be readily absorbed through the skin and by inhalation. The skin can be affected by contact with either the liquid or vapor. The rate of penetration into skin is proportional to dose, temperature and humidity. 

Sulfur mustards are viscous liquids at room temperature and have an odor resembling mustard plants, garlic, or horseradish, hence the name. When pure, they are colorless, but when used in impure forms, such as in warfare, they are usually yellow-brown. Mustard gases form blisters on exposed skin and in the lungs, often resulting in prolonged illness ending in death.

==History as chemical weapons==
Sulfur mustard is a type of chemical warfare agent. As a chemical weapon, mustard gas was first used in World War I, and has been used in several armed conflicts since then, including the Iran–Iraq War, resulting in more than 100,000 casualties. Sulfur-based and nitrogen-based mustard agents are regulated under Schedule 1 of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, as substances with few uses other than in chemical warfare. Mustard agents can be deployed by means of artillery shells, aerial bombs, rockets, or by spraying from aircraft.

==Adverse health effects==
Mustard gases have powerful blistering effects on victims. They are also carcinogenic and mutagenic alkylating agents. Their high lipophilicity accelerates their absorption into the body. Because mustard agents often do not elicit immediate symptoms, contaminated areas may appear normal. Within 24 hours of exposure, victims experience intense itching and skin irritation. If this irritation goes untreated, blisters filled with pus can form wherever the agent contacted the skin. As chemical burns, these are severely debilitating. 

If the victim&#x27;s eyes were exposed, then they become sore, starting with conjunctivitis (also known as pink eye), after which the eyelids swell, resulting in temporary blindness. Extreme ocular exposure to mustard gas vapors may result in corneal ulceration, anterior chamber scarring, and neovascularization. In these severe and infrequent cases, corneal transplantation has been used as a treatment. Miosis, when the pupil constricts more than usual, may also occur, which may be the result of the cholinomimetic activity of mustard. If inhaled in high concentrations, mustard agents cause bleeding and blistering within the respiratory system, damaging mucous membranes and causing pulmonary edema. Depending on the level of contamination, mustard agent burns can vary between first and second degree burns. They can also be as severe, disfiguring, and dangerous as third degree burns. Some 80% of sulfur mustard in contact with the skin evaporates, while 10% stays in the skin and 10% is absorbed and circulated in the blood.

The carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of exposure to mustard gas increase the risk of developing cancer later in life. In a study of patients 25 years after wartime exposure to chemical weaponry, c-DNA microarray profiling indicated that 122 genes were significantly mutated in the lungs and airways of mustard gas victims. Those genes all correspond to functions commonly affected by mustard gas exposure, including apoptosis, inflammation, and stress responses. The long-term ocular complications include burning, tearing, itching, photophobia, presbyopia, pain, and foreign-body sensations.
===Medical management===
In a rinse-wipe-rinse sequence, skin is decontaminated of mustard gas by washing with liquid soap and water, or an absorbent powder. The eyes should be thoroughly rinsed using saline or clean water. A topical analgesic is used to relieve skin pain during decontamination.

The blistering effects of mustard gas can be neutralized by decontamination solutions such as &quot;DS2&quot; (2% NaOH, 70% diethylenetriamine, 28% 2-methoxyethanol). For skin lesions, topical treatments, such as calamine lotion, steroids, and oral antihistamines are used to relieve itching. Larger blisters are irrigated repeatedly with saline or soapy water, then treated with an antibiotic and petroleum gauze.

Mustard agent burns do not heal quickly and (as with other types of burns) present a risk of sepsis caused by pathogens such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. The mechanisms behind mustard gas&#x27;s effect on endothelial cells are still being studied, but recent studies have shown that high levels of exposure can induce high rates of both necrosis and apoptosis. In vitro tests have shown that at low concentrations of mustard gas, where apoptosis is the predominant result of exposure, pretreatment with 50 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was able to decrease the rate of apoptosis. NAC protects actin filaments from reorganization by mustard gas, demonstrating that actin filaments play a large role in the severe burns observed in victims.

A British nurse treating soldiers with mustard agent burns during World War I commented:

===Mechanism of cellular toxicity===

Sulfur mustards readily eliminate chloride ions by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution to form cyclic sulfonium ions. These very reactive intermediates tend to permanently alkylate nucleotides in DNA strands, which can prevent cellular division, leading to programmed cell death. Alternatively, if cell death is not immediate, the damaged DNA can lead to the development of cancer. Oxidative stress would be another pathology involved in mustard gas toxicity.

In the wider sense, compounds with the structural element BC2H4X, where X is any leaving group and B is a Lewis base, are known as &quot;mustards&quot;. Such compounds can form cyclic &quot;onium&quot; ions (sulfonium, ammonium, etc.) that are good alkylating agents. Other such compounds are bis(2-haloethyl)ethers (oxygen mustards), the (2-haloethyl)amines (nitrogen mustards), and sesquimustard, which has two α-chloroethyl thioether groups (ClC2H4S−) connected by an ethylene bridge (−C2H4−). These compounds have a similar ability to alkylate DNA, but their physical properties vary.

==Formulations==

In its history, various types and mixtures of mustard gas have been employed. These include:
* H – Also known as HS (&quot;Hun Stuff&quot;) or &quot;Levinstein mustard&quot;. This is named after the inventor of the &quot;quick but dirty&quot; Levinstein Process for manufacture, reacting dry ethylene with disulfur dichloride under controlled conditions. Undistilled mustard gas contains 20–30% impurities, which means it does not store as well as HD. Also, as it decomposes, it increases in vapor pressure, making the munition it is contained in likely to split, especially along a seam, releasing the agent to the atmosphere.
* HD – Codenamed Pyro by the British, and Distilled Mustard by the US. Distilled mustard of 95% or higher purity. The term &quot;mustard gas&quot; usually refers to this variety of mustard.
* HT – Codenamed Runcol by the British, and Mustard T- mixture by the US. A mixture of 60% HD mustard and 40% O-mustard, a related vesicant with lower freezing point, lower volatility and similar vesicant characteristics.
* HL – A blend of distilled mustard (HD) and lewisite (L), originally intended for use in winter conditions due to its lower freezing point compared to the pure substances. The lewisite component of HL was used as a form of antifreeze.
* HQ – A blend of distilled mustard (HD) and sesquimustard (Q) (Gates and Moore 1946).
* Yellow Cross – any of several blends containing sulfur mustard and sometimes arsine agents, along with solvents and other additives.

==Commonly-stockpiled mustard agents (class)==
==History==

===Development===
Mustard gases were possibly developed as early as 1822 by César-Mansuète Despretz (1798–1863). Despretz described the reaction of sulfur dichloride and ethylene but never made mention of any irritating properties of the reaction product. In 1854, another French chemist, Alfred Riche (1829–1908), repeated this procedure, also without describing any adverse physiological properties. In 1860, the British scientist Frederick Guthrie synthesized and characterized the mustard agent compound and noted its irritating properties, especially in tasting. Also in 1860, chemist Albert Niemann, known as a pioneer in cocaine chemistry, repeated the reaction, and recorded blister-forming properties. In 1886, Viktor Meyer published a paper describing a synthesis that produced good yields. He combined 2-chloroethanol with aqueous potassium sulfide, and then treated the resulting thiodiglycol with phosphorus trichloride. The purity of this compound was much higher and consequently the adverse health effects upon exposure were much more severe. These symptoms presented themselves in his assistant, and in order to rule out the possibility that his assistant was suffering from a mental illness (psychosomatic symptoms), Meyer had this compound tested on laboratory rabbits, most of which died. In 1913, the English chemist Hans Thacher Clarke (known for the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction) replaced the phosphorus trichloride with hydrochloric acid in Meyer&#x27;s formulation while working with Emil Fischer in Berlin. Clarke was hospitalized for two months for burns after one of his flasks broke. According to Meyer, Fischer&#x27;s report on this accident to the German Chemical Society sent the German Empire on the road to chemical weapons.

Mustard gas can have the effect of turning a patient&#x27;s skin different colors, including shades of red, orange, pink, and in unusual cases, blue. The German Empire during World War I relied on the Meyer-Clarke method because 2-chloroethanol was readily available from the German dye industry of that time.

===Use===
Mustard gas was first used in World War I by the German army against British and Canadian soldiers near Ypres, Belgium, on July 12, 1917, and later also against the French Second Army. Yperite is &quot;a name used by the French, because the compound was first used at Ypres.&quot; The Allies did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at Cambrai, France, after the armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard shells. It took the British more than a year to develop their own mustard agent weapon, with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks (the only option available to the British was the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line.

Mustard gas was originally assigned the name LOST, after the scientists Wilhelm Lommel and Wilhelm Steinkopf, who developed a method of large-scale production for the Imperial German Army in 1916.

Mustard gas was dispersed as an aerosol in a mixture with other chemicals, giving it a yellow-brown color. Mustard agent has also been dispersed in such munitions as aerial bombs, land mines, mortar rounds, artillery shells, and rockets. Exposure to mustard agent was lethal in about 1% of cases. Its effectiveness was as an incapacitating agent. The early countermeasures against mustard agent were relatively ineffective, since a soldier wearing a gas mask was not protected against absorbing it through his skin and being blistered. A common countermeasure was using a urine-soaked mask or facecloth to prevent or reduce injury, a readily available remedy attested by soldiers in documentaries (e.g. &quot;They Shall Not Grow Old&quot; in 2018) and others (such as forward aid nurses) interviewed between 1947 and 1981 by the British Broadcasting Corporation for various World War One history programs; however, the effectiveness of this measure is unclear.

Mustard gas can remain in the ground for weeks, and it continues to cause ill effects. If mustard agent contaminates one&#x27;s clothing and equipment while cold, then other people with whom they share an enclosed space could become poisoned as contaminated items warm up enough material to become an airborne toxic agent. An example of this was depicted in a British and Canadian documentary about life in the trenches, particularly once the &quot;sousterrain&quot; (subways and berthing areas underground) were completed in Belgium and France. Towards the end of World War I, mustard agent was used in high concentrations as an area-denial weapon that forced troops to abandon heavily contaminated areas.

Since World War I, mustard gas has been used in several wars and other conflicts, usually against people who cannot retaliate in kind:
* United Kingdom against the Red Army in 1919
* Alleged British use in Mesopotamia in 1920
* Spain against the Rifian resistance in Morocco during the Rif War of 1921–27 (see also: &quot;Spanish use of chemical weapons in the Rif War&quot;)
* Italy in Libya in 1930
* The Soviet Union in Xinjiang, Republic of China, during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang against the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) in 1934, and also in the Xinjiang War (1937) in 1936–37
* Italy against Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in 1935-1936
* The Japanese Empire against China in 1937–1945 
* The US military conducted experiments with chemical weapons like lewisite and mustard gas on Japanese American, Puerto Rican and African Americans in the US military in World War II to see how non-white races would react to being mustard gassed, with Rollin Edwards describing it as &quot;It felt like you were on fire, guys started screaming and hollering and trying to break out. And then some of the guys fainted. And finally they opened the door and let us out, and the guys were just, they were in bad shape.&quot; and &quot;It took all the skin off your hands. Your hands just rotted&quot;. 
* After World War II, stockpiled mustard gas was dumped by South African military personnel under the command of William Bleloch off Port Elizabeth, resulting in several cases of burns among local trawler crews. 
* The United States Government tested effectiveness on US Naval recruits in a laboratory setting at The Great Lakes Naval Base, June 3, 1945
* The 2 December 1943 air raid on Bari destroyed an Allied stockpile of mustard gas on the SS &quot;John Harvey&quot;, killing 83 and hospitalizing 628. 
* Egypt against North Yemen in 1963–1967
* Iraq against Kurds in the town of Halabja during the Halabja chemical attack in 1988
* Iraq against Iranians in 1983–1988
* Possibly in Sudan against insurgents in the civil war, in 1995 and 1997.
* In the Iraq War, abandoned stockpiles of mustard gas shells were destroyed in the open air, and were used against Coalition forces in roadside bombs.
* By ISIS forces against Kurdish forces in Iraq in August 2015.
* By ISIS against another rebel group in the town of Mare&#x27; in 2015.
* According to Syrian state media, by ISIS against the Syrian Army during the battle in Deir ez-Zor in 2016.

The use of toxic gases or other chemicals, including mustard gas, during warfare is known as chemical warfare, and this kind of warfare was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, and also by the later Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. The latter agreement also prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and sale of such weapons.

In September 2012, a US official stated that the rebel militant group ISIS was manufacturing and using mustard gas in Syria and Iraq, which was allegedly confirmed by the group&#x27;s head of chemical weapons development, Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who has since been captured.

====Development of the first chemotherapy drug====
As early as 1919 it was known that mustard agent was a suppressor of hematopoiesis. In addition, autopsies performed on 75 soldiers who had died of mustard agent during World War I were done by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania who reported decreased counts of white blood cells. This led the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to finance the biology and chemistry departments at Yale University to conduct research on the use of chemical warfare during World War II.

As a part of this effort, the group investigated nitrogen mustard as a therapy for Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and other types of lymphoma and leukemia, and this compound was tried out on its first human patient in December 1942. The results of this study were not published until 1946, when they were declassified. In a parallel track, after the air raid on Bari in December 1943, the doctors of the U.S. Army noted that white blood cell counts were reduced in their patients. Some years after World War II was over, the incident in Bari and the work of the Yale University group with nitrogen mustard converged, and this prompted a search for other similar chemical compounds. Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard called &quot;HN2&quot; became the first cancer chemotherapy drug, chlormethine (also known as mechlorethamine, mustine) to be used. Chlormethine and other mustard gas molecules are still used to this day as an chemotherapy agent albeit they have largely been replaced with more safe chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and carboplatin.

====Disposal====

In the United States, storage and incineration of mustard gas and other chemical weapons were carried out by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency. Disposal projects at the two remaining American chemical weapons sites were carried out near Richmond, Kentucky, and Pueblo, Colorado.

New detection techniques are being developed in order to detect the presence of mustard gas and its metabolites. The technology is portable and detects small quantities of the hazardous waste and its oxidized products, which are notorious for harming unsuspecting civilians. The immunochromatographic assay would eliminate the need for expensive, time-consuming lab tests and enable easy-to-read tests to protect civilians from sulfur-mustard dumping sites.

In 1946, 10,000 drums of mustard gas (2,800 tonnes) stored at the production facility of Stormont Chemicals in Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, were loaded onto 187 boxcars for the journey to be buried at sea on board a long barge south of Sable Island, southeast of Halifax, at a depth of . The dump location is 42 degrees, 50 minutes north by 60 degrees, 12 minutes west.

A large British stockpile of old mustard agent that had been made and stored since World War I at M. S. Factory, Valley near Rhydymwyn in Flintshire, Wales, was destroyed in 1958.

Most of the mustard gas found in Germany after World War II was dumped into the Baltic Sea. Between 1966 and 2002, fishermen have found about 700 chemical weapons in the region of Bornholm, most of which contain mustard gas. One of the more frequently dumped weapons was &quot;Sprühbüchse 37&quot; (SprüBü37, Spray Can 37, 1937 being the year of its fielding with the German Army). These weapons contain mustard gas mixed with a thickener, which gives it a tar-like viscosity. When the content of the SprüBü37 comes in contact with water, only the mustard gas in the outer layers of the lumps of viscous mustard hydrolyzes, leaving behind amber-colored residues that still contain most of the active mustard gas. On mechanically breaking these lumps (e.g., with the drag board of a fishing net or by the human hand) the enclosed mustard gas is still as active as it had been at the time the weapon was dumped. These lumps, when washed ashore, can be mistaken for amber, which can lead to severe health problems. Artillery shells containing mustard gas and other toxic ammunition from World War I (as well as conventional explosives) can still be found in France and Belgium. These were formerly disposed of by explosion undersea, but since the current environmental regulations prohibit this, the French government is building an automated factory to dispose of the accumulation of chemical shells.

In 1972, the U.S. Congress banned the practice of disposing of chemical weapons into the ocean by the United States. 29,000 tons of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean off the United States by the U.S. Army. According to a report created in 1998 by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, the army created at least 26 chemical weapons dumping sites in the ocean offshore from at least 11 states on both the East Coast and the West Coast (in Operation CHASE, Operation Geranium, etc.). In addition, due to poor recordkeeping, about one-half of the sites have only their rough locations known.

In June 1997, India declared its stock of chemical weapons of of mustard gas. By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons/material stockpile and was granted extension for destroying the remaining stocks by April 2009 and was expected to achieve 100 percent destruction within that time frame. India informed the United Nations in May 2009 that it had destroyed its stockpile of chemical weapons in compliance with the international Chemical Weapons Convention. With this India has become the third country after South Korea and Albania to do so. This was cross-checked by inspectors of the United Nations.

Producing or stockpiling mustard gas is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. When the convention entered force in 1997, the parties declared worldwide stockpiles of 17,440 tonnes of mustard gas. As of December 2015, 86% of these stockpiles had been destroyed.

A significant portion of the United States&#x27; mustard agent stockpile was stored at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Approximately 1,621 tons of mustard agents were stored in one-ton containers on the base under heavy guard. A chemical neutralization plant was built on the proving ground and neutralized the last of this stockpile in February 2005. This stockpile had priority because of the potential for quick reduction of risk to the community. The nearest schools were fitted with overpressurization machinery to protect the students and faculty in the event of a catastrophic explosion and fire at the site. These projects, as well as planning, equipment, and training assistance, were provided to the surrounding community as a part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint program of the Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Unexploded shells containing mustard gases and other chemical agents are still present in several test ranges in proximity to schools in the Edgewood area, but the smaller amounts of poison gas () present considerably lower risks. These remnants are being detected and excavated systematically for disposal. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency oversaw disposal of several other chemical weapons stockpiles located across the United States in compliance with international chemical weapons treaties. These include the complete incineration of the chemical weapons stockpiled in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, and Oregon. Earlier, this agency had also completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile located on Johnston Atoll located south of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The largest mustard agent stockpile, at approximately 6,200 short tons, was stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot in northern Utah. The incineration of this stockpile began in 2006. In May 2011, the last of the mustard agents in the stockpile were incinerated at the Deseret Chemical Depot, and the last artillery shells containing mustard gas were incinerated in January 2012.

In 2008, many empty aerial bombs that contained mustard gas were found in an excavation at the Marrangaroo Army Base just west of Sydney, Australia. In 2009, a mining survey near Chinchilla, Queensland, uncovered 144 105-millimeter howitzer shells, some containing &quot;Mustard H&quot;, that had been buried by the U.S. Army during World War II.

In 2014, a collection of 200 bombs was found near the Flemish villages of Passendale and Moorslede. The majority of the bombs were filled with mustard agents. The bombs were left over from the German army and were meant to be used in the Battle of Passchendaele in World War I. It was the largest collection of chemical weapons ever found in Belgium.

A large amount of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, was found in a neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The cleanup was completed in 2021.

====Post-war accidental exposure====
In 2002, an archaeologist at the Presidio Trust archaeology lab in San Francisco was exposed to mustard gas, which had been dug up at the Presidio of San Francisco, a former military base.

In 2010, a clamming boat pulled up some old artillery shells of World War I from the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York. Multiple fishermen suffered from blistering and respiratory irritation severe enough to require hospitalization.

===WWII-era tests on men===

From 1943 to 1944, mustard agent experiments were performed on Australian service volunteers in tropical Queensland, Australia, by Royal Australian Engineers, British Army and American experimenters, resulting in some severe injuries. One test site, the Brook Islands National Park, was chosen to simulate Pacific islands held by the Imperial Japanese Army. These experiments were the subject of the documentary film &quot;Keen as Mustard&quot;.

The United States tested sulfur mustards and other chemical agents including nitrogen mustards and lewisite on up to 60,000 servicemen during and after WWII. The experiments were classified secret and as with Agent Orange, claims for medical care and compensation were routinely denied, even after the WWII-era tests were declassified in 1993. The Department of Veterans Affairs stated that it would contact 4,000 surviving test subjects but failed to do so, eventually only contacting 600. Skin cancer, severe eczema, leukemia, and chronic breathing problems plagued the test subjects, some of whom were as young as 19 at the time of the tests, until their deaths, but even those who had previously filed claims with the VA went without compensation.

African American servicemen were tested alongside white men in separate trials to determine whether their skin color would afford them a degree of immunity to the agents, and Nisei servicemen, some of whom had joined after their release from Japanese American Internment Camps were tested to determine susceptibility of Japanese military personnel to these agents. These tests also included Puerto Rican subjects.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Concentrations of thiodiglycol in urine have been used to confirm a diagnosis of chemical poisoning in hospitalized victims. The presence in urine of 1,1&#x27;-sulfonylbismethylthioethane (SBMTE), a conjugation product with glutathione, is considered a more specific marker, since this metabolite is not found in specimens from unexposed persons. In one case, intact mustard gas was detected in postmortem fluids and tissues of a man who died one week post-exposure.

<doc id="46127" wikidata="Q92638" url="?curid=46127" title="Robert Tarjan">
<text>Robert Endre Tarjan (born April 30, 1948) is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is the discoverer of several graph theory algorithms, including his strongly connected components algorithm, and co-inventor of both splay trees and Fibonacci heaps. Tarjan is currently the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University.

==Personal life and education==
He was born in Pomona, California. His father, George Tarjan (1912-1991), raised in Hungary, was a child psychiatrist, specializing in mental retardation, and ran a state hospital. Robert Tarjan&#x27;s younger brother James became a chess grandmaster. As a child, Robert Tarjan read a lot of science fiction, and wanted to be an astronomer. He became interested in mathematics after reading Martin Gardner&#x27;s mathematical games column in Scientific American. He became seriously interested in math in the eighth grade, thanks to a &quot;very stimulating&quot; teacher.

While he was in high school, Tarjan got a job, where he worked with IBM punch card collators. He first worked with real computers while studying astronomy at the Summer Science Program in 1964.

Tarjan obtained a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology in 1969. At Stanford University, he received his master&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1971 and a Ph.D. in computer science (with a minor in mathematics) in 1972. At Stanford, he was supervised by Robert Floyd and Donald Knuth, both highly prominent computer scientists, and his Ph.D. dissertation was &quot;An Efficient Planarity Algorithm&quot;. Tarjan selected computer science as his area of interest because he believed that computer science was a way of doing mathematics that could have a practical impact.

Tarjan now lives in Princeton, NJ, and Silicon Valley. He is married to Nayla Rizk.
He has three daughters: Alice Tarjan, Sophie Zawacki, and Maxine Tarjan.

==Computer science career==
Tarjan has been teaching at Princeton University since 1985. He has also held academic positions at Cornell University (1972–73), University of California, Berkeley (1973–1975), Stanford University (1974–1980), and New York University (1981–1985). He has also been a fellow of the NEC Research Institute (1989–1997). In April 2013 he joined Microsoft Research Silicon Valley in addition to the position at Princeton. In October 2014 he rejoined Intertrust Technologies as chief scientist.

Tarjan has worked at AT&amp;T Bell Labs (1980–1989), Intertrust Technologies (1997–2001, 2014–present), Compaq (2002) and Hewlett Packard (2006–2013).

===Algorithms and data structures===
Tarjan is known for his pioneering work on graph theory algorithms and data structures. Some of his well-known algorithms include Tarjan&#x27;s off-line least common ancestors algorithm, Tarjan&#x27;s strongly connected components algorithm, and Tarjan&#x27;s bridge-finding algorithm, and he was one of five co-authors of the median of medians linear-time selection algorithm. The Hopcroft–Tarjan planarity testing algorithm was the first linear-time algorithm for planarity testing.

Tarjan has also developed important data structures such as the Fibonacci heap (a heap data structure consisting of a forest of trees), and the splay tree (a self-adjusting binary search tree; co-invented by Tarjan and Daniel Sleator). Another significant contribution was the analysis of the disjoint-set data structure; he was the first to prove the optimal runtime involving the inverse Ackermann function.

==Awards==
Tarjan received the Turing Award jointly with John Hopcroft in 1986. The citation for the award states that it was:

Tarjan was also elected an ACM Fellow in 1994. The citation for this award states:

<doc id="46129" wikidata="Q5975060" url="?curid=46129" title="ITV Digital">
<text>ITV Digital was a British digital terrestrial television broadcaster which launched a pay-TV service on the world&#x27;s first digital terrestrial television network. Its main shareholders were Carlton Communications plc and Granada plc, owners of multiple licences of the ITV network. Starting as ONdigital in 1998, the service was rebranded as ITV Digital in July 2001.

Low audience figures, piracy issues and an ultimately unaffordable multi-million pound deal with the Football League led to the broadcaster suffering large losses, and it entered administration in March 2002. Pay television services ceased permanently on 1 May of that year, but carriage of the remaining free-to-air channels such as BBC One and Channel 4 continued. In October, ITV Digital’s former terrestrial multiplexes were taken over by Crown Castle and the BBC to create the Freeview free-to-air service.

==History==
On 31 January 1997, Carlton Television, Granada Television and satellite company British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) together created British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) as a joint venture, and applied to operate three digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences. They faced competition from a rival, Digital Television Network (DTN), a company created by cable operator CableTel (later known as NTL). On 25 June 1997, BDB won the auction and the Independent Television Commission (ITC) awarded the sole broadcast licence for DTT to the consortium. Then on 20 December 1997, the ITC awarded three pay-TV digital multiplex licences to BDB.

That same year, however, the ITC forced BSkyB out of the consortium on competition grounds; this effectively placed Sky in direct competition with the new service as Sky would also launch its digital satellite service in 1998, although Sky was still required to provide key channels such as Sky Movies and Sky Sports to BDB. With Sky as part of the consortium, British Digital Broadcasting would have paid discounted rates to carry Sky&#x27;s television channels. Instead, with its positioning as a competitor, Sky charged the full market rates for the channels, at an extra cost of around £60million a year to BDB. On 28 July 1998, BDB announced the service would be called ONdigital, and claimed it would be the biggest television brand launch in history. The company would be based in Marco Polo House (since demolished) in Battersea, south London, which was previously the home of BSkyB&#x27;s earlier rival, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).

Six multiplexes were set up, with three of them allocated to the existing analogue broadcasters. The other three multiplexes were auctioned off. ONdigital was given one year from the award of the licence to launch the first DTT service. In addition to launching audio and video services, it also led the specification of an industry-wide advanced interactive engine, based on MHEG-5. This was an open standard that was used by all broadcasters on DTT.

===The launch===

ONdigital was officially launched on 15 November 1998 amid a large public ceremony featuring celebrity Ulrika Jonsson and fireworks around the Crystal Palace transmitting station. Its competitor Sky Digital had already debuted on 1 October. The service launched with 12 primary channels, which included the new BBC Choice and ITV2 channels; a subscription package featuring channels such as Sky One, Cartoon Network, E4, UKTV channels and many developed in-house by Carlton and Granada such as Carlton World; premium channels including Sky Sports 1, 2, 3, Sky Premier and Sky MovieMax; and the newly launched FilmFour.

From the beginning, however, the company was quickly losing money. Supply problems with set-top boxes meant that the company missed Christmas sales and retailers had to wait several months for the customers to receive their boxes. Meanwhile, aggressive marketing by BSkyB for Sky Digital made the ONdigital offer look unattractive. The new digital satellite service provided a dish, digibox, installation and around 200 channels for £159, a lower price than ONdigital at £199. Sky had also launched earlier, meaning they had a head start over the ONdigital service. ONdigital&#x27;s subscription pricing had been set to compare with the older Sky analogue service of 20 channels. In 1999, digital cable services were launched by NTL, Telewest and Cable &amp; Wireless.

In February 1999, ITV secured the rights for UEFA Champions League football matches for four years, which would partly be broadcast through ONdigital. Two sports channels were added to the platform, Champions ON 28 and Champions ON 99 (later renamed ONsport 1 and ONsport 2 when it secured the rights to ATP tennis games), the latter of which timeshared with Carlton Cinema. Throughout 1999, channels including MTV and British Eurosport launched on the platform. The exclusive Carlton Kids and Carlton World channels closed in 2000 to make way for two Discovery channels.

ONdigital reported in April 1999 that it had 110,000 subscribers, while Sky Digital had over 350,000 by that time. By March 2000, there were 673,000 ONdigital customers.

The first interactive digital service was launched in mid-1999, called ONgames. On 7 March 2000, ONmail was launched which provided an interactive e-mail service. A deal with multiplex operator SDN led to the launch of pay-per-view service ONrequest on 1 May 2000. In June 2000, ONoffer was launched. On 18 September 2000, the internet TV service ONnet was launched.

On 17 June 2000, ONdigital agreed to a £315 million three-year deal with the Football League to broadcast 88 live Nationwide League and Worthington Cup matches from the 2001–02 season.

===Setbacks===
In 1999, Sky started to give away their digiboxes for free whilst the customer subscribed. This was a problem for ONdigital, as they had no choice but to sell prepaid set top boxes to win customers back from rival services. Even when they decided to sell prepaid set top boxes (under the ONprepaid brand), they could not easily compete with Sky.

ONdigital&#x27;s growth slowed throughout 2000, and by the start of 2001 the number of subscribers was no longer increasing; meanwhile, its competitor Sky Digital oversaw a dramatic increase in subscribers, spearheaded by the launch of interactive services, such as Open... and Sky Gamestar, and the launch of rival cable digital services from the likes of NTL and Telewest ate into ONdigital&#x27;s subscriber numbers. The ONdigital management team responded with a series of free set-top box promotions, initially at retailers such as Currys and Dixons, when ONdigital receiving equipment was purchased at the same time as a television set or similarly priced piece of equipment. These offers eventually became permanent, with the set-top box loaned to the customer at no charge for as long as they continued to subscribe to ONdigital, an offer that was matched by Sky. ONdigital&#x27;s churn rate, a measure of the number of subscribers leaving the service, reached 28% during 2001.

Additional problems for ONdigital were the choice of 64QAM broadcast mode, which when coupled with far weaker than expected broadcast power, meant that the signal was weak in many areas; a complex pricing structure with many options; a poor-quality subscriber management system (adapted from Canal+); a paper magazine TV guide whereas BSkyB had an electronic programme guide (EPG); insufficient technical customer services; and much signal piracy. While there was a limited return path provided via an in-built 2400 baud modem, there was no requirement, as there was with BSkyB, to connect the set-top box&#x27;s modem to a phone line.

With this combination of factors contributing to the service&#x27;s lack of popularity, in 2001, executives at ONdigital management wrote a letter to the government, asking for emergency funding to finance the service in order to keep it alive due to a lack of customers and paying members.

==== Loaned equipment ====

ONdigital began to sell prepaid set-top boxes (under the name ONprepaid) from November 1999 in order to win customers, especially at the launch of other digital services from the likes of NTL and Telewest. This bundle sold in high street shops and supermarkets at a price that included the set-top box (which was technically on loan) and the first year&#x27;s subscription package. These prepaid boxes amounted to 50% of sales in December 1999. Thousands of these packages were also sold at well below retail price on auction sites such as the then-popular QXL. As the call to activate the viewing card did not require any bank details, many ONdigital boxes which were supposed to be on loan were at unverifiable addresses. This was later changed so a customer could not buy a box without ONdigital verifying their address. Many customers did not activate the viewing card at all, although where the viewer&#x27;s address was known, ONdigital would write informing them that they must activate before a certain deadline.

==== Piracy ====
The ONdigital pay-per-view channels were encrypted using a system – SECA MediaGuard – which had subsequently been cracked by hackers working for NDS Group, the makers of the VideoGuard system that Sky Digital used. ONdigital did not update this system, therefore it was possible to produce and sell counterfeit subscription cards which would give access to all the channels. About 100,000 pirate cards were in circulation by 2002, and these played a role in the demise of the broadcaster that year.

===Rebranding===
In April 2001 it was said that ONdigital would be &#x27;relaunched&#x27; to bring it closer to the ITV network and to better compete with Sky. On 11 July 2001 Carlton and Granada rebranded ONdigital as ITV Digital.

Other services were also rebranded, such as ONnet to ITV Active. A rebranding campaign was launched, with customers being sent ITV Digital stickers to place over the ONdigital logos on their remote controls and set top boxes. The software running on the receivers was not changed, however, and continued to display &#x27;ON&#x27; on nearly every screen. However, iDTVs made after the rebrand removed the &#x27;ON&#x27; prefix from their software. Option 7 on the main menu on iDTVs was also renamed from &quot;ONdigital Updates&quot; to &quot;Subscription Information&quot;.

The rebrand was not without controversy, as SMG plc (owner of Scottish Television and Grampian Television), UTV and Channel Television pointed out that the ITV brand did not belong solely to Carlton and Granada. SMG and UTV initially refused to carry the advertising campaign for ITV Digital and did not allow the ITV Sport Channel space on their multiplex, thus it was not available at launch in most of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The case was resolved in Scotland and the Channel Islands and later still in Northern Ireland, allowing ITV Sport to launch in the non-Carlton and Granada regions, although it was never made available in the Channel Islands, where there was no DTT or cable, and it never appeared on Sky Digital.

Later in 2001, ITV Sport Channel was announced. This would be a premium sport channel, and would broadcast English football games as per the company&#x27;s deal with the Football League in 2000, as well as ATP tennis games and Champions League games previously covered by ONsport 1 and ONsport 2. The channel launched on 11 August of that year, and was also carried on cable by NTL.

===Downfall===
The service reached 1 million subscribers by January 2001, whereas Sky Digital had 5.7 million. Granada reported £69 million in losses in the first six months of 2001, leading some investors to urge it to close or sell ONdigital/ITV Digital. ITV Digital was unable to make a deal to put the ITV Sport Channel on Sky, which could have given the channel access to millions of Sky customers and generated income; the channel was only licensed to cable company NTL. Subscriptions for ONnet/ITV Active, its internet service, peaked at around 100,000 customers. ITV Digital had a 12% share of digital subscribers as of December 2001. ITV Digital and Granada cut jobs that month. By 2002, the company was thought to be losing up to £1 million per day.

In February 2002, Carlton and Granada said that ITV Digital needed an urgent &quot;fundamental restructuring&quot;. The biggest cost the company faced was its three-year deal with the Football League, which had been deemed too expensive by critics when agreed, as it was inferior to the top-flight Premiership coverage from Sky Sports. It was reported on 21 March 2002 that ITV Digital had proposed paying only £50 million for the remaining two years of the Football League deal, a reduction of £129m. Chiefs from the League said that any reduction in the payment could threaten the existence of many football clubs, which had budgeted for large incomes from the television contract.

===Administration===
On 27 March 2002, ITV Digital was placed in administration as it was unable to pay the full amount due to the Football League. Later, as chances of its survival remained bleak, the Football League sued Carlton and Granada, claiming that the firms had breached their contract in failing to deliver the guaranteed income. On 1 August the league lost the case, with the judge ruling that it had &quot;failed to extract sufficient written guarantees&quot;. The league then filed a negligence claim against its own lawyers for failing to press for a written guarantee at the time of the deal with ITV Digital. From this, in June 2006, it was awarded a paltry £4 in damages of the £150m it was seeking. The collapse put in doubt the government&#x27;s ambition to switch off analogue terrestrial TV signals by 2010.

Despite several interested parties, the administrators were unable to find a buyer for the company and effectively put it into liquidation on 26 April 2002. Most subscription channels stopped broadcasting on ITV Digital on 1 May 2002 at 7 am, with only free-to-air services continuing. The next day, ITV chief executive Stuart Prebble quit. In all, 1,500 jobs were lost by ITV Digital&#x27;s collapse. ITV Digital was eventually placed into liquidation on 18 October, with debts of £1.25 billion.

===Post-collapse===
By 30 April 2002, the Independent Television Commission (ITC) had revoked ITV Digital&#x27;s broadcasting licence and started looking for a buyer. A consortium made up of the BBC and Crown Castle submitted an application on 13 June, later joined by BSkyB, and were awarded the licence on 4 July. They launched the Freeview service on 30 October 2002, offering 30 free-to-air TV channels and 20 free-to-air radio channels including several interactive channels such as BBC Red Button and Teletext, but no subscription or premium services. Those followed on 31 March 2004 when Top Up TV began broadcasting 11 pay TV channels in timeshared broadcast slots.

From 10 December 2002, ITV Digital&#x27;s liquidators started to ask customers to return their set top boxes or pay a £39.99 fee. Had this been successful, it could have threatened to undermine the fledgling Freeview service, since at the time most digital terrestrial receivers in households were ONdigital and ITV Digital legacy hardware. In January 2003, Carlton and Granada stepped in and paid £2.8m to the liquidators to allow the boxes to stay with their customers, because at the time the ITV companies received a discount on their broadcasting licence payments based on the number of homes they had converted to digital television. It was also likely done to avoid further negativity towards the two companies.

During the time under administration, Carlton and Granada were in talks regarding a merger, which was eventually cleared in 2004.

====Effect on football clubs====

Following the proposed Football League merger, with the lucrative finances it proposed, ITV Digital&#x27;s collapse had a large effect on many football clubs. Bradford City F.C. was one of the affected, and its debt forced it into administration in May 2002, followed by Leicester City in October.

Barnsley F.C. also entered administration in October 2002, despite the club making a profit for the twelve years prior to the collapse of ITV Digital. Barnsley had budgeted on the basis that the money from the ITV Digital deal would be received, leaving a £2.5 million shortfall in their accounts when the broadcaster collapsed.

Clubs were forced to slash staff, and some players were forced to be sold as they were unable to pay them. Some clubs increased ticket prices for fans to offset the losses.

The rights to show Football League matches were resold to Sky Sports for £95 million for the next four years compared to £315 million over three years from ITV Digital, leading to a reduction from £2 million per season to £700,000 in broadcasting revenue for First Division clubs.

In total, fourteen Football League clubs were placed in administration within four years of the collapse of ITV Digital, compared to four in the four years before.

====News Corporation hacking allegations====
On 31 March 2002, French cable company Canal+ accused Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation in the United States of extracting the UserROM code from its MediaGuard encryption cards and leaking it onto the internet.
Canal+ brought a lawsuit against News Corporation alleging that it, through its subsidiary NDS (which provides encryption technology for Sky and other TV services from Murdoch), had been working on breaking the MediaGuard smartcards used by Canal+, ITV Digital and other non-Murdoch-owned TV companies throughout Europe. The action was later partially dropped after News Corporation agreed to buy Canal+&#x27;s struggling Italian operation Telepiu, a direct rival to a Murdoch-owned company in that country. 
Other legal action by EchoStar/NagraStar was being pursued as late as August 2005, accusing NDS of the same wrongdoing. In 2008, NDS was found to have broken piracy laws by hacking EchoStar Communications&#x27; smart card system, however only $1,500 in statutory damages was awarded.

On 26 March 2012, an investigation from BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; found evidence that one of News Corporation&#x27;s subsidiaries sabotaged ITV Digital. It found that NDS hacked ONdigital/ITV Digital smartcard data and leaked them through a pirate website under Murdoch&#x27;s control – actions which enabled pirated cards to flood the market. The accusations arose from emails obtained by the BBC, and an interview with Lee Gibling, the operator of a hacking website, who claimed he was paid up to £60,000 per year by Ray Adams, NDS&#x27;s head of security. This would mean that Murdoch used computer hacking to directly undermine rival ITV Digital. Lawyers for News Corporation claimed that these accusations of illegal activities against a rival business are &quot;false and libellous&quot;. In June 2013 the Metropolitan Police decided to look into these allegations following a request by Labour MP Tom Watson.

==Marketing==
ITV Digital ran an advertising campaign involving the comedian Johnny Vegas as Al and a knitted monkey simply called Monkey, voiced by Ben Miller. A knitted replica of Monkey could be obtained by signing up to ITV Digital. Because the monkey could not be obtained without signing up to the service, a market for second-hand monkeys developed. At one time, original ITV Digital Monkeys were fetching several hundred pounds on eBay, and knitting patterns delivered by email were sold for several pounds. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Mother. In August 2002, following ITV Digital&#x27;s collapse, Vegas claimed that he was owed money for the advertisements. In early 2007, Monkey and Al reappeared in an advert for PG Tips tea, which at first included a reference to ITV Digital&#x27;s downfall.

<text>Rennes (; ; Gallo: &quot;Resnn&quot;; ) is a city in the east of Brittany in Northwestern France at the confluence of the rivers Ille and Vilaine. Rennes is the prefecture of the Brittany region and Ille-et-Vilaine department. In 2021, its urban area had a population of 371,464 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area had a population of 771,320. The inhabitants of Rennes are called &quot;Rennais&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Rennaises&quot; (feminine) in French.

Rennes&#x27;s history goes back more than 2,000 years to a time when it was a small Gallic village named Condate. Together with Vannes and Nantes, it was one of the major cities of the ancient Duchy of Brittany. From the early sixteenth century until the French Revolution, Rennes was a parliamentary, administrative and garrison city of the historic province of Brittany in the Kingdom of France, as evidenced by its 17th-century Parliament&#x27;s Palace. Rennes played an important role in the Stamped Paper Revolt (Revolt of the papier timbré) in 1675. After the destructive fire of 1720, the medieval wooden center of the city was partially rebuilt in stone. Remaining mostly rural until the Second World War, Rennes underwent significant development in the twentieth century.

Since the 1950s, Rennes has grown in importance through rural flight and modern industrial development, partly in the automotive sector. The city developed extensive building plans to accommodate upwards of 200,000 inhabitants. During the 1980s, Rennes became one of the main centres in telecommunications and high-tech industry. It is now a significant digital innovation centre in France. In 2002, Rennes became the smallest city in the world to have a Metro line.

Labeled a city of art and history, it has preserved an important medieval and classical heritage within its historic center, with over 90 buildings protected as historic monuments. Home to more than 66,000 students in 2016, it is also the eighth-largest university campus of France. In 2018, named Rennes as &quot;the most liveable city in France&quot;.

== History ==
==Administration==
Since 2015, Rennes is divided into 6 cantons (populations as of 2019):

The &quot;&quot; (&quot;city hall&quot;) is right in the centre of Rennes.

===National representation===
The French Prison Service operates the &quot;Centre pénitentiaire de Rennes&quot;, the largest women&#x27;s prison in France.

==Geography==

The ancient centre of the town is built on a hill, with the north side being more elevated than the south side. It is at the confluence of two rivers: the Ille and the Vilaine.

Rennes is located on the European atlantic arc, 50 km from the English Channel (near Saint-Malo, Dinard, and Mont Saint-Michel).

Rennes has the distinction of having a significant Green Belt around its ring road. This Green Belt is a protected area between the city proper (rather dense) and the rest of its urban area (rather rural).

===Climate===

Rennes features an oceanic climate. Precipitation in Rennes is considerably less abundant than in the western parts of Brittany, reaching only half of the levels of, e.g., the city of Quimper, which makes rainfall in Rennes comparable to the levels of large parts of western Germany. Sunshine hours range between 1,700 and 1,850 annually, which is about the amount of sunshine received by the city of Lausanne.

==Demographics==
In 2018, the inner population of the city was 221,272. The Rennes intercommunal structure connecting Rennes with 42 nearby suburbs (named Rennes Métropole) had 450,593 inhabitants and the metropolitan area had a population of nearly 750,000.

Rennes has the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in France after Toulouse and ahead of Montpellier, Bordeaux and Nantes.

==Sights==

===Historic centre===

The historic centre is located on the former plan of the ramparts. There is a difference between the northern city centre and the southern city centre due to the 1720 fire, which destroyed most of the timber-framed houses in the northern part of the city. The rebuilding was done in stone, on a grid plan. The poorer southern part was not rebuilt.

Due to the presence of the &quot;parlement de Bretagne&quot;, many &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; were built in the northern part, the richer half of Rennes in the 18th century. Most of the city&#x27;s monuments historiques can be found there.

Colourful traditional half-timbered houses are situated primarily along the roads of Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Georges, de Saint-Malo, Saint-Guillaume, des Dames, du Chapitre, Vasselot, Saint-Michel, de la Psallette and around the plazas of Champ-Jacquet, des Lices, Saint-Anne and Rallier-du-Baty.

==== The Parlement de Bretagne and city hall area ====
The &quot;Parlement de Bretagne&quot; (Administrative and judicial centre of Brittany, ) is the most famous 17th century building in Rennes. It was rebuilt after a terrible fire in 1994 that may have been caused by a flare fired by a protester during a demonstration. It houses the Rennes Court of Appeal. The surrounding plaza is built in the classical style.

In the west, the Place de la Mairie (City Hall Plaza, Plasenn Ti Kêr):
* City Hall
* Opera

In the east, at the end of the &quot;Rue Saint-Georges&quot; with traditional half-timbered houses:

Also in this area are the former St. Yves chapel, which is now the tourist office and a local historical museum, and the Basilica Saint-Sauveur.

==== Remains of the ramparts ====
Built from the 3rd to the 12th centuries, the ramparts were largely destroyed between the beginning of the 16th century and the 1860s.

* Place Saint-Anne (Plasenn Santez-Anna)
* Saint-Aubin Church, built in the beginning of the 20th century
* Location of a former 14th century hospital

In the south-west of the area, &quot;La Rue Saint-Michel&quot; nicknamed &quot;Rue de La Soif&quot; (&quot;Road of Thirst&quot;), is known for its many bars. Meanwhile, in the south-east, the Place du Champ-Jacquet features Renaissance buildings and a statue of mayor Jean Leperdit ripping up a conscription list.

<doc id="46133" wikidata="Q847583" url="?curid=46133" title="Cardiomyopathy">
<text>Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
As of 2013, cardiomyopathies are defined as &quot;disorders characterized by morphologically and functionally abnormal myocardium in the absence of any other disease that is sufficient, by itself, to cause the observed phenotype.&quot; Types of cardiomyopathy include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome). In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the heart muscle enlarges and thickens. In dilated cardiomyopathy the ventricles enlarge and weaken. In restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricle stiffens.
In many cases, the cause cannot be determined. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually inherited, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy is inherited in about one third of cases. Dilated cardiomyopathy may also result from alcohol, heavy metals, coronary artery disease, cocaine use, and viral infections. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be caused by amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and some cancer treatments. Broken heart syndrome is caused by extreme emotional or physical stress.
Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and the severity of symptoms. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery. Surgery may include a ventricular assist device or heart transplant. In 2015 cardiomyopathy and myocarditis affected 2.5 million people. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects about 1 in 500 people while dilated cardiomyopathy affects 1 in 2,500. They resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is more common in young people.

==Signs and symptoms==

The presentation of cardiomyopathy is:
* Shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially with physical exertion
* Fatigue
* Swelling in the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen and veins in the neck
* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fainting during physical activity
* Arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats)
* Chest pain, especially after physical exertion or heavy meals
* Heart murmurs (unusual sounds associated with heartbeats)

==Causes==

Cardiomyopathies can be of genetic (familial) or non-genetic (acquired) origin. Genetic cardiomyopathies usually are caused by sarcomere or cytoskeletal diseases, neuromuscular disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, malformation syndromes and sometimes are unidentified. Non-genetic cardiomyopathies can have definitive causes such as viral infections, myocarditis and others.

Cardiomyopathies are either confined to the heart or are part of a generalized systemic disorder, both often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability. Other diseases that cause heart muscle dysfunction are excluded, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, or abnormalities of the heart valves. Often, the underlying cause remains unknown, but in many cases the cause may be identifiable. Alcoholism, for example, has been identified as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy, as has drug toxicity, and certain infections (including Hepatitis C). Untreated celiac disease can cause cardiomyopathies, which can completely reverse with a timely diagnosis. In addition to acquired causes, molecular biology and genetics have given rise to the recognition of various genetic causes.

A more clinical categorization of cardiomyopathy as &#x27;hypertrophied&#x27;, &#x27;dilated&#x27;, or &#x27;restrictive&#x27;, has become difficult to maintain because some of the conditions could fulfill more than one of those three categories at any particular stage of their development.

The current American Heart Association (AHA) definition divides cardiomyopathies into primary, which affect the heart alone, and secondary, which are the result of illness affecting other parts of the body. These categories are further broken down into subgroups which incorporate new genetic and molecular biology knowledge.

==Mechanism==
The pathophysiology of cardiomyopathies is better understood at the cellular level with advances in molecular techniques. Mutant proteins can disturb cardiac function in the contractile apparatus (or mechanosensitive complexes). Cardiomyocyte alterations and their persistent responses at the cellular level cause changes that are correlated with sudden cardiac death and other cardiac problems.

Cardiomyopathies are generally varied individually. Different factors can cause cardiomyopathies in adults as well as children. For example, dilated cardiomyopathy in adults is associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular diseases, and genetics. In children, neuromuscular diseases such as Becker muscular dystrophy or X-linked genetic disorder, are directly linked with cardiomyopathies.

==Diagnosis==

Among the diagnostic procedures done to determine a cardiomyopathy are:
* Physical exam
* Family history
* Blood test
* ECG
* Echocardiogram
* Stress test
* Genetic testing

===Classification===
Cardiomyopathies can be classified using different criteria:
* Primary/intrinsic cardiomyopathies
** Congenital
*** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
*** Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
*** Left ventricular noncompaction
*** Ion Channelopathies like the Long QT syndrome and the very rare Short QT syndrome
*** Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
** Mixed
*** Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
*** Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)
*** Brugada syndrome
** Acquired
*** Stress cardiomyopathy
*** Myocarditis, inflammation of and injury to heart tissue due in part to its infiltration by lymphocytes and monocytes
*** Eosinophilic myocarditis, inflammation of and injury to heart tissue due in part to its infiltration by eosinophils
*** Ischemic cardiomyopathy (&quot;not formally included in the classification, due to ischemic cardiomyopathy being a direct result of another cardiac problem&quot;)
* Secondary/extrinsic cardiomyopathies
** Metabolic/storage
*** Fabry&#x27;s disease
*** Hemochromatosis
** Endomyocardial
*** Endomyocardial fibrosis
*** Hypereosinophilic syndrome
** Endocrine
*** Diabetes mellitus
*** Hyperthyroidism
*** Acromegaly
** Cardiofacial
*** Noonan syndrome
** Neuromuscular
*** Muscular dystrophy
*** Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia
** Other
*** Obesity-associated cardiomyopathy

==Treatment==
Treatment may include suggestion of lifestyle changes to better manage the condition. Treatment depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and condition of disease, but may include medication (conservative treatment) or iatrogenic/implanted pacemakers for slow heart rates, defibrillators for those prone to fatal heart rhythms, ventricular assist devices (VADs) for severe heart failure, or catheter ablation for recurring dysrhythmias that cannot be eliminated by medication or mechanical cardioversion. The goal of treatment is often symptom relief, and some patients may eventually require a heart transplant.

Acoramidis (Attruby) was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2024, to treat adults with cardiomyopathy of wild-type or variant (hereditary) transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) to reduce death and hospitalization related to heart problems.

<text>Robert Bylot () was an English explorer who made four voyages to the Arctic. He was uneducated and from a working-class background, but was able to rise to rank of master in the English Royal Navy.

== Voyages ==

=== Robert Bylot ===

==== First voyage, 1610–1611 ====
Bylot was first mate on the during Henry Hudson&#x27;s 1610–1611 expedition into what is now known as Hudson Bay. In the spring of 1611, Hudson wanted to continue the expedition, but the crew wanted to return home. There was discontent between the captain and members of the crew, and was stripped of his rank.

Later there was a mutiny in which Hudson, his son and several sailors were set adrift in an open boat in James Bay. It was due to Bylot&#x27;s navigational skills that &quot;Discovery&quot; was able to return from the Arctic safely; Hudson and his party were never seen again. Upon return to England, Bylot was tried as a mutineer but was pardoned.

==== Second voyage, 1612–1613 ====
Bylot returned to Hudson Bay in 1612 with Sir Thomas Button. They wintered over at the mouth of the Nelson River, and in the spring of 1613, continued north. They were able to reach [[65th parallel north|], then returned to England.

=== Northwest Passage ===

==== First voyage, 1615 ====
In 1615, the [[Muscovy Company]] hired Bylot to find the [[Northwest Passage]] as captain of &quot;Discovery&quot;. [[William Baffin]] was the pilot. They sailed west from [[Hudson Strait]] and were blocked by ice at [[Frozen Strait]].

==== Second voyage, 1616 ====
The following year, the Muscovy Company again hired Bylot and Baffin to continue to search for the Northwest Passage. The voyage resulted in several notable achievements. First was the circumnavigation and mapping of what is now called [[Baffin Bay]]. Second was the discovery of [[Smith Sound]], by which the [[North Pole]] would eventually be reached. Third was the discovery of [[Lancaster Sound]], through which the Northwest Passage would eventually be found three centuries later.

== Legacy ==
Bylot and Baffin&#x27;s work in Baffin Bay was doubted by cartographers back in England. As late as 1812, some charts of the area only showed a dotted bulge with the words: &quot;Baffin&#x27;s Bay according to the relation of W. Baffin in 1616, but not now believed.&quot;

When the bay was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by [[John Ross (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Ross]] in 1818, the records of the Bylot–Baffin voyage proved extremely accurate. In England, almost total credit for the discovery was given to Baffin, and Bylot was virtually ignored. Historian [[Farley Mowat]] speculated two possible reasons for this: Bylot&#x27;s lack of education and lower position relative to Baffin in English society, and his involvement in the mutiny during Hudson&#x27;s expedition.

[[Bylot Island]], off the northern end of [[Baffin Island]] and one of the more dramatic of the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], was named after him.

<text>George Philip Lakoff ( ; born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist and philosopher, best known for his thesis that people&#x27;s lives are significantly influenced by the conceptual metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena.

The conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and Mark Johnson&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;Metaphors We Live By&quot; has found applications in a number of academic disciplines. Applying it to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led Lakoff into territory normally considered basic to political science. In his 1996 book &quot;Moral Politics&quot;, Lakoff described conservative voters as being influenced by the &quot;strict father model&quot; as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the state, and liberal/progressive voters as being influenced by the &quot;nurturant parent model&quot; as the folk psychological metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual&#x27;s experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being framed in linguistic constructions. In &quot;Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Persian Gulf&quot; (1991), he argues that the American involvement in the Persian Gulf War was obscured or &quot;spun&quot; by the metaphors which were used by the first Bush administration to justify it. Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank, the now defunct Rockridge Institute.

Lakoff is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundación IDEAS (IDEAS Foundation), Spain&#x27;s Socialist Party&#x27;s think tank. The more general theory that elaborated his thesis is known as embodied mind. Lakoff served as a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1972 until his retirement in 2016. He was married to linguist Robin Lakoff.

==Work==

===Reappraisal of metaphor===
Although some of Lakoff&#x27;s research involves questions traditionally pursued by linguists - such as the conditions under which a certain linguistic construction is grammatically viable - he has become best known for his reappraisal of the role that metaphors play in the socio-political activity of humans. The Western scientific tradition has seen metaphor as a purely linguistic construction. The essential thrust of Lakoff&#x27;s work has been to argue that metaphors are a primarily conceptual construction and are in fact central to the development of thought.

In his words: &quot;Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.&quot; According to Lakoff, non-metaphorical thought is possible only when we talk about purely physical reality; the greater the level of abstraction, the more layers of metaphor are required to express that abstraction. People do not notice these metaphors for various reasons, including that some metaphors become &quot;dead&quot; in the sense that we no longer recognize their origin. Another reason is that we just do not &quot;see&quot; what is &quot;going on&quot;.

In intellectual debate, for instance, the underlying metaphor - according to Lakoff - is usually that argument is war (later revised to &quot;argument is struggle&quot;):
*He &quot;won&quot; the argument.
*Your claims are &quot;indefensible&quot;.
*He &quot;shot down&quot; all my arguments.
*His criticisms were &quot;right on target&quot;.
*If you use that &quot;strategy&quot;, he&#x27;ll &quot;wipe you out&quot;.

According to Lakoff, the development of thought has been the process of developing better metaphors. He also points out that the application of one domain of knowledge to another offers new perceptions and understandings.

===Linguistics wars===

Lakoff began his career as a student and later as a teacher of the theory of transformational grammar developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Noam Chomsky. In the late 1960s, however, he joined with others to promote generative semantics as an alternative to Chomsky&#x27;s generative syntax. In an interview he stated:
During that period, I was attempting to unify Chomsky&#x27;s transformational grammar with formal logic. I had helped work out a lot of the early details of Chomsky&#x27;s theory of grammar. Noam claimed then — and still does, so far as I can tell — that syntax is independent of meaning, context, background knowledge, memory, cognitive processing, communicative intent, and every aspect of the body...In working through the details of his early theory, I found quite a few cases where semantics, context, and other such factors entered into rules governing the syntactic occurrences of phrases and morphemes. I came up with the beginnings of an alternative theory in 1963 and, along with wonderful collaborators like &quot;Haj&quot; Ross and Jim McCawley, developed it through the sixties.
Lakoff&#x27;s claim that Chomsky asserts independence between syntax and semantics has been rejected by Chomsky, who holds the following view: A decision as to the boundary separating syntax and semantics (if there is one) is not a prerequisite for theoretical and descriptive study of syntactic and semantic rules. On the contrary, the problem of delimitation will clearly remain open until these fields are much better understood than they are today. Exactly the same can be said about the boundary separating semantic systems from systems of knowledge and belief. That these seem to interpenetrate in obscure ways has long been noted….

In response to Lakoff&#x27;s making the above claim about Chomsky&#x27;s view, Chomsky claimed that Lakoff has &quot;virtually no comprehension of the work he is discussing&quot;. Despite Lakoff&#x27;s mischaracterization of Chomsky&#x27;s view on the matter, their linguistic positions diverge significantly; this rift between Generative Grammar and Generative Semantics led to fierce, acrimonious debates among linguists that have come to be known as the &quot;linguistics wars&quot;.

===Embodied mind===

When Lakoff claims the mind is &quot;embodied&quot;, he is arguing that almost all of human cognition, up through the most abstract reasoning, depends on and makes use of such concrete and &quot;low-level&quot; facilities as the sensorimotor system and the emotions. Therefore, embodiment is a rejection not only of dualism vis-a-vis mind and matter, but also of claims that human reason can be basically understood without reference to the underlying &quot;implementation details&quot;. Lakoff offers three complementary but distinct sorts of arguments in favor of embodiment:
* First, using evidence from neuroscience and neural-network simulations, he argues that certain concepts - such as color and spatial relation concepts (e.g. &quot;red&quot; or &quot;over&quot;; see also &quot;qualia&quot;) - can be almost entirely understood through the examination of how processes of perception or motor control work.
* Second, based on cognitive linguistics&#x27; analysis of figurative language, he argues that the reasoning we use for such abstract topics as warfare, economics, or morality is somehow rooted in the reasoning we use for such mundane topics as spatial relationships (see conceptual metaphor).
* Finally, based on research in cognitive psychology and some investigations in the philosophy of language, he argues that very few of the categories used by humans are actually of the black-and-white type amenable to analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. On the contrary, most categories are supposed to be much more complicated and messy, just like our bodies. &quot;We are neural beings&quot;, Lakoff states, &quot;Our brains take their input from the rest of our bodies. What our bodies are like and how they function in the world thus structures the very concepts we can use to think. We cannot think just anything — only what our embodied brains permit.&quot;

Lakoff envisages consciousness as neurally embodied, however he explicitly states that the mechanism is not just neural computation alone. Using the concept of , Lakoff supports the physicalist approach to the afterlife. If the soul can not have any of the properties of the body, then Lakoff claims it can not feel, perceive, think, be conscious, or have a personality. If this is true, then Lakoff asks what would be the point of the afterlife? Many scientists share the belief that there are problems with falsifiability and foundation ontologies purporting to describe &quot;what exists&quot;, to a sufficient degree of rigor to establish a reasonable method of empirical validation. But Lakoff takes this further to explain why hypotheses built with complex metaphors cannot be directly falsified. Instead, they can only be rejected based on interpretations of empirical observations guided by other complex metaphors. This is what he means when he says that falsifiability itself can never be established by any reasonable method that would not rely ultimately on a shared human bias. The bias he&#x27;s referring to is the set of conceptual metaphors governing how people interpret observations.

Lakoff is, with coauthors Mark Johnson and Rafael E. Núñez, one of the primary proponents of the embodied mind thesis. Lakoff discussed these themes in his 2001 Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow, published as &quot;The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding&quot;. Others who have written about the embodied mind include philosopher Andy Clark (See his &quot;Being There&quot;), philosophers and neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela and Varela&#x27;s student Evan Thompson, roboticists such as Rodney Brooks, Rolf Pfeifer and Tom Ziemke, the physicist David Bohm (see his &quot;Thought As A System&quot;), Ray Gibbs (see his &quot;Embodiment and Cognitive Science&quot;), John Grinder and Richard Bandler in their neuro-linguistic programming, and Julian Jaynes. The work of these writers can be traced back to earlier philosophical writings, most notably in the phenomenological tradition, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961) and Heidegger (1889–1976). The basic thesis of &quot;embodied mind&quot; is also traceable to the American contextualist or pragmatist tradition, notably to John Dewey in such works as &quot;Art as Experience&quot; (1934).

===Mathematics===
According to Lakoff, even mathematics is subjective to the human species and its cultures: thus &quot;any question of math&#x27;s being inherent in physical reality is moot, since there is no way to know whether or not it is&quot;. By this, he is saying that there is nothing outside of the thought structures we derive from our embodied minds that we can use to &quot;prove&quot; that mathematics is somehow beyond biology. Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez (2000) argue at length that mathematical and philosophical ideas are best understood in light of the embodied mind.
The philosophy of mathematics ought therefore to look to the current scientific understanding of the human body as a foundation ontology, and should abandon self-referential attempts to ground the operational components of mathematics in anything other than &quot;meat&quot;.

Mathematical reviewers have generally been critical of Lakoff and Núñez, pointing to mathematical errors. Lakoff claims that these errors have been corrected in subsequent printings. Although Lakoff and Núñez&#x27;s book attempts a refutation of some of the most widely accepted viewpoints in the philosophy of mathematics and advice for how the field might proceed, its authors have yet to elicit much of a reaction from philosophers of mathematics themselves. The small community specializing in the psychology of mathematical learning, to which Núñez belongs, is paying attention.

Lakoff has also claimed that we should remain agnostic about whether math is somehow wrapped up with the very nature of the universe. Early in 2001 Lakoff told the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS): &quot;Mathematics may or may not be out there in the world, but there&#x27;s no way that we scientifically could possibly tell.&quot; This is because the structures of scientific knowledge are not &quot;out there&quot; but rather in our brains, based on the details of our anatomy. Therefore, we cannot &quot;tell&quot; that mathematics is &quot;out there&quot; without relying on conceptual metaphors rooted in our biology. This claim bothers those who believe that there really is a way we could &quot;tell&quot;. The falsifiability of this claim is perhaps the central problem in the cognitive science of mathematics, a field that attempts to establish a foundation ontology based on the human cognitive and scientific process.

Lakoff has publicly expressed some of his political views and his ideas about the conceptual structures that he views as central to understanding the political process. He almost always discusses the former in terms of the latter. &quot;Moral Politics&quot; (1996, revisited in 2002) gives book-length consideration to the conceptual metaphors that Lakoff sees as present in the minds of American &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot;. The book is a blend of cognitive science and political analysis. Lakoff makes an attempt to keep his personal views confined to the last third of the book, where he explicitly argues for the superiority of the liberal vision.

Lakoff argues that the differences in opinions between liberals and conservatives follow from the fact that they subscribe with different strength to two different central metaphors about the relationship of the state to its citizens. Both, he claims, see governance through metaphors of the family. Conservatives would subscribe more strongly and more often to a model that he calls the &quot;strict father model&quot; and has a family structured around a strong, dominant &quot;father&quot; (government), and assumes that the &quot;children&quot; (citizens) need to be disciplined to be made into responsible &quot;adults&quot; (morality, self-financing). Once the &quot;children&quot; are &quot;adults&quot;, though, the &quot;father&quot; should not interfere with their lives: the government should stay out of the business of those in society who have proved their responsibility. In contrast, Lakoff argues that liberals place more support in a model of the family, which he calls the &quot;nurturant parent model&quot;, based on &quot;nurturant values&quot;, where both &quot;mothers&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot; work to keep the essentially good &quot;children&quot; away from &quot;corrupting influences&quot; (pollution, social injustice, poverty, etc.). Lakoff says that most people have a blend of both metaphors applied at different times, and that political speech works primarily by invoking these metaphors and urging the subscription of one over the other.

Lakoff further argues that one of the reasons liberals have had difficulty since the 1980s is that they have not been as aware of their own guiding metaphors, and have too often accepted conservative terminology framed in a way to promote the strict father metaphor. Lakoff insists that liberals must cease using terms like &quot;partial birth abortion&quot; and &quot;tax relief&quot; because they are manufactured specifically to allow the possibilities of only certain types of opinions. &quot;Tax relief&quot; for example, implies explicitly that taxes are an affliction, something someone would want &quot;relief&quot; from. To use the terms of another metaphoric worldview, Lakoff insists, is to unconsciously support it. Liberals must support linguistic think tanks in the same way that conservatives do if they are going to succeed in appealing to those in the country who share their metaphors.

Lakoff offers advice about how to counteract politicians&#x27; lies. He maintains that the act of stating that a lie is false reinforces the lie because it repeats the way the lie is framed. Instead, he recommends what he calls a &quot;truth sandwich&quot;:

&quot;1. Start with the truth. The first frame gets the advantage.
2. Indicate the lie. Avoid amplifying the specific language if possible.
3. Return to the truth. Always repeat truths more than lies.&quot;

Lakoff calls this a &quot;truth sandwich&quot; even though the baloney is in the middle. The position of the lie avoids both primacy and recency effects.

Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a progressive think tank, the Rockridge Institute, an involvement that follows in part from his recommendations in &quot;Moral Politics&quot;. Among his activities with the institute, which concentrates in part on helping liberal candidates and politicians with re-framing political metaphors, Lakoff has given numerous public lectures and written accounts of his message from &quot;Moral Politics.&quot; In 2008, Lakoff joined Fenton Communications, the nation&#x27;s largest public interest communications firm, as a Senior Consultant. One of his political works, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate&quot;, self-labeled as &quot;the Essential Guide for Progressives&quot;, was published in September 2004 and features a foreword by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean.

==Disagreement with Steven Pinker==
In 2006 Steven Pinker wrote an unfavorable review of Lakoff&#x27;s book &quot;Whose Freedom?&quot; in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Pinker argued that Lakoff&#x27;s propositions are unsupported, and his prescriptions are a recipe for electoral failure. He wrote that Lakoff was condescending and deplored Lakoff&#x27;s &quot;shameless caricaturing of beliefs&quot; and his &quot;faith in the power of euphemism.&quot; Pinker portrayed Lakoff&#x27;s arguments as &quot;cognitive relativism, in which mathematics, science, and philosophy are beauty contests between rival frames rather than attempts to characterize the nature of reality.&quot; Lakoff wrote a rebuttal to the review, stating that his position on many matters is the exact reverse of what Pinker attributes to him. Lakoff states that he explicitly rejects cognitive relativism, arguing that he is &quot;a realist, both about how the mind works and how the world works. Given that the mind works by frames and metaphors, the challenge is to use such a mind to accurately characterize how the world works.&quot;

<doc id="46136" wikidata="Q9500" url="?curid=46136" title="The Football Association">
<text>The Football Association (the FA) is the governing body of association football in England and the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Formed in 1863, it is the oldest football association in the world and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the amateur and professional game in its territory.

The FA facilitates all competitive football matches within its remit at national level, and indirectly at local level through the county football associations. It runs numerous competitions, the most famous of which is the FA Cup. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and youth national football teams.

The FA is a member of both UEFA and FIFA and holds a permanent seat on the International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is responsible for the Laws of the Game. As the first football association, it does not use the national name &quot;English&quot; in its title. The FA is based at Wembley Stadium, London. The FA is a member of the British Olympic Association, meaning that the FA has control over the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Great Britain Olympic football team.

All of England&#x27;s professional football teams are members of the Football Association. Although it does not run the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, it has veto power over the appointment of the league chairman and chief executive and over any changes to league rules. The English Football League, made up of the three fully professional divisions below the Premier League, is self-governing, subject to the FA&#x27;s sanctions.

==History==
For centuries before the first meeting of the Football Association in the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern on Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally accepted rules for playing football. Ebenezer Cobb Morley, as captain of Barnes, in 1862 wrote to &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; newspaper proposing a governing body for the sport &quot;with the object of establishing a definite code of rules for the regulation of the game&quot;; the letter led to the first meeting at The Freemasons&#x27; Tavern that created the FA in 1863. Morley was a founding member. Six meetings near London&#x27;s Covent Garden, at 81–82 Long Acre, ended in a split between the Association football and Rugby football. Both of them had their own uniforms, rituals, gestures and highly formalised rules.

In each public school the game was formalised according to local conditions; but when the schoolboys reached university, chaos ensued when the players used different rules, so members of the University of Cambridge devised and published a set of Cambridge Rules in 1848 which was widely adopted. Another set of rules, the Sheffield Rules, was used by a number of clubs in the North of England from the 1850s.

Eleven London football clubs and schools representatives met on 26 October 1863 to agree on common rules. The founding clubs present at the first meeting were:
* Barnes, 
* Civil Service, 
* Crusaders, 
* Forest of Leytonstone (later to become Wanderers F.C.), 
* N.N. (No Names) Club (Kilburn), 
* the original Crystal Palace, 
* the original Blackheath, 
* Kensington School, 
* Perceval House (Blackheath), 
* Surbiton F.C.,
* Blackheath Proprietary School.

Charterhouse sent their captain, B.F. Hartshorne, but declined the offer to join. Many of these clubs are now defunct or still play rugby. Civil Service FC, who now plays in the Southern Amateur League, is the only one of the original eleven football clubs still in existence, with an unbroken history, and playing association football, although Forest School has been a member since the fifth meeting in December 1863. Both Barnes and Wanderers have been refounded as football clubs in the modern era.

Ebenezer Cobb Morley was the FA&#x27;s first secretary (1863–66) and its second president (1867–74) and drafted the Laws of the Game generally called the &quot;London Rules&quot; at his home in Barnes, London. He played in the first-ever match in 1863.
The first version of the rules for the modern game was drawn up over a series of six meetings held in The Freemasons&#x27; Tavern from October till December. Of the clubs at the first meeting, Crusaders, Surbiton and Charterhouse did not attend the subsequent meetings, replaced instead by the Royal Navy School, Wimbledon School and Forest School. 
===Split from rugby===
At the final meeting, F. M. Campbell, the first FA treasurer and the Blackheath representative, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting, the first which allowed for the running with the ball in hand and the second, obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA but instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The term &quot;soccer&quot; dates back to this split to refer to football played under the &quot;association&quot; rules. After six clubs had withdrawn as they supported the opposing Rugby Rules, the Football Association had just nine members in January 1864: Barnes, Kilburn, Crystal Palace, War Office (Civil Service), Forest Club, Forest School, Sheffield, Uppingham and Royal Engineers (Chatham).

An inaugural game using the new FA rules was initially scheduled for Battersea Park on 2 January 1864, but enthusiastic members of the FA could not wait for the new year: the first game under F. A. rules was played at Mortlake on 19 December 1863 between Morley&#x27;s Barnes team and their neighbours Richmond (who were not members of the FA), ending in a goalless draw. The Richmond side were obviously unimpressed by the new rules in practice because they subsequently helped form the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The Battersea Park game was the first exhibition game using FA rules, and was played there on Saturday 9 January 1864. The members of the opposing teams for this game were chosen by the President of the FA (A. Pember) and the Secretary (E. C. Morley) and included many well-known footballers of the day. After the first match according to the new FA rules a toast was given &quot;Success to football, irrespective of class or creed&quot;.

Another notable match was London v Sheffield, in which a representative team from the FA played Sheffield FC under Association rules in March 1866; Charles Alcock described this game as &quot;first [match] of any importance under the auspices of the Football Association&quot;. Alcock (of Harrow School) of the Wanderers was elected to the committee of the FA in 1866, becoming its first full-time secretary and treasurer in 1870. He masterminded the creation of the Football Association Cup—the longest-running association football competition in the world—in 1871. Fifteen participating clubs subscribed to purchase a trophy. The first Cup Final was held at The Oval on 16 March 1872, fought between the Wanderers and the Royal Engineers (RE), watched by 2,000 spectators. In 1874 Francis Marindin became the third president of the Football Association.

===Single set of laws===

After many years of wrangling between the London-based Football Association and the Sheffield Football Association, the FA Cup brought the acceptance that one undisputed set of laws was required. The two associations had played 16 inter-association matches under differing rules; the Sheffield Rules, the London Rules and Mixed Rules. In April 1877, those laws were set with a number of Sheffield Rules being incorporated. In 1890 Arthur Kinnaird replaced Major Francis Marindin, becoming the fourth president of the Football Association. Kinnaird had at that time been a FA committeeman since the age of 21, in 1868. Kinnaird remained president for the next 33 years, until his death in 1923.

The FA Cup was initially contested by mostly southern, amateur teams, but more professionally organised northern clubs began to dominate the competition during the early 1880s; &quot;The turning point, north replacing south, working class defeating upper and professionals impinging upon the amateurs&#x27; territory, came in 1883.&quot; Hitherto, public school sides had played a dribbling game punctuated by violent tackles, but a new passing style developed in Scotland was successfully adopted by some Lancashire teams, along with a more organised approach to training. Blackburn Olympic reached the final in March 1883 and defeated Old Etonians. Near-neighbours Blackburn Rovers started to pay players, and the following season won the first of three consecutive FA Cups. The FA initially tried to outlaw professionalism but, in the face of a threatened breakaway body (the British Football Association), by 1885 was forced to permit payments to players. Three years later, in 1888, the first Football League was established, formed by six professional clubs from northwest England and six from the midlands.

In 1992, the Football Association took control of the newly created Premier League which consisted of 22 clubs who had broken away from the First Division of the Football League. The Premier League reduced to 20 clubs in 1995 and is one of the richest football leagues in the world.

The Football Association has updated their logo several times. They celebrated their 150th year with a special 2013–2014 season logo. The shield design (taken from the coat of arms of the Football Association) is the same, but the three lions, rosettes and border are in gold instead of black and red, with the usual white background. The title strip above reads &quot;The FA&quot; in white on gold, and there is a scroll below reading &quot;150 years&quot; in white on gold, between &quot;1863&quot; and &quot;2013&quot;.

===Women&#x27;s football===
By 1921 women&#x27;s football had become increasingly popular through the charitable games played by women&#x27;s teams during and after the First World War. In a move that was widely seen as caused by jealousy of the crowds&#x27; interest in women&#x27;s games which frequently exceeded that of the top men&#x27;s teams, in 1921 the Football Association banned all women&#x27;s teams from playing on grounds affiliated to the FA because they thought football damaged women&#x27;s bodies. For several decades, this meant that women&#x27;s football virtually ceased to exist.

The decision to exclude women was only reversed from 1969 when, after the increased interest in football caused by England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup triumph, the Women&#x27;s Football Association was founded, although it would take a further two years – and an order from UEFA – to force the (men&#x27;s) Football Association to remove its restrictions on the playing rights of women&#x27;s teams. It was not until 1983 that the WFA was able to affiliate to the FA as a &quot;County Association&quot; and only in 1993 did the FA found the &quot;Women&#x27;s Football Committee&quot; to run women&#x27;s football in England. The &quot;Women&#x27;s Football Conference&quot;, as it is now known, has representation on the FA Council equivalent to a County Football Association.

===FA 2017 reform===
In December 2016, five former FA executives – David Bernstein, David Davies, Greg Dyke, Alex Horne and David Triesman – called on Parliament&#x27;s Culture, Media and Sport Committee to propose legislation to reform the FA, saying it was outdated, held back by &quot;elderly white men&quot;, and unable to counter the power of the Premier League or &quot;to reform and modernise in a fast-changing world&quot;.

In April 2017, it was announced that some reforms, including reducing the size of the FA&#x27;s board and increasing the number of women, would be submitted for approval to the FA&#x27;s annual general meeting on 18 May. However, the proposed changes were criticised by some for not going far enough, particularly to improve minority representation. The proposals were approved at the AGM and include:
* Establishing three positions on the FA board for female members by 2018
* Reducing the size of the board to 10 members
* Adding 11 new members to the FA Council to &quot;better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football&quot;
* Limiting board membership to three terms of three years
* Introducing term limits for FA Council members

However, pressure for FA reform continued fuelled by allegations of racism and bullying in relation to the Mark Sampson and Eniola Aluko cases, and the historical sexual abuse scandal. In October 2017, FA chairman Greg Clarke announced a &quot;fundamental&quot; review of the FA after admitting it had &quot;lost the trust of the public&quot; following the Sampson controversy. In the same month, Clarke was criticised by sexual abuse victim Andy Woodward and the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s chief executive Gordon Taylor for remarks Clarke made to a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) hearing.

In November 2020, Clarke resigned as FA chairman over his use of the term &quot;coloured&quot; when referring to black players in comments to the DCMS committee via video link. The FA subsequently announced they would seek a new chairman, with hopes there would be an announcement as to the successor by March 2021.

===UK football sexual abuse scandal (2016–2021)===

In mid-November 2016, allegations of widespread historical sexual abuse at football clubs dating back to the 1970s began to emerge. On 21 November, the Football Association said it would set up a helpline; this was established with the NSPCC and opened on 24 November, reportedly receiving over 50 calls within the first two hours, over 100 by 27 November, and 860 (&quot;more than three times as many referrals as in the first three days of the Jimmy Savile scandal&quot;) by 1 December with 350 individuals alleging abuse. The FA and NSPCC also collaborated to produce a film about how to keep children safe in the sport, featuring the captains of England&#x27;s men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and cerebral palsy football teams (Wayne Rooney, Steph Houghton and Jack Rutter).

On 27 November, the FA announced it was to set up an internal review, led by independent counsel Kate Gallafent, into what Crewe and Manchester City knew about convicted child sex offender Barry Bennell and allegations of child sexual abuse in football, and investigate what information it was aware of at the time of the alleged offences.

The FA was criticised by Conservative MP Damian Collins, chairman of the House of Commons&#x27; Culture, Media and Sport Committee, for being too slow in reacting and not instigating a wider review. Former sport minister Gerry Sutcliffe talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted &quot;dismissively&quot; to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks; in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse; and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being &quot;prevented/bullied&quot; from talking). Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: &quot;What I&#x27;ve seen in football over the years is that they&#x27;re very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions.&quot;

On 6 December 2016, the FA announced that, due to &quot;the increased scope of the review since it was announced&quot; and Gallafent&#x27;s other professional commitments, the review would be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC. On 11 January 2017, the Sheldon review had made its first call for evidence, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information by 15 March about allegations of child sexual abuse between 1970 and 2005. In March 2018, it was reported that the scale of evidence provided, plus the &quot;chaotic nature of the archiving&quot;, had delayed the inquiry team&#x27;s sift through the FA&#x27;s legal files; around 500,000 pages of material from 6,000 files were uploaded to a digital platform, and 353 documents were identified as highly relevant. Sheldon expected to start writing his final report in August 2018.

In July 2018, it was reported that the FA&#x27;s independent inquiry had found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football. Sheldon&#x27;s report, likely to be highly critical of several clubs, was initially expected to be delivered to the FA in September 2018, but its publication was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Bob Higgins and possible further charges against Barry Bennell.

The 700-page report was eventually published on 17 March 2021. It identified failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at eight professional clubs: Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City, Newcastle United, Peterborough, Southampton and Stoke City. The report also made 13 recommendations for further improvements, including clubs employing qualified safeguarding officers, an FA board member to be the designated &quot;children&#x27;s safeguarding champion&quot;, spot checks of amateur clubs, a &quot;national day of safeguarding in football&quot; and an annual safeguarding report. However, the measures were criticised for being too late and lacking ambition. The FA issued a &quot;heartfelt apology&quot; to survivors and said it would be implementing all of Sheldon&#x27;s recommendations.

== Crown Dependencies ==
The football associations within the Crown Dependencies of Jersey (Jersey Football Association), Guernsey (Guernsey Football Association) and the Isle of Man (Isle of Man Football Association) are affiliated to the FA despite having a separate identity from that of the United Kingdom and by extension England. They are considered county football associations by the FA. Matt Le Tissier and Graeme Le Saux have represented the FA&#x27;s full national representative team and were born in Guernsey and Jersey respectively.

The Guernsey Football Association, Isle of Man Football Association and Jersey Football Association have been affiliated with the FA since 1903, 1908 and 1905 respectively.

A loophole was closed in May 2008 by FIFA which allowed players born in the Channel Islands to choose which home nation within the United Kingdom they will represent at international level. During the 1990s, Trevor Wood (Jersey) and Chris Tardif (Guernsey) represented Northern Ireland.

== Overseas Territories ==
The British overseas territory of Gibraltar&#x27;s Gibraltar Football Association was affiliated to the FA from 1911 until it opted to become a fully recognised member of UEFA, a feat achieved after a 14-year legal battle. Joseph Nunez, the Gibraltar FA President claimed they were &quot;unilaterally thrown out&quot; of the FA following an intervention from Geoff Thompson.

On the other hand, the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA), established in 1914, is one of the oldest football associations in Asia. They joined FIFA in 1954, and were also one of twelve founding members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). HK played an important role in the early development of Asian football and hosted the first Asian Cup competition in 1956. The dependent territory was relinquished by the UK in 1997 and handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Some of the other British overseas territories have local football associations or leagues (including the Anguilla Football Association, the Ascension Island Football League, the Bermuda Football Association, the British Virgin Islands Football Association, the Cayman Islands Football Association, the Falkland Islands Football League, the Montserrat Football Association, the Turks and Caicos Islands Football Association) and saint Helena, but these are not considered subsidiary to the Football Association.

Although the British overseas territories are too small to support professional teams, they have produced players such as Clyde Best who have gone on to play professionally in the Football Association, and referees such as Carlyle Crockwell, who have refereed FIFA matches.

==Relationship with FIFA==
The Football Association first joined FIFA in 1905. The &quot;British Associations&quot; (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales) opted to leave FIFA after World War I when FIFA chose not to exclude those who were part of the Central Powers from the organisation. The British Associations&#x27; stance had changed by 1922 and in 1924 they had rejoined FIFA.

The British Olympic Association had fought against &#x27;broken time&#x27; – monetary compensation for athletes&#x27; earnings when competing in the Olympic games. At the 1925 Olympic Congress in Prague, the British had made an amendment that concluded governing federations should define amateur status for their sports but only in accordance with the definition of amateurism accepted by the Olympic Congress. In 1928, Switzerland proposed to FIFA that in certain circumstances, &#x27;broken time&#x27; payments should be allowed and FIFA accepted. The FA resigned from FIFA in protest against the proposal. As a result of the FA&#x27;s resignation, England did not participate in the 1930, 1934 or 1938 FIFA World Cup.

At the 1930 Olympic Congress in Berlin, Belgian delegates proposed that for each sport the definition of amateur status be left to its international federation. The BOA argued for a common definition of amateurism and argued that &#x27;broken time&#x27; payments were against the Olympic ideal.

The FA rejoined FIFA in 1946 and participated in their first World Cup in 1950. One of the first actions of the Football Association was to request the expulsion of the German and Japanese national football associations for their countries&#x27; role in World War II. Germany and Japan were prevented from qualifying for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a consequence. They were re-acquainted with FIFA in 1950 following a second request from Switzerland who had had a previous request rejected in 1948.

==Finance and governance==
===Finances===
The FA&#x27;s main commercial asset is its ownership of the rights to England internationals and the FA Cup. Broadcasting income remains the FA&#x27;s largest revenue stream with both domestic and international broadcasting rights for England fixtures and the FA Cup tied up until at least 2021.

For the four seasons from 2008 to 2012, the FA secured £425 million from ITV and Setanta for England and FA Cup games domestic television rights, a 42% increase over the previous contract, and £145 million for overseas television rights, up 272% on the £39 million received for the previous four-year period. However, during 2008–09 Setanta UK went into administration, which weakened the FA&#x27;s cashflow position.

Turnover for the year ending 31 July 2016 was £370 million on which it made a profit after tax of £7 million. It has also made an investment of £125 million back into every level of Football in 2016. In July 2015 the FA announced plans to carry out a significant organisational restructure, in order to deliver considerable cost savings to invest in elite England teams, facilities and grassroots coaching.

The FA&#x27;s income does not include the turnover of English football clubs, which are independent businesses. As well as running its own operations the FA chooses five charities each year to which it gives financial support.

In three years up to 2014, the FA received £350,000 in fines from players over comments made on Twitter. The highest fine imposed was a £90,000 fine to Ashley Cole in 2012 after calling the FA &quot;a bunch of twats.&quot; The FA became stricter on comments made by players on Twitter, disciplining 121 players in three years.

===Principals===

The FA has a figurehead President, who since 1939 has always been a member of the British royal family. The Chairman of the FA has overall responsibility for policy. Traditionally this person rose through the ranks of the FA&#x27;s committee structure (e.g. by holding posts such as the chairmanship of a county football association). In 2008 politician David Triesman was appointed as the FA&#x27;s first &quot;independent chairman&quot;, the first from outside the football hierarchy. The day-to-day head of the FA was known as the Secretary until 1989, when the job title was changed to Chief Executive.

<text>(, &quot;Security Service&quot;), full title (&quot;Security Service of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;&quot;), or SD, was the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany. Established in 1931, the SD was the first Nazi intelligence organization and the Gestapo (formed in 1933) was considered its sister organization through the integration of SS members and operational procedures. The SD was administered as an independent SS office between 1933 and 1939. That year, the SD was transferred over to the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot;; RSHA), as one of its seven departments. Its first director, Reinhard Heydrich, intended for the SD to bring every single individual within the Third Reich&#x27;s reach under &quot;continuous supervision&quot;.

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the tribunal at the Nuremberg trials officially declared that the SD was a criminal organisation, along with the rest of Heydrich&#x27;s RSHA (including the Gestapo) both individually and as branches of the SS in the collective. Heydrich was assassinated in 1942; his successor, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials, sentenced to death and hanged in 1946.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The SD, one of the oldest security organizations of the SS, was first formed in 1931 as the &quot;Ic-Dienst&quot; (Intelligence Service) operating out of a single apartment and reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler. Himmler appointed a former junior naval officer, Reinhard Heydrich, to organise the small agency. The office was renamed &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) in the summer of 1932. The SD became more powerful after the Nazi Party took control of Germany in 1933 and the SS started infiltrating all leading positions of the security apparatus of the Reich. Even before Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, the SD was a veritable &quot;watchdog&quot; over the SS and over members of the Nazi Party and played a critical role in consolidating political-police powers into the hands of Himmler and Heydrich.

===Growth of SD and SS power===

Once Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President Paul von Hindenburg, he quickly made efforts to manipulate the aging president. On 28 February 1933, Hitler convinced Hindenburg to declare a state of emergency which suspended all civil liberties throughout Germany, due at least in part to the Reichstag fire on the previous night. Hitler assured Hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in Germany by taking a &quot;defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state&quot;. Wasting no time, Himmler set the SD in motion as they began creating an extensive card-index of the Nazi regime&#x27;s political opponents, arresting labor organizers, socialists, Jewish leaders, journalists, and communists in the process, sending them to the newly established prison facility near Munich, Dachau. Himmler&#x27;s SS and SD made their presence felt at once by helping rid the regime of its known political enemies and its perceived ones, as well. As far as Heydrich and Himmler were concerned, the SD left their mission somewhat vaguely defined so as to &quot;remain an instrument for all eventualities&quot;. One such eventuality would soon arise.

For a while, the SS competed with the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) for influence within Germany. Himmler distrusted the SA and came to deplore the &quot;rabble-rousing&quot; brownshirts (despite once having been a member) and what he saw as indecent sexual deviants amid its leadership. At least one pretext to secure additional influence for Himmler&#x27;s SS and Heydrich&#x27;s SD in &quot;protecting&quot; Hitler and securing his absolute trust in their intelligence collection abilities, involved thwarting a plot from Ernst Röhm&#x27;s SA using subversive means.

On 20 April 1934 Hermann Göring handed over control of the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Gestapo) to Himmler. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD. These events further extended Himmler&#x27;s control of the security mechanism of the Reich, which by proxy also strengthened the surveillance power of Heydrich&#x27;s SD, as both entities methodically infiltrated every police agency in Germany. Subsequently, the SD was made the sole &quot;party information service&quot; on 9 June 1934.

Under pressure from the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (German armed forces) leadership (whose members viewed the enormous armed forces of the SA as an existential threat) and with the collusion of Göring, Joseph Goebbels, the Gestapo and SD, Hitler was led to believe that Röhm&#x27;s SA posed a serious conspiratorial threat requiring a drastic and immediate solution. For its part, the SD provided fictitious information that there was an assassination plot on Hitler&#x27;s life and that an SA putsch to assume power was imminent since the SA were allegedly amassing weapons. Additionally, reports were coming into the SD and Gestapo that the vulgarity of the SA&#x27;s behavior was damaging the party and was even making antisemitism less palatable. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. The SS took one of its most decisive steps in eliminating its competition for command of security within Germany and established itself firmly in the Nazi hierarchy, making the SS and its intelligence organ, the SD, responsible only to the Führer. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives, with up to 200 people killed in the action. Moreover, the brutal crushing of the SA and its leadership sent a clear message to everyone that opposition to Hitler&#x27;s regime could be fatal. It struck fear across the Nazi leadership as to the tangible concern of the reach and influence of Himmler&#x27;s intelligence collection and policing powers.

===SD and Austria===
During the autumn of 1937, Hitler secured Mussolini&#x27;s support to annex Austria (Mussolini was originally apprehensive of the Nazi takeover of Austria) and informed his generals of his intentions to invade both Austria and Czechoslovakia. Getting Mussolini to approve political intrigue against Austria was a major accomplishment, as the Italian &quot;Duce&quot; had expressed great concern previously in the wake of an Austrian SS unit&#x27;s attempt to stage a coup not more than three weeks after the Röhm affair, an episode that embarrassed the SS, enraged Hitler, and ended in the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss on 25 July 1934. Nonetheless, to facilitate the incorporation of Austria into the greater Reich, the SD and Gestapo went to work arresting people immediately, using lists compiled by Heydrich. Heydrich&#x27;s SD and Austrian SS members received financing from Berlin to harass Austrian Chancellor von Schuschnigg&#x27;s government all throughout 1937. One section of the SD that was nothing more than a front for subversive activities against Austria ironically promoted &quot;German-Austrian peace&quot;.
Throughout the events leading to the &quot;Anschluß&quot; and even after the Nazis marched into Austria on 12 March 1938, Heydrich – convinced that only his SD could pull off a peaceful union between the two German-speaking nations – organized demonstrations, conducted clandestine operations, ordered terror attacks, distributed propaganda materials, encouraged the intimidation of opponents, and had his SS and SD personnel round up prominent anti-Nazis, most of whom ended up in Mauthausen concentration camp The coordinated efforts of the SiPo and Heydrich&#x27;s SD during the first days of the &quot;Anschluß&quot; effectively eliminated all forms of possible political, military and economic resistance within Austria. Once the annexation became official, the Austrian police were immediately subordinated to Heydrich&#x27;s SD, the SS and Gestapo. Machinations by the SD, the Gestapo, and the SS helped to bring Austria fully into Hitler&#x27;s grasp and on 13 March 1938, he signed into law the union with Austria as tears streamed down his face.

===&quot;Case Green&quot; and the Sudetenland===
Concomitant to its machinations against Austria, the SD also became involved in subversive activities throughout Czechoslovakia. Focusing on the Sudetenland with its 3 million ethnic Germans and the disharmony there which the Czech government could not seem to remedy, Hitler set Heydrich&#x27;s SD in motion in what came to be known as &quot;Case Green&quot;. Passed off as a mission to liberate Sudeten Germans from alleged Czech persecution, Case Green was in fact a contingency plan to outright invade and destroy the country, as Hitler intended to &quot;wipe Czechoslovakia off the map.&quot;

This operation was akin to earlier SD efforts in Austria; however, unlike Austria, the Czechs fielded their own Secret Service, against which Heydrich had to contend. Once &quot;Case Green&quot; began, Heydrich&#x27;s SD spies began covertly gathering intelligence, even going so far as having SD agents use their spouses and children in the cover scheme. The operation covered every conceivable type of intelligence data, using a myriad of cameras and photographic equipment, focusing efforts on important strategic locations like government buildings, police stations, postal services, public utilities, logistical routes, and above all, airfields.

Hitler worked out a sophisticated plan to acquire the Sudetenland, including manipulating Slovak nationalists to vie for independence and the suppression of this movement by the Czech government. Under directions from Heydrich, SD operative Alfred Naujocks was re-activated to engage in sabotage activities designed to incite a response from the Slovaks and the Czechs, a mission that ultimately failed. In June 1938 a directive from the SD head office indicated that Hitler issued an order at Jueterbog to his generals to prepare for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. To hasten a presumed heavy response from the French, British, and Czechs, Hitler then upped the stakes and claimed that the Czechs were slaughtering Sudeten Germans. He demanded the unconditional and prompt cession of the Sudetenland to Germany in order to secure the safety of endangered ethnic Germans. Around this time, early plots by select members of the German General Staff emerged, plans which included ridding themselves of Hitler.

Eventually a diplomatic showdown pitting Hitler against the governments of Czechoslovakia, Great Britain, and France, whose tepid reaction to the Austrian Anschluss had precipitated this crisis to some degree, ensued. The Sudetenland Crisis came to an end when Neville Chamberlain and Hitler signed the Munich Agreement on 29 September 1938, effectively ceding the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. Involvement in international affairs by the SD certainly did not end there and the agency remained active in foreign operations to such a degree that the head of the Reich Foreign Ministry office, Joachim von Ribbentrop, complained of their meddling, since Hitler would apparently make decisions based on SD reports without consulting him. According to historian Richard Breitman, there was animosity between the SS leadership and Ribbentrop&#x27;s Foreign Office atop their &quot;jurisdictional disputes&quot;.

===Intrigue against Poland===
Aside from its participation in diminishing the power of the SA and its scheme to kill Röhm, the SD took part in international intrigue, first by activities in Austria, again in Czechoslovakia, and then by helping provoke the &quot;reactive&quot; war against Poland. Code-named &quot;Operation Himmler&quot; and part of Hitler&#x27;s plan to justify an attack upon Poland, the SD&#x27;s clandestine activity for this mission included faking a Polish attack against &quot;innocent Germans&quot; at a German radio station in Gleiwitz. The SD took concentration-camp inmates condemned to die, and fitted them with Polish Army uniforms which Heinz Jost had acquired from Admiral Wilhelm Canaris&#x27; &quot;Abwehr&quot; (military intelligence). Leading this mission and personally selected by Heydrich was SS veteran Alfred Naujocks, who later reported during a War Criminal proceeding that he brought a Polish-speaking German along so he could broadcast a message in Polish from the German radio station &quot;under siege&quot; to the effect that it was time for an all out confrontation between Germans and Poles. To add documented proof of this attack, the SD operatives placed the fictitious Polish troops (killed by lethal injection, then shot for appearance) around the &quot;attacked&quot; radio station with the intention of taking members of the press to the site of the incident. Immediately in the wake of the staged incidents on 1 September 1939, Hitler proclaimed from the Reichstag in a famous radio address that German soldiers had been &quot;returning&quot; fire since 5:45 in the morning, setting the Second World War in Europe into motion.

==Tasks and general structure==

The SD was tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi leadership and the neutralization of such opposition, whether internal or external. To fulfill this task, the SD developed an organization of agents and informants throughout the Reich and later throughout the occupied territories, all part of the development of an extensive SS state and a totalitarian regime without parallel. The organization consisted of a few hundred full-time agents and several thousand informants. Historian George C. Browder writes that SD regiments were comparable to SS regiments, in that:

SD districts (&quot;Bezirke&quot;) emerged covering several Party circuits (&quot;Kreis&quot;) or an entire district (&quot;Gau&quot;). Below this level, SD sub-districts (&quot;Unterbezirke&quot;) slowly developed. They were originally to cover a single &quot;Kreis&quot;, and, in turn, to be composed of wards (&quot;Revier&quot;), but such an ambitious network never emerged. Eventually, the SD-sub-districts acquired the simple designation of &#x27;outposts&#x27; (&quot;Aussenstellen&quot;) as the lowest level-office in the field structure.

The SD was mainly an information-gathering agency, while the Gestapo—and to a degree the Criminal Police (&quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; or Kripo)—was the executive agency of the political-police system. The SD and Gestapo did have integration through SS members holding dual positions in each branch. Nevertheless, there was some jurisdictional overlap and operational conflict between the SD and Gestapo. In addition, the Criminal Police kept a level of independence since its structure had been longer-established.

As part and parcel of its intelligence operations, the SD carefully tracked foreign opinion and criticism of Nazi policies, censoring when necessary and likewise publishing hostile political cartoons in the SS weekly magazine, &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;. An additional task assigned to the SD and the Gestapo involved keeping tabs on the morale of the German population at large, which meant they were charged to &quot;carefully supervise the political health of the German ethnic body&quot; and once any symptoms of &quot;disease and germs&quot; appeared, it was their job to &quot;remove them by every appropriate means&quot;. Regular reports—including opinion polls, press dispatches, and information bulletins were established. These were monitored and reviewed by the head of the Inland-SD, Otto Ohlendorf (responsible for intelligence and security within Germany) and by the former Heidelberg professor and SD member . This activity aimed to control and assess the &quot;life domain&quot; or &quot;Lebensgebiet&quot; of the German population. Gathered information was then distributed by the SD through secret internal political reports entitled &quot;Meldungen aus dem Reich&quot; (reports from the Reich) to the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, enabling Hitler&#x27;s régime to evaluate the general morale and attitude of the German people so they could be manipulated by the Nazi propaganda machine in timely fashion. When the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, the SD reported that the measures against the Jews were well received by the German populace.

In 1936, the police were divided into the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo or Order Police) and the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo or Security Police). The Orpo consisted mainly of the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; (urban police), the &quot;Gendarmerie&quot; (rural police) and the &quot;Gemeindepolizei&quot; (municipal police). The SiPo was composed of the Kripo and the Gestapo. Heydrich became Chief of the SiPo and continued as Chief of the SD.

Continued escalation of antisemitic policies in the spring of 1937 from the SD&#x27;s Department of Jewish Affairs () – staffed by members like Adolf Eichmann, Herbert Hagen, and Theodor Dannecker – led to the eventual removal (&quot;Entfernung&quot;) of Jews from Germany; regardless of concerns about where they were headed. Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s original task (in his capacity as deputy for the Jewish Affairs department within the SD) was at first to remove any semblance of &quot;Jewish influence from all spheres of public life&quot;, which included the encouragement of wholesale Jewish emigration. Official bureaucratization increased apace with numerous specialized offices formed, aiding towards the overall persecution of the Jews.

Because the Gestapo and the SD had parallel duties, Heydrich tried to reduce any confusion or related territorial disputes through a decree on 1 July 1937, clearly defining the SD&#x27;s areas of responsibility as those dealing with &quot;learning (&quot;Wissenschaft&quot;), art, party and state, constitution and administration, foreign lands, Freemasonry and associations&quot; whereas the &quot;Gestapo&#x27;s jurisdiction was Marxism, treason, and emigrants&quot;. Additionally, the SD was responsible for matters related to &quot;churches and sects, pacifism, the Jews, right-wing movements&quot;, as well as &quot;the economy, and the Press&quot;, but the SD was instructed to &quot;avoid all matters which touched the &#x27;state police executive powers&#x27; (&quot;staatspolizeiliche Vollzugsmaßnahmen&quot;) since these belonged to the Gestapo, as did all individual cases.&quot;

In 1938, the SD was made the intelligence organization for the State as well as for the Nazi Party, supporting the Gestapo and working with the General and Interior Administration. As such, the SD came into immediate, fierce competition with German military intelligence, the &quot;Abwehr,&quot; which was headed by Admiral Canaris. The competition stemmed from Heydrich and Himmler&#x27;s intention to absorb the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and Admiral Canaris&#x27; view of the SD as an amateur upstart. Canaris refused to give up the autonomy that his military intelligence organ possessed. Additional problems also existed, like the racial exemption for members of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; from the Nazi Aryan-screening process, and then there was competition for resources which occurred throughout Nazi Germany&#x27;s existence.

On 27 September 1939, the SiPo became a part of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) under Heydrich:

* SD-Inland became &quot;Amt&quot; (department) III (internal intelligence – within Germany) under Otto Ohlendorf
* the Gestapo became &quot;Amt&quot; IV under Heinrich Müller
* the Kripo became &quot;Amt&quot; V under Arthur Nebe
* SD-Ausland became &quot;Amt&quot; VI (foreign intelligence – outside Germany) under Walter Schellenberg 

From February 1944 forward, the sections of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; were incorporated into &quot;Amt&quot; VI.

==The SD&#x27;s relationship with the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;==
The SD was the overarching agency under which the &quot;Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD&quot;, also known as the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, was subordinated; this was one of the principal reasons for the later war-crimes indictment against the organization by the Allies. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&#x27;s&quot; part in the Holocaust has been well documented. Its mobile killing units were active in the implementation of the Final Solution (the plan for genocide) in the territories overrun by the Nazi war machine. This SD subsidiary worked closely with the Wehrmacht in persecuting Jews, communists, partisans, and other groups, as well. Starting with the invasion of Poland throughout the campaign in the East, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; ruthlessly killed anyone suspected of being an opponent of the regime, either real or imagined. The men of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo, and Waffen-SS.

On 31 July 1941, Göring gave written authorisation to SD Chief Heydrich to ensure a government-wide cooperative effort in the implementation of the so-called Final Solution to the Jewish question in territories under German control. An SD headquarter&#x27;s memorandum indicated that the SD was tasked to accompany military invasions and assist in pacification efforts. The memo explicitly stated:

The SD will, where possible, follow up immediately behind the troops as they move in and, as in the Reich, will assume responsibility for the security of political life. Within the Reich, security measures are the responsibility of the Gestapo with SD cooperation. In occupied territory, measures will be under the direction of a senior SD commander; Gestapo officials will be allotted to individual &quot;Einsatzstäbe&quot;. It will be necessary to make available for special deployment a unit of &quot;Verfügungstruppe&quot; or &quot;Totenkopf&quot; [Death Head] formations.

Correspondingly, SD affiliated units, including the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; followed German troops into Austria, the Sudetenland, Bohemia, Moravia, Poland, Lithuania, as well as Russia. Since their task included cooperating with military leadership and vice versa, suppression of opposition in the occupied territories was a joint venture. There were territorial disputes and disagreement about how some of these policies were to be implemented. Nonetheless, by June 1941, the SS and the SD task forces were systematically shooting Jewish men of military age, which soon turned to &quot;gunning down&quot; old people, women, and children in the occupied areas.

On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, now called the Wannsee Conference, to discuss the implementation of the plan. Facilities such as Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor, Treblinka, and Auschwitz have their origins in the planning actions undertaken by Heydrich. Heydrich remained chief of the Security Police (SiPo) and the SD (through the RSHA) until his assassination in 1942, after which Ernst Kaltenbrunner was named chief by Himmler on 30 January 1943, and remained there until the end of the war. The SD was declared a criminal organization after the war and its members were tried as war criminals at Nuremberg. Whatever their original purpose, the SD and SS were ultimately created to identify and eradicate internal enemies of the State, as well as to pacify, subjugate, and exploit conquered territories and peoples.

==Organization==
The SS Security Service, known as the SS &quot;SD-Amt&quot;, became the official security organization of the Nazi Party in 1934. Consisting at first of paid agents and a few hundred unpaid informants scattered across Germany, the SD was quickly professionalized under Heydrich, who commissioned National Socialist academics and lawyers to ensure that the SS and its Security Service in particular, operated &quot;within the framework of National Socialist ideology.&quot; Heydrich was given the power to select men for the SS Security Service from among any SS subdivisions since Himmler considered the organization of the SD as important. In September 1939, the SD was divided into two departments, the interior department (&quot;Inland-SD&quot;) and the foreign department (&quot;Ausland-SD&quot;), and placed under the authority of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA).

===Inland-SD===
The Interior Security Service (&quot;Inland-SD&quot;), responsible for intelligence and security within Germany, was known earlier as Department II and later, when placed under the Reich Security Main Office, as its Department III. It was originally headed by Hermann Behrends and from September 1939 by Otto Ohlendorf. It was within this organization that Adolf Eichmann began working out the details for the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. Department III was divided into the following sections:

* Section A (Law and Legal Structures)
* Section B (Race and Ethnic Matters)
* Section C (Cultural and Religious Matters)
* Section D (Industry and Commerce)
* Section E (High Society)

===Ausland-SD===
The Foreign Security Service (&quot;Ausland-SD&quot;), responsible for intelligence activities beyond the boundaries of Germany, was known earlier as Department III and later, after September 1939, as Department VI of the Reich Security Main Office. It was nominally commanded by Heydrich, but run by his chief of staff Heinz Jost. In March 1942 Jost was fired and replaced by Walter Schellenberg, a deputy of Heydrich. After the 20 July plot in 1944, Department VI took over the functions of the Military Intelligence Service (&quot;Abwehr&quot;). Department VI was divided into the following sections:

* Section A (Organization and Administration)
* Section B (Espionage in the West)
* Section C (Espionage in the Soviet Union and Japan)
* Section D (Espionage in the American sphere)
* Section E (Espionage in Eastern Europe)
* Section F (Technical Matters)

===Security forces===

The SD and the SiPo were the main sources of officers for the security forces in occupied territories. SD-SiPo led battalions were typically placed under the command of the SS and Police Leaders, reporting directly to the RSHA in Berlin. The SD also maintained a presence at all concentration camps and supplied personnel, on an as-needed basis, to such special action troops as the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. In fact, all members of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; wore the SD sleeve diamond on their uniforms.

The SD-SiPo was the primary agency, in conjunction with the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;, assigned to maintain order and security in the Nazi ghettos established by the Germans throughout occupied Eastern Europe. On 7 December 1941, the same day as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the first extermination camp was opened at Chelmno near Lodz by Ernst Damzog, the SD and SiPo commander in occupied Poznań (Posen). Damzog had personally selected the staff for the killing centre and later supervised the daily operation of the camp, which was under the command of Herbert Lange. Over a span of approximately 15 months, 150,000 people were killed there.

==Infiltration==
According to the book &quot;Piercing the Reich&quot;, the SD was infiltrated in 1944 by a former Russian national who was working for the Americans. The agent&#x27;s parents had fled the Russian Revolution, and he had been raised in Berlin, and then moved to Paris. He was recruited by Albert Jolis of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Seventh Army detachment. The mission was codenamed RUPPERT.

How extensive the SD&#x27;s knowledge was about the early plots to kill Hitler by key members of the military remains a contested subject and a veritable unknown. According to British historian John Wheeler-Bennett, &quot;in view of the wholesale destruction of Gestapo archives it is improbable that this knowledge will ever be forthcoming. That the authorities were aware of serious &#x27;defeatism&#x27; is certain, but it is doubtful whether they suspected anyone of outright treason.&quot;

==Personnel==
Given the nature of the intelligence operations assigned to the SD, there were clear delineations between what constituted a full member (&quot;Mitglied&quot;) of the SD and those who were considered &quot;associates&quot; (&quot;Mitarbeiter&quot;) with a further subset for clerical support personnel (typists, file clerks, etc.) who were connoted as V-persons (&quot;Vertrauensleute&quot;). All SD personnel, whether simply associates or full members were required to swear an oath of secrecy, had to meet all the requirements for SS membership, were assigned SD code numbers (&quot;Chiffre Nummer&quot;) and if they were &quot;above the level of V-person&quot; they had to carry &quot;an SD identification card.&quot; The vast majority of early SD members were relatively young, but the officers were typically older by comparison; nevertheless, the average age of an SD member was approximately 2 years older than the average Nazi Party member. Much like the Nazi revolution in general, membership in the SS and the SD appealed more to the impressionable youth. Most SD members were Protestant by faith, had served in the military, and generally had a significant amount of education, representing &quot;an educated elite&quot; in the general sense – with about 14 percent of them earning doctorate degrees. Heydrich viewed the SD as spiritual-elite leaders within the SS and the &quot;cream of the cream of the NSDAP.&quot;

According to historian George C. Browder, &quot;SD men represented no pathological or psychically susceptible group. Few were wild or extreme Nazi fanatics. In those respects they were &#x27;ordinary men&#x27;. Yet in most other respects, they were an extraordinary mix of men, drawn together by a unique mix of missions.&quot; Along with members of the Gestapo, SD personnel were &quot;regarded with a mixture of fear and foreboding,&quot; and people wanted as little to do with them as possible. Belonging to the security apparatus of Nazi Germany obviously had its advantages but it was also fraught with occupationally related social disadvantages as well, and if post-war descriptions of the SD by historians are any indication, membership therein implied being a part of a &quot;ubiquitous secret society&quot; which was &quot;sinister&quot; and a &quot;messenger of terror&quot; not just for the German population, but within the &quot;ranks of the Nazi Party itself.&quot;

==Uniforms and insignia==
The SD used SS-ranks. When in uniform they wore the grey Waffen-SS uniform with army and &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; rank insignia on the shoulder straps, and SS rank insignia on the left collar patch. The right collar patch was black without the runes. The branch color of the SD was green. The SD sleeve diamond (SD &quot;Raute&quot;) insignia was worn on the lower left sleeve.

<text>Planner (often seen in publications as &quot;PLANNER&quot; although it is not an acronym) is a programming language designed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, and first published in 1969. First, subsets such as Micro-Planner and Pico-Planner were implemented, and then essentially the whole language was implemented as &quot;Popler&quot; by Julian Davies at the University of Edinburgh in the POP-2 programming language. Derivations such as QA4, Conniver, QLISP and Ether (see scientific community metaphor) were important tools in artificial intelligence research in the 1970s, which influenced commercial developments such as Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) and Automated Reasoning Tool (ART).

==Procedural approach versus logical approach==
The two major paradigms for constructing semantic software systems were procedural and logical. The procedural paradigm was epitomized by 
Lisp which featured recursive procedures that operated on list structures.

The logical paradigm was epitomized by uniform proof procedure resolution-based derivation (proof) finders. According to the logical paradigm it was “cheating” to incorporate procedural knowledge.

==Procedural embedding of knowledge==
Planner was invented for the purposes of the procedural embedding of knowledge and was a rejection of the resolution uniform proof procedure paradigm, which
#&quot;Converted everything to clausal form.&quot; Converting all information to clausal form is problematic because it hides the underlying structure of the information.
#&quot;Then used resolution to attempt to obtain a proof by contradiction by adding the clausal form of the negation of the theorem to be proved.&quot; Using only resolution as the rule of inference is problematical because it hides the underlying structure of proofs. Also, using proof by contradiction is problematical because the axiomatizations of all practical domains of knowledge are inconsistent in practice.

Planner was a kind of hybrid between the procedural and logical paradigms because it combined programmability with logical reasoning. Planner featured a procedural interpretation of logical sentences where an implication of the form can be procedurally interpreted in the following ways using pattern-directed invocation:
#Forward chaining (antecedently):
#:
#Backward chaining (consequently)
#:

In this respect, the development of Planner was influenced by natural deductive logical systems (especially the one by Frederic Fitch [1952]).

==Micro-planner implementation==

A subset called Micro-Planner was implemented by Gerry Sussman, Eugene Charniak and Terry Winograd and was used in Winograd&#x27;s natural-language understanding program SHRDLU, Eugene Charniak&#x27;s story understanding work, Thorne McCarty&#x27;s work on legal reasoning, and some other projects. This generated a great deal of excitement in the field of AI. It also generated controversy because it proposed an alternative to the logic approach that had been one of the mainstay paradigms for AI.

At SRI International, Jeff Rulifson, Jan Derksen, and Richard Waldinger developed QA4 which built on the constructs in Planner and introduced a context mechanism to provide modularity for expressions in the database. Earl Sacerdoti and Rene Reboh developed QLISP, an extension of QA4 embedded in INTERLISP, providing Planner-like reasoning embedded in a procedural language and developed in its rich programming environment. QLISP was used by Richard Waldinger and Karl Levitt for program verification, by Earl Sacerdoti for planning and execution monitoring, by Jean-Claude Latombe for computer-aided design, by Nachum Dershowitz for program synthesis, by Richard Fikes for deductive retrieval, and by Steven Coles for an early expert system that guided use of an econometric model.

Computers were expensive. They had only a single slow processor and their memories were very small by comparison with today. So Planner adopted some efficiency expedients including the following:

*Backtracking was adopted to economize on the use of time and storage by working on and storing only one possibility at a time in exploring alternatives.
*A unique name assumption was adopted to save space and time by assuming that different names referred to different objects. For example, names like Peking (previous PRC capital name) and Beijing (current PRC capital transliteration) were assumed to refer to different objects.
*A closed-world assumption could be implemented by conditionally testing whether an attempt to prove a goal exhaustively failed. Later this capability was given the misleading name &quot;negation as failure&quot; because for a goal it was possible to say: &quot;if attempting to achieve exhaustively fails then assert .&quot;

==The genesis of Prolog==
Gerry Sussman, Eugene Charniak, Seymour Papert and Terry Winograd visited the University of Edinburgh in 1971, spreading the news about Micro-Planner and SHRDLU and casting doubt on the resolution uniform proof procedure approach that had been the mainstay of the Edinburgh Logicists. At the University of Edinburgh, Bruce Anderson implemented a subset of Micro-Planner called PICO-PLANNER, and Julian Davies (1973) implemented essentially all of Planner.

According to Donald MacKenzie, Pat Hayes recalled the impact of a visit from Papert to Edinburgh, which had become the &quot;heart of artificial intelligence&#x27;s Logicland,&quot; according to Papert&#x27;s MIT colleague, Carl Hewitt. Papert eloquently voiced his critique of the resolution approach dominant at Edinburgh &quot;…and at least one person upped sticks and left because of Papert.&quot;
The above developments generated tension among the Logicists at Edinburgh. These tensions were exacerbated when the UK Science Research Council commissioned Sir James Lighthill to write a report on the AI research situation in the UK. The resulting report Lighthill 1973; McCarthy 1973] was highly critical although SHRDLU was favorably mentioned.

Pat Hayes visited Stanford where he learned about Planner. When he returned to Edinburgh, he tried to influence his friend Bob Kowalski to take Planner into account in their joint work on automated theorem proving. &quot;Resolution theorem-proving was demoted from a hot topic to a relic of the misguided past. Bob Kowalski doggedly stuck to his faith in the potential of resolution theorem proving. He carefully studied Planner.”. Kowalski [1988] states &quot;I can recall trying to convince Hewitt that Planner was similar to SL-resolution.&quot; But Planner was invented for the purposes of the procedural embedding of knowledge and was a rejection of the resolution uniform proof procedure paradigm. Colmerauer and Roussel recalled their reaction to learning about Planner in the following way:

&quot;While attending an IJCAI convention in September ‘71 with Jean Trudel, we met Robert Kowalski again and heard a lecture by Terry Winograd on natural language processing. The fact that he did not use a unified formalism left us puzzled. It was at this time that we learned of the existence of Carl Hewitt’s programming language, Planner. The lack of formalization of this language, our ignorance of Lisp and, above all, the fact that we were absolutely devoted to logic meant that this work had little influence on our later research.&quot;

In the fall of 1972, Philippe Roussel implemented a language called Prolog (an abbreviation for PROgrammation en LOGique – French for &quot;programming in logic&quot;). Prolog programs are generically of the following form (which is a special case of the backward-chaining in Planner):
 
Prolog duplicated the following aspects of Micro-Planner:
*Pattern directed invocation of procedures from goals (&quot;i.e.&quot; backward chaining)
*An indexed data base of pattern-directed procedures and ground sentences.
*Giving up on the completeness paradigm that had characterized previous work on theorem proving and replacing it with the programming language procedural embedding of knowledge paradigm.
Prolog also duplicated the following capabilities of Micro-Planner which were pragmatically useful for the computers of the era because they saved space and time:
*Backtracking control structure
*Unique Name Assumption by which different names are assumed to refer to distinct entities, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Peking and Beijing are assumed to be different.
*Reification of Failure. The way that Planner established that something was provable was to successfully attempt it as a goal and the way that it establish that something was unprovable was to attempt it as a goal and explicitly fail. Of course the other possibility is that the attempt to prove the goal runs forever and never returns any value. Planner also had a construct which succeeded if failed, which gave rise to the “Negation as Failure” terminology in Planner.

Use of the Unique Name Assumption and Negation as Failure became more questionable when attention turned to Open Systems.

The following capabilities of Micro-Planner were omitted from Prolog:
*Pattern-directed invocation of procedural plans from assertions (&quot;i.e&quot;., forward chaining)
*Logical negation, &quot;e.g.&quot;, .

Prolog did not include negation in part because it raises implementation issues. Consider for example if negation were included in the following Prolog program:
:

The above program would be unable to prove even though it follows by the rules of mathematical logic. This is an illustration of the fact that Prolog (like Planner) is intended to be a programming language and so does not (by itself) prove many of the logical consequences that follow from a declarative reading of its programs.
The work on Prolog was valuable in that it was much simpler than Planner. However, as the need arose for greater expressive power in the language, Prolog began to include many of the capabilities of Planner that were left out of the original version of Prolog.
