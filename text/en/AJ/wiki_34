<text>During World War II, the United States forcibly relocated and incarcerated about 120,000 people of Japanese descent in ten concentration camps operated by the War Relocation Authority (WRA), mostly in the western interior of the country. About two-thirds were U.S. citizens. These actions were initiated by Executive Order 9066, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, following the outbreak of war with the Empire of Japan in December 1941. About 127,000 Japanese Americans then lived in the continental U.S., of which about 112,000 lived on the West Coast. About 80,000 were &quot;Nisei&quot; (&#x27;second generation&#x27;; American-born Japanese with U.S. citizenship) and &quot;Sansei&quot; (&#x27;third generation&#x27;, the children of &quot;Nisei&quot;). The rest were &quot;Issei&quot; (&#x27;first generation&#x27;) immigrants born in Japan, who were ineligible for citizenship. In Hawaii, where more than 150,000 Japanese Americans comprised more than one-third of the territory&#x27;s population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were incarcerated.

Internment was intended to mitigate a security risk which Japanese Americans were believed to pose. The scale of the incarceration in proportion to the size of the Japanese American population far surpassed similar measures undertaken against German and Italian Americans who numbered in the millions and of whom some thousands were interned, most of these non-citizens. Following the executive order, the entire West Coast was designated a military exclusion area, and all Japanese Americans living there were taken to assembly centers before being sent to concentration camps in California, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Arkansas. Similar actions were taken against individuals of Japanese descent in Canada. Internees were prohibited from taking more than they could carry into the camps, and many were forced to sell some or all of their property, including their homes and businesses. At the camps, which were surrounded by barbed wire fences and patrolled by armed guards, internees often lived in overcrowded barracks with minimal furnishing.

In its 1944 decision &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the removals under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court limited its decision to the validity of the exclusion orders, avoiding the issue of the incarceration of U.S. citizens without due process, but ruled on the same day in &quot;Ex parte Endo&quot; that a loyal citizen could not be detained, which began their release. On December 17, 1944, the exclusion orders were rescinded, and nine of the ten camps were shut down by the end of 1945. Japanese Americans were initially barred from U.S. military service, but by 1943, they were allowed to join, with 20,000 serving during the war. Over 4,000 students were allowed to leave the camps to attend college. Hospitals in the camps recorded 5,981 births and 1,862 deaths during incarceration.

In the 1970s, under mounting pressure from the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) and redress organizations, President Jimmy Carter appointed the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) to investigate whether the internment had been justified. In 1983, the commission&#x27;s report, &quot;Personal Justice Denied,&quot; found little evidence of Japanese disloyalty and concluded that internment had been the product of racism. It recommended that the government pay reparations to the detainees. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which officially apologized and authorized a payment of $20,000 () to each former detainee who was still alive when the act was passed. The legislation admitted that the government&#x27;s actions were based on &quot;race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.&quot; By 1992, the U.S. government eventually disbursed more than $1.6 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in reparations to 82,219 Japanese Americans who had been incarcerated.

==Background==
=== Internment camps in the United States ===
The United States Government had previously employed civilian internment policies in a variety of circumstances. During the 1830s, civilians of the indigenous Cherokee nation were evicted from their homes and detained in &quot;emigration depots&quot; in Alabama and Tennessee prior to the deportation to Oklahoma following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830. Similar internment policies were carried out by U.S. territorial authorities against the Dakota and Navajo peoples during the American Indian Wars in the 1860s. In 1901, during the Philippine–American War, General J. Franklin Bell ordered the detainment of Filipino civilians in the provinces of Batangas and Laguna into U.S. Army-run concentration camps in order to prevent them from aiding insurgent forces; over 11,000 people died from disease and starvation. 

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, roughly 6,300 German-born residents of the United States were arrested, with 2,048 of those residents being incarcerated at two U.S. Army bases, where they remained interned until 1920. However, these policies only targeted a small fraction of German-born Americans and did not apply to German-American U.S. citizens.

===Japanese Americans before World War II===
Due in large part to socio-political changes which stemmed from the Meiji Restoration—and a recession which was caused by the abrupt opening of Japan&#x27;s economy to the world economy—people emigrated from the Empire of Japan after 1868 in search of employment. From 1869 to 1924, approximately 200,000 Japanese immigrated to the islands of Hawaii, mostly laborers expecting to work on the islands&#x27; sugar plantations. Some 180,000 went to the U.S. mainland, with the majority of them settling on the West Coast and establishing farms or small businesses. Most arrived before 1908, when the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement between Japan and the United States banned the immigration of unskilled laborers. A loophole allowed the wives of men who were already living in the US to join their husbands. The practice of women marrying by proxy and immigrating to the U.S. resulted in a large increase in the number of &quot;picture brides.&quot;

As the Japanese American population continued to grow, European Americans who lived on the West Coast resisted the arrival of this ethnic group, fearing competition, and making the exaggerated claim that hordes of Asians would take over white-owned farmland and businesses. Groups such as the Asiatic Exclusion League, the California Joint Immigration Committee, and the Native Sons of the Golden West organized in response to the rise of this &quot;Yellow Peril.&quot; They successfully lobbied to restrict the property and citizenship rights of Japanese immigrants, just as similar groups had previously organized against Chinese immigrants. Beginning in the late 19th century, several laws and treaties which attempted to slow immigration from Japan were introduced. The Immigration Act of 1924, which followed the example of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, effectively banned all immigration from Japan and other &quot;undesirable&quot; Asian countries.

The 1924 ban on immigration produced unusually well-defined generational groups within the Japanese American community. The &quot;Issei&quot; were exclusively those Japanese who had immigrated before 1924; some of them desired to return to their homeland. Because no more immigrants were permitted, all Japanese Americans who were born after 1924 were, by definition, born in the U.S. and by law, they were automatically considered U.S. citizens. The members of this &quot;Nisei&quot; generation constituted a cohort which was distinct from the cohort which their parents belonged to. In addition to the usual generational differences, Issei men were typically ten to fifteen years older than their wives, making them significantly older than the younger children in their often large families. U.S. law prohibited Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens, making them dependent on their children whenever they rented or purchased property. Communication between English-speaking children and parents who mostly or completely spoke in Japanese was often difficult. A significant number of older Nisei, many of whom were born prior to the immigration ban, had married and already started families of their own by the time the US entered World War II.

Despite racist legislation which prevented Issei from becoming naturalized citizens (or owning property, voting, or running for political office), these Japanese immigrants established communities in their new hometowns. Japanese Americans contributed to the agriculture of California and other Western states, by introducing irrigation methods which enabled them to cultivate fruits, vegetables, and flowers on previously inhospitable land.

In both rural and urban areas, &quot;kenjinkai,&quot; community groups for immigrants from the same Japanese prefecture, and &quot;fujinkai,&quot; Buddhist women&#x27;s associations, organized community events and did charitable work, provided loans and financial assistance and built Japanese language schools for their children. Excluded from setting up shop in white neighborhoods, nikkei-owned small businesses thrived in the &quot;Nihonmachi,&quot; or Japantowns of urban centers, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.

In the 1930s, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), concerned as a result of Imperial Japan&#x27;s rising military power in Asia, began to conduct surveillance in Japanese American communities in Hawaii. Starting in 1936, at the behest of President Roosevelt, the ONI began to compile a &quot;special list of those Japanese Americans who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp in the event of trouble&quot; between Japan and the United States. In 1939, again by order of the President, the ONI, Military Intelligence Division, and FBI began working together to compile a larger Custodial Detention Index. Early in 1941, Roosevelt commissioned Curtis Munson to conduct an investigation on Japanese Americans living on the West Coast and in Hawaii. After working with FBI and ONI officials and interviewing Japanese Americans and those familiar with them, Munson determined that the &quot;Japanese problem&quot; was nonexistent. His final report to the President, submitted November 7, 1941, &quot;certified a remarkable, even extraordinary degree of loyalty among this generally suspect ethnic group.&quot; A subsequent report by Kenneth Ringle (ONI), delivered to the President in January 1942, also found little evidence to support claims of Japanese American disloyalty and argued against mass incarceration.

===Roosevelt&#x27;s racial attitudes toward Japanese Americans===

Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to intern Japanese Americans was consistent with Roosevelt&#x27;s long-time racial views. During the 1920s, for example, he had written articles in the Macon Telegraph opposing white-Japanese intermarriage for fostering &quot;the mingling of Asiatic blood with European or American blood&quot; and praising California&#x27;s ban on land ownership by the first-generation Japanese. In 1936, while president, he privately wrote that, regarding contacts between Japanese sailors and the local Japanese American population in the event of war, &quot;every Japanese citizen or non-citizen on the Island of Oahu who meets these Japanese ships or has any connection with their officers or men should be secretly but definitely identified and his or her name placed on a special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp.&quot; 

===After Pearl Harbor===

In the weeks immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor the president disregarded the advice of advisors, notably John Franklin Carter, who urged him to speak out in defense of the rights of Japanese Americans.


The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, led military and political leaders to suspect that Imperial Japan was preparing a full-scale invasion of the United States West Coast. Due to Japan&#x27;s rapid military conquest of a large portion of Asia and the Pacific including a small portion of the U.S. West Coast (i.e., Aleutian Islands Campaign) between 1937 and 1942, some Americans feared that its military forces were unstoppable.

American public opinion initially stood by the large population of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; characterizing them as &quot;good Americans, born and educated as such.&quot; Many Americans believed that their loyalty to the United States was unquestionable. However, six weeks after the attack, public opinion along the Pacific began to turn against Japanese Americans living on the West Coast, as the press and other Americans became nervous about the potential for fifth column activity. Though some in the administration (including Attorney General Francis Biddle and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover) dismissed all rumors of Japanese American espionage on behalf of the Japanese war effort, pressure mounted upon the administration as the tide of public opinion turned against Japanese Americans.

A survey of the Office of Facts and Figures on February 4 (two weeks prior to the president&#x27;s order) reported that a majority of Americans expressed satisfaction with existing governmental controls on Japanese Americans. Moreover, in his autobiography in 1962, Attorney General Francis Biddle, who opposed incarceration, downplayed the influence of public opinion in prompting the president&#x27;s decision. He even considered it doubtful &quot;whether, political and special group press aside, public opinion even on the West Coast supported evacuation.&quot; Support for harsher measures toward Japanese Americans increased over time, however, in part since Roosevelt did little to use his office to calm attitudes. According to a March 1942 poll conducted by the American Institute of Public Opinion, after incarceration was becoming inevitable, 93% of Americans supported the relocation of Japanese non-citizens from the Pacific Coast while only 1% opposed it. According to the same poll, 59% supported the relocation of Japanese people who were born in the country and were United States citizens, while 25% opposed it.

The incarceration and imprisonment measures taken against Japanese Americans after the attack falls into a broader trend of anti-Japanese attitudes on the West Coast of the United States. To this end, preparations had already been made in the collection of names of Japanese American individuals and organizations, along with other foreign nationals such as Germans and Italians, that were to be removed from society in the event of a conflict. The December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into the Second World War, enabled the implementation of the dedicated government policy of incarceration, with the action and methodology having been extensively prepared before war broke out despite multiple reports that had been consulted by President Roosevelt expressing the notion that Japanese Americans posed little threat.

Additionally, the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II led to severe economic consequences. Numerous Japanese Americans had to leave their homes, businesses, and possessions since they were relocated to the internment camps. This also led to the collapse of many family-owned businesses, real estate, and their savings since they had been escorted to the camps. &quot;Camp residents lost some $400 million in property during their incarceration. Congress provided $38 million in reparations in 1948 and, forty years later, paid an additional $20,000 to each surviving individual who had been detained in the camps&quot;. Additionally, Japanese American farmers suffered greatly due to their forced relocation. In 1942, the managing secretary of the Western Growers Protective Association reported that the removal of Japanese Americans led to significant profits for growers and shippers. These losses were tragic, which ended up affecting a multitude of Japanese Americans and resulted in many losses of properties, businesses, and more. This also resulted in limited compensation, and far less than what they had originally lost. The economic outcomes of the Japanese imprisonments were disastrous and serve as a reminder of the lasting cost of cultural discrimination.

====Niihau incident====
Although the impact on US authorities is controversial, the Niihau incident immediately followed the attack on Pearl Harbor, when Ishimatsu Shintani, an Issei, and Yoshio Harada, a Nisei, and his Issei wife Irene Harada on the island of Ni&#x27;ihau violently freed a downed and captured Japanese naval airman, attacking their fellow Ni&#x27;ihau islanders in the process.

====Roberts Commission====
Several concerns over the loyalty of ethnic Japanese seemed to stem from racial prejudice rather than any evidence of malfeasance. The Roberts Commission report, which investigated the Pearl Harbor attack, was released on January 25 and accused persons of Japanese ancestry of espionage leading up to the attack. Although the report&#x27;s key finding was that General Walter Short and Admiral Husband E. Kimmel had been derelict in their duties during the attack on Pearl Harbor, one passage made vague reference to &quot;Japanese consular agents and other... persons having no open relations with the Japanese foreign service&quot; transmitting information to Japan. It was unlikely that these &quot;spies&quot; were Japanese American, as Japanese intelligence agents were distrustful of their American counterparts and preferred to recruit &quot;white persons and Negroes.&quot; However, despite the fact that the report made no mention of Americans of Japanese ancestry, national and West Coast media nevertheless used the report to vilify Japanese Americans and inflame public opinion against them.

====Questioning loyalty====
Major Karl Bendetsen and Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, head of the Western Defense Command, questioned Japanese American loyalty. DeWitt said:

He further stated in a conversation with California&#x27;s governor, Culbert L. Olson:

====&quot;A Jap&#x27;s a Jap&quot;====
DeWitt, who administered the incarceration program, repeatedly told newspapers that &quot;A Jap&#x27;s a Jap&quot; and testified to Congress:

DeWitt also sought approval to conduct search and seizure operations which were aimed at preventing alien Japanese from making radio transmissions to Japanese ships. The Justice Department declined, stating that there was no probable cause to support DeWitt&#x27;s assertion, as the FBI concluded that there was no security threat. On January 2, the Joint Immigration Committee of the California Legislature sent a manifesto to California newspapers which attacked &quot;the ethnic Japanese,&quot; who it alleged were &quot;totally unassimilable.&quot; This manifesto further argued that all people of Japanese heritage were loyal subjects of the Emperor of Japan; the manifesto contended that Japanese language schools were bastions of racism which advanced doctrines of Japanese racial superiority.

The manifesto was backed by the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West and the California Department of the American Legion, which in January demanded that all Japanese with dual citizenship be placed in concentration camps. By February, Earl Warren, the Attorney General of California (and a future Chief Justice of the United States), had begun his efforts to persuade the federal government to remove all people of Japanese ethnicity from the West Coast.

Those who were as little as Japanese were placed in incarceration camps. Bendetsen, promoted to colonel, said in 1942, &quot;I am determined that if they have one drop of Japanese blood in them, they must go to camp.&quot;

====Presidential Proclamations====
Upon the bombing of Pearl Harbor and pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526 and 2527 were issued designating Japanese, German and Italian nationals as enemy aliens. Information gathered by US officials over the previous decade was used to locate and incarcerate thousands of Japanese American community leaders in the days immediately following Pearl Harbor (see section elsewhere in this article &quot;Other concentration camps&quot;). In Hawaii, under the auspices of martial law, both &quot;enemy aliens&quot; and citizens of Japanese and &quot;German&quot; descent were arrested and interned (incarcerated if they were a US citizen).

Presidential Proclamation 2537 (codified at 7 Fed. Reg. 329) was issued on January 14, 1942, requiring &quot;alien enemies&quot; to obtain a certificate of identification and carry it &quot;at all times&quot;. Enemy aliens were not allowed to enter restricted areas. Violators of these regulations were subject to &quot;arrest, detention and incarceration for the duration of the war.&quot;

On February 13, the Pacific Coast Congressional subcommittee on aliens and sabotage recommended to the President immediate evacuation of &quot;all persons of Japanese lineage and all others, aliens and citizens alike&quot; who were thought to be dangerous from &quot;strategic areas,&quot; further specifying that these included the entire &quot;strategic area&quot; of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. On February 16 the President tasked Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson with replying. A conference on February 17 of Secretary Stimson with assistant secretary John J. McCloy, Provost Marshal General Allen W. Gullion, Deputy chief of Army Ground Forces Mark W. Clark, and Colonel Bendetsen decided that General DeWitt should be directed to commence evacuations &quot;to the extent he deemed necessary&quot; to protect vital installations. Throughout the war, interned Japanese Americans protested against their treatment and insisted that they be recognized as loyal Americans. Many sought to demonstrate their patriotism by trying to enlist in the armed forces. Although early in the war Japanese Americans were barred from military service, by 1943 the army had begun actively recruiting Nisei to join new all-Japanese American units.

==Development==
===Executive Order 9066 and related actions===
Executive Order 9066, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized military commanders to designate &quot;military areas&quot; at their discretion, &quot;from which any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; These &quot;exclusion zones,&quot; unlike the &quot;alien enemy&quot; roundups, were applicable to anyone that an authorized military commander might choose, whether citizen or non-citizen. Eventually such zones would include parts of both the East and West Coasts, totaling about 1/3 of the country by area. Unlike the subsequent deportation and incarceration programs that would come to be applied to large numbers of Japanese Americans, detentions and restrictions directly under this Individual Exclusion Program were placed primarily on individuals of German or Italian ancestry, including American citizens. The order allowed regional military commanders to designate &quot;military areas&quot; from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded.&quot; Although the executive order did not mention Japanese Americans, this authority was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were required to leave Alaska and the military exclusion zones from all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, with the exception of those inmates who were being held in government camps. The detainees were not only people of Japanese ancestry, they also included a relatively small number—though still totaling well over ten thousand—of people of German and Italian ancestry as well as Germans who were expelled from Latin America and deported to the U.S. Approximately 5,000 Japanese Americans relocated outside the exclusion zone before March 1942, while some 5,500 community leaders had been arrested immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack and thus were already in custody.

On March 2, 1942, General John DeWitt, commanding general of the Western Defense Command, publicly announced the creation of two military restricted zones. Military Area No. 1 consisted of the southern half of Arizona and the western half of California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as all of California south of Los Angeles. Military Area No. 2 covered the rest of those states. DeWitt&#x27;s proclamation informed Japanese Americans they would be required to leave Military Area 1, but stated that they could remain in the second restricted zone. Removal from Military Area No. 1 initially occurred through &quot;voluntary evacuation.&quot; Japanese Americans were free to go anywhere outside of the exclusion zone or inside Area 2, with arrangements and costs of relocation to be borne by the individuals. The policy was short-lived; DeWitt issued another proclamation on March 27 that prohibited Japanese Americans from leaving Area 1. A night-time curfew, also initiated on March 27, 1942, placed further restrictions on the movements and daily lives of Japanese Americans.

Included in the forced removal was Alaska, which, like Hawaii, was an incorporated U.S. territory located in the northwest extremity of the continental United States. Unlike the contiguous West Coast, Alaska was not subject to any exclusion zones due to its small Japanese population. Nevertheless, the Western Defense Command announced in April 1942 that all Japanese people and Americans of Japanese ancestry were to leave the territory for incarceration camps inland. By the end of the month, over 200 Japanese residents regardless of citizenship were exiled from Alaska, most of them ended up at the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Southern Idaho.

Eviction from the West Coast began on March 24, 1942, with Civilian Exclusion Order No. 1, which gave the 227 Japanese American residents of Bainbridge Island, Washington six days to prepare for their &quot;evacuation&quot; directly to Manzanar. Colorado governor Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only elected official to publicly denounce the incarceration of American citizens (an act that cost his reelection, but gained him the gratitude of the Japanese American community, such that a statue of him was erected in the Denver Japantown&#x27;s Sakura Square). A total of 108 exclusion orders issued by the Western Defense Command over the next five months completed the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast in August 1942.

In addition to imprisoning those of Japanese descent in the US, the US also interned people of Japanese (and German and Italian) descent deported from Latin America. Thirteen Latin American countries—Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru—cooperated with the US by apprehending, detaining and deporting to the US 2,264 Japanese Latin American citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry.

==Support and opposition==
===Non-military advocates of exclusion, removal, and detention===
The deportation and incarceration of Japanese Americans was popular among many white farmers who resented the Japanese American farmers. &quot;White American farmers admitted that their self-interest required the removal of the Japanese.&quot; These individuals saw incarceration as a convenient means of uprooting their Japanese American competitors. Austin E. Anson, managing secretary of the Salinas Vegetable Grower-Shipper Association, told &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1942:

The Leadership of the Japanese American Citizens League did not question the constitutionality of the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Instead, arguing it would better serve the community to follow government orders without protest, the organization advised the approximately 120,000 affected to go peacefully.

The Roberts Commission Report, prepared at President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s request, has been cited as an example of the fear and prejudice informing the thinking behind the incarceration program. The Report sought to link Japanese Americans with espionage activity, and to associate them with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Columnist Henry McLemore, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers, reflected the growing public sentiment that was fueled by this report:

Other California newspapers also embraced this view. According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial,

U.S. Representative Leland Ford (R-CA) of Los Angeles joined the bandwagon, who demanded that &quot;all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in [inland] concentration camps.&quot;

Incarceration of Japanese Americans, who provided critical agricultural labor on the West Coast, created a labor shortage which was exacerbated by the induction of many white American laborers into the Armed Forces. This vacuum precipitated a mass immigration of Mexican workers into the United States to fill these jobs, under the banner of what became known as the Bracero Program. Many Japanese detainees were temporarily released from their camps – for instance, to harvest Western beet crops – to address this wartime labor shortage.

===Non-military advocates who opposed exclusion, removal, and detention===
Like many white American farmers, the white businessmen of Hawaii had their own motives for determining how to deal with the Japanese Americans, but they opposed their incarceration. Instead, these individuals gained the passage of legislation which enabled them to retain the freedom of the nearly 150,000 Japanese Americans who would have otherwise been sent to concentration camps which were located in Hawaii. As a result, only 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese Americans in Hawaii were incarcerated.

The powerful businessmen of Hawaii concluded that the imprisonment of such a large proportion of the islands&#x27; population would adversely affect the economic prosperity of the territory. The Japanese represented &quot;over 90 percent of the carpenters, nearly all of the transportation workers, and a significant portion of the agricultural laborers&quot; on the islands. General Delos Carleton Emmons, the military governor of Hawaii, also argued that Japanese labor was &quot;&#x27;absolutely essential&#x27; for rebuilding the defenses destroyed at Pearl Harbor.&quot; Recognizing the Japanese American community&#x27;s contribution to the affluence of the Hawaiian economy, General Emmons fought against the incarceration of the Japanese Americans and had the support of most of the businessmen of Hawaii. By comparison, Idaho governor Chase A. Clark, in a Lions Club speech on May 22, 1942, said &quot;Japs live like rats, breed like rats and act like rats. We don&#x27;t want them ... permanently located in our state.&quot;

Initially, Oregon&#x27;s governor Charles A. Sprague opposed the incarceration, and as a result, he decided not to enforce it in the state and he also discouraged residents from harassing their fellow citizens, the Nisei. He turned against the Japanese by mid-February 1942, days before the executive order was issued, but he later regretted this decision and he attempted to atone for it for the rest of his life.

Even though the incarceration was a generally popular policy in California, it was not universally supported. R.C. Hoiles, publisher of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, argued during the war that the incarceration was unethical and unconstitutional:

It would seem that convicting people of disloyalty to our country without having specific evidence against them is too foreign to our way of life and too close akin to the kind of government we are fighting... We must realize, as Henry Emerson Fosdick so wisely said, &#x27;Liberty is always dangerous, but it is the safest thing we have.&#x27;

Members of some Christian religious groups (such as Presbyterians), particularly those who had formerly sent missionaries to Japan, were among opponents of the incarceration policy. Some Baptist and Methodist churches, among others, also organized relief efforts to the camps, supplying inmates with supplies and information.

===Statement of military necessity as a justification of incarceration===

====Niihau Incident====

The Niihau Incident occurred in December 1941, just after the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor. The Imperial Japanese Navy had designated the Hawaiian island of Niihau as an uninhabited island for damaged aircraft to land and await rescue. Three Japanese Americans on Niihau assisted a Japanese pilot, Shigenori Nishikaichi, who crashed there. Despite the incident, the Territorial Governor of Hawaii Joseph Poindexter rejected calls for the mass incarceration of the Japanese Americans living there.

====Cryptography====
In &quot;Magic: The Untold Story of U.S. Intelligence and the Evacuation of Japanese Residents from the West Coast During World War II&quot;, David Lowman, a former National Security Agency operative, argues that Magic (the code-name for American code-breaking efforts) intercepts posed &quot;frightening specter of massive espionage nets&quot;, thus justifying incarceration. Lowman contended that incarceration served to ensure the secrecy of U.S. code-breaking efforts, because effective prosecution of Japanese Americans might necessitate disclosure of secret information. If U.S. code-breaking technology was revealed in the context of trials of individual spies, the Japanese Imperial Navy would change its codes, thus undermining U.S. strategic wartime advantage.

Some scholars have criticized or dismissed Lowman&#x27;s reasoning that &quot;disloyalty&quot; among some individual Japanese Americans could legitimize &quot;incarcerating 120,000 people, including infants, the elderly, and the mentally ill&quot;. Lowman&#x27;s reading of the contents of the &quot;Magic&quot; cables has also been challenged, as some scholars contend that the cables demonstrate that Japanese Americans were not heeding the overtures of Imperial Japan to spy against the United States. According to one critic, Lowman&#x27;s book has long since been &quot;refuted and discredited&quot;.

The controversial conclusions drawn by Lowman were defended by conservative commentator Michelle Malkin in her book &quot;In Defense of Internment: The Case for &#x27;Racial Profiling&#x27; in World War II and the War on Terror&quot; (2004). Malkin&#x27;s defense of Japanese incarceration was due in part to reaction to what she describes as the &quot;constant alarmism from Bush-bashers who argue that every counter-terror measure in America is tantamount to the internment&quot;. She criticized academia&#x27;s treatment of the subject, and suggested that academics critical of Japanese incarceration had ulterior motives. Her book was widely criticized, particularly with regard to her reading of the Magic cables. Daniel Pipes, also drawing on Lowman, has defended Malkin, and said that Japanese American incarceration was &quot;a good idea&quot; which offers &quot;lessons for today&quot;.

====Black and Jewish reactions to the Japanese American incarceration====

The American public overwhelmingly approved of the Japanese American incarceration measures and as a result, they were seldom opposed, particularly by members of minority groups who felt that they were also being chastised within America. Morton Grodzins writes that &quot;The sentiment against the Japanese was not far removed from (and it was interchangeable with) sentiments against Negroes and Jews.&quot;

Occasionally, the NAACP and the NCJW spoke out but few were more vocal in opposition to incarceration than George S. Schuyler, an associate editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, perhaps the leading black newspaper in the U.S., who was increasingly critical of the domestic and foreign policy of the Roosevelt administration. He dismissed accusations that Japanese Americans presented any genuine national security threat. Schuyler warned African Americans that &quot;if the Government can do this to American citizens of Japanese ancestry, then it can do this to American citizens of ANY ancestry...Their fight is our fight.&quot;

The shared experience of racial discrimination has led some modern Japanese American leaders to come out in support of HR 40, a bill which calls for reparations to be paid to African-Americans because they are affected by slavery and subsequent discrimination. Cheryl Greenberg adds &quot;Not all Americans endorsed such racism. Two similarly oppressed groups, African Americans and Jewish Americans, had already organized to fight discrimination and bigotry.&quot; However, due to the justification of concentration camps by the US government, &quot;few seemed tactile to endorse the evacuation; most did not even discuss it.&quot; Greenberg argues that at the time, the incarceration was not discussed because the government&#x27;s rhetoric hid the motivations for it behind a guise of military necessity, and a fear of seeming &quot;un-American&quot; led to the silencing of most civil rights groups until years into the policy.

===United States District Court&#x27;s opinions===

A letter by General DeWitt and Colonel Bendetsen expressing racist bias against Japanese Americans was circulated and then hastily redacted in 1943–1944. DeWitt&#x27;s final report stated that, because of their race, it was impossible to determine the loyalty of Japanese Americans, thus necessitating incarceration. The original version was so offensive – even in the atmosphere of the wartime 1940s – that Bendetsen ordered all copies to be destroyed.
In 1980, a copy of the original &quot;Final Report: Japanese Evacuation from the West Coast – 1942&quot; was found in the National Archives, along with notes which show the numerous differences which exist between the original version and the redacted version. This earlier, racist and inflammatory version, as well as the FBI and Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) reports, led to the &quot;coram nobis&quot; retrials which overturned the convictions of Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi and Minoru Yasui on all charges related to their refusal to submit to exclusion and incarceration. The courts found that the government had intentionally withheld these reports and other critical evidence, at trials all the way up to the Supreme Court, which proved that there was no military necessity for the exclusion and incarceration of Japanese Americans. In the words of Department of Justice officials writing during the war, the justifications were based on &quot;willful historical inaccuracies and intentional falsehoods&quot;.

===The Ringle Report===
In May 2011, U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal, after a year of investigation, found Charles Fahy had intentionally withheld &quot;The Ringle Report&quot; drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, in order to justify the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s actions in the cases of &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;. The report would have undermined the administration&#x27;s position of the military necessity for such action, as it concluded that most Japanese Americans were not a national security threat, and that allegations of communication espionage had been found to be without basis by the FBI and Federal Communications Commission.

==Newspaper editorials==
Editorials from major newspapers at the time were generally supportive of the incarceration of the Japanese by the United States.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial dated February 19, 1942, stated that:

Since Dec. 7 there has existed an obvious menace to the safety of this region in the presence of potential saboteurs and fifth columnists close to oil refineries and storage tanks, airplane factories, Army posts, Navy facilities, ports and communications systems. Under normal sensible procedure not one day would have elapsed after Pearl Harbor before the government had proceeded to round up and send to interior points all Japanese aliens and their immediate descendants for classification and possible incarceration.

This dealt with aliens, and the unassimilated. Going even farther, an &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; editorial dated February 20, 1942, stated that:

The time to stop taking chances with Japanese aliens and Japanese-Americans has come. . . . While Americans have an inate [&quot;sic&quot;] distaste for stringent measures, every one must realize this is a total war, that there are no Americans running loose in Japan or Germany or Italy and there is absolutely no sense in this country running even the slightest risk of a major disaster from enemy groups within the nation.

A &quot;Washington Post&quot; editorial dated February 22, 1942, stated that:

There is but one way in which to regard the Presidential order empowering the Army to establish &quot;military areas&quot; from which citizens or aliens may be excluded. That is to accept the order as a necessary accompaniment of total defense.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial dated February 28, 1942, stated that:

As to a considerable number of Japanese, no matter where born, there is unfortunately no doubt whatever. They are for Japan; they will aid Japan in every way possible by espionage, sabotage and other activity; and they need to be restrained for the safety of California and the United States. And since there is no sure test for loyalty to the United States, all must be restrained. Those truly loyal will understand and make no objection.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial dated December 8, 1942, stated that:

The Japs in these centers in the United States have been afforded the very best of treatment, together with food and living quarters far better than many of them ever knew before, and a minimum amount of restraint. They have been as well fed as the Army and as well as or better housed. . . . The American people can go without milk and butter, but the Japs will be supplied.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial dated April 22, 1943, stated that:

As a race, the Japanese have made for themselves a record for conscienceless treachery unsurpassed in history. Whatever small theoretical advantages there might be in releasing those under restraint in this country would be enormously outweighed by the risks involved.

==Facilities==
The Works Projects Administration (WPA) played a key role in the construction and staffing of the camps in the initial period. From March to 
the end of November 1942, that agency spent $4.47 million on removal 
and incarceration, which was even more than the Army devoted to that purpose during that period. The WPA was instrumental in creating such features of the camps as guard towers and barbed wire fencing.

The government operated several different types of camps holding Japanese Americans. The best known facilities were the military-run Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA) &quot;Assembly Centers&quot; and the civilian-run War Relocation Authority (WRA) Many employees of the WRA had earlier worked for the WPA during the initial period of removal and construction. &quot;Relocation Centers,&quot; which are generally (but unofficially) referred to as &quot;internment camps&quot;. Scholars have urged dropping such euphemisms and refer to them as concentration camps and the people as incarcerated. Another argument for using the label &quot;concentration camps&quot; is that President Roosevelt himself applied that terminology to them, including at a press conference in November 1944.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) operated camps officially called &quot;Internment Camps&quot;, which were used to detain those suspected of crimes or of &quot;enemy sympathies&quot;. The government also operated camps for a number of German Americans and Italian Americans, who sometimes were assigned to share facilities with the Japanese Americans. The WCCA and WRA facilities were the largest and the most public. The WCCA Assembly Centers were temporary facilities that were first set up in horse racing tracks, fairgrounds, and other large public meeting places to assemble and organize inmates before they were transported to WRA Relocation Centers by truck, bus, or train. The WRA Relocation Centers were semi-permanent camps that housed persons removed from the exclusion zone after March 1942, or until they were able to relocate elsewhere in the United States outside the exclusion zone.

===DOJ and Army incarceration camps===
Eight U.S. Department of Justice Camps (in Texas, Idaho, North Dakota, New Mexico, and Montana) held Japanese Americans, primarily non-citizens and their families. The camps were run by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, under the umbrella of the DOJ, and guarded by Border Patrol agents rather than military police. The population of these camps included approximately 3,800 of the 5,500 Buddhist and Christian ministers, school instructors, newspaper workers, fishermen, and community leaders who had been accused of fifth column activity and arrested by the FBI after Pearl Harbor. (The remaining 1,700 were released to WRA relocation centers.) Immigrants and nationals of German and Italian ancestry were also held in these facilities, often in the same camps as Japanese Americans. Approximately 7,000 German Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans from Hawaiʻi and the U.S. mainland were interned in DOJ camps, along with 500 German seamen already in custody after being rescued from the &quot;SS Columbus&quot; in 1939. In addition 2,264 ethnic Japanese, 4,058 ethnic Germans, and 288 ethnic Italians were deported from 19 Latin American countries for a later-abandoned hostage exchange program with Axis countries or confinement in DOJ camps.

Several U.S. Army incarceration camps held Japanese, Italian, and German American men considered &quot;potentially dangerous&quot;. Camp Lordsburg, in New Mexico, was the only site built specifically to confine Japanese Americans. In May 1943, the Army was given responsibility for the detention of prisoners of war and all civilian internees were transferred to DOJ camps.

===WCCA Civilian Assembly Centers===
Executive Order 9066 authorized the removal of all persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast; however, it was signed before there were any facilities completed to house the displaced Japanese Americans. After the voluntary evacuation program failed to result in many families leaving the exclusion zone, the military took charge of the now-mandatory evacuation. On April 9, 1942, the Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA) was established by the Western Defense Command to coordinate the forced removal of Japanese Americans to inland concentration camps.

The relocation centers faced opposition from inland communities near the proposed sites who disliked the idea of their new &quot;Jap&quot; neighbors. In addition, government forces were struggling to build what would essentially be self-sufficient towns in very isolated, undeveloped, and harsh regions of the country; they were not prepared to house the influx of over 110,000 inmates. Since Japanese Americans living in the restricted zone were considered too dangerous to conduct their daily business, the military decided it had to house them in temporary centers until the relocation centers were completed.

Under the direction of Colonel Karl Bendetsen, existing facilities had been designated for conversion to WCCA use in March 1942, and the Army Corps of Engineers finished construction on these sites on April 21, 1942. All but four of the 15 confinement sites (12 in California, and one each in Washington, Oregon, and Arizona) had previously been racetracks or fairgrounds. The stables and livestock areas were cleaned out and hastily converted to living quarters for families of up to six, while wood and tarpaper barracks were constructed for additional housing, as well as communal latrines, laundry facilities, and mess halls. A total of 92,193 Japanese Americans were transferred to these temporary detention centers from March to August 1942. (18,026 more had been taken directly to two &quot;reception centers&quot; that were developed as the Manzanar and Poston WRA camps.) The WCCA was dissolved on March 15, 1943, when it became the War Relocation Authority and turned its attentions to the more permanent relocation centers.

===WRA Relocation Centers===
The War Relocation Authority (WRA) was the U.S. civilian agency responsible for the relocation and detention. The WRA was created by President Roosevelt on March 18, 1942, with Executive Order 9102 and it officially ceased to exist on June 30, 1946. Milton S. Eisenhower, then an official of the Department of Agriculture, was chosen to head the WRA. In the 1943 US Government film &quot;Japanese Relocation&quot; he said, &quot;This picture tells how the mass migration was accomplished. Neither the Army, not the War Relocation Authority relish the idea of taking men, women and children from their homes, their shops and their farms. So, the military and civilian agencies alike, determined to do the job as a democracy should—with real consideration for the people involved.&quot; Dillon S. Myer replaced Eisenhower three months later on June 17, 1942. Myer served as Director of the WRA until the centers were closed. Within nine months, the WRA had opened ten facilities in seven states and transferred over 100,000 people from the WCCA facilities.

The WRA camp at Tule Lake was integral to food production in its own camp, as well as other camps. Almost 30 crops were harvested at this site by farmworkers. Despite this, Tule Lake&#x27;s camp was eventually used as a detention center for people believed to pose a security risk. Tule Lake also served as a &quot;segregation center&quot; for individuals and families who were deemed &quot;disloyal&quot;, and for those who were to be deported to Japan.

===List of camps===

There were three types of camps. &quot;Civilian Assembly Centers&quot; were temporary camps, frequently located at horse tracks, where Japanese Americans were sent after they were removed from their communities. Eventually, most of the Japanese Americans were sent to &quot;Relocation Centers,&quot; also known as &quot;internment camps&quot;. &quot;Detention camps&quot; housed Nikkei who the government considered disruptive as well as Nikkei who the government believed were of special interest. When most of the Assembly Centers closed, they became training camps for US troops.

==Exclusion, removal, and detention==
Somewhere between 110,000 and 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were subject to this mass exclusion program, of whom about 80,000 &quot;Nisei&quot; (second generation) and &quot;Sansei&quot; (third generation) were U.S. citizens. The rest were &quot;Issei&quot; (first generation) who were subject to internment under the Alien Enemies Act; many of these &quot;resident aliens&quot; had been inhabitants of the United States for decades, but had been deprived by law of being able to become naturalized citizens. Also part of the West Coast removal were 101 orphaned children of Japanese descent taken from orphanages and foster homes within the exclusion zone.

Detainees of Japanese descent were first sent to one of 17 temporary &quot;Civilian Assembly Centers&quot;, where most awaited transfer to more permanent relocation centers being constructed by the newly formed War Relocation Authority (WRA). Some of those who reported to the civilian assembly centers were not sent to relocation centers, but were released under the condition that they remain outside the prohibited zone until the military orders were modified or lifted. Almost 120,000 Japanese Americans and resident Japanese aliens were eventually removed from their homes on the West Coast and Southern Arizona as part of one of the largest forced relocations in U.S. history.

Most of these camps/residences, gardens, and stock areas were placed on Native American reservations, for which the Native Americans were formally compensated. The Native American councils disputed the amounts negotiated in absentia by US government authorities. They later sued to gain relief and additional compensation for some items of dispute.

Under the National Student Council Relocation Program (supported primarily by the American Friends Service Committee), students of college age were permitted to leave the camps to attend institutions willing to accept students of Japanese ancestry. Although the program initially granted leave permits to a very small number of students, this eventually included 2,263 students by December 31, 1943.

===Conditions in the camps===
In 1943, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes wrote &quot;the situation in at least some of the Japanese internment camps is bad and is becoming worse rapidly.&quot; The quality of life in the camps was heavily influenced by which government entity was responsible for them. INS Camps were regulated by international treaty. The legal difference between &quot;interned&quot; and relocated had significant effects on those who were imprisoned.

According to a 1943 War Relocation Authority report, inmates were housed in &quot;tar paper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind&quot;. The spartan facilities met international laws, but left much to be desired. Many camps were built quickly by civilian contractors during the summer of 1942 based on designs for military barracks, making the buildings poorly equipped for cramped family living. Throughout many camps, twenty-five people were forced to live in space built to contain four, leaving no room for privacy.

The Heart Mountain War Relocation Center in northwestern Wyoming was a barbed-wire-surrounded enclave with unpartitioned toilets, cots for beds, and a budget of 45 cents daily per capita for food rations.

Armed guards were posted at the camps, which were all in remote, desolate areas far from population centers. Inmates were typically allowed to stay with their families. There are documented instances of guards shooting inmates who reportedly attempted to walk outside the fences. One such shooting, that of James Wakasa at Topaz, led to a re-evaluation of the security measures in the camps. Some camp administrations eventually allowed relatively free movement outside the marked boundaries of the camps. Nearly a quarter of the inmates left the camps to live and work elsewhere in the United States, outside the exclusion zone. Eventually, some were authorized to return to their hometowns in the exclusion zone under supervision of a sponsoring American family or agency whose loyalty had been assured.

The phrase &quot;shikata ga nai&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;it cannot be helped&quot;) was commonly used to summarize the incarcerated families&#x27; resignation to their helplessness throughout these conditions. This was noticed by their children, as mentioned in the well-known memoir &quot;Farewell to Manzanar&quot; by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston. Further, it is noted that parents may have internalized these emotions to withhold their disappointment and anguish from affecting their children. Nevertheless, children still were cognizant of this emotional repression.

====Medical care====
Before the war, 87 physicians and surgeons, 137 nurses, 105 dentists, 132 pharmacists, 35 optometrists, and 92 lab technicians provided healthcare to the Japanese American population, with most practicing in urban centers like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. As the eviction from the West Coast was carried out, the Wartime Civilian Control Administration worked with the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) and many of these professionals to establish infirmaries within the temporary assembly centers. An Issei doctor was appointed to manage each facility, and additional healthcare staff worked under his supervision, although the USPHS recommendation of one physician for every 1,000 inmates and one nurse to 200 inmates was not met. Overcrowded and unsanitary conditions forced assembly center infirmaries to prioritize inoculations over general care, obstetrics, and surgeries; at Manzanar, for example, hospital staff performed over 40,000 immunizations against typhoid and smallpox. Food poisoning was common and also demanded significant attention. Those who were detained in Topaz, Minidoka, and Jerome experienced outbreaks of dysentery.

Facilities in the more permanent &quot;relocation centers&quot; eventually surpassed the makeshift assembly center infirmaries, but in many cases, these hospitals were incomplete when inmates began to arrive and were not fully functional for several months. Additionally, vital medical supplies such as medications and surgical and sterilization equipment were limited. The staff shortages suffered in the assembly centers continued in the WRA camps. The administration&#x27;s decision to invert the management structure and demote Japanese American medical workers to positions below white employees, while capping their pay rate at $20/month, further exacerbated this problem. (At Heart Mountain, for example, Japanese American doctors received $19/month compared to white nurses&#x27; $150/month.) The war had caused a shortage of healthcare professionals across the country, and the camps often lost potential recruits to outside hospitals that offered better pay and living conditions. When the WRA began to allow some Japanese Americans to leave camp, many Nikkei medical professionals resettled outside the camp. Those who remained had little authority in the administration of the hospitals. Combined with the inequitable payment of salaries between white and Japanese American employees, conflicts arose at several hospitals, and there were two Japanese American walk-outs at Heart Mountain in 1943.

Despite a shortage of healthcare workers, limited access to equipment, and tension between white administrators and Japanese American staff, these hospitals provided much-needed medical care in camp. The extreme climates of the remote incarceration sites were hard on infants and elderly prisoners. The frequent dust storms of the high desert locations led to increased cases of asthma and coccidioidomycosis, while the swampy, mosquito-infested Arkansas camps exposed residents to malaria, all of which were treated in camp. Almost 6,000 live deliveries were performed in these hospitals, and all mothers received pre- and postnatal care. The WRA recorded 1,862 deaths across the ten camps, with cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis, and vascular disease accounting for the majority.

===Education===

Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans detained by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities were set up in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Books were only issued a month after the opening. In the Southwest, the schoolhouses were extremely hot in summertime. Class sizes were very large. At the height of its attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. There was a general teacher shortage in the US at the time, and the teachers were required to live in the camps themselves. Although the salary in the camps was triple that for regular teaching jobs, authorities were still unable to fill all the teaching positions with certified personnel, and so some non-certified teacher detainees were hired as assistants.

===Sports===

Although life in the camps was very difficult, Japanese Americans formed many different sports teams, including baseball and football teams. In January 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued what came to be known as the &quot;Green Light Letter&quot; to MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, which urged him to continue playing Major League Baseball games despite the ongoing war. In it Roosevelt said that &quot;baseball provides a recreation&quot;, and this was true for Japanese American incarcerees as well. Over 100 baseball teams were formed in the Manzanar camp so that Japanese Americans could have some recreation, and some of the team names were carry-overs from teams formed before the incarceration.

Both men and women participated in the sports. In some cases, the Japanese American baseball teams from the camps traveled to outside communities to play other teams. Incarcerees from Idaho competed in the state tournament in 1943, and there were games between the prison guards and the Japanese American teams. Branch Rickey, who would be responsible for bringing Jackie Robinson into Major League Baseball in 1947, sent a letter to all of the WRA camps expressing interest in scouting some of the Nisei players. In the fall of 1943, three players tried out for the Brooklyn Dodgers in front of MLB scout George Sisler, but none of them made the team.

=== Tule Lake Agricultural Program ===
The Tule Lake agricultural program was constructed with the purpose of growing crops in order to feed both detainees in their camp and in the other camps. It is said that any extras would be sold on the open market. The agricultural program was a way for inmates to be employed while at the center, as well as a way for some to learn farming skills. A 4-H program was established to pave a way for children to help the agricultural process at the center. From 1942 through 1945, Tule Lake produced 29 different crops, including Japanese vegetables like daikon, gobo, and nappa.

===Student leave to attend Eastern colleges===
Japanese American students were no longer allowed to attend college in the West during the incarceration, and many found ways to transfer or attend schools in the Midwest and East in order to continue their education.

Most Nisei college students followed their families into camp, but a small number arranged for transfers to schools outside the exclusion zone. Their initial efforts expanded as sympathetic college administrators and the American Friends Service Committee began to coordinate a larger student relocation program. The Friends petitioned WRA Director Milton Eisenhower to place college students in Eastern and Midwestern academic institutions.

The National Japanese American Student Relocation Council was formed on May 29, 1942, and the AFSC administered the program. The acceptance process vetted college students and graduating high school students through academic achievement and a questionnaire centering on their relationship with American culture. Some high school students were also able to leave the incarceration camps through boarding schools. 39 percent of the Nisei students were women. The student&#x27;s tuition, book costs, and living expenses were absorbed by the U.S. government, private foundations (such as the Columbia Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation) and church scholarships, in addition to significant fundraising efforts led by Issei parents in camp.

Outside camp, the students took on the role of &quot;ambassadors of good will&quot;, and the NJASRC and WRA promoted this image to soften anti-Japanese prejudice and prepare the public for the resettlement of Japanese Americans in their communities. Some students worked as domestic workers in nearby communities during the school year.

At Earlham College, President William Dennis helped institute a program that enrolled several dozen Japanese American students in order to spare them from incarceration. While this action was controversial in Richmond, Indiana, it helped strengthen the college&#x27;s ties to Japan and the Japanese American community. At Park College in Missouri, Dr. William Lindsay Young attempted to get Nisei students enrolled despite backlash from the greater Parkville city.

At Oberlin College, about 40 evacuated Nisei students were enrolled. One of them, Kenji Okuda, was elected as student council president. Three Nisei students were enrolled at Mount Holyoke College during World War 2.

In total, over 500 institutions east of the exclusion zone opened their doors to more than 3,000 college-age youth who had been placed behind barbed wire, many of whom were enrolled in West Coast schools prior to their removal. These included a variety of schools, from small liberal arts colleges to large public universities.

The NJASRC ceased operations on June 7, 1946. After the incarceration camps had been shut down, releasing many Issei parents with little belongings, many families followed the college students to the eastern cities where they attended school. In 1980, former Nisei students formed the NSRC Nisei Student Relocation Commemorative Fund. In 2021, The University of Southern California apologized for discriminating against Nisei students. It issued posthumous degrees to the students whose educations were cut short or illegitimated, having already issued degrees to those surviving.

===Loyalty questions and segregation===
In early 1943, War Relocation Authority officials, working with the War Department and the Office of Naval Intelligence, circulated a questionnaire in an attempt to determine the loyalty of incarcerated Nisei men they hoped to recruit into military service. The &quot;Statement of United States Citizen of Japanese Ancestry&quot; was initially given only to Nisei who were eligible for service (or would have been, but for the 4-C classification imposed on them at the start of the war). Authorities soon revised the questionnaire and required all adults in camp to complete the form. Most of the 28 questions were designed to assess the &quot;Americanness&quot; of the respondent — had they been educated in Japan or the U.S.? were they Buddhist or Christian? did they practice &quot;judo&quot; or play on a baseball team? The final two questions on the form, which soon came to be known as the &quot;loyalty questionnaire&quot;, were more direct:

Across the camps, people who answered No to both questions became known as &quot;No Nos&quot;.

While most camp inmates simply answered &quot;yes&quot; to both questions, several thousand — 17 percent of the total respondents, 20 percent of the Nisei — gave negative or qualified replies out of confusion, fear or anger at the wording and implications of the questionnaire. In regard to Question 27, many worried that expressing a willingness to serve would be equated with volunteering for combat, while others felt insulted at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them and their families. An affirmative answer to Question 28 brought up other issues. Some believed that renouncing their loyalty to Japan would suggest that they had at some point been loyal to Japan and disloyal to the United States. Many believed they were to be deported to Japan no matter how they answered, they feared an explicit disavowal of the Emperor would become known and make such resettlement extremely difficult.

On July 15, 1943, Tule Lake, the site with the highest number of &quot;no&quot; responses to the questionnaire, was designated to house inmates whose answers suggested they were &quot;disloyal&quot;. During the remainder of 1943 and into early 1944, more than 12,000 men, women and children were transferred from other camps to the maximum-security Tule Lake Segregation Center.

Afterward, the government passed the Renunciation Act of 1944, a law that made it possible for Nisei and Kibei to renounce their American citizenship. A total of 5,589 detainees opted to do so; 5,461 of these were sent to Tule Lake. Of those who renounced US citizenship, 1,327 were repatriated to Japan. Those persons who stayed in the US faced discrimination from the Japanese American community, both during and after the war, for having made that choice of renunciation. At the time, they feared what their futures held were they to remain American and remain incarcerated.

These renunciations of American citizenship have been highly controversial, for a number of reasons. Some apologists for incarceration have cited the renunciations as evidence that &quot;disloyalty&quot; or anti-Americanism was well represented among the incarcerated peoples, thereby justifying the incarceration. Many historians have dismissed the latter argument, for its failure to consider that the small number of individuals in question had been mistreated and persecuted by their own government at the time of the &quot;renunciation&quot;:

[T]he renunciations had little to do with &quot;loyalty&quot; or &quot;disloyalty&quot; to the United States, but were instead the result of a series of complex conditions and factors that were beyond the control of those involved. Prior to discarding citizenship, most or all of the renunciants had experienced the following misfortunes: forced removal from homes; loss of jobs; government and public assumption of disloyalty to the land of their birth based on race alone; and incarceration in a &quot;segregation center&quot; for &quot;disloyal&quot; ISSEI or NISEI...

Minoru Kiyota, who was among those who renounced his citizenship and soon came to regret the decision, has said that he wanted only &quot;to express my fury toward the government of the United States&quot;, for his incarceration and for the mental and physical duress, as well as the intimidation, he was made to face.

Civil rights attorney Wayne M. Collins successfully challenged most of these renunciations as invalid, owing to the conditions of duress and intimidation under which the government obtained them. Many of the deportees were Issei (first generation) or Kibei, who often had difficulty with English and often did not understand the questions they were asked. Even among those Issei who had a clear understanding, Question 28 posed an awkward dilemma: Japanese immigrants were denied U.S. citizenship at the time, so when asked to renounce their Japanese citizenship, answering &quot;Yes&quot; would have made them stateless persons.

When the government began seeking army volunteers from among the camps, only 6% of military-aged male inmates volunteered to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. Most of those who refused tempered that refusal with statements of willingness to fight if they were restored their rights as American citizens. Eventually 33,000 Japanese American men and many Japanese American women served in the U.S. military during World War II, of which 20,000 served in the U.S. Army.

The 100th Infantry Battalion, which was formed in June 1942 with 1,432 men of Japanese descent from the Hawaii National Guard, was sent to Camps McCoy and Shelby for advanced training. Because of the 100th&#x27;s superior training record, the War Department authorized the formation of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. When the call was made, 10,000 young men from Hawaii volunteered with eventually 2,686 being chosen along with 1,500 from the continental U.S. The 100th Infantry Battalion landed in Salerno, Italy in September 1943 and became known as the Purple Heart Battalion. This legendary outfit was joined by the 442nd RCT in June 1944, and this combined unit became the most highly decorated U.S. military unit of its size and duration in U.S. military history. The 442nd&#x27;s Nisei segregated field artillery battalion, then on detached service within the U.S. Army in Bavaria, liberated at least one of the satellite labor camps of the Nazis&#x27; original Dachau concentration camp on April 29, 1945, and only days later, on May 2, halted a death march in southern Bavaria.

===Proving commitment to the United States===
Many Nisei worked to prove themselves as loyal American citizens. Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans who served in the Army during World War II, &quot;many Japanese American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home&quot; and they were &quot;proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American&quot;. Some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Women&#x27;s Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. A smaller number of women also volunteered to serve as nurses for the ANC (Army Nurse Corps). Satoshi Ito, an incarceration camp inmate, reinforces the idea of the immigrants&#x27; children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother would tell him, you&#x27;re here in the United States, you need to do well in school, you need to prepare yourself to get a good job when you get out into the larger society. He said she would tell him, don&#x27;t be a dumb farmer like me, like us to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William &amp; Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.

===Other concentration camps===

As early as September 1931, after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, US officials began to compile lists of individuals, lists which were particularly focused on the Issei. This data was eventually included in the Custodial Detention index (CDI). Agents in the Department of Justice&#x27;s Special Defense Unit classified the subjects into three groups: A, B, and C, with A being the &quot;most dangerous&quot;, and C being &quot;possibly dangerous&quot;.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt authorized his attorney general to put a plan for the arrest of thousands of individuals whose names were on the potential enemy alien lists into motion, most of these individuals were Japanese American community leaders. Armed with a blanket arrest warrant, the FBI seized these men on the eve of December 8, 1941. These men were held in municipal jails and prisons until they were moved to Department of Justice detention camps, these camps were separate from the camps which were operated by the Wartime Relocation Authority (WRA). These camps were operated under far more stringent conditions and they were also patrolled by heightened criminal-style guards, despite the absence of criminal proceedings. Memoirs about the camps include those by Keiho Soga and Toru Matsumoto.

Crystal City, Texas, was one such camp where Japanese Americans, German Americans, and Italian Americans were interned along with a large number of Axis-descended nationals who were seized from several Latin-American countries by the U.S.

The Canadian government also confined its citizens with Japanese ancestry during World War II (see Internment of Japanese Canadians), for many reasons which were also based on fear and prejudice. Some Latin American countries on the Pacific Coast, such as Peru, interned ethnic Japanese or sent them to the United States for incarceration. Brazil also imposed restrictions on its ethnic Japanese population.

===Hawaii===
Although Japanese Americans in Hawaii comprised more than one-third of Hawaii&#x27;s entire population, businessmen prevented their incarceration or deportation to the concentration camps which were located on the mainland because they recognized their contributions to Hawaii&#x27;s economy. In the hysteria of the time, some mainland Congressmen (Hawaii was only an incorporated U.S. territory at the time, and despite being fully part of the U.S., did not have a voting representative or senator in Congress) promoted that all Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants should be removed from Hawaii but were unsuccessful. An estimated 1,200 to 1,800 Japanese nationals and American-born Japanese from Hawaii were interned or incarcerated, either in five camps on the islands or in one of the mainland concentration camps, but this represented well-under two percent of the total Japanese American residents in the islands. &quot;No serious explanations were offered as to why ... the internment of individuals of Japanese descent was necessary on the mainland, but not in Hawaii, where the large Japanese-Hawaiian population went largely unmolested.&quot;

The vast majority of Japanese Americans and their immigrant parents in Hawaii were not incarcerated because the government had already declared martial law in Hawaii, a legal measure which allowed it to significantly reduce the supposed risks of espionage and sabotage by residents of Hawaii who had Japanese ancestry. Also, Japanese Americans comprised over 35% of the territory&#x27;s entire population: they numbered 157,905 out of a total population of 423,330 at the time of the 1940 census, making them the largest ethnic group at that time; detaining so many people would have been enormously challenging in terms of logistics. Additionally, the whole of Hawaiian society was dependent on their productivity. According to intelligence reports which were published at the time, &quot;the Japanese, through a concentration of effort in select industries, had achieved a virtual stranglehold on several key sectors of the economy in Hawaii,&quot; and they &quot;had access to virtually all jobs in the economy, including high-status, high-paying jobs (e.g., professional and managerial jobs)&quot;. To imprison such a large percentage of the islands&#x27; work force would have crippled the Hawaiian economy. Thus, the unfounded fear of Japanese Americans turning against the United States was overcome by the reality-based fear of massive economic loss.

Despite the financial and logistical obstacles, President Roosevelt persisted for quite some time in urging incarceration of Japanese Americans in Hawaii. As late as February 26, 1942, he informed Secretary of the Navy Knox that he had &quot;long felt that most of the Japanese should be removed from Oahu to one of the other Islands.&quot; While Roosevelt conceded that such an undertaking involved &quot;much planning, much temporary construction, and 
careful supervision of them when they get to the new location,&quot; he did not &quot;worry about the constitutional question—first, because of my recent order and, second, because Hawaii is under martial law.&quot; He called for Knox to work with Stimson and &quot;go ahead and do it as a military project.&quot; Eventually, he too gave up the project.

Lieutenant General Delos C. Emmons, the commander of the Hawaii Department, promised that the local Japanese American community would be treated fairly as long as it remained loyal to the United States. He succeeded in blocking efforts to relocate it to the outer islands or the mainland by pointing out the logistical difficulties of such a move. Among the small number incarcerated were community leaders and prominent politicians, including territorial legislators Thomas Sakakihara and Sanji Abe.

Five concentration camps were operated in the territory of Hawaii, referred to as the &quot;Hawaiian Island Detention Camps&quot;. One camp was located on Sand Island, at the mouth of Honolulu Harbor. This camp was constructed before the outbreak of the war. All of the prisoners who were held there were &quot;detained under military custody... because of the imposition of martial law throughout the Islands&quot;. It was replaced by the Honouliuli Internment Camp, near Ewa, on the southwestern shore of Oahu in 1943. Another was located in Haiku, Maui, in addition to the Kilauea Detention Center on Hawaii and Camp Kalaheo on Kauai.

===Japanese Latin Americans===
During World War II, over 2,200 Japanese from Latin America were held in concentration camps run by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, part of the Department of Justice. Beginning in 1942, Latin Americans of Japanese ancestry were rounded up and transported to American concentration camps run by the INS and the U.S. Justice Department. Most of these internees, approximately 1,800, came from Peru. An additional 250 were from Panama, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

The first group of Japanese Latin Americans arrived in San Francisco on April 20, 1942, on board the &quot;Etolin&quot; along with 360 ethnic Germans and 14 ethnic Italians from Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. The 151 men — ten from Ecuador, the rest from Peru — had volunteered for deportation believing they were to be repatriated to Japan. They were denied visas by U.S. Immigration authorities and then detained on the grounds they had tried to enter the country illegally, without a visa or passport. Subsequent transports brought additional &quot;volunteers&quot;, including the wives and children of men who had been deported earlier. A total of 2,264 Japanese Latin Americans, about two-thirds of them from Peru, were interned in facilities on the U.S. mainland during the war.

The United States originally intended to trade these Latin American internees as part of a hostage exchange program with Japan and other Axis nations; at least one trade occurred. Over 1,300 persons of Japanese ancestry were exchanged for a like number of non-official Americans in October 1943, at the port of Marmagao, India. Over half were Japanese Latin Americans (the rest being ethnic Germans and Italians) and of that number one-third were Japanese Peruvians.

On September 2, 1943, the Swedish ship &quot;MS Gripsholm&quot; departed the U.S. with just over 1,300 Japanese nationals (including nearly a hundred from Canada and Mexico) en route for the exchange location, Marmagao, the main port of the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India. After two more stops in South America to take on additional Japanese nationals, the passenger manifest reached 1,340. Of that number, Latin American Japanese numbered 55 percent of the Gripsholm&#x27;s travelers, 30 percent of whom were Japanese Peruvian. Arriving in Marmagao on October 16, 1943, the Gripsholm&#x27;s passengers disembarked and then boarded the Japanese ship &quot;Teia Maru.&quot; In return, &quot;non-official&quot; Americans (secretaries, butlers, cooks, embassy staff workers, etc.) previously held by the Japanese Army boarded the &quot;Gripsholm&quot; while the &quot;Teia Maru&quot; headed for Tokyo. Because this exchange was done with those of Japanese ancestry officially described as &quot;volunteering&quot; to return to Japan, no legal challenges were encountered. The U.S. Department of State was pleased with the first trade and immediately began to arrange a second exchange of non-officials for February 1944. This exchange would involve 1,500 non-volunteer Japanese who were to be exchanged for 1,500 Americans. The US was busy with Pacific Naval activity and future trading plans stalled. Further slowing the program were legal and political &quot;turf&quot; battles between the State Department, the Roosevelt administration, and the DOJ, whose officials were not convinced of the legality of the program.

The completed October 1943 trade took place at the height of the Enemy Alien Deportation Program. Japanese Peruvians were still being &quot;rounded up&quot; for shipment to the U.S. in previously unseen numbers. Despite logistical challenges facing the floundering prisoner exchange program, deportation plans were moving ahead. This is partly explained by an early-in-the-war revelation of the overall goal for Latin Americans of Japanese ancestry under the Enemy Alien Deportation Program. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wrote an agreeing President Roosevelt, &quot;[that the US must] continue our efforts to remove all the Japanese from these American Republics for internment in the United States.&quot;

&quot;Native&quot; Peruvians expressed extreme animosity toward their Japanese citizens and expatriates, and Peru refused to accept the post-war return of Japanese Peruvians from the US. Although a small number asserting special circumstances, such as marriage to a non-Japanese Peruvian, did return, the majority were trapped. Their home country refused to take them back (a political stance Peru maintained until 1950), they were generally Spanish speakers in the Anglo US, and in the postwar U.S., the Department of State started expatriating them to Japan. Civil rights attorney Wayne Collins filed injunctions on behalf of the remaining internees, helping them obtain &quot;parole&quot; relocation to the labor-starved Seabrook Farms in New Jersey. He started a legal battle that was not resolved until 1953, when, after working as undocumented immigrants for almost ten years, those Japanese Peruvians remaining in the U.S. were finally offered citizenship.

==Incarceration ends==
On December 18, 1944, the Supreme Court handed down two decisions on the legality of the incarceration under Executive Order 9066. &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, a 6–3 decision upholding a Nisei&#x27;s conviction for violating the military exclusion order, stated that, in general, the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast was constitutional. However, &quot;Ex parte Endo&quot; unanimously declared on that same day that loyal citizens of the United States, regardless of cultural descent, could not be detained without cause. In effect, the two rulings held that, while the eviction of American citizens in the name of military necessity was legal, the subsequent incarceration was not—thus paving the way for their release.

Having been alerted to the Court&#x27;s decision, the Roosevelt administration issued Public Proclamation No. 21 the day before the &quot;Korematsu&quot; and &quot;Endo&quot; rulings were made public, on December 17, 1944, rescinding the exclusion orders and declaring that Japanese Americans could return to the West Coast the next month.

Although War Relocation Authority (WRA) Director Dillon Myer and others had pushed for an earlier end to the incarceration, the Japanese Americans were not allowed to return to the West Coast until January 2, 1945, after the November 1944 election, so as not to impede Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection campaign. Many younger detainees had already been sent to Midwest or Eastern cities to pursue work or educational opportunities. For example, 20,000 were sent to Lake View, Chicago. The remaining population began to leave the camps to try to rebuild their lives at home. Former inmates were given $25 and a train ticket to wherever they wanted to go, but many had little or nothing to return to, having lost their homes and businesses. When Japanese Americans were sent to the camps they could only take a few items with them and while incarcerated could only work for menial jobs with a small monthly salary of $12–$19. When incarceration ended, they therefore had few savings to survive on. Some emigrated to Japan, although many of these were repatriated against their will. The camps remained open for residents who were not ready to return (mostly elderly Issei and families with young children), but the WRA pressured stragglers to leave by gradually eliminating services in camp. Those who had not left by each camp&#x27;s close date were forcibly removed and sent back to the West Coast.

Nine of the ten WRA camps were shut down by the end of 1945, although Tule Lake, which held &quot;renunciants&quot; slated for deportation to Japan, was not closed until March 20, 1946. Japanese Latin Americans brought to the U.S. from Peru and other countries, who were still being held in the DOJ camps at Santa Fe and Crystal City, took legal action in April 1946 in an attempt to avoid deportation to Japan.

==Aftermath==
===Hardship and material loss===

Many detainees lost irreplaceable personal property due to restrictions that prohibited them from taking more than they could carry into the camps. These losses were compounded by theft and destruction of items placed in governmental storage. Leading up to their incarceration, Nikkei were prohibited from leaving the Military Zones or traveling more than from home, forcing those who had to travel for work, like truck farmers and residents of rural towns, to quit their jobs. Many others were simply fired for their Japanese heritage.

Many Japanese Americans encountered continued housing injustice after the war. Alien land laws in California, Oregon, and Washington barred the Issei from owning their pre-war homes and farms. Many had cultivated land for decades as tenant farmers, but they lost their rights to farm those lands when they were forced to leave. Other Issei (and Nisei who were renting or had not completed payments on their property) had found families willing to occupy their homes or tend their farms during their incarceration. However, those unable to strike a deal with caretakers had to sell their property, often in a matter of days and at great financial loss to predatory land speculators, who made huge profits.

In addition to these monetary and property losses, there were seven who were shot and killed by sentries: Kanesaburo Oshima, 58, during an escape attempt from Fort Sill, Oklahoma; Toshio Kobata, 58, and Hirota Isomura, 59, during transfer to Lordsburg, New Mexico; James Ito, 17, and Katsuji James Kanegawa, 21, during the December 1942 Manzanar Riot; James Hatsuaki Wakasa, 65, while walking near the perimeter wire of Topaz; and Shoichi James Okamoto, 30, during a verbal altercation with a sentry at the Tule Lake Segregation Center.

Hatano Farm is located south of Los Angeles. It was shut down in 2022 by city officials, but recently gained status as a point of historical interest by vote from the California State Resources Commission. Upon returning from incarceration, U.S. Army veteran James Hatano settled and began to grow flowers. His land was located in Rancho Palos Verdes and was acquired through a federal lease in 1953. Hatano was one of the only returning Japanese who decided to farm again.

Psychological injury was observed by Dillon S. Myer, director of the WRA camps. In June 1945, Myer described how the Japanese Americans had grown increasingly depressed and overcome with feelings of helplessness and personal insecurity. Author Betty Furuta explains that the Japanese used &quot;gaman,&quot; loosely meaning &quot;perseverance&quot;, to overcome hardships; this was mistaken by non-Japanese as being introverted and lacking initiative.

Japanese Americans also encountered hostility and even violence when they returned to the West Coast. Concentrated largely in rural areas of Central California, there were dozens of reports of gunshots, fires, and explosions aimed at Japanese American homes, businesses, and places of worship, in addition to non-violent crimes like vandalism and the defacing of Japanese graves. In one of the few cases that went to trial, four men were accused of attacking the Doi family of Placer County, California, setting off an explosion, and starting a fire on the family&#x27;s farm in January 1945. Despite a confession from one of the men that implicated the others, the jury accepted their defense attorney&#x27;s framing of the attack as a justifiable attempt to keep California &quot;a white man&#x27;s country&quot; and acquitted all four defendants.

To compensate former detainees for their property losses, Congress passed the Japanese-American Claims Act on July 2, 1948, allowing Japanese Americans to apply for compensation for property losses which occurred as &quot;a reasonable and natural consequence of the evacuation or exclusion&quot;. By the time the Act was passed, the IRS had already destroyed most of the detainees&#x27; 1939–42 tax records. Due to the time pressure and strict limits on how much they could take to the camps, few were able to preserve detailed tax and financial records during the evacuation process. Therefore, it was extremely difficult for claimants to establish that their claims were valid. Under the Act, Japanese American families filed 26,568 claims totaling $148 million in requests; about $37 million was approved and disbursed.

The different placement for the detainees had significant consequences for their lifetime outcomes. A 2016 study finds, using the random dispersal of detainees into camps in seven different states, that the people assigned to richer locations did better in terms of income, education, socioeconomic status, house prices, and housing quality roughly fifty years later.

===Reparations and redress===

Beginning in the 1960s, a younger generation of Japanese Americans, inspired by the civil rights movement, began what is known as the &quot;Redress Movement&quot;, an effort to obtain an official apology and reparations from the federal government for incarcerating their parents and grandparents during the war. They focused not on documented property losses but on the broader injustice and mental suffering caused by the incarceration. The movement&#x27;s first success was in 1976, when President Gerald Ford proclaimed that the incarceration was &quot;wrong&quot;, and a &quot;national mistake&quot; which &quot;shall never again be repeated&quot;. President Ford signed a proclamation formally terminating Executive Order 9066 and apologized for the incarceration, stating: &quot;We now know what we should have known then—not only was that evacuation wrong but Japanese-Americans were and are loyal Americans. On the battlefield and at home the names of Japanese-Americans have been and continue to be written in history for the sacrifices and the contributions they have made to the well-being and to the security of this, our common Nation.&quot;

The campaign for redress was launched by Japanese Americans in 1978. The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), which had cooperated with the administration during the war, became part of the movement. It asked for three measures: $25,000 to be awarded to each person who was detained, an apology from Congress acknowledging publicly that the U.S. government had been wrong, and the release of funds to set up an educational foundation for the children of Japanese American families.

In 1980, under the Carter administration, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) to study the matter. On February 24, 1983, the commission issued a report entitled &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot;, condemning the incarceration as unjust and motivated by racism and xenophobic ideas rather than factual military necessity. Concentration camp survivors sued the federal government for $24 million in property loss, but lost the case. However, the Commission recommended that $20,000 in reparations be paid to those Japanese Americans who had suffered incarceration.

The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 exemplified the Japanese American redress movement that impacted the large debate about the reparation bill. There was question over whether the bill would pass during the 1980s due to the poor state of the federal budget and the low support of Japanese Americans covering 1% of the United States. However, four powerful Japanese American Democrats and Republicans who had war experience, with the support of Democratic congressmen Barney Frank, sponsored the bill and pushed for its passage as their top priority.
On August 10, 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which had been sponsored by several representatives including Barney Frank, Norman Mineta, and Bob Matsui in the House and by Spark Matsunaga who got 75 co-sponsors in the Senate, provided financial redress of $20,000 for each former detainee who was still alive when the act was passed, totaling $1.2 billion. The question of to whom reparations should be given, how much, and even whether monetary reparations were appropriate were subjects of sometimes contentious debate within the Japanese American community and Congress.

On September 27, 1992, the Civil Liberties Act Amendments of 1992, appropriating an additional $400 million to ensure all remaining detainees received their $20,000 redress payments, was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush. He issued another formal apology from the U.S. government on December 7, 1991, on the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, saying:
In remembering, it is important to come to grips with the past. No nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces of its past. We in the United States acknowledge such an injustice in our history. The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.

Over 81,800 people qualified by 1998 and $1.6 billion was distributed among them.

Under the 2001 budget of the United States, Congress authorized the preservation of ten detention sites as historical landmarks: &quot;places like Manzanar, Tule Lake, Heart Mountain, Topaz, Amache, Jerome, and Rohwer will forever stand as reminders that this nation failed in its most sacred duty to protect its citizens against prejudice, greed, and political expediency&quot;.

President Bill Clinton awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, to Korematsu in 1998, saying, &quot;In the long history of our country&#x27;s constant search for justice, some names of ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls: Plessy, Brown, Parks ... to that distinguished list, today we add the name of Fred Korematsu.&quot; That year, Korematsu served as the Grand Marshal of San Francisco&#x27;s annual Cherry Blossom Festival parade. On January 30, 2011, California first observed an annual &quot;Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitution&quot;, the first such ceremony ever to be held in commemoration of an Asian American in the United States. On June 14, 2011, Peruvian President Alan García apologized for his country&#x27;s internment of Japanese immigrants during World War II, most of whom were transferred to the U.S.

=== Social impact and legacy ===
After the war, and once the process of internment came to its conclusion, Japanese Americans became socially affected by the war and their experiences of United States government policy. Japanese Americans rejected their racial identity as a prerequisite to various organizations that had existed prior to their internment, in order to assimilate back into American society, with both the Japanese Association and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce slipping into non-existence in the post-war years. The distancing of Japanese Americans from any collective, racially labelled establishments was something they saw necessary in order to preserve their status in the United States in the wake of their experiences.

In addition, Japanese Americans were also impacted socially by a changing religious structure in which ethnic churches were terminated, with church membership dropping from 25% of the Japanese American population in 1942, to 6% in 1962.

==Terminology debate==
===Misuse of the term &quot;internment&quot;===
The legal term &quot;internment&quot; has been used in regards to the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans. This term, however, derives from international conventions regarding the treatment of enemy nationals during wartime and specifically limits internment to those (noncitizen) enemy nationals who threaten the security of the detaining power. The internment of selected enemy alien belligerents, as opposed to mass incarceration, is legal both under US and international law. UCLA Asian American studies professor Lane Hirabayashi pointed out that the history of the term internment, to mean the arrest and holding of non-citizens, could only be correctly applied to Issei, Japanese people who were not legal citizens. These people were a minority during Japanese incarceration and thus Roger Daniels, emeritus professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, has concluded that this terminology is wrongfully used by any government that wishes to include groups other than the Issei.

On April 22, 2022, The Associated Press edited its entry for &quot;Japanese internment&quot;, changing the entry heading to &quot;Japanese internment, incarceration,&quot; and adding the following wording:Though internment has been applied historically to all detainments of Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals during World War II, the broader use of the term is inaccurate—about two-thirds of those who were relocated US citizens and thus could not be considered interns—and many Japanese-Americans find it objectionable.

It is better to say that they were &quot;incarcerated&quot; or &quot;detained&quot; and to define the larger event as the &quot;incarceration of Japanese Americans&quot;. 

===Which term to use===
During World War II, the camps were referred to both as relocation centers and concentration camps by government officials and in the press. Roosevelt himself referred to the camps as concentration camps on different occasions, including at a press conference held on October 20, 1942. In 1943, his attorney general Francis Biddle lamented that &quot;The present practice of keeping loyal American citizens in concentration camps for longer than is necessary is dangerous and repugnant to the principles of our government.&quot;

Following World War II, other government officials made statements suggesting that the use of the term &quot;relocation center&quot; had been largely euphemistic. In 1946, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes wrote &quot;We gave the fancy name of &#x27;relocation centers&#x27; to these dust bowls, but they were concentration camps nonetheless.&quot; In a 1961 interview, Harry S. Truman stated &quot;They were
concentration camps. They called it relocation but they put them in concentration camps, and I was against it. We were in a period of emergency, but it was still the wrong thing to do.&quot;

In subsequent decades, debate has arisen over the terminology used to refer to camps in which Americans of Japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents, were incarcerated by the US government during the war. These camps have been referred to as &quot;war relocation centers&quot;, &quot;relocation camps&quot;, &quot;relocation centers&quot;, &quot;internment camps&quot;, and &quot;concentration camps&quot;, and the controversy over which term is the most accurate and appropriate continues.

===Towards a consensus===
In 1998, the use of the term &quot;concentration camps&quot; gained greater credibility prior to the opening of an exhibit about the American camps at Ellis Island. Initially, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) and the National Park Service, which manages Ellis Island, objected to the use of the term in the exhibit. However, during a subsequent meeting held at the offices of the AJC in New York City, leaders representing Japanese Americans and Jewish Americans reached an understanding about the use of the term.

After the meeting, the Japanese American National Museum and the AJC issued a joint statement (which was included in the exhibit) that read in part:&quot;The New York Times&quot; published an unsigned editorial supporting the use of &quot;concentration camp&quot; in the exhibit. An article quoted Jonathan Mark, a columnist for &quot;The Jewish Week&quot;, who wrote, &quot;Can no one else speak of slavery, gas, trains, camps? It&#x27;s Jewish malpractice to monopolize pain and minimize victims.&quot; AJC Executive Director David A. Harris stated during the controversy, &quot;We have not claimed Jewish exclusivity for the term &#x27;concentration camps.&#x27;&quot;, while also stating &quot;Since the Second World War, these terms have taken on a specificity and a new level of meaning that deserves protection. A certain care needs to be exercised.&quot;

Deborah Schiffrin has written that, at the opening of the exhibition, entitled &quot;America&#x27;s Concentration Camps: Remembering the Japanese-American Experience&quot;, &quot;some Jewish groups&quot; had been offended by the use of the term. However, Schiffrin also notes that a compromise was reached when an appropriate footnote was added to the exhibit brochure.

===On the rejection of euphemisms===
On July 7, 2012, at its annual convention, the National Council of the Japanese American Citizens League unanimously ratified the &quot;Power of Words Handbook,&quot; calling for the use of &quot;...truthful and accurate terms, and retiring the misleading euphemisms created by the government to cover up the denial of Constitutional and human rights, the force, oppressive conditions, and racism against 120,000 innocent people of Japanese ancestry locked up in America&#x27;s World War II concentration camps.&quot; Moreover, Roosevelt himself publicly used the term &quot;concentration camps&quot; without any qualifiers to describe Japanese American incarceration in a press conference in November 1944.

==Comparisons==
The incarceration of Japanese Americans has been compared the internal deportation of Ethnically Volga German Soviet citizens from the western USSR to Soviet Central Asia. As well as the persecutions, expulsions, and dislocations of other ethnic minority groups which also occurred during World War II, both in Europe and Asia.

==Notable individuals who were incarcerated==
*George Takei, an American actor famed for his role as Sulu in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, was incarcerated at Rohwer and Tule Lake concentration camps between the ages of five and eight. He reflected on these experiences in the 2019 series &quot;The Terror: Infamy&quot;. Takei has also recounted his time in a concentration camp in the graphic novel &quot;They Called Us Enemy&quot;.
*Pat Morita, the American actor who played the role of Mr. Miyagi in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. He and his family were incarcerated at Gila River.
*Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese American sculptor, decided to voluntarily relocate to Poston, Arizona from New York but eventually asked to be released because of the conditions and alienation from the Japanese American community in camp.
*Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga, a &quot;nisei&quot; high school senior incarcerated in Manzanar, California who became a political activist for various causes, including Japanese American redress
*Norman Y. Mineta was a U.S. Representative from San Jose, Secretary of Commerce under Clinton, and Secretary of Transportation under President George W. Bush
*Ruth Asawa, artist and namesake of the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts. She was incarcerated with her family at the Rowher camp in Arkansas.

===Cultural legacy===

====Exhibitions and collections====



* In 1987, the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History opened an exhibition called &quot;A More Perfect Union: Japanese Americans and the U.S. Constitution&quot;. The exhibition examined the Constitutional process by considering the experiences of Americans of Japanese ancestry before, during, and after World War II. On view were more than 1,000 artifacts and photographs relating to the experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II. The exhibition closed on January 11, 2004. On November 8, 2011, the Museum launched an online exhibition of the same name with shared archival content.
* In September 2022, the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles created a project in which each person with Japanese ancestry who was incarcerated in an internment camp (over 125,000 names) is displayed in a printed book of names, called the Ireichō, a website known as the Ireizō (ireizo.com), and a light sculpture called Ireihi.
* Following recognition of the injustices done to Japanese Americans, in 1992 Manzanar camp was designated a National Historic Site to &quot;provide for the protection and interpretation of historic, cultural, and natural resources associated with the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II&quot; (Public Law 102-248). In 2001, the site of the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho was designated the Minidoka National Historic Site. Honouliuli National Historic Site and Amache National Historic Site have also been added to the National Park System.
* The elementary school at Poston Camp Unit 1, the only surviving school complex at one of the camps and the only major surviving element of the Poston camp, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2012.
* On April 16, 2013, the Japanese American Internment Museum was opened in McGehee, Arkansas regarding the history of two concentration camps.
* In January 2015, the Topaz Museum opened in Delta, Utah. Its stated mission is &quot;to preserve the Topaz site and the history of the internment experience during World War II; to interpret its impact on the internees, their families, and the citizens of Millard County; and to educate the public in order to prevent a recurrence of a similar denial of American civil rights&quot;.
* On June 29, 2017, in Chicago, Illinois, the Alphawood Gallery, in partnership with the Japanese American Service Committee, opened &quot;Then They Came for Me&quot;, the largest exhibition on Japanese American incarceration and postwar resettlement ever to open in the Midwest. This exhibit was scheduled to run until November 19, 2017.

=====Sculpture=====

Nina Akamu, a Sansei, created the sculpture entitled &quot;Golden Cranes&quot; of two red-crowned cranes, which became the center feature of the Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II. The U.S. Department of Defense described the November 9, 2000, dedication of the Memorial: &quot;Drizzling rain was mixed with tears streaming down the faces of Japanese American World War II heroes and those who spent the war years imprisoned in isolated internment camps.&quot; Akamu&#x27;s family&#x27;s connection to the concentration camps based on the experience of her maternal grandfather, who was interned and later died in a concentration camp in Hawaii—combined with the fact that she grew up in Hawaii for a time, where she fished with her father at Pearl Harbor—and the erection of a Japanese American war memorial near her home in Massa, Italy, inspired a strong connection to the Memorial and its creation.

United States Attorney General Janet Reno also spoke at the dedication of the Memorial, where she shared a letter from President Clinton stating: &quot;We are diminished when any American is targeted unfairly because of his or her heritage. This Memorial and the internment sites are powerful reminders that stereotyping, discrimination, hatred and racism have no place in this country.&quot;

According to the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation, the memorial:

...is symbolic not only of the Japanese American experience, but of the extrication of anyone from deeply painful and restrictive circumstances. It reminds us of the battles we&#x27;ve fought to overcome our ignorance and prejudice and the meaning of an integrated culture, once pained and torn, now healed and unified. Finally, the monument presents the Japanese American experience as a symbol for all peoples.

====Films====

Dozens of movies were filmed about and in the concentration camps; these relate the experiences of inmates or were made by former camp inmates. Examples follow.
* The film &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955) is about the wartime bias against Japanese Americans.
* In &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), Ralph Macchio&#x27;s character, Daniel, discovers a box containing references to the deaths of Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s wife and child in the Manzanar camp, and to Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita&#x27;s character) being awarded the Medal of Honor while serving with the 442nd Infantry Regiment.

===Legal legacy===

Several significant legal decisions arose out of Japanese American incarceration, relating to the powers of the government to detain citizens in wartime. Among the cases which reached the US Supreme Court were &quot;Ozawa v. United States&quot; (1922), &quot;Yasui v. United States&quot; (1943), &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; (1943), &quot;ex parte Endo&quot; (1944), and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944). In &quot;Ozawa&quot;, the court established that peoples defined as &#x27;white&#x27; were specifically of Caucasian descent; In &quot;Yasui&quot; and &quot;Hirabayashi,&quot; the court upheld the constitutionality of curfews based on Japanese ancestry; in &quot;Korematsu,&quot; the court upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion order. In &quot;Endo&quot;, the court accepted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and ruled that the WRA had no authority to subject a loyal citizen to its procedures.

Korematsu&#x27;s and Hirabayashi&#x27;s convictions were vacated in a series of &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases in the early 1980s. In the &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases, federal district and appellate courts ruled that newly uncovered evidence revealed an unfairness which, had it been known at the time, would likely have changed the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions in the Yasui, Hirabayashi, and Korematsu cases.

These new court decisions rested on a series of documents recovered from the National Archives showing that the government had altered, suppressed, and withheld important and relevant information from the Supreme Court, including the Final Report by General DeWitt justifying the incarceration program. The Army had destroyed documents in an effort to hide alterations that had been made to the report to reduce their racist content. The &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases vacated the convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi (Yasui died before his case was heard, rendering it moot), and are regarded as part of the impetus to gain passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.

The rulings of the US Supreme Court in the Korematsu and Hirabayashi cases were criticized in Dictum in the 2018 majority opinion of &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot; upholding a ban on immigration of nationals from several Muslim majority countries but not overruled as it fell outside the case-law applicable to the lawsuit. Regarding the Korematsu case, Chief Justice Roberts wrote: &quot;The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority.&quot;

Former Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark, who represented the US Department of Justice in the &quot;relocation&quot;, writes in the epilogue to the book &quot;Executive Order 9066: The Internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans&quot; (1992):

<text>The Leaning Tower of Pisa ( ), or simply the Tower of Pisa (), is the , or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral. It is known for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is one of three structures in Pisa&#x27;s Cathedral Square (), which includes the cathedral and Pisa Baptistry. Over time, the tower has become one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world as well an architectural icon of Italy, receiving over 5 million visitors each year.

The height of the tower is from the ground on the low side and on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is . Its weight is estimated at . The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase.

The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure&#x27;s weight. It worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

== Architect ==
The identity of the architect of the tower is a subject of controversy. The design had long been attributed to a man named Guglielmo and to Bonanno Pisano, the latter a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to return and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.

== Construction ==
Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell&#x27;Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the . The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower. On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid. Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals. Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: &quot;Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa&quot;.

The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for the better part of a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled. On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower&#x27;s construction.

On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower. On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut the required marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco. In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved. Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoese in the Battle of Meloria.

The seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower. There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.

== History following construction ==
Between 1589 and 1592, Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass, in keeping with the scientific law of free fall. The primary source for this is the biography &quot;Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei)&quot;, written by Galileo&#x27;s pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death.

During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. Leon Weckstein, a U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower, was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.

Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.

Starting in 1993, 870 tonnes of lead counterweights were added, which straightened the tower slightly.

The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.

The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight, and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away, and residences in the path of a potential collapse were vacated. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by removing of soil from underneath the raised end. The tower&#x27;s tilt was reduced by , returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years. In total, of soil were removed.

After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening, the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower&#x27;s age and its exposure to wind and rain. In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.

A ceremony for the 850th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone was held on 9 August 2023.

== Earthquake survival ==
The tower has survived at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. A 2018 engineering investigation concluded that the tower withstood the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction: the height and stiffness of the tower combined with the softness of the foundation soil influences the tower&#x27;s vibrational characteristics in such a way that it does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the tower to the verge of collapse helped to prevent significant destruction in the event of an earthquake.

About the 5th bell: The name &quot;Pasquareccia&quot; comes from &quot;Easter&quot;, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in &quot;Palazzo Pretorio&quot; in Pisa, where it was called &quot;La Giustizia&quot; (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289. A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken &quot;Pasquareccia&quot;.
The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.

== &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ==
Two German churches have challenged the tower&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s most lopsided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower of the Oberkirche in the town of Bad Frankenhausen. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former&#x27;s tilt to be 3.97 degrees. In June 2010, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the &quot;World&#x27;s Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower&quot;; it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Tower of Pisa, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in Wānaka, New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.

<doc id="46890" wikidata="Q1136013" url="?curid=46890" title="Frequency-hopping spread spectrum">
<text>Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly changing the carrier frequency among many frequencies occupying a large spectral band. The changes are controlled by a code known to both transmitter and receiver. FHSS is used to avoid interference, to prevent eavesdropping, and to enable code-division multiple access (CDMA) communications.

The frequency band is divided into smaller sub-bands. Signals rapidly change (&quot;hop&quot;) their carrier frequencies among the center frequencies of these sub-bands in a determined order. Interference at a specific frequency will affect the signal only during a short interval.

FHSS offers four main advantages over a fixed-frequency transmission:

# FHSS signals are highly resistant to narrowband interference because the signal hops to a different frequency band.
# Signals are difficult to intercept if the frequency-hopping pattern is not known.
# Jamming is also difficult if the pattern is unknown; the signal can be jammed only for a single hopping period if the spreading sequence is unknown.
# FHSS transmissions can share a frequency band with many types of conventional transmissions with minimal mutual interference. FHSS signals add minimal interference to narrowband communications, and vice versa.

== Usage ==

=== Military ===
Spread-spectrum signals are highly resistant to deliberate jamming unless the adversary has knowledge of the frequency-hopping pattern. Military radios generate the frequency-hopping pattern under the control of a secret Transmission Security Key (TRANSEC) that the sender and receiver share in advance. This key is generated by devices such as the KY-57 Speech Security Equipment. United States military radios that use frequency hopping include the JTIDS/MIDS family, the HAVE QUICK Aeronautical Mobile communications system, and the SINCGARS Combat Net Radio, Link-16.

=== Civilian ===
In the US, since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) amended rules to allow FHSS systems in the unregulated 2.4 GHz band, many consumer devices in that band have employed various FHSS modes. eFCC CFR 47 part 15.247 covers the regulations in the US for 902–928 MHz, 2400–2483.5 MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz bands, and the requirements for frequency hopping.

Some walkie-talkies that employ FHSS technology have been developed for unlicensed use on the 900 MHz band. FHSS technology is also used in many hobby transmitters and receivers used for radio-controlled model cars, airplanes, and drones. A type of multiple access is achieved allowing hundreds of transmitter/receiver pairs to be operated simultaneously on the same band, in contrast to previous FM or AM radio-controlled systems that had limited simultaneous channels.

==Technical considerations==
The overall bandwidth required for frequency hopping is much wider than that required to transmit the same information using only one carrier frequency. But because transmission occurs only on a small portion of this bandwidth at any given time, the instantaneous interference bandwidth is really the same. While providing no extra protection against wideband thermal noise, the frequency-hopping approach reduces the degradation caused by narrowband interference sources.

One of the challenges of frequency-hopping systems is to synchronize the transmitter and receiver. One approach is to have a guarantee that the transmitter will use all the channels in a fixed period of time. The receiver can then find the transmitter by picking a random channel and listening for valid data on that channel. The transmitter&#x27;s data is identified by a special sequence of data that is unlikely to occur over the segment of data for this channel, and the segment can also have a checksum for integrity checking and further identification. The transmitter and receiver can use fixed tables of frequency-hopping patterns, so that once synchronized they can maintain communication by following the table.

In the US, FCC part 15 on unlicensed spread spectrum systems in the 902–928 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands permits more power than is allowed for non-spread-spectrum systems. Both FHSS and direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) systems can transmit at 1 watt, a thousandfold increase from the 1 milliwatt limit on non-spread-spectrum systems. The FCC also prescribes a minimum number of frequency channels and a maximum dwell time for each channel.

==Origins==
In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi experimented with frequency-selective reception in an attempt to minimise interference.

The earliest mentions of frequency hopping in open literature are in US patent 725,605, awarded to Nikola Tesla on March 17, 1903, and in radio pioneer Jonathan Zenneck&#x27;s book &quot;Wireless Telegraphy&quot; (German, 1908, English translation McGraw Hill, 1915), although Zenneck writes that Telefunken had already tried it. Nikola Tesla doesn&#x27;t mention the phrase &quot;frequency hopping&quot; directly, but certainly alludes to it. Entitled &quot;Method of Signaling&quot;, the patent describes a system that would enable radio communication &quot;without any danger of the signals or messages being disturbed, intercepted, interfered with in any way&quot;.

The German military made limited use of frequency hopping for communication between fixed command points in World War I to prevent eavesdropping by British forces, who did not have the technology to follow the sequence. Jonathan Zenneck&#x27;s book &quot;Wireless Telegraphy&quot; was originally published in German in 1908, but was translated into English in 1915 as the enemy started using frequency hopping on the front line.

In 1920, Otto B. Blackwell, De Loss K. Martin, and Gilbert S. Vernam filed a patent application for a &quot;Secrecy Communication System&quot;, granted as U.S. Patent 1,598,673 in 1926. This patent described a method of transmitting signals on multiple frequencies in a random manner for secrecy, anticipating key features of later frequency hopping systems.

A Polish engineer and inventor, Leonard Danilewicz, claimed to have suggested the concept of frequency hopping in 1929 to the Polish General Staff, but it was rejected.

In 1932, was awarded to Willem Broertjes, named &quot;Method of maintaining secrecy in the transmission of wireless telegraphic messages&quot;, which describes a system where &quot;messages are transmitted by means of a group of frequencies... known to the sender and receiver alone, and alternated at will during transmission of the messages&quot;.

During World War II, the US Army Signal Corps was inventing a communication system called SIGSALY, which incorporated spread spectrum in a single frequency context. But SIGSALY was a top-secret communications system, so its existence was not known until the 1980s.

In 1942, actress Hedy Lamarr and composer George Antheil received for their &quot;Secret Communications System&quot;, an early version of frequency hopping using a piano-roll to switch among 88 frequencies to make radio-guided torpedoes harder for enemies to detect or jam. They then donated the patent to the U.S. Navy.

Frequency-hopping ideas may have been rediscovered in the 1950s during patent searches when private companies were independently developing direct-sequence Code Division Multiple Access, a non-frequency-hopping form of spread-spectrum. In 1957, engineers at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division adopted a similar idea, using the recently invented transistor instead of Lamarr&#x27;s and Antheil&#x27;s clockwork technology. In 1962, the US Navy utilized Sylvania Electronic Systems Division&#x27;s work during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

A practical application of frequency hopping was developed by Ray Zinn, co-founder of Micrel Corporation. Zinn developed a method allowing radio devices to operate without the need to synchronize a receiver with a transmitter. Using frequency hopping and sweep modes, Zinn&#x27;s method is primarily applied in low data rate wireless applications such as utility metering, machine and equipment monitoring and metering, and remote control. In 2006 Zinn received for his &quot;Wireless device and method using frequency hopping and sweep modes.&quot;

== Variations ==
Adaptive frequency-hopping spread spectrum (AFH) as used in Bluetooth improves resistance to radio frequency interference by avoiding crowded frequencies in the hopping sequence. This sort of adaptive transmission is easier to implement with FHSS than with DSSS.

The key idea behind AFH is to use only the &quot;good&quot; frequencies and avoid the &quot;bad&quot; ones—those experiencing frequency selective fading, those on which a third party is trying to communicate, or those being actively jammed. Therefore, AFH should be complemented by a mechanism for detecting good and bad channels.

But if the radio frequency interference is itself dynamic, then AFH&#x27;s strategy of &quot;bad channel removal&quot; may not work well. For example, if there are several colocated frequency-hopping networks (as Bluetooth Piconet), they are mutually interfering and AFH&#x27;s strategy fails to avoid this interference.

The problem of dynamic interference, gradual reduction of available hopping channels and backward compatibility with legacy Bluetooth devices was resolved in version 1.2 of the Bluetooth Standard (2003). Such a situation can often happen in the scenarios that use unlicensed spectrum.

In addition, dynamic radio frequency interference is expected to occur in the scenarios related to cognitive radio, where the networks and the devices should exhibit frequency-agile operation.

Chirp modulation can be seen as a form of frequency-hopping that simply scans through the available frequencies in consecutive order to communicate.

Frequency hopping can be superimposed on other modulations or waveforms to enhance the system performance.

<text>are Japanese immigrants to countries in North America and South America. The term is used mostly by ethnic Japanese. are born in Japan; their children born in the new country are (, &quot;two&quot;, plus , &quot;generation&quot;); and their grandchildren are (, &quot;three&quot;, plus , &quot;generation&quot;).

The character and uniqueness of the is recognized in their social history.

==History==
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897. In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Peru.

===Brazilian ===
Brazil is home to the largest ethnic Japanese population outside Japan, numbering an estimated more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity), more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States. The Japanese Brazilians are an important part of Asian ethnic minorities in Brazil.

===American ===

The first members of the emigrated not directly to the mainland United States, but to Hawaii. These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship &quot;City of Tokio&quot; in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai&#x27;i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its sugar plantations. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.

Emigration of Japanese directly to the mainland began in 1885, when &quot;student-laborers&quot; landed on the West Coast of the United States. The earliest of these emigrated to San Francisco. Their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home. While they encountered discrimination, they also made opportunities, and many settled in California, and later in Washington and Oregon as well as Alaska (to a lesser degree).

===Canadian ===

Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, like their American counterparts, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different socio-cultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences. The narrative of Japanese-Canadians include post-Pearl Harbor experiences of uprooting, incarceration, and dispersal of the pre-war Japanese-Canadian communities.

===Peruvian ===

Among the approximately 100,000 (2021) Peruvians of Japanese descent living in Peru, the Japanese Peruvians comprise a small number.

== Cultural profile ==

=== Generations ===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have specific names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for . The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like , , and , which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called and the fifth is called .

 is a Japanese-language term used by ethnic Japanese in countries in North America and South America to specify the Japanese people who were the first generation to immigrate there.

Originally, as mentioned above, these words were themselves common nouns in Japan referred to generations or reigns. So they are also still used in Japanese terms for personal names, such as means Queen Elizabeth II. Within the ethnic Japanese immigrant community they had come to characterize their own generations.

The , , and generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, involvement with non-Japanese, religious belief and practice, and other matters. The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during World War II has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns.

The term encompasses all of the world&#x27;s Japanese immigrants across generations. The collective memory of the and older was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911. Newer immigrants carry very different memories of more recent Japan. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other. The significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

In North America, since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred. The , their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.

There are just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London. Unlike other communities in the world, these Britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as , , or .

====Issei====
The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before emigrating, is called &quot;Issei&quot; (一世). In the 1930s, the term &quot;Issei&quot; came into common use, replacing the term &quot;immigrant&quot; (&quot;ijusha&quot;). This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves. The term &quot;Issei&quot; represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.

&quot;Issei&quot; settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English. They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were unable to rebuild their lost businesses and savings. The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of &quot;Issei&quot; being predominantly friends with other &quot;Issei.&quot;

Unlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.

====&quot;Issei&quot; women====
&quot;Issei&quot; women&#x27;s lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness. The &quot;Issei&quot; women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late &quot;Meiji&quot; Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of &quot;Issei&quot; women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women. In Hawai‘i, &quot;Issei&quot; women worked as washerwomen, midwives, and barbers, providing essential services to the growing immigrant population. &quot;Issei&quot; women were instrumental in fostering social cohesion and preserving Japanese culture through the establishment of community organizations. Shizue Iwatsuki founded the Japanese Women’s Society in Hood River, Oregon, which provided a vital social network for Japanese immigrant women while ensuring the continuation of cultural traditions. 

&quot;Issei&quot; women divided their time between working and keeping house. Many described their lives as a constant cycle of labor, balancing agricultural work with domestic responsibilities. They frequently referred to their husbands as &quot;Meiji men,&quot; describing them as embodying the patriarchal ideals of late Meiji Japan. These men often avoided household or childcare duties, leaving Issei women to shoulder most of the physical and emotional labor.

====Aging====
The &quot;kanreki&quot; (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the &quot;Issei&quot; and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of &quot;Nisei.&quot; Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.

Japanese-American photographer Mary Koga documented elderly first generation immigrants in her &quot;Portrait of the Issei in Illinois&quot;, taken between 1986 and 1989.

==History==
The experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the Japanese society they left behind. As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.

===Emigrants from Japan===
Japan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the Tokugawa family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society. The only exceptions were Chinese and some Dutch, but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese citizens. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by Commodore Perry caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the Meiji era to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.

After 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.

After 1884, emigration of working classes was permitted; and the first issei began to arrive in North and South America soon after. For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon. By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon. By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.

===Immigrants in America===

Few Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan. This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many &quot;Issei&quot; arrived as laborers. They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.

The Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice. Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan. If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.

In 1913, California&#x27;s Alien Land Law prohibited non-citizens from owning land in the state, and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive alien land laws. This included the &quot;Issei&quot;, Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth. Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their &quot;Nisei&quot; children.

===Americans&#x27; first impression of Issei===
Americans generally viewed the &quot;Issei&quot; as a crude, ill-educated lot. Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. 

Whether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the &quot;Issei&quot; almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the &quot;Issei&quot; from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California. The only exceptions were that some young &quot;Issei&quot; committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.

===Racial segregation and immigration law===

The post-1900 cause to renew the Chinese Exclusion Act became generalized protests against all Asian immigrants, including the Issei. Since Chinese immigration to the U.S. was largely limited, hostility fell on the &quot;Issei.&quot; American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading anti-Japanese sentiment. White Americans wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the Asiatic Exclusion League that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese students at a segregated school. The &quot;Issei&quot; were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former president, Theodore Roosevelt, and as a result, they signed the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.

By 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman&#x27;s agreement, a number of &quot;Nisei&quot;, the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The &quot;Issei&quot; were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the &quot;Issei.&quot;

The Immigration Act of 1924 represented the Issei&#x27;s failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before 1 July 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.

The &quot;Issei,&quot; however, were very good at enhancing rice farming on &quot;unusable&quot; land. Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state. The largest &quot;Issei&quot; community settled around Vacaville, California, near San Francisco.

===Internment===

When the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (&quot;Nisei&quot;) and their non-citizen parents (&quot;Issei&quot;). When the apology and redress for injustices were enacted by the American Congress and the Canadian Parliament in 1988, most of the &quot;Issei&quot; were dead, or too old for it to make any significant difference in lives that had been disrupted.

== Notable individuals ==

The number of &quot;issei&quot; who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the &quot;nikkei.&quot; Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by &quot;issei&quot; from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.

<doc id="46893" wikidata="Q319128" url="?curid=46893" title="Sansei">
<text>is a Japanese and North American English term used in parts of the world (mainly in South America and North America) to refer to the children of children born to ethnically Japanese emigrants (&quot;Issei&quot;) in a new country of residence, outside of Japan. The &quot;nisei&quot; are considered the second generation, while grandchildren of the Japanese-born emigrants are called &quot;Sansei&quot;. The fourth generation is referred to as &quot;yonsei&quot;. The children of at least one &quot;nisei&quot; parent are called &quot;Sansei&quot;; they are usually the first generation of whom a high percentage are mixed-race, given that their parents were (usually), themselves, born and raised in America.

The character and uniqueness of the &quot;sansei&quot; is recognized in its social history.

==In various countries==

Although the earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897, the four largest populations of Japanese and their descendants are in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Peru.

===Brazilian &quot;Sansei&quot;===

Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan, with an estimate of more than 1.5 million people (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity), more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States. The &quot;Sansei&quot; Japanese of Brazil are an important ethnic minority in the South American nation.

===American &quot;Sansei&quot;===
Most American &quot;Sansei&quot; were born during the Baby Boom after the end of World War II; older &quot;Sansei&quot;, who were living in the western United States during the war, were forcibly incarcerated with their parents (&quot;Nisei&quot;) and grandparents (&quot;Issei&quot;) after Executive Order 9066 was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from the West Coast and from Southern Arizona. The &quot;Sansei&quot; were forceful activists in the redress movement of the 1980s, which resulted in an official apology to the internees. In some senses, the &quot;Sansei&quot; seem to feel they are caught in a dilemma between their &quot;quiet&quot; Nisei parents and their other identity model of &quot;verbal&quot; and outspoken Americans.

In the United States, an iconic &quot;Sansei&quot; is General Eric Shinseki (born November 28, 1942, 34th Chief of Staff of the United States Army (1999–2003) and former United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He is the first Asian American in U.S. history to be a four-star general, and the first to lead one of the four U.S. military services.

===Canadian &quot;Sansei&quot;===
Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identities, and wartime experiences.

===Peruvian &quot;Sansei&quot;===
Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the &quot;Sansei&quot; Japanese Peruvians comprise the largest number. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who was in office from 28 July 1990 until 22 November 2000, was the &quot;nisei&quot; son of &quot;Issei&quot; emigrants from Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.

==Cultural profile==

===Generations===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (&quot;sei&quot; 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like &quot;Issei&quot;, &quot;Nisei&quot; and &quot;Sansei&quot; which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called &quot;Yonsei&quot; (四世) and the fifth is called &quot;Gosei&quot; (五世). The &quot;Issei&quot;, &quot;Nisei&quot; and &quot;Sansei&quot; generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, religious belief and practice and other matters. The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns. 

The term &quot;Nikkei&quot; (日系) encompasses all of the world&#x27;s Japanese immigrants across generations. The collective memory of the &quot;Issei&quot; and older &quot;Nisei&quot; was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other. In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

In North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred. The &quot;Sansei&quot;, their parents, their grandparents, and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.

There are currently just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London; but unlike other &quot;Nikkei&quot; communities elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as &quot;Issei&quot;, &quot;Nisei&quot; or &quot;Sansei&quot;.

====Sansei====
The third generation of immigrants, born in the United States or Canada to parents born in the United States or Canada, is called &quot;Sansei&quot; (三世). Children born to the &quot;Nisei&quot; were generally born after 1945. They speak English as their first language and are completely acculturized in the contexts of Canadian or American society. They tend to identify with Canadian or American values, norms and expectations. Few speak Japanese and most tend to express their identity as Canadian or American rather than Japanese. Among the &quot;Sansei&quot; there is an overwhelming percentage of marriages to persons of non-Japanese ancestry.

====Aging====
The &quot;kanreki&quot; (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the &quot;Issei&quot; and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of &quot;Nisei&quot; and a few &quot;Sansei&quot;. Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.

==History==
===Internment and redress===
Some responded to internment with lawsuits and political action; and for others, poetry became an unplanned consequence:
=== Life under United States policies before and after World War II ===
==Politics==

The &quot;sansei&quot; became known as the &quot;activist generation&quot; because of their large hand in the redress movement and individuals that have become a part of the American mainstream political landscape.

== Notable individuals ==

The numbers of &quot;sansei&quot; who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the &quot;Nikkei.&quot; Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by &quot;sansei&quot; from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.

<text>In mathematics, the Euler numbers are a sequence &quot;En&quot; of integers defined by the Taylor series expansion

:formula_1,

where formula_2 is the hyperbolic cosine function. The Euler numbers are related to a special value of the Euler polynomials, namely:
:formula_3

The Euler numbers appear in the Taylor series expansions of the secant and hyperbolic secant functions. The latter is the function in the definition. They also occur in combinatorics, specifically when counting the number of alternating permutations of a set with an even number of elements.

== Examples ==
The odd-indexed Euler numbers are all zero. The even-indexed ones have alternating signs. Some values are:
Some authors re-index the sequence in order to omit the odd-numbered Euler numbers with value zero, or change all signs to positive . This article adheres to the convention adopted above.

==Explicit formulas==
===In terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind===
The following two formulas express the Euler numbers in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind:

:formula_4
:formula_5

where formula_6 denotes the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and formula_7 denotes the rising factorial.
===As a double sum===
The following two formulas express the Euler numbers as double sums
:formula_8
:formula_9

===As an iterated sum===
An explicit formula for Euler numbers is:

:formula_10

where denotes the imaginary unit with .

===As a sum over partitions===
The Euler number can be expressed as a sum over the even partitions of ,

:formula_11

as well as a sum over the odd partitions of ,

:formula_12

where in both cases and
:formula_13
is a multinomial coefficient. The Kronecker deltas in the above formulas restrict the sums over the s to and to , respectively.

<text>Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine. Lutrinae is a branch of the Mustelidae family, which includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines, among other animals.

Otters&#x27; habitats include dens known as holts or couches, with their social structure described by terms such as dogs or boars for males, bitches or sows for females, and pups or cubs for offspring. Groups of otters can be referred to as a bevy, family, lodge, romp, or raft when in water, indicating their social and playful characteristics. Otters are known for their distinct feces, termed spraints, which can vary in smell from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish.

Otters exhibit a varied life cycle with a gestation period of about 60–86 days, and offspring typically stay with their family for a year. They can live up to 16 years, with their diet mainly consisting of fish and sometimes frogs, birds, or shellfish, depending on the species. Otters are distinguished by their long, slim bodies, powerful webbed feet for swimming, and their dense fur, which keeps them warm and buoyant in water. They are playful animals, engaging in activities like sliding into water on natural slides and playing with stones.

There are 13 known species of otters, ranging in size and habitat preferences, with some species adapted to cold waters requiring a high metabolic rate for warmth. Otter-human interactions have varied over time, with otters being hunted for their pelts, used in fishing practices in southern Bangladesh, and occasionally attacking humans, though such incidents are rare and often a result of provocation. Otters hold a place in various cultures&#x27; mythology and religion, symbolizing different attributes and stories, from Norse mythology to Native American totems and Asian folklore, where they are sometimes believed to possess shapeshifting abilities.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;otter&quot; derives from the Old English word or . This and cognate words in other Indo-European languages ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European root , which also gave rise to the English word &quot;water&quot;.

== Terminology ==
An otter&#x27;s den is called a holt, or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars; females are called bitches or sows; and their offspring are called pups or cubs. The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature), or, when in water, raft.

The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish; these are known as spraints.

== Life cycle ==
The gestation period in otters is about 60 to 86 days. The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog, and older offspring. Female otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years. The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland. It is lined with moss and grass.

After one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim. The pup lives with its family for approximately one year. Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups. Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds.

== Description ==
Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities for holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from in length and in weight. The Asian small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species and the giant otter and sea otter are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long guard hairs. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat buoyant under water.

Several otter species live in cold waters and have high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. Eurasian otters must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as , an otter needs to catch of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for three to five hours each day and nursing mothers up to eight hours each day.

== Feeding ==
For most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs. Some otters are experts at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of clams, sea urchins and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their bellies. This skill must be learned by the young.

Otters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to prevent their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives.

Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and sliding on them into the water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary in their social structure, some being largely solitary, while others live in groups – in a few species these groups may be fairly large.

== Relation with humans ==
=== Hunting ===
Otters have been hunted for their pelts from at least the 1700s, although it may have begun well before then. Early hunting methods included darts, arrows, nets and snares but later, traps were set on land and guns used.

There has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for the royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them. The tails of otters were often made into items for men to wear. These included hats and belts. Even some types of mittens for children have been made from the fur of otters.

Otters have also been hunted using dogs, especially the otterhound. From 1958 to 1963, the 11 otter hunts in England and Wales killed 1,065 otters between them. In such hunts, the hunters notched their poles after every kill. The prized trophy that hunters would take from the otters was the baculum, which would be worn as a tie-pin.

Traffic (the wildlife trade monitoring network) reported that otters are at serious risk in Southeast Asia and have disappeared from parts of their former range. This decline in populations is due to hunting to supply the demand for skins.

=== Fishing for humans ===

For many generations, fishermen in southern Bangladesh have bred smooth-coated otters and used them to chase fish into their nets. Once a widespread practice, passed down from father to son throughout many communities in Asia, this traditional use of domesticated wild animals is still in practice in the district of Narail, Bangladesh.

=== Attacks on humans ===
A 2011 review by the IUCN/SSC Otter Specialist Group showed that otter attacks reported between 1875 and 2010 occurred most often in Florida, where human and otter populations have substantially increased since 2000, with the majority involving the North American otter. At least 42 instances of attack were found, including one resulting in death and another case of serious injury. Attacking otters had rabies in 36% of anecdotal reports. 80% of otter bite victims do not seek medical treatment.

Animal welfare groups say that, unless threatened, otters rarely attack humans. In November 2021, about 20 otters ambushed a British man in his 60s during an early morning walk in Singapore Botanic Gardens. Despite weighing over 200 pounds, he was trampled and bitten and could not stand up without help from a nearby rescuer. The man speculated that another runner might have stepped on one of the animals earlier, and wished that there could be more lighting installed at that location.

=== Religion and mythology ===
Norse mythology tells of the dwarf Ótr habitually taking the form of an otter. The myth of &quot;Otter&#x27;s Ransom&quot; is the starting point of the Volsunga saga.

In Irish mythology, the character Lí Ban was turned from a woman into a mermaid, half human and half salmon, and given three hundred years of life to roam the oceans. Her lapdog assumed the form of an otter and shared her prolonged lifetime and her extensive wanderings.

In some Native American cultures, otters are considered totem animals.

The otter is held to be a clean animal belonging to Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrian belief, and taboo to kill.

In popular Korean mythology, it is told that people who see an otter (&quot;soodal&quot;) will attract &#x27;rain clouds&#x27; for the rest of their lives.

In the Buddhist Jataka tales, The Otters and The Wolf, two otters agreed to let a wolf settle their dispute in dividing their caught fish but it was taken away by the cunning wolf.

==== Japanese folklore ====

In Japanese, otters are called &quot;kawauso&quot; (). In Japanese folklore, they fool humans in the same way as foxes (kitsune) and tanuki.

In the Noto region, Ishikawa Prefecture, there are stories where they shapeshift into beautiful women or children wearing checker-patterned clothing. If a human attempts to speak to one, they will answer &quot;oraya&quot; and then answer &quot;araya,&quot; and if anybody asks them anything, they say cryptic things like &quot;kawai.&quot; There are darker stories, such as one from Kaga Province (now Ishikawa Prefecture) in which an otter that lives in the castle&#x27;s moat shapeshifts into a woman, invites males, and then kills and eats them.

In the kaidan, essays, and legends of the Edo period like the &quot;Urami Kanawa&quot; (), &quot;Taihei Hyaku Monogatari&quot; (), and the &quot;Shifu Goroku&quot; (), there are tales about strange occurrences like otters that shapeshift into beautiful women and kill men.

In the town of Numatachi, Asa District, Hiroshima Prefecture (now Hiroshima), they are called &quot;tomo no kawauso&quot; () and &quot;ato no kawauso&quot; (). It is said that they shapeshift into bōzu (a kind of monk) and appear before passers-by, and if the passer-by tries to get close and look up, its height steadily increases until it becomes a large bōzu.

In the Tsugaru region, Aomori Prefecture, they are said to possess humans. It is said that those possessed by otters lose their stamina as if their soul has been extracted. They are also said to shapeshift into severed heads and get caught in fishing nets.

In the Kashima District and the Hakui District in Ishikawa Prefecture, they are seen as a yōkai under the name &quot;kabuso&quot; or &quot;kawaso&quot;. They perform pranks like extinguishing the fire of the paper lanterns of people who walk on roads at night, shapeshifting into a beautiful woman of 18 or 19 years of age and fooling people, or tricking people and making them try to engage in sumo against a rock or a tree stump. It is said that they speak human words, and sometimes people are called and stopped while walking on roads.

In the Ishikawa and Kochi Prefectures, they are said to be a type of kappa, and there are stories told about how they engage in sumo with otters. In places like the Hokuriku region, Kii, and Shikoku, the otters are seen as a type of kappa. In the Kagakushū, a dictionary from the Muromachi period, an otter that grew old becomes a kappa.

In an Ainu folktale, in Urashibetsu (in Abashiri, Hokkaido), there are stories where monster otters shapeshift into humans, go into homes where there are beautiful girls, and try to kill the girl and make her its wife.

In China, like in Japan, there are stories where otters shapeshift into beautiful women in old books like &quot;In Search of the Supernatural&quot; and the &quot;Zhenyizhi&quot; ().

<text>The Egyptian language, or Ancient Egyptian (; ), is an extinct branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages that was spoken in ancient Egypt. It is known today from a large corpus of surviving texts, which were made accessible to the modern world following the decipherment of the ancient Egyptian scripts in the early 19th century.

Egyptian is one of the earliest known written languages, first recorded in the hieroglyphic script in the late 4th millennium BC. It is also the longest-attested human language, with a written record spanning over 4,000 years. Its classical form, known as &quot;Middle Egyptian,&quot; served as the vernacular of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and remained the literary language of Egypt until the Roman period.

By the time of classical antiquity, the spoken language had evolved into Demotic, and by the Roman era, diversified into various Coptic dialects. These were eventually supplanted by Arabic after the Muslim conquest of Egypt, although Bohairic Coptic remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Church.

==Classification==
The Egyptian language branch belongs to the Afroasiatic language family. Among the typological features of Egyptian that are typically Afroasiatic are its fusional morphology, nonconcatenative morphology, a series of emphatic consonants, a three-vowel system , a nominal feminine suffix *&quot;-at&quot;, a nominal prefix &quot;m-&quot;, an adjectival suffix &quot;-ī&quot; and characteristic personal verbal affixes. Of the other Afroasiatic branches, linguists have variously suggested that the Egyptian language shares its greatest affinities with Berber and Semitic languages, particularly Arabic (which is spoken in Egypt today) and Hebrew. However, other scholars have argued that the Egyptian language shared closer linguistic ties with northeastern African regions.

There are two theories that seek to establish the cognate sets between Egyptian and Afroasiatic, the traditional theory and the &quot;neuere Komparatistik&quot;, founded by Semiticist Otto Rössler.
According to the , in Egyptian, the Proto-Afroasiatic voiced consonants developed into pharyngeal : Egyptian &#x27;portal&#x27;, Semitic &#x27;door&#x27;. The traditional theory instead disputes the values given to those consonants by the , instead connecting with Semitic and . Both schools agree that Afroasiatic merged with Egyptian , , , and in the dialect on which the written language was based, but it was preserved in other Egyptian varieties. They also agree that original palatalise to in some environments and are preserved as in others.

The Egyptian language has many biradical and perhaps monoradical roots, in contrast to the Semitic preference for triradical roots. Egyptian is probably more conservative, and Semitic likely underwent later regularizations converting roots into the triradical pattern.

Although Egyptian is the oldest Afroasiatic language documented in written form, its morphological repertoire is very different from that of the rest of the Afroasiatic languages in general, and Semitic languages in particular. There are multiple possibilities: perhaps Egyptian had already undergone radical changes from Proto-Afroasiatic before it was recorded; or the Afroasiatic family has so far been studied with an excessively Semitocentric approach; or, as G. W. Tsereteli suggests, Afroasiatic is a sprachbund, rather than a true genetic language family.

==History==
The Egyptian language can be grouped thus:
* Egyptian
** Earlier Egyptian, Older Egyptian, or Classical Egyptian
*** Old Egyptian
**** Early Egyptian, Early Old Egyptian, Archaic Old Egyptian, Pre-Old Egyptian, or archaic Egyptian
**** standard Old Egyptian
*** Middle Egyptian
** Later Egyptian
*** Late Egyptian
*** Demotic Egyptian
*** Coptic
The Egyptian language is conventionally grouped into six major chronological divisions:
*Archaic Egyptian (before ), the reconstructed language of the Early Dynastic Period,
*Old Egyptian (), the language of the Old Kingdom,
*Middle Egyptian (), the language of the Middle Kingdom to early New Kingdom and continuing on as a literary language into the 4th century AD,
*Late Egyptian (), Amarna period to Third Intermediate Period,
*Demotic Egyptian (), the vernacular of the Late Period, Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt,
*Coptic (after ), the vernacular at the time of Christianisation, and the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity.

Old, Middle, and Late Egyptian were all written using both the hieroglyphic and hieratic scripts. 
Demotic is the name of the script derived from the hieratic beginning in the 7th century BC.

The Coptic alphabet was derived from the Greek alphabet, with adaptations for Egyptian phonology. It was first developed in the Ptolemaic period, and gradually replaced the Demotic script in about the 4th to 5th centuries of the Christian era.

===Old Egyptian===
The term &quot;Archaic Egyptian&quot; is sometimes reserved for the earliest use of hieroglyphs, from the late fourth through the early third millennia BC. At the earliest stage, around 3300 BC, hieroglyphs were not a fully developed writing system, being at a transitional stage of proto-writing; over the time leading up to the 27th century BC, grammatical features such as nisba formation can be seen to occur.

Old Egyptian is dated from the oldest known complete sentence, including a finite verb, which has been found. Discovered in the tomb of Seth-Peribsen (dated ), the seal impression reads:
:

Extensive texts appear from about 2600 BC. An early example is the Diary of Merer. The Pyramid Texts are the largest body of literature written in this phase of the language. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the tripling of ideograms, phonograms, and determinatives to indicate the plural. Overall, it does not differ significantly from Middle Egyptian, the classical stage of the language, though it is based on a different dialect.

In the period of the 3rd dynasty (), many of the principles of hieroglyphic writing were regularized. From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the third and fourth centuries), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2,000 years.

===Middle Egyptian===
Middle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC, during the Middle Kingdom and the subsequent Second Intermediate Period. As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from Egyptology. While most Middle Egyptian is seen written on monuments by hieroglyphs, it was also written using a cursive variant, and the related hieratic.

Middle Egyptian first became available to modern scholarship with the decipherment of hieroglyphs in the early 19th century. The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by Adolf Erman in 1894, surpassed in 1927 by Alan Gardiner&#x27;s work. Middle Egyptian has been well-understood since then, although certain points of the verbal inflection remained open to revision until the mid-20th century, notably due to the contributions of Hans Jakob Polotsky.

The Middle Egyptian stage is taken to have ended around the 14th century BC, giving rise to Late Egyptian. This transition was taking place in the later period of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt (known as the Amarna Period).

====Egyptien de tradition====

Original Old Egyptian and Middle Egyptian texts were still used after the 14th century BCE. And an emulation of predominately Middle Egyptian, but also with characteristics of Old Egyptian, Late Egyptian and Demotic, called &quot;&quot; or &quot;Neo-Middle Egyptian&quot; by scholars, was used as a literary language for new texts since the later New Kingdom in official and religious hieroglyphic and hieratic texts in preference to Late Egyptian or Demotic. &quot;Égyptien de tradition&quot; as a religious language survived until the Christianisation of Roman Egypt in the 4th century.

===Late Egyptian===
Late Egyptian was spoken for about 650 years, beginning around 1350 BC, during the New Kingdom of Egypt. Late Egyptian succeeded but did not fully supplant Middle Egyptian as a literary language, and was also the language of the New Kingdom administration.

Texts written wholly in Late Egyptian date to the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt and later. Late Egyptian is represented by a large body of religious and secular literature, comprising such examples as the &quot;Story of Wenamun&quot;, the love poems of the Chester–Beatty I papyrus, and the &quot;Instruction of Any&quot;. Instructions became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior. Late Egyptian was also the language of New Kingdom administration.

Late Egyptian is not completely distinct from Middle Egyptian, as many &quot;classicisms&quot; appear in historical and literary documents of this phase. However, the difference between Middle and Late Egyptian is greater than the difference between Middle and Old Egyptian. Originally a synthetic language, Egyptian by the Late Egyptian phase had become an analytic language. The relationship between Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian has been described as being similar to that between Latin and Italian. 
* Written Late Egyptian was seemingly a better representative than Middle Egyptian of the spoken language in the New Kingdom and beyond: weak consonants &quot;ꜣ, w, j&quot;, as well as the feminine ending were increasingly dropped, apparently because they stopped being pronounced.
* The demonstrative pronouns (masc.), (fem.), and (pl.) were used as definite articles. 
* The old form (he heard) of the verb was replaced by which had both prospective (he shall hear) and perfective (he heard) aspects. The past tense was also formed using the auxiliary verb (make), as in (he has accused him).
* Adjectives as attributes of nouns are often replaced by nouns.

The Late Egyptian stage is taken to have ended around the 8th century BC, giving rise to Demotic.

===Demotic===
Demotic is a later development of the Egyptian language written in the Demotic script, following Late Egyptian and preceding Coptic, the latter of which it shares much with. In the earlier stages of Demotic, such as those texts written in the early Demotic script, it probably represented the spoken idiom of the time. However, as its use became increasingly confined to literary and religious purposes, the written language diverged more and more from the spoken form, leading to significant diglossia between the late Demotic texts and the spoken language of the time, similar to the use of classical Middle Egyptian during the Ptolemaic Period.

===Coptic===

Coptic is the name given to the late Egyptian vernacular when it was written in a Greek-based alphabet, the Coptic alphabet; it flourished from the time of Early Christianity (c. 31/33–324), but Egyptian phrases written in the Greek alphabet first appeared during the Hellenistic period , with the first known Coptic text, still pagan (Old Coptic), from the 1st century AD.

Coptic survived into the medieval period, but by the 16th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the Mamluks. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that. Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church.

==Dialects==
Some evidence of dialectal variation is Egyptian is found as early as the 3rd millennium BC, but because the heiroglyphic scripts inherent conservatism and that most hieroglyphic Egyptian texts are written in a literary prestige register rather than the vernacular speech variety of their author. As a result, dialectical differences are not apparent in written Egyptian until the adoption of the Coptic alphabet. Nevertheless, it is clear that these differences existed before the Coptic period. In one Late Egyptian letter (dated ), a scribe jokes that his colleague&#x27;s writing is incoherent like &quot;the speech of a Delta man with a man of Elephantine.&quot;

Recently, some evidence of internal dialects has been found in pairs of similar words in Egyptian that, based on similarities with later dialects of Coptic, may be derived from northern and southern dialects of Egyptian. Written Coptic has five major dialects, which differ mainly in graphic conventions, most notably the southern Saidic dialect, the main classical dialect, and the northern Bohairic dialect, currently used in Coptic Church services.

==Phonology==

While the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact phonetics is unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2,000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates Old Latin from Modern Italian, significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.

Phonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of tenuis and emphatic consonants, as in many Semitic languages, or one of aspirated and ejective consonants, as in many Cushitic languages.

Since vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems.

The actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.

===Old Egyptian===
====Consonants====
The following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686–2181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:


 has no independent representation in the hieroglyphic orthography, and it is frequently written as if it were or . That is probably because the standard for written Egyptian is based on a dialect in which had merged with other sonorants. Also, the rare cases of occurring are not represented. The phoneme is written as in the initial position ( = &#x27;father&#x27;) and immediately after a stressed vowel ( = &#x27;bad&#x27;) and as word-medially immediately before a stressed vowel ( = &#x27;you will appear&#x27;) and are unmarked word-finally ( = &#x27;father&#x27;).

===Middle Egyptian===
In Middle Egyptian (2055–1650 BC), a number of consonantal shifts take place. By the beginning of the Middle Kingdom period, and had merged, and the graphemes and are used interchangeably. In addition, had become word-initially in an unstressed syllable ( &gt; &quot;colour&quot;) and after a stressed vowel ( &gt; &#x27;[the god] Apis&#x27;).

===Late Egyptian===
In Late Egyptian (1069–700 BC), the phonemes &quot;d ḏ g&quot; gradually merge with their counterparts &quot;t ṯ k&quot; ( &gt; Akkadian transcription &#x27;dbn-weight&#x27;). Also, &quot;ṯ ḏ&quot; often become , but they are retained in many lexemes; &quot;ꜣ&quot; becomes ; and become at the end of a stressed syllable and eventually null word-finally: &gt; Akkadian transcription &#x27;bow&#x27;.

===Demotic===
====Phonology====
The most important source of information about Demotic phonology is Coptic. The consonant inventory of Demotic can be reconstructed on the basis of evidence from the Coptic dialects. Demotic orthography is relatively opaque. The Demotic &quot;alphabetical&quot; signs are mostly inherited from the hieroglyphic script, and due to historical sound changes they do not always map neatly onto Demotic phonemes. However, the Demotic script does feature certain orthographic innovations, such as the use of the sign for //, which allow it to represent sounds that were not present in earlier forms of Egyptian.

The Demotic consonants can be divided into two primary classes: obstruents (stops, affricates and fricatives) and sonorants (approximants, nasals, and semivowels). Voice is not a contrastive feature; all obstruents are voiceless and all sonorants are voiced. Stops may be either aspirated or tenuis (unaspirated), although there is evidence that aspirates merged with their tenuis counterparts in certain environments.

The following table presents the consonants of Demotic Egyptian. The reconstructed value of a phoneme is given in IPA transcription, followed by a transliteration of the corresponding Demotic &quot;alphabetical&quot; sign(s) in angle brackets .



===Coptic===
More changes occur in the 1st millennium BC and the first centuries AD, leading to Coptic (1st or 3rd – c. 19th centuries AD). In Sahidic &quot;ẖ ḫ ḥ&quot; had merged into &quot;š&quot; (most often from &quot;ḫ&quot;) and (most often &quot;ẖ ḥ&quot;). Bohairic and Akhmimic are more conservative and have a velar fricative ( in Bohairic, in Akhmimic). Pharyngeal &quot;*ꜥ&quot; had merged into glottal after it had affected the quality of the surrounding vowels. is not indicated orthographically unless it follows a stressed vowel; then, it is marked by doubling the vowel letter (except in Bohairic): Akhmimic , Sahidic and Lycopolitan &quot;šoʔp&quot;, Bohairic &quot;šoʔp&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27; &lt; &quot;ḫpr.w&quot; * &#x27;has become&#x27;. The phoneme was probably pronounced as a fricative , becoming after a stressed vowel in syllables that had been closed in earlier Egyptian (compare &lt; &#x27;gold&#x27; and &lt; * &#x27;horn&#x27;). The phonemes occur only in Greek loanwords, with rare exceptions triggered by a nearby : &lt; &quot;ꜥ.t n.t sbꜣ.w&quot; &#x27;school&#x27;.
Earlier &quot;*d ḏ g q&quot; are preserved as ejective &quot;t&#x27; c&#x27; k&#x27; k″&quot; before vowels in Coptic. Although the same graphemes are used for the pulmonic stops (), the existence of the former may be inferred because the stops are allophonically aspirated before stressed vowels and sonorant consonants. In Bohairic, the allophones are written with the special graphemes , but other dialects did not mark aspiration: Sahidic , Bohairic &#x27;the sun&#x27;.

Thus, Bohairic does not mark aspiration for reflexes of older &quot;*d ḏ g q&quot;: Sahidic and Bohairic &#x27;horn&#x27;. Also, the definite article is unaspirated when the next word begins with a glottal stop: Bohairic &#x27;the account&#x27;.

The consonant system of Coptic is as follows:

===Vowels===
Here is the vowel system reconstructed for earlier Egyptian:

Vowels are always short in unstressed syllables ( = &#x27;first&#x27;) and long in open stressed syllables ( = &#x27;man&#x27;), but they can be either short or long in closed stressed syllables ( = &#x27;we&#x27;, = &#x27;to stay&#x27;).

In the Late New Kingdom, after Ramses II, around 1200 BC, changes to (like the Canaanite shift), &#x27;(the god) Horus&#x27; &gt; (Akkadian transcription: ). , therefore, changes to : &#x27;tree&#x27; &gt; (Akkadian transcription: ).

In the Early New Kingdom, short stressed changes to : &quot;Menes&quot; &gt; (Akkadian transcription: ). Later, probably 1000–800 BC, a short stressed changes to : &quot;Tanis&quot; was borrowed into Hebrew as *ṣuʕn but would become transcribed as during the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Unstressed vowels, especially after a stress, become : &#x27;good&#x27; &gt; (Akkadian transcription ). changes to next to and : &#x27;soldier&#x27; &gt; (earlier Akkadian transcription: , later: ).

In Sahidic and Bohairic Coptic, Late Egyptian stressed becomes and becomes , but are unchanged in the other dialects:
* &#x27;brother&#x27;
*: Sahidic and Bohairic 
*: Akhmimic, Lycopolitan and Fayyumic 
* &#x27;name&#x27; &gt; 
*: Sahidic and Bohairic 
*: Akhmimic, Lycopolitan and Fayyumic 

However, in the presence of guttural fricatives, Sahidic and Bohairic preserve , and Fayyumic renders it as :
* &#x27;ten thousand&#x27; 
*: Sahidic, Akhmimic and Lycopolitan 
*: Bohairic 
*: Fayyumic 

In Akhmimic and Lycopolitan, becomes before etymological :
* &#x27;river&#x27; &gt; 
*: Sahidic 
*: Bohairic 
*: Akhmimic 
*: Fayyumic 

Similarly, the diphthongs , , which normally have reflexes , in Sahidic and are preserved in other dialects, are in Bohairic (in non-final position) and respectively:
* &quot;to me, to them&quot;
*: Sahidic 
*: Akhmimic and Lycopolitan 
*: Fayyumic 
*: Bohairic 

Sahidic and Bohairic preserve before (etymological or from lenited or tonic-syllable coda ),: Sahidic and Bohairic &#x27;to you (fem.)&#x27; &lt; &lt; . may also have different reflexes before sonorants, near sibilants and in diphthongs.

Old surfaces as after nasals and occasionally other consonants: &#x27;god&#x27; &gt; has acquired phonemic status, as is evidenced by minimal pairs like &#x27;to approach&#x27; &lt; ẖnn vs. &#x27;inside&#x27; &lt; ẖnw. An etymological &gt; often surfaces as next to and after etymological pharyngeals: &lt; &#x27;street&#x27; (Semitic loan).

Most Coptic dialects have two phonemic vowels in unstressed position. Unstressed vowels generally became , written as or null ( in Bohairic and Fayyumic word-finally), but pretonic unstressed /a/ occurs as a reflex of earlier unstressed near an etymological pharyngeal, velar or sonorant (&#x27;to become many&#x27; &lt; ꜥšꜣ ) or an unstressed . Pretonic [i] is underlyingly : Sahidic &#x27;ibis&#x27; &lt; h(j)bj.w .

Thus, the following is the Sahidic vowel system c. AD 400:

===Phonotactics===
Earlier Egyptian has the syllable structure CV(ː)(C) in which V is long in open stressed syllables and short elsewhere. In addition, CVːC or CVCC can occur in word-final, stressed position. However, CVːC occurs only in the infinitive of biconsonantal verbal roots, CVCC only in some plurals.

In later Egyptian, stressed CVːC, CVCC, and CV become much more common because of the loss of final dentals and glides.

===Stress===
Earlier Egyptian stresses one of the last two syllables. According to some scholars, that is a development from a stage in Proto-Egyptian in which the third-last syllable could be stressed, which was lost as open posttonic syllables lost their vowels: &gt; &#x27;transformation&#x27;.

===Egyptological pronunciation===
As a convention, Egyptologists make use of an &quot;Egyptological pronunciation&quot; in English: the consonants are given fixed values, and vowels are inserted according to essentially arbitrary rules. Two of these consonants known as alef and ayin are generally pronounced as the vowel . Yodh is pronounced , &quot;w&quot; . Between other consonants, is then inserted. Thus, for example, the Egyptian name Ramesses is most accurately transliterated as (&quot;Ra is the one who bore him&quot;) and pronounced as .

In transcription, , , and all represent consonants. For example, the name Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC) was written in Egyptian as (&quot;living image of Amun&quot;). Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. So although is pronounced in modern Egyptological pronunciation, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *, transliterable as .

== Writing systems ==
Most surviving texts in the Egyptian language are written on stone in hieroglyphs. The native name for Egyptian hieroglyphic writing is (&quot;writing of the gods&#x27; words&quot;).
In antiquity, most texts were written on the quite perishable medium of papyrus though a few have survived that were written in hieratic and (later) demotic. There was also a form of cursive hieroglyphs, used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; of the Twentieth Dynasty; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of ligatures. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as &quot;lapidary hieratic&quot;.
In the language&#x27;s final stage of development, the Coptic alphabet replaced the older writing system.

Hieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as ideograms to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as phonograms to represent their phonetic value.

As the phonetic realization of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of transliteration to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.

Egyptian scholar Gamal Mokhtar noted that the inventory of hieroglyphic symbols derived from &quot;fauna and flora used in the signs [which] are essentially African&quot;, reflecting the local wildlife of North Africa, the Levant and southern Mediterranean. In &quot;regards to writing, we have seen that a purely Nilotic, hence [North] African origin not only is not excluded, but probably reflects the reality&quot; that the geographical location of Egypt is, of course, in Africa.

==Morphology==
Egyptian is fairly typical for an Afroasiatic language in that most of its vocabulary is built around a root of three consonants, though there are sometimes only two consonants in the root: (, &quot;sun&quot;—the is thought to have been something like a voiced pharyngeal fricative). Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: (&quot;be upside-down&quot;).

Vowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic (&quot;to choose&quot;), for example, can represent the stative (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the imperfective forms or even a verbal noun (&quot;a choosing&quot;).

===Nouns===
Egyptian nouns can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ) and singular or plural ( / ), or dual ( / ).

Articles, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.

===Pronouns===
Egyptian has three different types of personal pronouns: suffix, enclitic (called &quot;dependent&quot; by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the infinitive to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists as a &quot;fourth&quot; set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:

Demonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:

Finally, interrogative pronouns bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and Berber counterparts:

===Verbs===
Egyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.

Finite verbs convey person, tense/aspect, mood and voice. Each is indicated by a set of affixal morphemes attached to the verb: For example, the basic conjugation is (&quot;to hear&quot;) is (&quot;he hears&quot;).

Non-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the participles and the negative infinitive, which &quot;Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs&quot; calls &quot;negatival complement&quot;. There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: past and temporally-unmarked imperfective and aorist forms. The latter are determined from their syntactic context.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify:



Attributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: (&quot;[the] great god&quot;).

However, when they are used independently as a predicate in an adjectival phrase, as (&quot;[the] god [is] great&quot;, &quot;great [is the] god&quot;), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.

===Prepositions===
Egyptian makes use of prepositions.

===Adverbs===
Adverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: For example:

Here are some common Egyptian adverbs:

==Syntax==
Old Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have verb-subject-object as the basic word order. For example, the equivalent of &quot;he opens the door&quot; would be (&quot;opens he [the] door&quot;). The so-called construct state combines two or more nouns to express the genitive, as in Semitic and Berber languages. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.

The early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use , and .

As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.

==Legacy==
The Egyptian language survived through the Middle Ages and into the early modern period in the form of the Coptic language. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular and as a liturgical language for the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Churches. Coptic also had an enduring effect on Egyptian Arabic, which replaced Coptic as the main daily language in Egypt; the Coptic substratum in Egyptian Arabic appears in certain aspects of syntax and to a lesser degree in vocabulary and phonology.

In antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on Classical Greek, so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include:
* (Egyptian , via Greek and then Latin)
* (Egyptian , via Latin)
* (Egyptian , via Greek)
* (Egyptian , Coptic , via Greek)
* (Egyptian , via Greek)
* (Egyptian , via Greek)
* (Egyptian , via Greek))
* possibly 
* (Egyptian , &quot;great house&quot;, via Hebrew and Greek)

The Hebrew Bible also contains some words, terms, and names that are thought by scholars to be Egyptian in origin. An example of this is Zaphnath-Paaneah, the Egyptian name given to Joseph.

The etymological root of &quot;Egypt&quot; is the same as &quot;Copts&quot;, ultimately from the Late Egyptian name of Memphis, &quot;Hikuptah&quot;, a continuation of Middle Egyptian ( &quot;temple of the ka (soul) of Ptah&quot;).

<text>Caesarean section, also known as C-section, cesarean, or caesarean delivery, is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother&#x27;s abdomen. It is often performed because vaginal delivery would put the mother or child at risk (of paralysis or even death). Reasons for the operation include, but are not limited to, obstructed labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, shoulder presentation, and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother&#x27;s pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary.
A C-section typically takes 45 minutes to an hour. It may be done with a spinal block, where the woman is awake, or under general anesthesia. A urinary catheter is used to drain the bladder, and the skin of the abdomen is then cleaned with an antiseptic. An incision of about 15 cm (6 inches) is then typically made through the mother&#x27;s lower abdomen. The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered. The incisions are then stitched closed. A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake. Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home.
C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low-risk pregnancies. They also typically take about six weeks to heal from, longer than vaginal birth. The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother. Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason. The method of delivery does not appear to have an effect on subsequent sexual function.
In 2012, about 23 million C-sections were done globally. The international healthcare community has previously considered the rate of 10% and 15% to be ideal for caesarean sections. Some evidence finds a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes. More than 45 countries globally have C-section rates less than 7.5%, while more than 50 have rates greater than 27%. Efforts are being made to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section. In the United States as of 2017, about 32% of deliveries are by C-section. The surgery has been performed at least as far back as 715 BC following the death of the mother, with the baby occasionally surviving. A popular idea is that the Roman statesman Julius Caesar was born via caesarean section and is the namesake of the procedure, but if this is the true etymology, it is based on a misconception: until the modern era, C-sections seem to have been invariably fatal to the mother, and Caesar&#x27;s mother Aurelia not only survived her son&#x27;s birth but lived for nearly 50 years afterward. There are many ancient and medieval legends, oral histories, and historical records of laws about C-sections around the world, especially in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The first recorded successful C-section (where both the mother and the infant survived) was performed on a woman in Switzerland in 1500 by her husband, Jakob Nufer, though this was not recorded until 8 decades later. With the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 19th century, survival of both the mother and baby, and thus the procedure, became significantly more common.
==Uses==

Caesarean section (C-section) is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. C-sections are also carried out for personal and social reasons on maternal request in some countries.

===Medical uses===
Complications of labor and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery include:
* Abnormal presentation (breech or transverse positions)
* Prolonged labor or a failure to progress (obstructed labour, also known as dystocia)
* Fetal distress
* Cord prolapse
* Uterine rupture or an elevated risk thereof
* Uncontrolled hypertension, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia in the mother
* Tachycardia in the mother or baby after amniotic rupture (the waters breaking)
* Placenta problems (placenta praevia, placental abruption or placenta accreta)
* Failed labor induction
* Failed instrumental delivery (by forceps or ventouse (Sometimes, a trial of forceps/ventouse delivery is attempted, and if unsuccessful, the baby will need to be delivered by caesarean section.)
* Large baby weighing &gt; 4,000 grams (macrosomia)
* Umbilical cord abnormalities (vasa previa, multilobate including bilobate and succenturiate-lobed placentas, velamentous insertion)

Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant disease, include:
* Previous (high risk) fetus
* HIV infection of the mother with a high viral load (HIV with a low maternal viral load is not necessarily an indication for caesarean section)
* An outbreak of genital herpes in the third trimester (which can cause infection in the baby if born vaginally)
* Previous classical (longitudinal) caesarean section
* Previous uterine rupture
* Prior problems with the healing of the perineum (from previous childbirth or Crohn&#x27;s disease)
* Bicornuate uterus
* Rare cases of posthumous birth after the death of the mother

Other
* Decreasing experience of accoucheurs with the management of breech presentation. Although obstetricians and midwives are extensively trained in proper procedures for breech presentation deliveries using simulation mannequins, there is decreasing experience with actual vaginal breech delivery, which may increase the risk.

===Prevention===
The prevalence of caesarean section is generally agreed to be higher than needed in many countries, and physicians are encouraged to actively lower the rate, as a caesarean rate higher than 10–15% is not associated with reductions in maternal or infant mortality rates, although some evidence support that a higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes.

Some of these efforts are: emphasizing a long latent phase of labor is not abnormal and not a justification for C-section; a new definition of the start of active labor from a cervical dilatation of 4 cm to a dilatation of 6 cm; and allowing women who have previously given birth to push for at least 2 hours, with 3 hours of pushing for women who have not previously given birth, before labor arrest is considered. Physical exercise during pregnancy decreases the risk. Additionally, results from a 2021 systematic review of the evidence on outpatient cervical ripening found that in women with low-risk pregnancies, the risk of cesarean delivery with harms to the mother or child were not significantly different from when done in an inpatient setting.

==Risks==
Adverse outcomes in low-risk pregnancies occur in 8.6% of vaginal deliveries and 9.2% of caesarean section deliveries.

===Mother===
In those who are low risk, the risk of death for caesarean sections is 13 per 100,000 vs. for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The United Kingdom National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth.

In Canada, the difference in serious morbidity or mortality for the mother (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was 1.8 additional cases per 100. The difference in in-hospital maternal death was not significant.
A caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative adhesions, incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction), and wound infections. If a caesarean is performed in an emergency, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient&#x27;s stomach may not be empty, increasing the risk of anaesthesia. Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and post-dural-puncture spinal- headaches.

Wound infections occur after caesarean sections at a rate of 3–15%. The presence of chorioamnionitis and obesity predisposes the woman to develop a surgical site infection.

Women who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless medical indications to do so exist. The risk of placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening condition which is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0.13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more. Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.

Mothers can experience an increased incidence of postnatal depression, and can experience significant psychological trauma and ongoing birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder after obstetric intervention during the birthing process. Factors like pain in the first stage of labor, feelings of powerlessness, intrusive emergency obstetric intervention are important in the subsequent development of psychological issues related to labor and delivery.

====Subsequent pregnancies====

Women who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally.

Women who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth. Delivery after previous caesarean section is by either of two main options:
* Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)
* Elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS)

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.

====Adhesions====
There are several steps that can be taken during abdominal or pelvic surgery to minimize postoperative complications, such as the formation of adhesions. Such techniques and principles may include:
* Handling all tissue with absolute care
* Using powder-free surgical gloves
* Controlling bleeding
* Choosing sutures and implants carefully
* Keeping tissue moist
* Preventing infection with antibiotics given intravenously to the mother before skin incision

Despite these proactive measures, adhesion formation is a recognized complication of any abdominal or pelvic surgery. To prevent adhesions from forming after caesarean section, adhesion barrier can be placed during surgery to minimize the risk of adhesions between the uterus and ovaries, the small bowel, and almost any tissue in the abdomen or pelvis. This is not current UK practice, as there is no compelling evidence to support the benefit of this intervention.

Adhesions can cause long-term problems, such as:
* Infertility, which may end when adhesions distort the tissues of the ovaries and tubes, impeding the normal passage of the egg (ovum) from the ovary to the uterus. One in five infertility cases may be adhesion related (stoval)
* Chronic pelvic pain, which may result when adhesions are present in the pelvis. Almost 50% of chronic pelvic pain cases are estimated to be adhesion related (stoval)
* Small bowel obstruction: the disruption of normal bowel flow, which can result when adhesions twist or pull the small bowel.

The risk of adhesion formation is one reason why vaginal delivery is usually considered safer than elective caesarean section where there is no medical indication for section for either maternal or fetal reasons.

===Child===
Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation &quot;carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother.&quot; Newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be up to 3 times the number at 40 weeks, and is elevated compared to 38 weeks gestation. These early term births were associated with more death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks (full term). Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but no adverse effects in the health of the mothers or babies.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and medical policy makers review research studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization &gt; 4–5 days. In the case of caesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labor at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8.2 times higher for pre-labor caesarean at 38 weeks. In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated (elective) delivery before 39 weeks.

For otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery, in this case, does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth. When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37-week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36–37 weeks).
The consensus concerning monoamniotic twins (identical twins sharing an amniotic sac), the highest risk type of twins, is that they should be delivered by caesarean section at or shortly after 32 weeks, since the risks of intrauterine death of one or both twins is higher after this gestation than the risk of complications of prematurity.

In a research study widely publicized, singleton children born earlier than 39 weeks may have developmental problems, including slower learning in reading and math.

Other risks include:
* Wet lung (Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn): Failure to pass through the birth canal does not expose the baby to cortisol and epinephrine which typically would reverse the potassium/sodium pumps in the baby&#x27;s lung. This causes fluid to remain in the lung.
* Potential for early delivery and complications: Preterm delivery may be inadvertently carried out if the due-date calculation is inaccurate. One study found an increased complication risk if a repeat elective caesarean section is performed even a few days before the recommended 39 weeks.
* Higher infant mortality risk: In caesarean sections performed with no indicated medical risk (singleton at full term in a head-down position with no other obstetric or medical complications), the risk of death in the first 28 days of life has been cited as 1.77 per 1,000 live births among women who had caesarean sections, compared to 0.62 per 1,000 for women who delivered vaginally.

Birth by caesarean section also seems to be associated with worse health outcomes later in life, including overweight or obesity, problems in the immune system, and poor digestive system. However, caesarean deliveries are found to not affect a newborn&#x27;s risk of developing food allergy. This finding contradicts a previous study that claims babies born via caesarean section have lower levels of &quot;Bacteroides&quot; that is linked to peanut allergy in infants.

==Classification==
Caesarean sections have been classified in various ways by different perspectives. One way to discuss all classification systems is to group them by their focus either on the urgency of the procedure (most common), characteristics of the mother, or as a group based on other, less commonly discussed factors.

===By urgency===
Conventionally, caesarean sections are classified as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation. Classification is used to help communication between the obstetric, midwifery and anaesthetic team for discussion of the most appropriate method of anaesthesia. The decision whether to perform general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthetic) is important and is based on many indications, including how urgent the delivery needs to be as well as the medical and obstetric history of the woman. Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.

A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical indications which have developed before or during the pregnancy, and ideally after 39 weeks of gestation. In the UK, this is classified as a &#x27;grade 4&#x27; section (delivery timed to suit the mother or hospital staff) or as a &#x27;grade 3&#x27; section (no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery needed).
Emergency caesarean sections are performed in pregnancies in which a vaginal delivery was planned initially, but an indication for caesarean delivery has since developed. In the UK they are further classified as grade 2 (delivery required within 90 minutes of the decision but no immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus) or grade 1 (delivery required within 30 minutes of the decision: immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby or both.)

Elective caesarean sections may be performed on the basis of an obstetrical or medical indication, or because of a medically non-indicated maternal request. Among women in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, about 7% preferred caesarean section as a method of delivery. In cases without medical indications the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend a planned vaginal delivery. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that if after a woman has been provided information on the risk of a planned caesarean section and she still insists on the procedure it should be provided. If provided this should be done at 39 weeks of gestation or later. There is no evidence that ECS can reduce mother-to-child hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus transmission.

===By characteristics of the mother===

====Caesarean delivery on maternal request====

Caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR) is a medically unnecessary caesarean section, where the conduct of a childbirth via a caesarean section is requested by the pregnant patient even though there is not a medical indication to have the surgery. Systematic reviews have found no strong evidence about the impact of caesareans for nonmedical reasons. Recommendations encourage counseling to identify the reasons for the request, addressing anxieties and information, and encouraging vaginal birth. Elective caesareans at 38 weeks in some studies showed increased health complications in the newborn. For this reason ACOG and NICE recommend that elective caesarean sections should not be scheduled before 39 weeks gestation unless there is a medical reason. Planned caesarean sections may be scheduled earlier if there is a medical reason.

====After previous caesarean====

Mothers who have previously had a caesarean section are more likely to have a caesarean section for future pregnancies than mothers who have never had a caesarean section. There is discussion about the circumstances under which women should have a vaginal birth after a previous caesarean.

Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is the practice of birthing a baby vaginally after a previous baby has been delivered by caesarean section (surgically). According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), successful VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies. According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for VBAC. Approximately 60–80% of women opting for VBAC will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.

====Twins====
For otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not. When the first twin is not head down at the point of labor starting, a caesarean section should be recommended. Although the second twin typically has a higher frequency of problems, it is not known if a planned caesarean section affects this. It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.

====Breech birth====

A breech birth is the birth of a baby from a breech presentation, in which the baby exits the pelvis with the buttocks or feet first as opposed to the normal head-first presentation. In breech presentation, fetal heart sounds are heard just above the umbilicus.

Babies are usually born head first. If the baby is in another position the birth may be complicated. In a &#x27;breech presentation&#x27;, the unborn baby is bottom-down instead of head-down. Babies born bottom-first are more likely to be harmed during a normal (vaginal) birth than those born head-first. For instance, the baby might not get enough oxygen during the birth. Having a planned caesarean may reduce these problems. A review looking at planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation with planned vaginal birth, concludes that in the short term, births with a planned caesarean were safer for babies than vaginal births. Fewer babies died or were seriously hurt when they were born by caesarean. There was tentative evidence that children who were born by caesarean had more health problems at age two. Caesareans caused some short-term problems for mothers such as more abdominal pain. They also had some benefits, such as less urinary incontinence and less perineal pain.

The bottom-down position presents some hazards to the baby during the process of birth, and the mode of delivery (vaginal versus caesarean) is controversial in the fields of obstetrics and midwifery.

Though vaginal birth is possible for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section as studies have shown increased risks of morbidity and mortality for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason. As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.

====Resuscitative hysterotomy====

A resuscitative hysterotomy, also known as a peri-mortem caesarean delivery, is an emergency caesarean delivery carried out where maternal cardiac arrest has occurred, to assist in resuscitation of the mother by removing the aortocaval compression generated by the gravid uterus. Unlike other forms of caesarean section, the welfare of the fetus is a secondary priority only, and the procedure may be performed even prior to the limit of fetal viability if it is judged to be of benefit to the mother.

===Other ways, including the surgery technique===
There are several types of caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but there is no way of knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.
* The classical caesarean section involves a longitudinal midline incision on the uterus which allows a larger space to deliver the baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. Any woman who has had a classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision is much more likely to rupture in labor than the transverse incision.
* The lower uterine segment section is the procedure most commonly used today; it involves a transverse cut just above the edge of the bladder. It results in less blood loss and has fewer early and late complications for the mother, as well as allowing her to consider a vaginal birth in the next pregnancy.
* A caesarean hysterectomy consists of a caesarean section followed by the removal of the uterus. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the placenta cannot be separated from the uterus.

The EXIT procedure is a specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression.

The Misgav Ladach method is a modified caesarean section which has been used nearly all over the world since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, at the time he was the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montréal in 1994 and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the abdominal incision he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. There is also an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.

Since 2015, the World Health Organization has endorsed the Robson classification as a holistic means of comparing childbirth rates between different settings, with a view to allowing more accurate comparison of caesarean section rates.

==Technique==


Antibiotic prophylaxis is used before an incision. The uterus is incised, and this incision is extended with blunt pressure along a cephalad-caudad axis. The infant is delivered, and the placenta is then removed. The surgeon then makes a decision about uterine exteriorization. Single-layer uterine closure is used when the mother does not want a future pregnancy. When subcutaneous tissue is 2 cm thick or more, surgical suture is used. Discouraged practices include manual cervical dilation, any subcutaneous drain, or supplemental oxygen therapy with intent to prevent infection.

Caesarean section can be performed with single or double layer suturing of the uterine incision. Single layer closure compared with double layer closure has been observed to result in reduced blood loss during the surgery. It is uncertain whether this is the direct effect of the suturing technique or if other factors such as the type and site of abdominal incision contribute to reduced blood loss. Standard procedure includes the closure of the peritoneum. Research questions whether this is needed, with some studies indicating peritoneal closure is associated with longer operative time and hospital stay. The Misgav Ladach method is a surgery technical that may have fewer secondary complications and faster healing, due to the insertion into the muscle.

===Anesthesia===
Both general and regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia) are acceptable for use during caesarean section. Evidence does not show a difference between regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia with respect to major outcomes in the mother or baby. Regional anaesthesia may be preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby. Compared to general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia is better at preventing persistent postoperative pain 3 to 8 months after caesarean section. Other advantages of regional anesthesia may include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: pulmonary aspiration (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and esophageal intubation. One trial found no difference in satisfaction when general anaesthesia was compared with either spinal anaesthesia.

Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled caesarean section. Regional anaesthesia during caesarean section is different from the analgesia (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense nerve block.

General anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.

===Prevention of complications===

Postpartum infection is one of the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. A caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity, estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high, and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections was found by a meta-analysis to substantially reduce the incidence of febrile morbidity. Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans, largely endometritis, urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing caesarean section decreased wound infection, endometritis, and serious infectious complications by about 65%. Side effects and effect on the baby is unclear.

Women who have caesareans can recognize the signs of fever that indicate the possibility of wound infection. Taking antibiotics before skin incision rather than after cord clamping reduces the risk for the mother, without increasing adverse effects for the baby. Moderate certainty evidence suggest that chlorhexidine gluconate as a skin preparation is slightly more effective in prevention surgical site infections than povidone-iodine but further research is needed.

Some doctors believe that during a caesarean section, mechanical cervical dilation with a finger or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and lochia drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing the risk of death. The evidence neither supported nor refuted this practice for reducing postoperative morbidity, pending further large studies.

Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common in women who have spinal anaesthesia; intravenous fluids such as crystalloids, or compressing the legs with bandages, stockings, or inflatable devices may help to reduce the risk of hypotension but the evidence is still uncertain about their effectiveness.

===Skin-to-skin contact===

The WHO and UNICEF recommend that infants born by Caesarean section should have skin-to-skin contact (SSC) as soon as the mother is alert and responsive. Immediate SSC following a spinal or epidural anesthetic is possible because the mother remains alert; however, after a general anesthetic the father or other family member may provide SSC until the mother is able.

It is known that during the hours of labor before a vaginal birth a woman&#x27;s body begins to produce oxytocin which aids in the bonding process, and it is thought that SSC can trigger its production as well. Indeed, women have reported that they felt that SSC had helped them to feel close to and bond with their infant. A review of literature also found that immediate or early SSC increased the likelihood of successful breastfeeding and that newborns were found to cry less and relax quicker when they had SSC with their father as well.

==Recovery==
It is common for women who undergo caesarean section to have reduced or absent bowel movements for hours to days. During this time, women may experience abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. This usually resolves without treatment. Poorly controlled pain following non-emergent caesarean section occurs in between 13% and 78% of women. Following caesarean delivery, complementary and alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture) may help to relieve pain, though evidence supporting the efficacy of such treatments is extremely limited. Abdominal, wound and back pain can continue for months after a caesarean section. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be helpful. For the first couple of weeks after a caesarean, women should avoid lifting anything heavier than their baby. To minimize pain during breastfeeding, women should experiment with different breastfeeding holds including the football hold and side-lying hold. Women who have had a caesarean are more likely to experience pain that interferes with their usual activities than women who have vaginal births, although by six months there is generally no longer a difference. Pain during sexual intercourse is less likely than after vaginal birth; by six months there is no difference.

There may be a somewhat higher incidence of postnatal depression in the first weeks after childbirth for women who have caesarean sections, but this difference does not persist. Some women who have had caesarean sections, especially emergency caesareans, experience post-traumatic stress disorder.

A woman who undergoes caesarean section has 18.3% chance of chronic surgical pain at three months and 6.8% chance of surgical pain at 12 months.

In recent meta-analyses, caesarean section has been associated to a lower risk of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse compared to vaginal delivery. Women who have vaginal births, after a previous caesarean, are more than twice as likely to subsequently have pelvic floor surgery as those who have another caesarean.

==Frequency==
Global rates of caesarean section are increasing. It doubled from 2003 to 2018 to reach 21%, and is increasing annually by 4%. The trend towards increasing rates is particularly strong in middle and high income countries. In southern Africa, the cesarean rate is less than 5%; while the rate is almost 60% in some parts of Latin America. The Canadian rate was 26% in 2005–2006. Australia has a high caesarean section rate, at 31% in 2007. At one time a rate of 10% to 15% was thought to be ideal; a rate of 19% may result in better outcomes. The World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rate in June 2010. Their official statement read, &quot;There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them.&quot;

More than 50 nations have rates greater than 27%. Another 45 countries have rates less than 7.5%. There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section. Globally, 1% of all caesarean deliveries are carried out without medical need. Overall, the caesarean section rate was 25.7% for 2004–2008.

There is no significant difference in caesarean rates when comparing midwife continuity care to conventional fragmented care. More emergency caesareans—about 66%—are performed during the day rather than the night.

The rate has risen to 46% in China and to levels of 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries. In Brazil and Iran the caesarean section rate is greater than 40%. Brazil has one of the highest caesarean section rates in the world, with rates in the public sector of 35–45%, and 80–90% in the private sector.

===Europe===
Across Europe, there are differences between countries: in Italy the caesarean section rate is 40%, while in the Nordic countries it is 14%. In the United Kingdom, in 2008, the rate was 24%. In Ireland the rate was 26.1% in 2009.

In Italy, the incidence of caesarean sections is particularly high, although it varies from region to region. In Campania, 60% of 2008 births reportedly occurred via caesarean sections. In the Rome region, the mean incidence is around 44%, but can reach as high as 85% in some private clinics.

===United States===
In the United States, cesarean deliveries began rising in the 1960s and started becoming routine in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the United States the rate of C-section is around 33%, varying from 23% to 40% depending on the state. One of three women who gave birth in the US delivered by caesarean in 2011. In 2012, close to 23 million C-sections were carried out globally.

With nearly 1.3 million stays, caesarean section was one of the most common procedures performed in U.S. hospitals in 2011. It was the second-most common procedure performed for people ages 18 to 44 years old. Caesarean rates in the U.S. have risen considerably since 1996. The rate has increased in the United States, to 33% of all births in 2012, up from 21% in 1996. In 2010, the caesarean delivery rate was 32.8% of all births (a slight decrease from 2009&#x27;s high of 32.9% of all births). A study found that in 2011, women covered by private insurance were 11% more likely to have a caesarean section delivery than those covered by Medicaid. The increase in use has not resulted in improved outcomes, resulting in the position that C-sections may be done too frequently. It is believed that the high rate of induced deliveries has also led to the high rate of c-sections because they are twice as likely to lead to one.

Hospitals and doctors make more money from C-section births than vaginal deliveries. Economists have calculated that hospitals may make a few thousand dollars more and doctors a few hundred. It has been found that for-profit hospitals do more c-sections than non-profit hospitals. One study looked at the rate of c-sections done for women who were themselves doctors. It found that there was a 10 percent decrease to the rate of c-sections vs the general population. But if the hospital paid their doctors a flat salary removing the incentive to do the surgical procedures, which take more time, the rate of c-sections done on women who were themselves physicians exceeded that of the procedure done on non-medically knowledgeable mothers, suggesting that some women who actually needed c-sections were not getting them.

Concerned over the rising number of cesarean deliveries and hospital costs, in 2009 Minnesota introduced a blended payment rate for either vaginal or cesarean uncomplicated births (i.e., a similar payment regardless of delivery mode). As a result, the prepolicy cesarean rate of 22.8% dropped 3.24 percentage points. The cost of childbirth hospitalizations in Minnesota dropped by $425.80 at the time the policy was initiated and continued to drop by $95.04 per quarter with no significant effects on maternal morbidity.

The rise of cesarean births in the United States has coincided with counter-movements emphasizing natural childbirth with a lesser degree of medical intervention.

=== China ===
The rate of cesarean sections began to sharply increase in China in the 1990s. This increase was driven by the expansion of China&#x27;s modern hospital infrastructure, and occurred first in urban areas. The rise in cesarean deliveries has also resulted in social critique of the medical establishment over the medical necessity of performing cesarean sections.

==History==

There are many conflicting stories of the first successful caesarean section (or C-section) in which both mother and baby survived. It is, however, known that the procedure had been attempted for hundreds of years before it became accepted in the beginning of the twentieth century. While forceps have gone through periods of high popularity, today they are only used in approximately 10% of deliveries. The c-section has become the more popular solution for difficult deliveries. In 2005, one-third of babies were born via C-section.

Historically, caesarean sections performed upon a live woman usually resulted in the death of the mother. It was considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. By way of comparison, see the resuscitative hysterotomy or perimortem caesarean section.

According to the ancient Chinese &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Luzhong (), a sixth-generation descendant of the mythical Yellow Emperor, had six sons, all born by &quot;cutting open the body&quot;. The sixth son Jilian founded the House of Mi that ruled the State of Chu (–223 BC).

The Sanskrit medical treatise &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, composed in the early 1st millennium CE, mentions post-mortem caesarean sections. The first available non-mythical record of a C-section is the mother of Bindusara (born , ruled 298 – ), the second Mauryan &quot;Samrat&quot; (emperor) of India, accidentally consumed poison and died when she was close to delivering him. Chanakya, Chandragupta&#x27;s teacher and adviser, made up his mind that the baby should survive. He cut open the belly of the queen and took out the baby, thus saving the baby&#x27;s life.

An early account of caesarean section in Iran (Persia) is mentioned in the book of &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, written around 1000 AD, and relates to the birth of Rostam, the legendary hero of that country. According to the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the Simurgh instructed Zal upon how to perform a caesarean section, thus saving Rudaba and the child Rostam. In Persian literature caesarean section is known as &quot;Rostamina&quot; ().

In the Irish mythological text the Ulster Cycle, the character Furbaide Ferbend is said to have been born by posthumous caesarean section, after his mother was murdered by his evil aunt Medb.

The Babylonian Talmud, an ancient Jewish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the caesarean section. The procedure is termed . It also discusses at length the permissibility of performing a C-section on a dying or dead mother. There is also some basis for supposing that Jewish women regularly survived the operation in Roman times (as early as the 2nd century AD).

Pliny the Elder theorized that Julius Caesar&#x27;s (born 100 BC) name came from an ancestor who was born by caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the discussion of the etymology of &quot;Caesar&quot;). Some popular misconceptions involve Caesar himself being born from the procedure; which is considered false because the procedure was lethal to mothers in ancient Rome and Caesar&#x27;s mother Aurelia Cotta lived until he was an adult. The Ancient Roman caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth, a practice sometimes called the &quot;Caesarean law&quot;.

The Spanish saint Raymond Nonnatus (1204–1240) received his surname—from the Latin (&#x27;not born&#x27;)—because he was born by caesarean section. His mother died while giving birth to him.

There is some indirect evidence that the first caesarean section that was survived by both the mother and child was performed in Prague in 1337. The mother was Beatrice of Bourbon, the second wife of the King of Bohemia John of Luxembourg. Beatrice gave birth to the king&#x27;s son Wenceslaus I, later the duke of Luxembourg, Brabant, and Limburg, and who became the half brother of the later King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV.

In an account from the 1580s, Jakob Nufer, a veterinarian in Siegershausen, Switzerland, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour, with her surviving. His wife allegedly bore five more children, including twins, and the baby delivered by caesarean section purportedly lived to the age of 77.

For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high mortality rate by modern standards. Key steps in reducing mortality were:
* Introduction of the transverse incision technique to minimize bleeding by Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer in 1881 is thought to be first modern CS performed.
* The introduction of uterine suturing by Max Sänger in 1882
* Modification by Hermann Johannes Pfannenstiel in 1900, see Pfannenstiel incision
* Extraperitoneal CS and then moving to low transverse incision (Krönig, 1912)
* Adherence to principles of asepsis
* Anesthesia advances
* Blood transfusion
* Antibiotics

Indigenous people in the Great Lakes region of Africa, including Rwanda and Uganda, performed caesarean sections which in one account by Robert William Felkin from 1879 resulted in the survival of both mother and child. Banana wine was used, although the site of the incision was then also washed with water and, post operation, covered with a paste made by chewing two different roots. From the well-developed nature of the medical procedures employed he concluded that these procedures had been employed for some time. James Barry was the first European doctor to carry out a successful caesarean in Africa, while posted to Cape Town between 1817 and 1828.

The first successful caesarean section to be performed in the United States took place in Rockingham County, Virginia in 1794. The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.

=== Caesarius of Terracina ===

The patron saint of caesarean section is Caesarius, a young deacon martyred at Terracina, who has replaced and Christianized the pagan figure of Caesar. The martyr (Saint Cesareo in Italian) is invoked for the success of this surgical procedure, because it was considered the new &quot;Christian Caesar&quot; – as opposed to the &quot;pagan Caesar&quot; – in the Middle Ages it began to be invoked by pregnant women to wish a physiological birth, for the success of the expulsion of the baby from the uterus and, therefore, for their salvation and that of the unborn. The practice continues, in fact the martyr Caesarius is invoked by the future mothers who, due to health problems or that of the baby, must give birth to their child by caesarean section.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is not definitively known. Roman &quot;Lex Regia&quot; (royal law), later the (imperial law), of Numa Pompilius (715–673 BC), required the child of a mother who had died during childbirth to be cut from her womb.
There was a cultural taboo that mothers should not be buried pregnant, that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses. Roman practice required a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure, reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery.

Speculations that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C-section are false. Although caesarean sections were performed in Roman times, no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery, while Caesar&#x27;s mother lived for years after his birth. As late as the 12th century, scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman&#x27;s surviving this procedure and again becoming pregnant. The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb &quot;&quot;, &#x27;to cut&#x27;, with children delivered this way referred to as . Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar (an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman) as , &#x27;cut from the womb&#x27; giving this as an explanation for the cognomen &quot;Caesar&quot; which was then carried by his descendants. Nonetheless, the false etymology has been widely repeated until recently. For example, the first (1888) and second (1989) editions of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; say that caesarean birth &quot;was done in the case of Julius Cæsar&quot;. More recent dictionaries are more diffident: the online edition of the OED (2021) mentions &quot;the traditional belief that Julius Cæsar was delivered this way&quot;, and &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; (2003) says &quot;from the legendary association of such a delivery with the Roman cognomen &quot;Caesar&quot;&quot;.

The word &quot;Caesar&quot;, meaning either Julius Caesar or an emperor in general, is also borrowed or calqued in the name of the procedure in many other languages in Europe and beyond.

Finally, the Roman &quot;praenomen&quot; (given name) Caeso was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.

=== Spelling ===

The term &quot;caesarean&quot; is spelled in various accepted ways, . The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) uses &quot;cesarean section&quot;, while some other American medical works, e.g. &quot;Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary&quot;, use &quot;caesarean&quot;, as do most British works. The online versions of the US-published &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; and &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; list &quot;cesarean&quot; first and other spellings as &quot;variants&quot;.

==Society and culture==

===Court cases===
&quot;In re A.C.&quot;, 573 A.2d 1235 (1990), was a District of Columbia Court of Appeals case. It was the first American appellate court case decided against a forced Caesarean section, although the decision was issued after the fatal procedure was performed. Physicians performed a Caesarean section upon patient Angela Carder (née Stoner) without informed consent in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her baby. The case stands as a landmark in United States case law establishing the rights of informed consent and bodily integrity for pregnant women.

In Illinois, &quot;In re Baby Boy Doe&quot;, 632 N.E.2d 326 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994) was a court case holding that courts may not balance whatever rights a fetus may have against the rights of a competent woman, whose choice to refuse medical treatment as invasive as a Cesarean section must be honored even if the choice may be harmful to the fetus.

&quot;Pemberton v. Tallahassee Memorial Regional Center&quot;, 66 F. Supp. 2d 1247 (N.D. Fla. 1999), is a case in the United States regarding reproductive rights. Pemberton had a previous Caesarean section (vertical incision), and with her second child attempted to have a VBAC (vaginal birth after c-section). When a doctor she had approached about a related issue at the Tallahassee Memorial Regional Center found out, he and the hospital sued to force her to get a c-section. The court held that the rights of the fetus at or near birth outweighed the rights of Pemberton to determine her own medical care. She was physically forced to stop laboring, and taken to the hospital, where a c-section was performed. Her suit against the hospital was dismissed. The court held that a cesarean section at the end of a full-term pregnancy was here deemed to be medically necessary by doctors to avoid a substantial risk that the fetus would die during delivery due to uterine rupture, a risk of 4–6% according to the hospital&#x27;s doctors and 2% according to Pemberton&#x27;s doctors. Furthermore, the court held that a state&#x27;s interest in preserving the life of an unborn child outweighed the mother&#x27;s constitutional interest of bodily integrity. The court held that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was not applicable, because bearing an unwanted child is a greater intrusion on the mother&#x27;s constitutional interests than undergoing a cesarean section to deliver a child that the mother affirmatively desires to deliver. The court further distinguished &quot;In re A.C.&quot; by stating that it left open the possibility that a non-consenting patient&#x27;s interest would yield to a more compelling countervailing interest in an &quot;extremely rare and truly exceptional case.&quot; The court then held this case to be such.

===Presence of father===

In many hospitals, the mother&#x27;s partner is encouraged to attend the surgery to support her and share the experience. While traditionally there has been an opaque surgical drape obstructing the parents&#x27; view, some patients and doctors are opting for a &quot;gentle C-section&quot; using a clear drape, allowing the parents to watch the delivery and see their infant immediately.

===Special cases===
In Judaism, there is a dispute among the &quot;poskim&quot; (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether the first-born son from a caesarean section has the laws of a &quot;bechor&quot;. Traditionally, a male child delivered by caesarean is not eligible for the &quot;Pidyon HaBen&quot; dedication ritual.

In rare cases, caesarean sections can be used to remove a dead fetus; otherwise, the woman has to labour and deliver a baby known to be a stillbirth. A late-term abortion using caesarean section procedures is termed a hysterotomy abortion and is very rarely performed.

The mother may perform a caesarean section on herself; there have been successful cases, such as Inés Ramírez Pérez of Mexico who, on 5 March 2000, took this action. She survived, as did her son, Orlando Ruiz Ramírez.

In 2024, a female western lowland gorilla had a successful cesarean section after zoo veterinarians diagnosed her with pre-eclampsia. The premature gorilla infant survived, as a result of similar methods used with human infants.

<text>Greyhawk, also known as the World of Greyhawk, is a fictional world designed as a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy roleplaying game. Although not the first campaign world developed for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;—Dave Arneson&#x27;s &quot;Blackmoor&quot; campaign predated it by about a year—the world of Greyhawk closely identified with early development of the game beginning in 1972, and after being published it remained associated with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; publications until 2008. The world itself started as a simple dungeon under a castle designed by Gary Gygax for the amusement of his children and friends, but it was rapidly expanded to include not only a complex multi-layered dungeon environment, but also the nearby city of Greyhawk, and eventually an entire world. In addition to the campaign world, which was published in several editions over twenty years, Greyhawk was also used as the setting for many adventures published in support of the game, as well as for RPGA&#x27;s massively shared &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; campaign from 2000 to 2008.

==Setting==
The World of Greyhawk is located on a planet called &quot;Oerth.&quot; Oerth has an axial tilt of 30 degrees, which causes greater seasonal temperature variation than on Earth and is controlled by wizardly and divine magic that shifts weather patterns to be more favorable to the populace. Castle Greyhawk was the most famous dungeon in Oerth, the home campaign world of Gary Gygax. Players in the earliest days of this campaign mostly stayed within Castle Greyhawk&#x27;s dungeons, but Gygax envisioned the rest of his world as a sort of parallel Earth, and the original Oerth (pronounced &#x27;Oith&#x27;, as with a Brooklyn accent) looked much like the real-world Earth but filled with imaginary cities and countries. Several years later, when TSR produced the original &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; folio (1980), Gygax was asked to produce a map of the world and decided to create something new which still featured many of the locales from his original world of Oerth but with new geography. Gygax also connected Dave Arneson&#x27;s Blackmoor to his world by including a country by that name in Oerth. In his later novel &quot;Dance of Demons&quot; (1988), Gygax destroyed Greyhawk&#x27;s Oerth and replaced it with a new fantasy world of Yarth.

The &quot;Flanaess&quot; is the eastern part of the continent of Oerik, one of the four continents of Oerth, acting as the setting of dozens of adventures published between the 1970s and 2000s. In late 1972, Dave Arneson demonstrated a new type of game to a group of gamers in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, including game designer Gygax. Gygax agreed to develop a set of rules with Arneson and get the game published; the game eventually became known as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Gygax designed a set of dungeons underneath the ruins of Castle Greyhawk as a testing ground for new rules, character classes and spells. In those early days, there was no Flanaess; the world map of Oerth was developed by Gygax as circumstances dictated, the new cities and lands simply drawn over a map of North America. Gygax and Kuntz further developed this campaign setting, and by 1976, the lands within a radius of 50 miles had been mapped in depth, and the lands within a radius of approximately 500 miles were in outline form. 

Following yet more work, in 1978 Gygax agreed to publish his world and decided to redevelop Oerth from scratch. Once he had sketched out the entire planet to his satisfaction, one hemisphere of Oerth was dominated by a massive continent called Oerik. Gygax decided to concentrate his first efforts on the continent of Oerik and asked TSR&#x27;s printing house about the maximum size of paper they could handle; the answer was 34 x 22 inches (86 cm x 56 cm). He found that, using the scale he desired, he could fit only the northeast corner of Oerik on two of the sheets. This corner of Oerik became known as &quot;the Flanaess&quot;, so named in Gygax&#x27;s mind because of the peaceful people known as the Flannae who had once lived there. Gygax also added many more new regions, countries and cities, bringing the number of political states to 60.

Needing original placenames for all of the geographical and political places on his map, Gygax sometimes resorted to wordplay based on the names of friends and acquaintances. For instance, Perrenland was named after Jeff Perren, who co-wrote the rules for &quot;Chainmail&quot; with Gygax; Urnst was a homophone of Ernst (his son Ernie); and Sunndi was a near-homophone of Cindy, another of Gygax&#x27;s children.

From Gygax&#x27;s prototype map, Darlene Pekul, a freelance artist in Lake Geneva, developed a full color map on a hex grid. Gygax was so pleased with the result that he quickly switched his home Greyhawk campaign over to the new world he had created. Ultimately, the original Castle Greyhawk was never published for public play, instead with many of the elements of Gygax&#x27;s original campaign becoming the seed for other adventures.

==Development history==
===Early development===
In the late 1960s, Gary Gygax, a military history buff and pulp fantasy fan, was a central, founding figure in the Castle &amp; Crusade Society. The C&amp;C Society, as it was known, served enthusiasts of miniature wargaming in the Middle Ages and published an occasional newsletter known as the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;.

Following up on a promise he made in &quot;Domesday Book&quot; #5, Gygax presented the &quot;Great Kingdom&quot; map c. June 1971 in Domesday #9, to be used as a game setting for the Society. Members thereafter began claiming territories, including member Dave Arneson, who was an officer of the organization, and frequent contributor to the newsletter. Arneson claimed a territory he named Blackmoor, a setting he had already begun developing in his home campaign, and Gygax reserved for himself a territory on lake Nyr Div.

In addition to historically-based medieval wargaming, both Gygax and Arneson were enthusiasts of adding fantasy elements to their games. To this end, Gygax created a fantasy supplement for the &quot;Chainmail&quot; ruleset for medieval miniatures that he was co-writing with Jeff Perren. Released in the late spring of 1971, this booklet included rules for fantasy monsters, wizards and magical weapons.

Around the same time, in Minneapolis–St. Paul, Dave Arneson, impressed by the &quot;Braunstein&quot; role-playing games of fellow wargamer David Wesely, developed the Barony of Blackmoor as a setting for Braunstein style games. Arneson based his game around the village, castle and dungeons of Blackmoor. The castle itself was represented on the table by an actual plastic kit model of a medieval castle. Arneson informed the players that instead of controlling regiments, they would each take one individual character into the castle of the Barony of Blackmoor to explore its dangerous dungeons. Arneson drew from numerous sources but quickly incorporated the fantasy supplement of Chainmail into his games.
After about a year and half of play, Arneson (Blackmoor) and fellow gamer David Megarry (Dungeon! boardgame) traveled to Lake Geneva in November or December 1972 to pitch their respective games to Gygax, who at that time was a representative of the Guidon Games company. Gygax was immediately intrigued by the concept of individual characters exploring a dungeon setting. He and Arneson agreed to co-develop a set of rules, and Gygax quickly developed a castle and dungeon of his own, &quot;Castle Greyhawk&quot;, set within his portion of the Great Kingdom map. Castle Greyhawk is sometimes considered the first dungeon in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and pioneered the roots of the mega-dungeon format of gaming.

Two of his children, Ernie and Elise, were the first players, and during their first session, as Tenser and Ahlissa, they fought and destroyed the first monsters of the Greyhawk dungeon; Gygax recalled them as being either giant centipedes or a nest of scorpions. During the same session, Ernie and Elise also found the first treasure, a chest of 3,000 copper coins which was too heavy to carry, much to the children&#x27;s chagrin. After his children had gone to bed, Gygax immediately began working on a second level for the dungeon. At the next play session, Ernie and Elise were joined by Gygax&#x27;s friends: Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz, and Terry Kuntz.

About a month after his first session, Gygax created the nearby city of Greyhawk, where the players&#x27; characters could sell their treasure and find a place to rest.

===Home campaign (1972–1979)===
As Gygax and Arneson worked to develop and publish the rules for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; through TSR, Gygax continued to design and present the dungeons and environs of Castle Greyhawk to his circle of friends and family, using them as playtesters for new rules and concepts. As the players began to explore more of the world outside of the castle and city, Gygax developed other regions and cities for them. With play sessions occurring seven or more times a week, Gygax did not have the time or inclination to create the map for a whole new world; he simply drew his world over a map of North America, adding new cities and regions as his world slowly grew through ongoing adventures. The city and castle of Greyhawk were placed near the real-world position of Chicago, his birthplace; various other places were clustered around it. For instance, the rival city of Dyvers he placed in the area of real-world Milwaukee.

Gygax also continued to develop the dungeons underneath the castle. By the time he was finished, the complex labyrinth encompassed thirteen levels filled with devious traps, secret passageways, hungry monsters, and glittering treasure. Although details of these original Greyhawk dungeons have never been published in detail, Gygax gave some glimpses of them in an article he wrote for the European fanzine &quot;Europa&quot; in 1975:

::Before the rules for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; were published, &quot;Old Greyhawk Castle&quot; was 13 levels deep. The first level was a simple maze of rooms and corridors, for none of the &quot;participants&quot; had ever played such a game before. The second level had two unusual items, a Nixie pool and a fountain of snakes. The third featured a torture chamber and small cells and prison rooms. The fourth was a level of crypts and undead. The fifth was centered around a strange font of black fire and gargoyles. The sixth was a repeating maze with dozens of wild hogs... in inconvenient spots, naturally backed up by appropriate numbers of Wereboars. The seventh was centered around a circular labyrinth and a street of masses of ogres. The eighth through tenth levels were caves and caverns featuring Trolls, giant insects and a transporter nexus with an evil Wizard (with a number of tough associates) guarding it. The eleventh level was the home of the most powerful wizard in the castle: He had Balrogs as servants. The remainder of the level was populated by Martian White Apes, except the sub-passage system underneath the corridors which was full of poisonous critters with no treasure. Level twelve was filled with Dragons.

::The bottom level, number thirteen, contained an inescapable slide which took the players clear through &#x27;to China&#x27;, from whence they had to return via &quot;Outdoor Adventure&quot;. It was quite possible to journey downward by an insidious series of slanting passages which began on the second level, but the likelihood of following such a route unknowingly did not become too great until the seventh or eighth level...

::Side levels included a barracks with Orcs, Hobgoblins, and Gnolls continually warring with each other, a museum, a huge arena, an underground lake, a Giant&#x27;s home, and a garden of fungi.

Anyone who made it to the bottom level alive met Zagyg, the insane architect of the dungeons. &quot;Zagyg&quot; is a reverse homophone of &quot;Gygax&quot;, and it was Gygax&#x27;s inside joke that the person who had designed the dungeon—himself—must be insane. Only three players ever made it to the bottom level and met Zagyg, all of them during solo adventures: Rob Kuntz (playing Robilar), Gygax&#x27;s son Ernie (playing Tenser), and Rob&#x27;s brother Terry (playing Terik). Their reward was to be instantly transported to the far side of the world, where they each faced a long solo trek back to the city of Greyhawk. Terik and Tenser managed to catch up to Robilar along the way, and the three journeyed back to Greyhawk together.

By this time, a dozen players crowded Gygax&#x27;s basement every night, with over 20 at times on weekends and the effort needed to plan their adventures took up much of Gygax&#x27;s spare time. He had been very impressed with Rob Kuntz&#x27;s imaginative play as a player, and appointed Rob to be co-Dungeon Master of Greyhawk. This freed up Gygax to work on other projects, and also gave him an opportunity to participate as a player, creating characters like Yrag and Mordenkainen.

In order to make room for Rob Kuntz&#x27;s dungeons, Gygax scrapped his bottom level and integrated Rob&#x27;s work into the Greyhawk dungeons. Gygax and Kuntz continued to develop new levels for their players, and by the time the Greyhawk home campaign drew to a close in 1985, the castle dungeons encompassed more than fifty levels.

====Significant player characters====
While many players participating in the Gygax and Kuntz home campaign were occasional players, sometimes not even naming their characters, others played far more frequently, and several of their characters became well known to the general gaming world before publication of the Greyhawk campaign setting. Some of these characters became known when Gygax mentioned them in his various columns, interviews, and publications. In other cases, when Gygax created a new magical spell for the game, he would sometimes use the name of a wizard character from his home campaign to add verisimilitude to the spell name, such as &quot;Melf&#x27;s acid arrow&quot;, Melf being a character created by his son Luke. Some of the characters who became synonymous with Greyhawk at that time included:
* Murlynd: Gary Gygax&#x27;s friend Don Kaye created Murlynd for the second-ever session of Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk campaign in 1972. Gygax later recalled that &quot;Murlynd&quot; was the first attempt by a player to make a creative name for a character; in the early days, most players—including Gygax himself—simply used their own name as a basis for their character&#x27;s name, e.g. Gary was &quot;Yrag&quot;, etc. According to Robert Kuntz, Murlynd did not get his trademark &quot;six-shooters&quot; in actual play, but they were given to the character in tribute to Don Kaye&#x27;s love of the Western genre. Although Gygax did not allow the use of gunpowder in his Greyhawk setting, he made a loophole for Don Kaye by ruling that Murlynd actually carried two magical wands that made loud noises and delivered small but deadly missiles. His name is used for the &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; item, &quot;Murlynd&#x27;s Spoon&quot;.
* Robilar: Robilar was a fighter belonging to Rob Kuntz. Like Murlynd, Robilar was also created for the second-ever session beneath Castle Greyhawk in 1972, rolled up on Gygax&#x27;s kitchen table. Gygax suggested to Kuntz the name of Robilar, after a minor character in Gygax&#x27;s novella &quot;The Gnome Cache&quot;. Because Kuntz was a constant player, Robilar rapidly gained power and possessions. As the city of Greyhawk was developed, he also became the secret owner of the Green Dragon Inn in the city of Greyhawk, where he kept tabs on happenings in the city. Kuntz quickly grew impatient with play when it involved more than a couple of players, and often played solo adventures one-on-one with Gygax. Robilar was not only the first to reach the 13th and bottom level of Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk dungeons, but on the way, he was also responsible for freeing nine demi-gods (whom Gygax revived a decade later as some of the first deities of Greyhawk: Iuz, Ralishaz, Trithereon, Erythnul, Olidammara, Heironeous, Celestian, Hextor, and Obad-Hai). Robilar was also the first to enter Gygax&#x27;s Temple of Elemental Evil, and conquered it completely. Robilar also freed the demoness Zuggtmoy from her prison at the centre of the Temple. Kuntz later related that Gygax was very dismayed that his masterpiece dungeon had been destroyed by a single adventurer, and as punishment, Gygax had an army pursue Robilar back to his castle, which he had to abandon. Robilar also lost possession of the Green Dragon Inn.
* Tenser: Tenser was a wizard played by Gygax&#x27;s son Ernie. In the earliest days of Greyhawk, Ernie often gamed with Rob Kuntz (Robilar) and Terry Kuntz (Terik). At one point, using their combined forces of loyal henchmen, the three controlled access to the first level of the Greyhawk dungeons while they ransacked the lower levels. Tenser became the second character to reach the thirteenth (and bottom, at the time) level of the Greyhawk dungeons, when he noticed that Robilar was missing and went in search of him. Gary Gygax included the name &quot;Tenser&quot; in the names of two spells, &quot;Tenser&#x27;s floating disc&quot; and &quot;Tenser&#x27;s transformation&quot;.
* Terik (or Teric) was a character created by Terry Kuntz. Terik often adventured with Tenser and Robilar in the days when the three controlled the first level of the dungeons of Greyhawk. Terik became the third and last character to reach the bottom level of Gygax&#x27;s original Greyhawk dungeon when he noticed Robilar and Tenser were missing and went in search of them.
* Erac&#x27;s Cousin: Gary Gygax&#x27;s son Ernie originally had a character he called Erac. Later, he created a wizard who, due to a personal issue as part of his backstory, refused to reveal his name, simply referring to himself as Erac&#x27;s Cousin. Gary Gygax knew that Ernie liked the Barsoom stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and at one point, transported Erac&#x27;s Cousin to a Barsoom-like Mars, where the inhabitants refused to let the wizard use magic. Erac&#x27;s Cousin was forced to become a fighter instead, and learned to fight proficiently with two weapons simultaneously. Eventually he was able to teleport back to Oerth, but when he acquired two vorpal blades, Rob Kuntz and Gary Gygax decided he had become too powerful, and lured him into a demon&#x27;s clutches. The demon took him to an alternative plane that drained the magic from the vorpal blades, destroying them.
* Yrag: After Gygax made Kuntz a co-DM, this fighter was Gygax&#x27;s first character, and Gygax often referred to Yrag&#x27;s various adventures in columns and interviews. &quot;Yrag&quot; is simply &quot;Gary&quot; spelled backwards.
* Mordenkainen: This was perhaps Gygax&#x27;s most famous character, and also his favorite. Mordenkainen was created in early 1973, and his name was drawn from Finnish mythology. Due to constant play, often with Rob Kuntz as DM, Gygax advanced Mordenkainen into a powerful character. Gygax never revealed exactly how powerful Mordenkainen was, simply stating that the wizard had &quot;twenty-something levels&quot;. Even years after he last played Mordenkainen, he would not disclose any of Mordenkainen&#x27;s powers or possessions. Various spells from first edition bear his name, such as &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s faithful hound&quot;, &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s lucubration&quot;, and &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s sword&quot;.
* Bigby: Bigby started life as an evil low-level wizard non-player character in Rob Kuntz&#x27;s dungeons of Greyhawk. Gary Gygax, playing Mordenkainen, managed to subdue him, and forced Bigby to become his servant. After a long time and several adventures, Mordenkainen managed to convince Bigby to leave his evil ways behind, and Kuntz ruled that Bigby had changed from an enemy to a loyal henchman, and therefore Gygax could take over Bigby as a player character. Thereafter, Gygax developed Bigby into a powerful wizard second only to Mordenkainen, and used his name to describe a series of &quot;hand&quot; spells, e.g. &quot;Bigby&#x27;s crushing hand&quot; and &quot;Bigby&#x27;s grasping hand&quot;. For a time after this, Rob Kuntz ruled that all the names of Mordenkainen&#x27;s future henchmen had to rhyme with Bigby. This resulted in Zigby the dwarf; Rigby the cleric; Sigby Griggbyson the fighter; Bigby&#x27;s apprentice, Nigby; and Digby, Mordenkainen&#x27;s new apprentice who replaced Bigby.
* Melf: Melf was an elven character created by Gary Gygax&#x27;s son Luke. Gary Gygax borrowed Melf&#x27;s name for the spell &quot;Melf&#x27;s acid arrow&quot;.
* Rary: Rary was a wizard created by Brian Blume and played only until he reached the 3rd level, at which point Blume retired him, having reached his objective, which was to be able to call his character &quot;Medium Rary&quot;. Gygax borrowed the name for the spells &quot;Rary&#x27;s mnemonic enhancer&quot; and &quot;Rary&#x27;s telepathic bond&quot;.
* Otto: Otto, like Bigby, started life as an evil non-player character wizard in the dungeons of Greyhawk. Tenser and Robilar defeated him in combat, and when given a choice of which master to serve, Otto chose to serve Robilar, thereby becoming a character controlled by Robilar&#x27;s creator, Rob Kuntz. Thereafter, Otto accompanied Robilar on many adventures, including Robilar&#x27;s destruction of the Temple of Elemental Evil. Gary Gygax borrowed Otto&#x27;s name for the spell &quot;Otto&#x27;s irresistible dance&quot;.
* Drawmij: Drawmij was a wizard created by Jim Ward—&quot;Drawmij&quot; is simply his name spelled backwards. Gygax borrowed Drawmij&#x27;s name for the magical spell &quot;Drawmij&#x27;s instant summons&quot;.
* The Circle of Eight: At the point where Gygax&#x27;s own characters in the Greyhawk home campaign had collectively accumulated both enough wealth that they could not easily spend it, and a standing army that rivalled most nations&#x27; forces, he gathered all eight of the characters—Mordenkainen (wizard), Yrag (fighter), Bigby (wizard), Rigby (cleric), Zigby (dwarf), Felnorith (fighter), Vram (elf) &amp; Vin (elf)—together as the Circle of Eight. Pooling their resources, Gygax had the Eight construct a stronghold in the middle of an evil land so they would not have to travel far to find adventure. After three years of game time, the result was the Obsidian Citadel, an octagonal castle which housed the Circle of Eight and their armies. After Gygax was ousted from TSR, Carl Sargent and Rik Rose remolded Gygax&#x27;s old &quot;Circle of Eight&quot; in &quot;The City of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set into a new plot device. Instead of a group of eight companions belonging to Gygax, who sallied forth from an impregnable bastion to fight evil, the Circle became eight wizards brought together by Gygax&#x27;s own creation now owned by TSR, Mordenkainen. Game designer Ken Rolston described this new Circle of Eight as &quot;a powerful and influential local organization of wizards&quot;. Wolfgang Baur found the Circle of Eight a small but knowledgable organization, central to the mythos of the &quot;Greyhawk&quot; setting, with all its members being important.

====Greyhawk firsts====
=====The first publication to mention Greyhawk=====
Gary Gygax wrote a short story titled &quot;The Expedition Into the Black Reservoir&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Dungeon Adventure at Greyhawk Castle&quot;, which was published in the August 1974 issue of Chicago small press magazine &quot;El Conquistador&quot;.

=====The first mention of Oerth=====
In the first issue of &quot;The Dragon&quot; published in June 1976, Gygax prefaced Chapter 1 of his serialized novella &quot;The Gnome Cache&quot; with a note that the story&#x27;s setting, Oerth, was very similar to Earth in terms of geography.

=====The first deities of Greyhawk=====
One facet of culture that Gygax did not address during the first few years of his home campaign was organized religion. Since his campaign was largely built around the needs of lower-level characters, he did not think specific deities were necessary, since direct interaction between a god and a low-level character was very unlikely. Some of his players took matters into their own hands, calling upon Norse or Greek gods such as Odin or Zeus, or even Conan&#x27;s Crom in times of dire need. However, some of the players wanted Gygax to create and customize a specific deity so that cleric characters could receive their powers from someone less ambiguous than &quot;the gods&quot;. Gygax jokingly created two gods: Saint Cuthbert—who brought non-believers around to his point of view with whacks of his cudgel —and Pholtus, whose fanatical followers refused to believe that any other gods existed. Because both of these deities represented aspects of Good, Gygax eventually created a few evil deities to provide some villainy.

In Chapter 2 of &quot;The Gnome Cache&quot;, which appeared in the second issue of &quot;The Dragon&quot;, a shrine to St. Cuthbert (spelled &quot;St. Cuthburt&quot;) was mentioned, which was the first published reference to a Greyhawk deity.

=====The first Greyhawk novel=====
In 1976, Gygax invited the science fiction/fantasy writer Andre Norton to play &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in his Greyhawk world. Norton subsequently wrote &quot;Quag Keep&quot;, which involved a group of gamers who travel from the real world to Greyhawk. It was the first novel to be set, at least partially, in the Greyhawk setting, and according to &quot;Alternative Worlds&quot;, the first to be based on &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. &quot;Quag Keep&quot; was excerpted in issue #12 of &quot;The Dragon&quot; (February 1978) just prior to the book&#x27;s release.

=====The first Greyhawk adventures published by TSR=====
From 1976 to 1979, Gygax also shared some glimpses of his home campaign with other gamers when he set several TSR &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures in the world of Greyhawk:
* &quot;Lost Caverns of Tsojconth&quot; (1976), republished in 1982 as S4 &quot;Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot;
* S1 &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; (1978)
* G1 &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot; (1978)
* G2 &quot;Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl&quot; (1978)
* G3 &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot; (1978)
* D1 &quot;Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot; (1978)
* D2 &quot;Shrine of the Kuo-Toa&quot; (1978)
* D3 &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot; (1978)
* T1 &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot; (1978)

In addition, Lawrence Schick set his 1979 TSR adventure S2 &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot; in Greyhawk.

Despite fan curiosity, the original Castle Greyhawk was never officially published outside of Gygax&#x27;s home campaign.

===&quot;The World of Greyhawk&quot; folio edition (1980)===
In 1975, Gygax and Kuntz published a booklet called &quot;Supplement I: Greyhawk&quot;, an expansion of the rules for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; based on their play experiences in the Greyhawk campaign. Although it detailed new spells and character classes that had been developed in the dungeons of Greyhawk, it did not contain any details of their Greyhawk campaign world. The only two references to Greyhawk were an illustration of a large stone head in a dungeon corridor titled &quot;The Great Stone Face, Enigma of Greyhawk&quot; and mention of a fountain on the second level of the dungeons that continuously issued an endless number of snakes.

The 2004 publication &quot;30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; suggested that details of Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk campaign were published in this booklet, but Gygax had no plans in 1975 to publish details of the Greyhawk world, since he believed that new players of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; would rather create their own worlds than use someone else&#x27;s. In addition, he did not want to publish all the material he had created for his players; he thought he would be unlikely to recoup a fair investment for the thousands of hours he had spent on it. Since his secrets would be revealed to his players, he would be forced to recreate a new world for them afterward.

With the release of the &quot;AD&amp;D Players Handbook&quot; in 1978, many players were intrigued by the connection of Greyhawk characters to magical spells such as &quot;Tenser&#x27;s floating disc&quot;, &quot;Bigby&#x27;s crushing hand&quot;, and &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s faithful hound&quot;. The &quot;AD&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide&quot;, released the following year, also made references to the dungeons of Castle Greyhawk. Players&#x27; curiosity was further piqued by the ten &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; modules set in Greyhawk that were published between 1976 and 1979. Several of Gygax&#x27;s regular columns in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine also mentioned details of his home campaign and characters that inhabited his world. Gygax was surprised when he found out that players wanted to use Greyhawk as their campaign world.

====Development of geography====
Rather than using his own version of the Great Kingdom map, which included local areas based on real-world maps, Gygax decided to create an entirely new and greatly expanded version of Oerth. Needing many more original names for all of the geographical and political places on his map for the new and expanded areas, Gygax sometimes resorted to wordplay. He had previously used Perrenland on the Great Kingdom map, named after Jeff Perren, who co-wrote the rules for &quot;Chainmail&quot; with Gygax, but for the new Greyhawk map he added many more such names of friends and acquaintances. For instance, Urnst was a homophone of Ernst (his son Ernie) and Sunndi was a near-homophone of Cindy, another of Gygax&#x27;s children.

Gygax gave only the most basic descriptions of each state; he expected that DMs would customize the setting in order to make it an integral part of their own individual campaigns. His map included arctic wastes, desert, temperate forests, tropical jungles, mountainous cordillera, seas and oceans, rivers, archipelagos and volcanoes.

====Development of history and politics====
Gygax set out to create a fractious place where chaos and evil were in the ascendant and courageous champions would be needed. In order to explain how his world had arrived at this state, he wrote an outline of a thousand years of history. As a military history buff, he was very familiar with the concept of waves of cultural invasions, such the Picts of Great Britain being invaded by the Celts, who were in turn invaded by the Romans. In creating a similar pattern of history for his world, Gygax decided that a thousand years before his campaign began, the northeast corner of the continent had been occupied by a peaceful but primitive people called the Flannae, whose name was the root for the name of that part of Oerik, the &quot;Flanaess&quot;. At that time, far to the west of the Flanaess, two peoples were at war, the Bakluni and the Suloise. The war reached its climax when both sides used powerful magic to obliterate each other, in an event called the Twin Cataclysms. Refugees of these disasters were forced out of their lands, and the Suloise invaded the Flanaess, forcing the Flannae to flee to the outer edges of the continent. Several centuries later, a new invader appeared, the Oeridians, and they in turn forced the Suloise southward. One tribe of the Oeridians, the Aerdi, began to set up an empire. Several centuries later, the Aerdi&#x27;s Great Kingdom ruled most of the Flanaess. The Aerdi overkings marked the beginning of what they believed would be perpetual peace with Year 1 of a new calendar, the Common Year (CY) Reckoning. However, several centuries later, the Empire became decadent, with their rulers losing their sanity, turning to evil, and enslaving their people. When the overking Ivid V came to the throne, the oppressed peoples rebelled.

It was at this point, in the year 576 CY, that Gygax set the world of Greyhawk. As Gygax wrote in his &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; folio: &quot;The current state of affairs in the Flanaess is confused indeed. Humankind is fragmented into isolationist realms, indifferent nations, evil lands, and states striving for good&quot;. Gygax did not issue monthly or yearly updates to the state of affairs as presented in the folio since he saw 576 CY as a common starting point for every home campaign; because each would be moving forward at its own pace, there would be no practical way to issue updates that would be relevant to every Dungeon Master.

Gygax was also aware that different players would be using his world for different reasons. When he was the Dungeon Master of his home campaign, he found that his players were more interested in dungeon-delving than politics, but when he switched roles and became a player, often going one-on-one with Rob Kuntz as Dungeon Master, Gygax immersed his own characters in politics and large-scale battles. Knowing that there would be some players looking for a town in which to base their campaign, and others interested in politics or warfare, Gygax tried to include as much detail as possible about each region, including a short description of the region and its people, the title of its ruler, the racial makeup of its people, its resources and major cities, and its allies and enemies.

For the same reason that he had created a variety of geographical, political and racial settings, he also strove to create a world with some good, some evil, and some undecided areas. He felt that some players would be happiest playing in a mainly good country and fighting the evil that arose to threaten it; others might want to be a part of an evil country; and still others might take a neutral stance and simply try to collect gold and treasure from both sides.

====Publication====

TSR originally intended to publish &quot;The World of Greyhawk&quot; (TSR 9025) early in 1979, but it was not released until August 1980. &quot;The World of Greyhawk&quot; consisted of a 32-page folio (the first edition is often called the &quot;World of Greyhawk folio&quot; to distinguish it from later editions) and a 34&quot; x 44&quot; (86 cm x 112 cm) two-piece color map of the Flanaess. Reviewers were generally impressed, but some remarked on the lack of a pantheon of Greyhawk-specific deities, as well as the lack of any mention of the infamous dungeons of Castle Greyhawk.

Game designer Jim Bambra found the original set &quot;disappointing&quot;, because &quot;there is only so much information you can cram into a 32-page booklet, particularly when covering such a large area&quot;.

===Between editions (1980–1983)===
Before the folio edition was released, Gygax planned to publish supplementary information, using his column &quot;From the Sorcerer&#x27;s Scroll&quot; that appeared on a semi-regular basis in TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot;.

In the May 1980 issue, Gygax gave a quick overview of the development of his new &quot;The World of Greyhawk&quot; folio. For players who planned to use large scale army tactics, he gave details of the private armies that were commanded by some prominent Greyhawk characters from his original home game: Bigby, Mordenkainen, Robilar, Tenser and Erac&#x27;s Cousin. Gygax also mentioned some of the planned Greyhawk publications he was overseeing: a large-scale map of the city of Greyhawk; some adventure modules set in Greyhawk; a supplementary map of lands outside the Flanaess; all fifty levels of Castle Greyhawk&#x27;s dungeon; and miniatures army combat rules. None of these projects, other than a few of the adventure modules, were published by TSR.

Although Gygax originally intended to immediately publish more details of Greyhawk in &quot;Dragon&quot; on a regular basis, other projects intervened, and it was not until the August 1981 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; that Len Lakofka, in his column &quot;Leomund&#x27;s Tiny Hut&quot;, outlined methods for determining a character&#x27;s place of birth and languages spoken. Gygax added an addendum concerning the physical appearances of the main Greyhawk races. In the November 1981 issue, Gygax gave further details of racial characteristics and modes of dress.

In the December 1982 issue, David Axler contributed a system for determining weather in the world of Greyhawk. Gygax later said he thought a system of fourteen charts for determining the weather was too cumbersome, and he personally did not use it in his home campaign.

====More information about every political region====
The folio edition had thirty two pages, and information about each region was condensed into a short paragraph or two. Gygax realized that some players needed more in-depth information about the motivations and aspirations of each region, and the history of interactions with surrounding regions. With this in mind, Gygax decided to publish a much longer description of each region in &quot;Dragon&quot;. The first two articles, covering seventeen regions, appeared in the December 1981 and January 1982 issues. Due to his involvement in many other TSR projects, Gygax handed responsibility for completion of this project to Rob Kuntz, who covered the remaining forty three regions in the March, July and September 1982 issues.

====Deities of Greyhawk====

In the August 1982 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Gygax gave advice on how to adapt deities from the previously published &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; for worship by non-human races in the Greyhawk world. A few months later, he published a five-part series of articles in the November 1982 through March 1983 issues of &quot;Dragon&quot; that outlined a pantheon of deities custom-made for humans in the world of Greyhawk. In addition to his original Greyhawk deities, St. Cuthbert and Pholtus, Gygax added seventeen more deities. Although later versions of the campaign setting would assign most of these deities to worship by specific races of humans, at this time they were generally worshiped by all humans of the Flanaess.

Shortly after the release of the folio edition, TSR released the adventure module C1 &quot;The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan&quot;, designed to familiarize players with the Olman race of the Amedio Jungle. Largely based on Aztec and Incan cultures, this adventure introduced the first published deities of the Greyhawk campaign: Mictlantecuhtli, god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld; Tezcatlipoca, god of sun, moon, night, scheming, betrayals and lightning; and Quetzalcoatl, god of air, birds and snakes. This area was further explored in &quot;The Scarlet Brotherhood&quot; (1999), which expanded the Olman pantheon, and newly introduced the Touv people, including their nine gods.

====Non-player characters of Greyhawk====

Also included in the March 1983 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; was an article detailing four unique Greyhawk characters. The first two &quot;quasi-deities&quot;—Heward and Keoghtom—had been created by Gygax as non-player characters (NPCs). The third, Murlynd, was a character that had been created by Gygax&#x27;s childhood friend Don Kaye before Kaye&#x27;s untimely death in 1975. The fourth, a &quot;hero-deity&quot; named Kelanen, was developed to illustrate the &quot;principle of advancement of power&quot;.

====TSR Greyhawk adventures published after the folio edition====
Of the ten adventures set in Greyhawk published by TSR before the folio edition, all but one had been written by Gygax. However, the new availability of information about Gygax&#x27;s campaign world and TSR&#x27;s desire to make it central to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; encouraged many new writers to set their adventures in Greyhawk. This, combined with the fact that Gygax was increasingly involved in other areas of the company, meant that of the seventeen Greyhawk adventures published in the two years after the folio edition, only four were written or co-written by Gygax:
* S3 &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1980)
* A1 &quot;Slave Pits of the Undercity&quot; (David Cook, 1980)
* A2 &quot;Secret of the Slavers&#x27; Stockade&quot; ( Harold Johnson &amp; Tom Moldvay, 1981)
* A3 &quot;Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords&quot; (Allen Hammack, 1981 )
* A4 &quot;In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords&quot; (Lawrence Schick, 1981)
* Q1 &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot; (David C. Sutherland III &amp; Gary Gygax, 1980)
* C1 &quot;The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan&quot; (Harold Johnson &amp; Jeff R. Leason, 1980)
* C2 &quot;The Ghost Tower of Inverness&quot; (Allen Hammack, 1980)
* I1 &quot;Dwellers of the Forbidden City&quot; (David Cook, 1981)
* L1 &quot;The Secret of Bone Hill&quot; (Lenard Lakofka, 1981)
* U1 &quot;Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh&quot; (Dave Browne &amp; Don Turnbull, 1981)
* U2 &quot;Danger at Dunwater&quot; (Dave Browne &amp; Don Turnbull, 1982)
* N1 &quot;Against the Cult of the Reptile God&quot; (Douglas Niles, 1982)
* WG4 &quot;The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1982)
* S4 &quot;Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1982) Originally published as &quot;Lost Caverns of Tsojconth &quot; in 1976
* U3 &quot;The Final Enemy&quot; (Dave Browne &amp; Don Turnbull, 1983)
* L2 &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Knot&quot; (Lenard Lakofka, 1983)

In 1981, TSR also published the &quot;super-modules&quot; D1-2 &quot;Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot; and G1-2-3 &quot;Against the Giants&quot;, both being compilations of previously published modules from the &quot;Drow&quot; series and the &quot;Giant&quot; series respectively.

Numerous projects were planned to add more depth and detail to the setting after the publication of the initial folio, but many of these projects never appeared for various reasons.

===&quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set (1983)===
In 1983, TSR published an expanded boxed set of the campaign world, &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot;, which is usually called the &quot;Greyhawk boxed set&quot; to differentiate it from other editions. According to game designer Jim Bambra, &quot;the second edition was much larger than the first and addressed itself to making the World of Greyhawk setting a more detailed and vibrant place&quot;. This edition quadrupled the number of pages from the original edition to 128, adding significantly greater detail. One major addition was a pantheon of deities: in addition to the nineteen deities outlined by Gygax in his &quot;Dragon&quot; article, another thirty-one new deities were added, though only three received full write-ups of their abilities and worshipers. This brought the number of Greyhawk deities to an even fifty. For the next eight years, Greyhawk would be primarily defined by the information in this publication.

===After publication of the boxed set (1984–1985)===
Publication of the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; was the first step in Gygax&#x27;s vision for Oerth. Over the next few years, he planned to unveil other areas of the continent of Oerik, giving each new area the same in-depth treatment of history, geography, and politics as had been accorded the Flanaess. Gygax had also mapped out the other hemisphere of Oerth in his personal notes. Part of this would be Gygax&#x27;s work, but Len Lakofka and François Froideval had also created material that Gygax wanted to place on Oerth. Frank Mentzer, Creative Consultant at TSR at the time, wrote four RPGA tournament adventures taken from his home campaign setting of &quot;Aquaria&quot; (published by TSR as the first four of the R-series modules: R1 &quot;To the Aid of Falx&quot;, R2 &quot;The Investigation of Hydell&quot;, R3 &quot;The Egg of the Phoenix&quot;, and R4 &quot;Doc&#x27;s Island&quot;). Mentzer envisioned them as the first part of a new &quot;Aqua-Oeridian&quot; campaign set somewhere on Oerth outside of the Flanaess.

However, by this time, Gygax was in Hollywood on a semi-permanent basis, approving scripts for the Saturday morning &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; cartoon series and trying to land a deal for a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; film. Not only was Gygax&#x27;s own output of Greyhawk-related materials greatly reduced, but the company began to shift its focus and resources away from Greyhawk to a new campaign setting called &quot;Dragonlance&quot;.

The success of the Dragonlance series of modules and books pushed aside the World of Greyhawk setting, as TSR concentrated on expanding and defining the world of Krynn. One of the factors that contributed to the success of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting when it was published in 1984 was a series of concurrent novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Gygax realized that novels set in Greyhawk could have a similar benefit for his campaign world and wrote &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;, the first in a series of novels that would be published under the banner &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot;. The protagonist was Gord the Rogue, and this first novel told of his rise from the Slum Quarters of the city of Greyhawk to become a world traveler and thief extraordinaire. The novel was designed to promote sales of the boxed set by providing colorful details about the social customs and peoples of various cities and countries around the Flanaess.

Before &quot;Saga of Old City&quot; was released in November 1985, Gygax wrote a sequel, &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot;. He also wrote a short story, &quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot;, that appeared in the special 100th issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; in August of the same year. This introduced Gord the Rogue to gamers just before &quot;Saga of Old City&quot; was scheduled to be released.

====Greyhawk modules====
In the two years after the Greyhawk boxed set appeared, TSR published eight adventures set in Greyhawk. Five were written or co-written by Gygax, and the other three were from TSR&#x27;s United Kingdom division:
* EX1 &quot;Dungeonland&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1983)
* EX2 &quot;Land Beyond the Magic Mirror&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1983)
Both of the EX adventures, although nominally set in Greyhawk, transported characters through a planar gate into an alternate reality.
* UK1 &quot;Beyond the Crystal Cave&quot; (Dave Brown, Tom Kirby &amp; Graeme Morris, 1983)
* UK2 &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (Graeme Morris, 1983)
* UK3 &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (Graeme Morris, 1984)
* WG5 &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Fantastic Adventure&quot; (Robert Kuntz &amp; Gary Gygax, 1984)
* WG6 &quot;Isle of the Ape&quot; (Gary Gygax, 1985)
* T1–4 &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; (Gary Gygax &amp; Frank Mentzer, 1985)

====&quot;Dragon&quot; articles====
From 1983 to 1985, the only notable supplement for the Greyhawk world was a five-part article by Len Lakofka in the June–October and December 1984 issues of &quot;Dragon&quot; that detailed the Suel gods who had been briefly mentioned in the boxed set. In the December 1984 issue, Gygax mentioned clerics of non-human races and indicated that the twenty four demihuman and humanoid deities that had been published in the February–June 1982 issues of &quot;Dragon&quot; were now permitted in Greyhawk; this increased the number of Greyhawk deities from fifty to seventy four.

Other than those articles, Greyhawk was only mentioned in passing in three other issues until Gygax&#x27;s &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; short story in the August 1985 issue &quot;Dragon&quot;. Gygax then provided some errata for the boxed set in the September 1985 issue, which was the last mention of the Greyhawk world in &quot;Dragon&quot; for almost two years.

====Gygax departs====
Shortly after the release of the boxed set, Gygax discovered that while he had been in Hollywood, TSR had run into serious financial difficulties. Returning to Lake Geneva, Gygax managed to get TSR back on firm financial footing, but different visions of TSR&#x27;s future caused a power struggle within the company, and Gygax was forced out of TSR on December 31, 1985.

===Greyhawk without Gygax (1986–1987)===
After Gygax left TSR, the continued development of Greyhawk became the work of many writers and creative minds. Rather than continuing forward with Gygax&#x27;s plan for an entire planet, the setting was never expanded beyond the Flanaess, nor would other authors&#x27; work be linked to unexplored areas of the continent Oerik. According to Gygax, TSR&#x27;s stewardship turned Greyhawk into something very different from what he had envisioned.

In 1986, in the months following Gygax&#x27;s ousting, TSR turned away from development of Greyhawk and focused its energies on a new campaign setting called &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. In 1986 and 1987, only three Greyhawk modules were released, A1-4 &quot;Scourge of the Slave Lords&quot;, S1-4 &quot;Realms of Horror&quot; and GDQ1-7 &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot;, all being collections of previously published modules rather than new material.

====Greyhawk novels continue without Gord the Rogue====
Gygax&#x27;s novel &quot;Saga of Old City&quot;, released in November 1985, and &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot;, released two months after Gygax&#x27;s departure from TSR, proved to be popular titles, and in 1987, TSR hired Rose Estes to continue the series, albeit without Gord the Rogue, to whom Gygax had retained all rights. From 1987 to 1989, Estes produced five more novels under the &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; banner: &quot;Master Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Price of Power&quot;, &quot;The Demon Hand&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, and &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot;. A sixth book, &quot;Dragon in Amber&quot;, appeared in 1990 book catalogs, but was never written, and the series was discontinued.

====The dungeons of Greyhawk revealed====
In its 1986 Summer Mail Order Hobby Shop catalog, TSR had listed a new Greyhawk adventure called WG7 &quot;Shadowlords&quot;, a high-level adventure to be written by Gary Gygax and Skip Williams. This adventure was canceled after Gygax left TSR, and the catalog number WG7 was reassigned to a new adventure, &quot;Castle Greyhawk&quot;, released in 1988. It was the first new Greyhawk adventure in three years, but it had nothing to do with Gygax&#x27;s original Castle Greyhawk. Instead, it was a compilation of twelve humorous dungeon levels, each one written by a freelance author. The puns and jokes often referenced modern culture—the Amazing Driderman, King Burger, Bugsbear Bunny, and the crew of &quot;Star Trek&quot;—and the module also included an appearance by Gygax&#x27;s Mordenkainen in a film studio.

===Greyhawk revived (1988–1990)===
By 1988, with the first series of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; adventures drawing to a close, and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; doing very well, TSR turned back to &quot;Greyhawk&quot;. In the January 1988 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Jim Ward - one of the original players in the dungeons of &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, creator of the wizard Drawmij, and now working for TSR in the post-Gygax era - requested player-input about what should be included in a hardcover sourcebook for &quot;Greyhawk&quot;. He received over five hundred letters in response. In the August 1988 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, he outlined the ideas from readers that had been included, and &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; appeared shortly afterward as a response to requests from &quot;Greyhawk&quot; fans. The book&#x27;s title was borrowed from Rose Estes&#x27;s &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; line of novels and used the same front-cover banner design. It was the thirteenth and final hardcover book published for the 1st edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules.

The contents were designed to give Dungeon Masters ideas and play-opportunities unique to the &quot;Greyhawk&quot; world, including new monsters, magical spells and items, a variety of geographical features, profiles of prominent citizens, and the avatars of deities. In the time since Gygax had left TSR, no original &quot;Greyhawk&quot; material had been published, and many letter-writers had requested ideas for new adventures. Ward responded by including six plot-outlines that could be inserted into a &quot;Greyhawk&quot; campaign.

====&quot;The City of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set====

The publication of &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; came just as TSR released the 2nd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. TSR released &quot;The City of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set in 1989 under the &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; banner. Written by Carl Sargent and Rik Rose, this was not the city created by Gygax and Kuntz, but a new plan built from references made in previously-published material.

This release remolded Gary Gygax&#x27;s old Circle of Eight into a new plot-device. Instead of a group of eight companions based in the Obsidian Citadel who left periodically to fight evil, the Circle became eight wizards led by a ninth wizard, Gygax&#x27;s former character Mordenkainen. In addition to Mordenkainen, seven of the wizards were previously existing characters from Gygax&#x27;s original home game: Bigby, Otiluke, Drawmij, Tenser, Nystul, Otto, and Rary. The eighth was new: the female wizard Jallarzi Sallavarian. The Circle&#x27;s mandate was to act as neutral referees between Good and Evil, never letting one side or the other gain the upper hand for long. In addition, Sargent and Rose took Gygax&#x27;s original Obsidian Citadel, re-purposed it as Mordenkainen&#x27;s castle, and placed it in an unspecified location in the Yatil Mountains.

The following year, in conjunction with this boxed set, TSR published a trilogy of &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; Adventure (WGA) modules by Richard and Anne Brown - WGA1 &quot;Falcon&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, WGA2 &quot;Falconmaster&quot;, and WGA3 &quot;Flames of the Falcon&quot; - set in the city, and centered on a mysterious villain called The Falcon. A fourth WGA module, WGA4 &quot;Vecna Lives!&quot; by David Cook, was published the same year, and featured the first appearance by Vecna, formerly a mythic lich in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; lore, now promoted to demigod-status.

====Modules released under the &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; banner====
TSR also released five new &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; (WG) adventures, which used the &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; banner:
* WG8 &quot;Fate of Istus&quot; (Various authors, 1989)
* WG9 &quot;Gargoyle&quot; (Dave Collins &amp; Skip Williams, 1989)
* WG10 &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (Jean Rabe &amp; Skip Williams, 1989)
* WG11 &quot;Puppets&quot; (Vince Garcia &amp; Bruce Rabe, 1989)
* WG12 &quot;Vale of the Mage&quot; (Jean Rabe, 1989)

In 1990, TSR also published WGR1 &quot;Greyhawk Ruins&quot;, a module and sourcebook about Castle Greyhawk by TSR writers Blake Mobley and Timothy Brown. Although this was not the Castle Greyhawk of Gygax and Kuntz, it was the first serious attempt to publish details of the castle.

===A new vision of the Flanaess (1991–1997)===
Game designer Rick Swan noted the apparent lack of a central vision for Greyhawk material, describing the Greyhawk setting up to this point as &quot;a crazy quilt, where odd-shaped scraps of material are randomly sewn together and everybody hopes for the best. How else to explain a setting that encompasses everything from the somber A1-4 &quot;Scourge of the Slave Lords&quot; adventure to the King Kong-inspired WG6 &quot;Isle of the Ape&quot; to the cornball humor of WG7 &quot;Castle Greyhawk&quot;? It makes for an interesting mess, but it&#x27;s a mess nonetheless... &quot;The City of Greyhawk&quot; [is] the most credible attempt at smoothing out the rough spots&quot;.

In 1990, TSR decided that the decade-old world of Greyhawk needed to be refreshed. Rather than follow through with Gary Gygax&#x27;s plan to develop new regions beyond the boundaries of the Flanaess, the decision was made to stay within the Flanaess and reinvigorate it by moving the campaign time line forward a decade, from 576 CY to 586 CY. The main story vehicle would be a war fomented by an evil half-demon named Iuz that involved the entire Flanaess, which would allow TSR to radically alter the pattern of regions, alliances, and rulers from Gygax&#x27;s original setting.

====The &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot;====
In order to move players from Gygax&#x27;s familiar &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; to their new vision, TSR planned a trilogy of modules that would familiarize players with events and conditions leading up to the coming war, and then take them through the war itself. Once players completed the war via the three modules, a new boxed set would be published to introduce the new storyline and the new Flanaess. Two &quot;World of Greyhawk Swords&quot; modules, WGS1 &quot;Five Shall Be One&quot; by Carl Sargent and WGS2 &quot;Howl from the North&quot; by Dale Henson, were released in 1991. These described events leading up to the war.

The third module was reworked into &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot;, a strategy war game that led players through the events, strategies, and alliances of the actual war. A booklet included with the game, &quot;Greyhawk Wars Adventurer&#x27;s Book&quot;, described the event of the war. In 582 CY (six years after Gygax&#x27;s original setting of 576 CY), a regional conflict started by Iuz gradually widened until it was a war that affected almost every nation in the Flanaess. A peace treaty was signed in the city of Greyhawk two years later, which is why the conflict became known as the &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot;. On the day of the treaty-signing, Rary—once a minor spellcaster created and then discarded by Brian Blume, but now elevated by TSR to the Circle of Eight—attacked his fellow Circle members, aided and abetted by Robilar. After the attack, Tenser and Otiluke were dead, while Robilar and Rary fled to the deserts of the Bright Lands. Rob Kuntz, original creator of Robilar, objected to this storyline, since he believed that Robilar would never attack his old adventuring companion Mordenkainen. Although Kuntz did not own the creative rights to Robilar and no longer worked at TSR, he unofficially suggested an alternate storyline that Robilar had been visiting another plane and in his absence, a clone or evil twin of Robilar was responsible for the attack.

====&quot;From the Ashes&quot;====
In 1992, after the two &quot;World of Greyhawk Swords&quot; prequel modules and the &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot; game had been on the market for some months, TSR released the new Greyhawk setting, &quot;From the Ashes&quot;, a boxed set primarily written by Carl Sargent that described the Flanaess in the aftermath of the &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot;. It contained a large 4-color hex map of the area around the city of Greyhawk; two full-color, 32&quot;x21&quot; fold-out poster maps of the continent (east and west), and 20 &quot;quick adventure cards&quot;, and two 96-page books.

The first book, &quot;Atlas of the Flanaess&quot;, was a replacement for Gygax&#x27;s original &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set, with some changes. Many human gods from previous editions were not included, although one new demigod, Mayaheine, was added. This had the net effect of reducing the total number of human deities from fifty to twenty-eight. Deities of other races were increased from twenty-four to thirty-eight, but unlike the full descriptions that were given to the human gods, these were simply listed by name. Like Gygax&#x27;s original boxed set, each region was given a two to three hundred word description, although some details included in the older edition, such as trade goods, total population and racial mixes, were not included in this edition. A number of regions—Ahlissa, Almor, Medegia and South Province—no longer existed after the Wars or had been folded into other regions. One new region—the Olman Islands—was detailed. This had the net effect of reducing the total number of regions from sixty to fifty eight. &#x27;s map of the Flanaess included in Gygax&#x27;s setting was reproduced as an 11&quot;x17&quot; black-and-white map printed on the inside cover of the &quot;Atlas&quot;.

The second book, the &quot;Campaign Book&quot;, was designed to supplement, rather than replace, the four-year-old &quot;City of Greyhawk&quot; boxed set. It included updates to the city and its environs, and gave details of some new non-player characters and possible adventure hooks.

In Gygax&#x27;s setting, the major conflict had been between the Great Kingdom and the lands that were trying to free themselves from the evil overking. In Sargent&#x27;s world, the Great Kingdom storyline was largely replaced by the major new conflict between the land of Iuz and the regions that surrounded it. Southern lands outside of Iuz&#x27;s were threatened by the Scarlet Brotherhood, while other countries had been invaded by monsters or taken over by agents of evil. Overall, the vision was of a darker world where good folk were being swamped by a tide of evil.

Game designer Rick Swan concurred with this multi-step approach, writing that &quot;Greyhawk Wars&quot; &quot;took another step in the right direction by shaking things up with a much-needed dose of epic conflict... veteran designer Carl Sargent has continued the overhaul with the ambitious &quot;From the Ashes&quot;. By combining heroic tradition with elements of dark fantasy, he&#x27;s come up with a Greyhawk campaign that is both familiar and refreshingly unexpected&quot;.

Sargent tried to generate interest for this grimmer vision of the Flanaess by following up with an article in &quot;Dragon&quot;&#x27;s March 1993 issue, writing, &quot;...the powers of evil have waxed strong. The hand of Iuz, the Old One, extends across the central Flanaess, and the cruel Scarlet Brotherhood extends its power and influence around the southern lands bordering the Azure Sea. The &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; setting has become a truly exciting world again...&quot;

The boxed set was supported by the publication of two new source books in 1993, also written by Sargent. WGR4 &quot;The Marklands&quot; provided information about the good realms of Furyondy, Highfolk, and Nyrond that opposed Iuz, while WGR5 &quot;Iuz the Evil&quot; detailed information about the lands of Iuz, and emphasized the prominent new role that Iuz now played in the world order.

In addition, a number of adventures were also published, as much to provide more source material as for adventure:
* WGQ1 &quot;Patriots of Ulek&quot; was the first module published after &quot;From the Ashes&quot;, and advanced the storyline in Ulek, threatened by invasion from Turrosh Mak of the Pomarj.
* WGR2 &quot;Treasures of Greyhawk&quot;, by Jack Barker, Roy Rowe, Louis Prosperi, and Tom Prusa, was a loosely connected series of mini-adventures—for instance, exploring Bigby&#x27;s home, travelling to the demiplane called The Great Maze of Zagyg, and trading riddles with a sphinx. Each mini-adventure focussed on a unique treasure in the Flanaess.
* WGR3 &quot;Rary the Traitor&quot; by Anthony Pryor was both an adventure module and a source book about the Bright Lands, the new home of Rary and Robilar following their murder of Tenser and Otiluke.
* WGR6 &quot;The City of Skulls&quot;, by Carl Sargent, and WGM1 &quot;Border Watch&quot;, by Paul T. Riegel, were modules highlighting the struggle between Furyondy and the lands of Iuz.

As Gygax had done ten years before, Sargent also used the pages of &quot;Dragon&quot; to promote his new world. He was working on a new source book, &quot;Ivid the Undying&quot;, and excerpted parts of it in the April, June and August 1994 issues.

====TSR drops Greyhawk====
In late 1994, TSR canceled Sargent&#x27;s new book just as it was being readied for publication, and stopped work on all other Greyhawk projects. Nothing more about Greyhawk was ever published by TSR, with one exception: in May 1995, a &quot;Dragon&quot; column devoted to industry gossip noted that the manuscript of &quot;Ivid the Undying&quot; had been released by TSR as a computer text file. Using this file, several people have reconstructed the book as it might have appeared in published form.

By the end of 1996, TSR found itself heavily in debt and unable to pay its printers. Just as bankruptcy in 1997 seemed inevitable, Wizards of the Coast stepped in and, fueled by income from its collectible card game &quot;&quot;, bought TSR and all its properties.

===Wizards of the Coast (1998–2008)===
After Wizards of the Coast (WotC) and TSR merged, the determination was made that TSR had created too many settings for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, and several of them were eliminated. However, WotC&#x27;s CEO, Peter Adkison, was a fan of both &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and Greyhawk, and two major initiatives were created: a revival of Greyhawk, and a new third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. A team of people was put together to revive the moribund Greyhawk setting by pulling together all the previously published information about it. Once that was done, the decision was made to update Carl Sargent&#x27;s storyline, using similar prequel adventures to pave the way for the updated campaign setting.

First, Roger E. Moore created &quot;Return of the Eight&quot; in 1998. In the adventure, set in 586 CY, the same year as the &quot;From the Ashes&quot; boxed set, the players meet the surviving members of the Circle of Eight, which is called the Circle of Five because it is missing Tenser, Otiluke and Rary. If the players successfully finish the adventure, Tenser is rescued from death, though he refuses to rejoin the Circle, and the Circle is reconstituted as Eight with the addition of three new wizards: Alhamazad the Wise, Theodain Eriason and Warnes Starcoat.

Next, the &quot;Greyhawk Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;, by Anne Brown, was released. This 64-page booklet moved the storyline ahead five years to 591 CY, and it mostly condensed and reiterated material that had been released in Gygax&#x27;s and Sargent&#x27;s boxed sets. New material included important non-player characters, a guide to roleplaying in the Flanaess, and some new sights. The list of deities was both shrunk and expanded; the thirty-eight non-human deities in the &quot;From the Ashes&quot; boxed set were eliminated and non-human concerns assigned to a handful of human deities, but the list of human deities was expanded from twenty-four to fifty-four.

With the groundwork for a new storyline prepared, TSR/WotC released the new campaign setting as a 128-page source book, &quot;The Adventure Begins&quot;, by Roger E. Moore. Taking its lead from the &quot;Greyhawk Player&#x27;s Guide&quot;, the new campaign world was set in 591 CY. Unlike the darker feel of &quot;From the Ashes&quot;, where the Flanaess was overrun by evil, Moore returned to Gygax&#x27;s world of adventure.

The &quot;Lost Tombs&quot; trilogy of modules—&quot;The Star Cairns&quot; and &quot;Crypt of Lyzandred the Mad&quot;, by Sean K. Reynolds, and &quot;The Doomgrinder&quot;, by Steve Miller—were the first to be published in the new setting.

====&quot;25th anniversary of D&amp;D&quot;====
The year 1999 marked twenty-five years since the publication of the original &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules, and WotC sought to lure older gamers back to Greyhawk by producing a series of nostalgia-tinged &quot;Return to...&quot; adventures that evoked the best-known Greyhawk modules from 20 years before, under the banner &quot;25th Anniversary of D&amp;D&quot;:
* &quot;Return to the Tomb of Horrors&quot;, by Bruce R. Cordell, reprinted Gary Gygax&#x27;s S1 &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, and added a substantial expansion.
* &quot;Return to the Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, by John D. Rateliff, took Gary Gygax&#x27;s 1979 module, B2 &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; and restocked it with fresh monsters, as if the twenty years that had passed since the original module&#x27;s publication also equaled twenty years of game time. Although the original had been in a generic setting, the new adventure set the Keep in Greyhawk.
* &quot;Return to White Plume Mountain&quot;, by Bruce R. Cordell, likewise updated Lawrence Schick&#x27;s twenty-year-old adventure, &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, by advancing the storyline twenty years.
* &quot;Against the Giants: The Liberation of Geoff&quot;, by Sean K. Reynolds, included the full text of Gygax&#x27;s three original 1979 &quot;Giant&quot; modules and details of eighteen new adventure sites in Geoff, linked together as an integrated campaign.
* &quot;Slavers&quot; by Sean K. Reynolds and Chris Pramas, was a sequel to the original A1-4 &quot;Scourge of the Slavelords&quot; series, set ten years after the original adventures.
* &quot;Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, by Monte Cook, returned the players to Gygax&#x27;s infamous temple, which Rob Kuntz (as Robilar) had originally looted and wrecked. It was published in 2001, using the 3rd edition rules.

In conjunction with the publication of the &quot;Return to&quot; adventures, WotC also produced a series of companion novels known as the &quot;Greyhawk Classics&quot; series: &quot;Against the Giants&quot;, &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, &quot;Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Expedition to the Barrier Peaks&quot;, &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot;, &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot;, and &quot;The Tomb of Horrors&quot;.

In an attempt to attract players of other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings, WotC released &quot;Die, Vecna, Die!&quot;, by Bruce R. Cordell and Steve Miller, a three-part adventure tying Greyhawk to the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Planescape&quot; campaign settings. Published in 2000, it was the last adventure to be written for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s 2nd edition rules.

====Third edition (2000–2008)====
In the editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; published by TSR, the setting of the game had not been specifically defined—Dungeon Masters were expected to either create a new world, or purchase a commercial campaign setting such as Greyhawk or &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. In 2000, after two years of work and playtesting, WotC released the 3rd edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, and defined a default setting for the game for the first time. Under third edition rules, unless a Dungeon Master specifically chose to use a different campaign setting, his or her &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game would be set in the world of Greyhawk.

====&quot;Living Greyhawk&quot;====
With the release of the 3rd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, RPGA—the organized play division of WotC—announced a new massively shared living campaign, &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot;, modeled on a 2nd edition campaign called &quot;Living City&quot;. Although &quot;Living City&quot; was relatively successful, RPGA wanted to expand the scope of their new campaign—instead of one city as a setting, the new campaign would involve thirty different regions of Greyhawk, each specifically keyed to a particular country, state, or province of the real world. Each region would produce its own adventures, and in addition to these, RPGA would provide worldwide &quot;Core&quot; adventures. To provide the level of detail needed for such a venture, WotC published the &quot;Living Greyhawk Gazetteer&quot;, the most in-depth examination of the world of Greyhawk ever produced, and the official starting point for not only the campaign, but also for all home campaigns from that point forward.

Concurrent with the release of the 3rd edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; debuted at Gen Con 2000 with three &quot;Core&quot; adventures: COR1-1 &quot;Dragon Scales at Morningtide&quot;, by Sean K. Reynolds; COR1-2 &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, by Sean Flaherty and John Richardson; and COR1-3 &quot;River Of Blood&quot;, by Erik Mona. WotC also released &quot;The Fright at Tristor&quot; by Keith Polster (2000), designed as an introductory adventure to the Living Greyhawk campaign world.

Unlike previous campaign settings, in which the calendar was frozen at a point chosen by the author, the &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; calendar did advance one year in game time for every calendar year in real time: the campaign started in 591 CY (2001) and ended in 598 CY (2008), at which point over a thousand adventures had been produced for an audience of over ten thousand players. During this time, the campaign administrators incorporated most of WotC&#x27;s new rules into the Greyhawk world, only excising material they felt would unbalance the campaign. In 2005, the administrators incorporated every deity ever mentioned in official Greyhawk material previous to the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd edition, as well as all deities mentioned in the new 3rd edition source books. This tripled the number of deities in the campaign from about seventy to almost two hundred.

Despite the massive amount of world and storyline development, none of the &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; storylines or changes to the setting were considered official, since the regional adventure modules were produced by volunteers; this material only received a cursory vetting by RPGA campaign administrators, and no review by WotC personnel.

====Wizards of the Coast Greyhawk releases====
Despite the popularity of the &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; campaign, Wizards of the Coast did not produce much material for Greyhawk after the 25th anniversary &quot;Return to...&quot; series of adventures and the &quot;Living Greyhawk Gazetteer&quot;:
* &quot;The Standing Stone&quot;, written by John D. Rateliff (2001), had several minor references to the Greyhawk setting.
* &quot;Red Hand of Doom&quot;, written by James Jacob (2006), was not set in a specific campaign world, but did contain instructions for where to set the adventure within Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, and Eberron. 
* &quot;Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk&quot; by Erik Mona, James Jacobs, and Jason Bulmahn (2007), was an update to TSR&#x27;s 1990 release WGR1 &quot;Greyhawk Ruins&quot;. 

Otherwise, Wizards of the Coast left the development of the Greyhawk world to RPGA&#x27;s &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; campaign and concentrated on producing new source books of expansion material for the core rules of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

===Fourth and fifth edition of D&amp;D (2008 to present)===
====Fourth edition====
At Gen Con 2007, WotC announced that the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; would be released the following spring, and Greyhawk would no longer be the default campaign setting under the new rules system. For this reason, &quot;Living Greyhawk&quot; was not converted to the new rules system; instead, it was brought to a conclusion at Origins 2008.

In 2009, WotC released &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot;, by Andy Collins, which updated Gary Gygax&#x27;s original 1st edition &quot;Village of Hommlet&quot; to the 4th edition rules for characters of 4th level. It was not available for purchase, but was sent as a reward for those who joined the RPGA. In March 2013 the adventure by Collins was reprinted in issue 212 of &quot;Dungeon&quot;, but now for characters of 3rd to 5th level.

====Fifth edition====
When the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for the fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released in 2014, several references to the world of Greyhawk appeared throughout the descriptions of various races and classes, and a partial list of Greyhawk deities appeared in the book. The &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, the second released book of the 5th edition, did not include any direct references to Greyhawk but did mention Explictica Defilus from &quot;Against the Cult of the Reptile God&quot; in the Naga entry, and tied the creation of ghouls to Doresain, the &quot;King of Ghouls&quot;, from the Greyhawk adventure &quot;Kingdom of the Ghouls&quot; by Wolfgang Baur from &quot;Dungeon&quot; #70.

In April 2017, &quot;Tales from the Yawning Portal&quot; was released. It contained seven older modules now reprinted and updated for the fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Four out of the seven were old Greyhawk modules: &quot;Against the Giants&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot;, and &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;. In addition the book also featured advice how to place the other adventures within the Greyhawk setting, or how to change the name-giving tavern Yawning Portal in Waterdeep from the Forgotten Realms into the Green Dragon Inn from the City of Greyhawk.

In May 2019, &quot;Ghosts of Saltmarsh&quot; was released for the fifth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The book compiles new versions of classic adventures that are located around Saltmarsh in Greyhawk (&quot;The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh&quot;, &quot;Danger at Dunwater&quot;, and &quot;The Final Enemy&quot;), or are generally naval themed.

In May 2024, it was announced that the updated &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; would feature Greyhawk as a sample campaign setting, and that prominent characters from the Greyhawk campaign setting would feature heavily in the art of all three updated core rulebooks.

==Unofficial Greyhawk sources==
Although TSR and WotC had each in turn owned the official rights to the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; since the first folio edition was published in 1980, the two people most responsible for its early development, Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz, still had most of their original notes regarding the fifty levels of dungeons under Castle Greyhawk. Gygax also had his old maps of the city of Greyhawk, and still owned the rights to Gord the Rogue.

After Gygax left TSR in 1985, he continued to write a few more &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; novels, which were published by New Infinities Productions: &quot;Sea of Death&quot; (1987), &quot;City of Hawks&quot; (1987), and &quot;Come Endless Darkness&quot; (1988). However, by this time, Gygax was furious with the new direction in which TSR was taking &quot;his&quot; world. In a literary declaration that his old world of Oerth was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk, Gygax destroyed his version of Oerth in the final &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; novel, &quot;Dance of Demons&quot;. For the next fifteen years, he worked to develop other game systems.

But there was still the matter of the unpublished dungeons under Castle Greyhawk. Although Gygax had given glimpses into the dungeons in his magazine columns and articles, the dungeons themselves had never been released to the public. Likewise, Gygax&#x27;s version of the city of Greyhawk had never been published, although Frank Mentzer believed the reason for that was because &quot;the City of Greyhawk was a later development, originally being but a location (albeit a capital). As such it was never fleshed out all that thoroughly... notes on certain locations and notorious personnel, a sketch map of great brevity, and otherwise quite loose. That is doubtless why Gary didn&#x27;t publish it; it had never been completed&quot;.

However, in 2003, Gygax announced that he was working with Rob Kuntz to publish the original castle and city in six volumes, although the project would use the rules for &quot;Castles and Crusades&quot; rather than &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Since WotC still owned the rights to the name Greyhawk, Gygax changed the name of the castle to &quot;Castle Zagyg&quot;—the reverse homophone of his own name originally ascribed to the mad architect of his original thirteen level dungeon. Gygax also changed the name of the nearby city to &quot;Yggsburgh&quot;, a play on his initials E.G.G.

This project proved to be much more work than Gygax and Kuntz had envisioned. By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on the original home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed fifty levels of maze-like passages and thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, were found to be too much to fit into the proposed six volumes. Gygax decided he would recreate something like his original thirteen level dungeon, amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes. Neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions as they went, they usually just drew a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps. These sketchy maps contained just enough detail so that the two could combine their independent efforts, after determining the merits of each piece. Recreating the city was also a challenge; although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while maintaining the look and feel of his original.

The slow and laborious process came to a complete halt in April 2004, when Gygax suffered a serious stroke. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from fourteen-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Kuntz had to withdraw due to other projects, although he continued to work on an adventure module that would be published at the same time as the first book. Under these circumstances, work on the Castle Zagyg project continued even more slowly, although Jeffrey Talanian stepped in to help Gygax. In 2005, Troll Lord Games published Volume I, &quot;Castle Zagyg: Yggsburgh&quot;. This 256-page hardcover book contained details of Gygax&#x27;s original city, its personalities and politics, as well as over thirty encounters outside the city. The two part fold out map of the area was rendered by Darlene Pekul, the same artist who had produced the original map for the folio edition of &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot;. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published &quot;Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau&quot;, an adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz.

Book catalogs published in 2005 indicated several more volumes in the series would follow shortly, but it was not until 2008 that the second volume, &quot;Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works&quot;, appeared. &quot;The Upper Works&quot; described details of the castle above ground, acting as a teaser for the volumes concerning the actual dungeons that would follow. However, Gygax died in March 2008 before any further books were published. After his death, Gygax Games, under the control of Gary&#x27;s widow Gail, took over the project, but no more volumes of the &quot;Castle Zagyg&quot; project have been published.

Rob Kuntz also published some of his creative work from the Castle Greyhawk dungeons. In 2008, he released the adventure modules &quot;The Living Room&quot;, about a whimsical but dangerous room that housed enormous furniture, and &quot;Bottle City&quot;, about a bottle found on the second level of the dungeon that contained an entire city. 2009 saw Kuntz release &quot;Daemonic &amp; Arcane&quot;, a collection of Greyhawk and &quot;Kalibruhn&quot; magic items, and &quot;The Stalk&quot;, a wilderness adventure. By October 2010, Black Blade Publishing began to publish several of Kuntz&#x27;s original Greyhawk levels, including the Machine Level, the Boreal Level, the Giants&#x27; Pool Hall, and the Garden of the Plantmaster.

<text>Forgotten Realms is a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game. Commonly referred to by players and game designers as &quot;The Realms&quot;, it was created by game designer Ed Greenwood around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories. Several years later, it was published for the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game as a series of magazine articles, and the first Realms game products were released in 1987. Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since, in addition to novels, role-playing video game adaptations (including the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game to use graphics), comic books, and the film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;.

Forgotten Realms is a fantasy world setting, described as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real. The premise is that, long ago, planet Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed, the inhabitants of Earth had mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world – hence the name Forgotten Realms. The original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, had small runic letters that read &quot;Herein lie the lost lands&quot; as an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.

Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings, largely due to the success of novels by authors such as R. A. Salvatore and numerous role-playing video games, including &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; (1988), &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; (1991), &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; (2000), the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series.

== Creative origins ==
Ed Greenwood began writing stories about the Forgotten Realms as a child, starting at the age of eight. He came up with the name from the notion of a multiverse of parallel worlds; Earth is one such world, and the Realms another. In Greenwood&#x27;s original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world that can no longer be accessed. Greenwood discovered the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) game releases in 1978. Greenwood brought his fantasy world into the new medium of role-playing games when a university student named September invited him to play &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; with her. Greenwood then starting using the setting for his personal role-playing campaign. Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep before creating a group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Shadowdale region. Greenwood felt that his players&#x27; thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: &quot;They want it to seem real, and work on &#x27;honest jobs&#x27; and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves.&quot; Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.

Starting in 1979, Greenwood published a series of articles that detailed the setting in &quot;The Dragon&quot; (later &quot;Dragon&quot;) magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the &quot;curst&quot;. Greenwood continued to write extensive articles for &quot;Dragon&quot;, in which he used the Forgotten Realms as the setting to detail magic items, monsters, and spells. When Gary Gygax &quot;lost control of TSR in 1985, the company saw an opportunity to move beyond Greyhawk and introduce a new default setting&quot;. In 1986, TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in &quot;Dragon&quot;.

Greenwood states that Grubb asked him &quot;Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?&quot;, and Greenwood answered &quot;yes&quot; to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than its epic fantasy counterpart Dragonlance, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project and began working to get Forgotten Realms officially published. He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the setting for a token fee. He noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that could be accessed from Earth, as &quot;[c]oncerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to &#x27;find a gate&#x27;) led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning&quot;.

Jon Peterson, author of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History&quot;, said that Greenwood &quot;was that rare obsessive DM who just seemed to have more ideas and energy to pour into his world than even the folks at TSR did. Naturally when TSR was shopping for new campaign worlds as part of their cross-media strategy, they had to get the Forgotten Realms. R. A. Salvatore took Greenwood&#x27;s world and created characters and stories for it that made him a bestselling author and sustained TSR as a major fantasy book publisher&quot;.

== Publication history ==
=== 1985–1990 ===
In 1985, the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; module &quot;Bloodstone Pass&quot; was released by TSR and is retroactively considered to be a part of the Forgotten Realms, although it was not until the module &quot;The Bloodstone Wars&quot; was released that it became the official setting for the module series. Douglas Niles had worked on a novel trilogy with a Celtic theme, which were then altered to become the first novels set in the Forgotten Realms, starting with &quot;Darkwalker on Moonshae&quot; (1987). It is the first book in &quot;The Moonshae Trilogy&quot;, which predates the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot; by one month.

The &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot; was later released in 1987 as a boxed set of two source books (&quot;Cyclopedia of the Realms&quot; and &quot;DM&#x27;s Sourcebook of the Realms&quot;) and four large color maps, designed by Greenwood in collaboration with Grubb. It sold &quot;ca.&quot; one hundred fifty thousand times in its first two years. The set introduced the campaign setting and explained how to use it, and reserved space on the map for SSI&#x27;s Gold Box computer role-playing games set in the Forgotten Realms.

TSR began incorporating elements by other designers into the Forgotten Realms, including the Moonshae Isles by Douglas Niles, the &quot;Desert of Desolation&quot; by Tracy Hickman and Laura Hickman, and Kara-Tur by Zeb Cook. The setting also provided a new way for TSR to market its &quot;Battlesystem&quot; rules, which it had supported with the Bloodstone adventure sequence which started with &quot;Bloodstone Pass&quot;; the last two adventures in the series, &quot;The Bloodstone Wars&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Throne of Bloodstone&quot; (1988), were unambiguously set in the Forgotten Realms. Some characters from &quot;Egg of the Phoenix&quot; (1987) by Frank Mentzer were incorporated into &quot;The Savage Frontier&quot; (1988).

The compilation module &quot;Desert of Desolation&quot; reworked the previous adventures to fit as part of the Forgotten Realms. The module &quot;Under Illefarn&quot; published in 1987 is set in the Forgotten Realms, as is the module released in 1988, &quot;Swords of the Iron Legion&quot;.

R. A. Salvatore wrote his first novel for the Forgotten Realms, &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (1988), which was originally set in the Moonshae Islands before being moved to a new location and introduced the drow character Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden. Drizzt has since appeared in more than seventeen subsequent novels, many of which have appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. In 1988, the first in a line of Forgotten Realms role-playing video games, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, was released by Strategic Simulations, Inc. The game was popular and won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988&quot;.

Several supplements to the original boxed set were released under the first edition rules, beginning with &quot;Waterdeep and the North&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Moonshae&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Empires of the Sands&quot;, &quot;The Magister&quot;, &quot;The Savage Frontier&quot;, &quot;Dreams of the Red Wizards&quot;, and &quot;Lords of Darkness&quot; in 1988. The &quot;City System&quot; boxed set was released in 1988, and it contained several maps of the city of Waterdeep. &quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot;, a module based on the computer game &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, was also released in 1988.

The boxed set &quot;Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms&quot; was released in 1988. It gives details of the lands of Kara-Tur, and was designed to be used with the 1986 book &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot;, which officially placed the book in the Forgotten Realms world.

In 1989, DC Comics began publishing a series of Forgotten Realms comics written by Grubb. Each issue contains twenty-six pages, illustrated primarily by Rags Morales and Dave Simons. Twenty-five issues were published in total, with the last being released in 1991. A fifty-six page annual &quot;Forgotten Realms Comic Annual #1: Waterdhavian Nights&quot;, illustrated by various artists, was released in 1990.

&quot;Curse of the Azure Bonds&quot;, a module based on the role-playing video game of the same name, was released in 1989.

=== 1990–2000 ===
To transition the Forgotten Realms from first edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; to the ruleset&#x27;s second edition, a story involving the gods being cast down was planned by TSR management from the top-down and started with &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot; (1989) and continued with a three-adventure &quot;Avatar&quot; series (1989) and a three-novel &quot;Avatar&quot; series (1989), and some stories in the comic book. TSR adjusted the timeline of the Forgotten Realms by advancing the calendar one year forward to 1358 DR, referring to the gap as the Time of Troubles.

In early 1990, the hardcover &quot;Forgotten Realms Adventures&quot; by Grubb and Greenwood was released, which introduced the setting to &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition; the book also detailed how the Time of Troubles had changed the setting. &quot;The Ruins of Undermountain&quot; (1991) was one of the first published mega-dungeons. The Al-Qadim setting by Jeff Grubb was released in 1992, and the setting was added to the southern part of the Forgotten Realms. In July 1990, the RPGA Network&#x27;s &quot;Polyhedron Newszine&quot; began publishing a monthly column by Greenwood entitled &quot;The Everwinking Eye&quot; detailing various locations and personalities in the Realms. The Network used the Forgotten Realms city of Ravens Bluff as the setting for their first living campaign. Official RPGA support for this product line included the &quot;Living City&quot; module series. A number of sub-settings of the Forgotten Realms were briefly supported in the early 1990s. Three more modules were produced for the Kara-Tur setting. &quot;The Horde&quot; boxed set, released in 1990, detailed the Hordelands, which featured a series of three modules. The &quot;Maztica Campaign Set&quot;, released in 1991, detailed the continent of Maztica.

The original gray boxed set was revised in 1993 to update it to &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition, with the release of a new &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; boxed set containing three books (&quot;A Grand Tour of the Realms&quot;, &quot;Running the Realms&quot;, and &quot;Shadowdale&quot;) and various &quot;monster supplements&quot;. Additional material for the setting was released steadily throughout the 1990s. Forgotten Realms novels, such as the &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series, the first three books of &quot;The Elminster Series&quot;, and numerous anthologies were also released throughout the 1990s, which led to the setting being hailed as one of the most successful shared fantasy universes of the 1990s. By the first quarter of 1996, TSR had published sixty-four novels set in the Forgotten Realms out of the 242 novels set in &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; worlds. These novels in turn sparked interest in role-playing by new gamers.

Numerous Forgotten Realms video games were released between 1990 and 2000. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; for MS-DOS was released in 1990, which was followed by two sequels: the first in 1991, and the second in 1992. All three games were re-released for MS-DOS compatible operating systems on a single disk in 1995. Another 1991 release was &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; on America Online, the first graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). In 1998, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the first in a line of popular role-playing video games developed by BioWare and &quot;considered by most pundits as the hands-down best PC roleplaying game ever&quot;, was released. The game was followed by a sequel, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, in 2000 and &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, a separate game that utilized the same game engine as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;. &quot;Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor&quot; was released in 2001. Several popular Forgotten Realms characters such as Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden and Elminster made minor appearances in these games.

=== 2000–2008 ===
When Wizards of the Coast took over publication of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; after purchasing TSR in 1997, they trimmed production down from six campaign settings to &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; and &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, and completed &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition production sometime between 1998 and 1999. They later hired Rob Heinsoo to be part of the D&amp;D Worlds team and focus on Forgotten Realms in the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. An official material update and a timeline advance were introduced to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition in 2001 with the release of the hardcover book the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot;, which won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Role-Playing Game Supplement of 2001&quot; in 2002. The timeline was officially advanced from 1358 DR to 1372 DR. The adventure &quot;City of the Spider Queen&quot; (2002) did not meet its projected sales targets, so Wizards of the Coast cut back on production of new adventures.

In 2002, BioWare released &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, set in the northern reaches of Faerûn and operating on the revised 3.0 rules for D&amp;D. It was followed by two expansion packs: &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot; and &quot;Hordes of the Underdark&quot;. A sequel using version 3.5 of the rules was produced by Obsidian Entertainment in 2006, and was followed by the expansion sets &quot;Mask of the Betrayer&quot; and &quot;Storm of Zehir&quot;. The &quot;Forgotten Realms Deluxe Edition&quot; compilation was released in 2006, containing the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series (excluding the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; games), &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; series, and all &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; games before &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;.

=== 2008–2014 ===
With the release of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition in 2008, Wizards opted for a publishing plan featuring a series of six books per year – consisting of three core rulebooks as well as three setting books – beginning with the Forgotten Realms. The company started the cycle with the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide&quot; (2008), the &quot;Forgotten Realms Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2008), and &quot;Scepter Tower of Spellgard&quot;. These books updated the Forgotten Realms to the newest rules system which altered the setting drastically to make it fit with the 4th edition concept of &quot;Points of Light&quot;.

The main lore change centered around an event called the Spellplague in 1385 DR. This cataclysm was unleashed when the goddess of magic Mystra was killed, &quot;transforming whole nations and altering creatures. In addition, parts of Toril have fused with its long-lost twin world Abeir, whisking away some countries and adding new ones. The Underdark is more open to the surface. Thay has become a nightmare land of death and the Elves, sensing the newfound connection to the Feywild, have returned to Faerûn in force&quot;. The event moved the fictional world&#x27;s timeline 94 years into the future to 1479 DR. The Spellplague acted as &quot;a narrative justification for design changes&quot;.

In 2008, the Forgotten Realms also became the setting for the RPGA&#x27;s sole living campaign, Living Forgotten Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk.

In 2011, the &quot;Neverwinter Campaign Setting&quot; was released which launched the 4th edition&#x27;s first major multimedia release. The Forgotten Realms city setting spawned four novels by R. A. Salvatore called the Neverwinter Saga, a comic book, and a board game called &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot;, as well as two video games – the Facebook game &quot;Heroes of Neverwinter&quot; (2011–2012) and a MMORPG called &quot;Neverwinter&quot; (2013). Laura Tommervik, from the Wizards of the Coast marketing team, explained the approach: &quot;We use Neverwinter as the connective tissue across multiple product categories. The transmedia campaign is an opportunity for fans to experience the brand however they choose to&quot;.

In 2013, Wizards of the Coast announced a year-long event called the Sundering which acted as a multimedia project to transition the Forgotten Realms to the next edition of the game. This release included a weekly D&amp;D Encounters in-store play event, a free-to-play mobile game &quot;Arena of War&quot; (2013), and a collaborative novel series: &quot;The Companions&quot; (2013) by R. A. Salvatore, &quot;The Godborn&quot; (2013) by Paul S. Kemp, &quot;The Adversary&quot; (2013) by Erin Evans, &quot;The Reaver&quot; (2014) by Richard Lee Byers, &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (2014) by Troy Denning, and &quot;The Herald&quot; (2014) by Ed Greenwood. Liz Schuh, Head of Publishing and Licensing for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, said:The Sundering is the last of a series of ground-shaking events. It really affects the whole world of the Forgotten Realms in a major way. You may remember when the Spell Plagues began, the two worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Abeir and Toril, crashed together. That created both geographic changes (the map of the Forgotten Realms and Faerûn actually changed due to that collision), and also changed the way magic works. It changed the pantheon of the gods. The Sundering is all about those two worlds separating—coming apart—and the process of that separation is really the story that we&#x27;re telling over the next year. At the end of this story arc, Abeir and Toril will be separate again, and many of the things that happened when they crashed together will go back to the way they were before. So magic will be much like it was before the Spell Plague. Markings that marked spell-plagued people and animals will fade and go away. It&#x27;s really about moving the Forgotten Realms forward, but also about bringing it around to the most beloved and most fondly remembered Forgotten Realms. The result of The Second Sundering, in game terms, was the transition from 4th edition rules to 5th edition rules of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, published in 2014.

=== 2014–present ===
When &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 5th edition was published in 2014, Wizards of the Coast announced that the Forgotten Realms would continue to serve as the official campaign setting for its upcoming published adventure materials. The village of Phandalin in the Forgotten Realms acted as the primary setting for the new 5th edition &quot;Starter Set&quot; (2014) which was published before the release of three new core rulebooks. &quot;Tyranny of Dragons&quot; was the first multimedia storyline for the new edition and included two adventure modules, &quot;Hoard of the Dragon Queen&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Rise of Tiamat&quot; (2014), and an update to the &quot;Neverwinter&quot; (2013) video game. The next two storylines, &quot;Elemental Evil&quot; which included &quot;Princes of the Apocalypse&quot; (2015) and &quot;Rage of Demons&quot; which included &quot;Out of the Abyss&quot; (2015), were also set in the Forgotten Realms.

The first campaign guide for the new edition, the &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2015), was released on November 3, 2015, and only covered a fraction of the Forgotten Realms. It describes the 2013 Sundering event, referred to as the Second Sundering in the book, and its consequences in game terms and lore. The video game &quot;Sword Coast Legends&quot; (2015) published by Digital Extremes was also released in the same month as the tabletop campaign guide.

5th edition details on &quot;the rest of Faerûn had been untouched until the &quot;Tomb of Annihilation&quot; (2017), an adventure that leaves the northern Sword Coast for the southern jungles of Chult&quot;. The official &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; actual play web series &quot;Rivals of Waterdeep&quot;, which premiered in 2018, is set in the Forgotten Realms. It has adapted adventure modules such as &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Descent Into Avernus&quot; (2019) and &quot;Candlekeep Mysteries&quot; (2021) which are also set in the Forgotten Realms.

==Fictional setting==

The focus of the Forgotten Realms setting is the continent of Faerûn, the western part of a continent that was roughly modeled after the Eurasian continent on Earth. The lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race, with populations of many humanoid races and creatures ubiquitous in fantasy fiction works such as dwarves, elves, goblins, and orcs. Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms resembles the pre-industrial Earth in the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.

===Geography===
The Forgotten Realms is part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril (usually just called Toril), an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences and consists of several large continents. It was first detailed in the original &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Set&quot;, published in 1987 by TSR. The other continents of Toril include Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, and other yet unspecified landmasses. Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East Asia, was later the focus of its own source book &quot;Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms&quot;, published in 1988. There is also a vast subterranean world called the Underdark beneath the surface.

In early editions of the setting, The Realms shared a unified cosmology with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With the release of the 2001 &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot;, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.

===Religion===
Religion plays a large part in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and their followers being an integral part of the world. Deities interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others. Greenwood created a pantheon of gods for his home &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, in his Forgotten Realms world, which were introduced in his article &quot;Down-to-earth divinity&quot; from &quot;Dragon&quot; #54 (October 1981).

When the Forgotten Realms was published as a setting in 1987, the pantheon added Waukeen, the goddess of trade, money, and wealth, who was created by one of Jeff Grubb&#x27;s players, and added to the Forgotten Realms by Grubb. Tyche was replaced with Tymora, and the elemental lords from Melniboné were replaced by Akadi, Grumbar, Istishia, and Kossuth.

Much of the history of the Forgotten Realms detailed in novels and source books concerns the actions of various deities and The Chosen (mortal representatives with a portion of their deities&#x27; power) such as Elminster, Fzoul Chembryl, Midnight (who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, Mystra), and the Seven Sisters. Above all other deities is Ao, the Overlord, who does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals. He is single-handedly responsible for the Time of Troubles, or Godswar, as seen in &quot;The Avatar Trilogy&quot;.

===Characters===
The setting is home to several noteworthy recurring characters that have gained wider reception, including:
* The Companions of the Hall, a group of adventurers that were created by R. A. Salvatore and introduced in &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; (1988). Each of these characters &quot;fit into an RPG archetype&quot;. They include:
** Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, a drow, or dark elf, ranger who is the main character of 34 novels. Drizzt is noted for his commitment to friendship and peace, which is contrary to the stereotype of his people. Drizzt as a character is often used to represent issues of racial prejudice, particularly in &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot;. Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself and his human romantic interest Catti-Brie.
** Wulfgar, a massive human barbarian; in &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, Wulfgar&#x27;s combat prowess is significant enough that along with Drizzt and his magic panther Guenhwyvar, they manage to &quot;beat 25 giants by themselves&quot;. As a character, Wulfgar exemplifies &quot;the strong, honest, hot-headed young warrior hero type common to adventure stories and similar to Howard&#x27;s creation Conan&quot;.
** Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven fighter who retakes Mithral Hall with the help of the other Companions and becomes its king. He was one of the first friends Drizzt made upon leaving the Underdark and both Catti-Brie and Wulfgar are his adopted children. Rob Bricken for &quot;io9&quot; highlighted Bruenor as &quot;a dwarf that hits pretty much every fantasy stereotype, including his desire to reclaim an ancestral home that his people were chased out of after they dug too far and awakened a monster&quot;.
** Catti-brie, a human archer who would later develop abilities as a spellcaster; in &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;, Drizzt referred to her as his soulmate. Catti-Brie is favored by Mielikki, a goddess associated with forests and nature spirits, and she bears the deity&#x27;s mark. Bricken argued that her characterization in &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; is limited, while Aidan-Paul Canavan maintained that she becomes a &quot;hero&quot; only in later novels.
** Regis, a halfling member of the Companions, who behaves in the stereotypical manner of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s hobbits. Bricken noted that Regis is a rogue who &quot;set himself apart a bit by carrying a crystal pendant he can use to charm people&quot;, though he is sometimes forced into dangerous situations and &quot;ends up saving the day, Bilbo-style&quot;, such as in the final battle of &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;.
* Elminster, a wizard also known as the Sage of Shadowdale; he is &quot;a founding member of the Harpers and one of the oldest surviving and most powerful Chosen of Mystra&quot;. The Harpers are a semi-secret organization; Jonathan Palmer, for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, called them &quot;Laudable&quot; and commented that they are &quot;fighters for freedom and justice&quot;. Bricken described Elminster as &quot;the most powerful, important, and smartest wizard in the Forgotten Realms, and one of the setting&#x27;s most important characters [...] more Merlin than Gandalf, which makes him less enigmatic and prone to tomfoolery than other major fantasy wizards, which I count as a good thing&quot;.
* Volothamp Geddarm, a human adventurer who is famed within the setting Faerûn for the number of guidebooks he writes about the various regions within the Realms. The character&#x27;s name is often attributed in real-world D&amp;D publications as the in-universe narrator of said works. Paul Pettengale from &quot;Arcane&quot; described him as &quot;one of those characters that everyone&#x27;s heard about, and one that just about every Dungeon Master must have been tempted to introduce to their campaign at some point or another&quot;.
* Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun, developed by Greenwood and game designer Steven Schend, is a character noted for his appearances in several novels set in the Forgotten Realms, as well as the 2004 video game &quot;Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone&quot;. A powerful wizard renowned for his namesake staff, in earlier editions he is the Archmage of Waterdeep, leading member of the Harpers, and one of Mystra&#x27;s Chosen. Prior to his death, Khelben passes the Blackstaff to his apprentice Tsarra, who takes up residence at Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep and inherits his memories and legacy. Writer Aubrey Sherman said he is an example for the importance of a wand or staff behind the conception of a wizard archetype and listed the character among D&amp;D&#x27;s notable wizards.
* , also a character by R. A. Salvatore, was introduced in the 1990 novel &quot;Exile&quot;. He also appears in &quot;Promise of the Witch King, Road of the Patriarch&quot; and &quot;The Pirate King&quot;, as well as &quot;The Sellswords&quot; and the &quot;Paths of Darkness&quot; trilogies. Described by Christian Hoffer from &quot;Comicbook.com&quot; as a popular and intriguing supporting character, Jarlaxle is the charismatic and opportunistic drow leader of the mercenary band Bregan D&#x27;aerthe. Anglistics scholar Caroline de Launay characterized Jarlaxle as an independent character inclined to &quot;subtle manoeuvres&quot;, while Hoffer explained that he is an amoral villain who has &quot;plenty of contingencies and secret plots&quot;. When comparing the plot of &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; to a game of chess, de Launay assigned Jarlaxle the role of the knight. Theo Kogod, for &quot;CBR&quot;, wrote that Jarlaxle is &quot;in many ways [...] a dark reflection of the heroic and honorable Drizzt. He used lies, manipulation and cunning to rise as high as a male Drow could within his culture, but in the end, he also left his home behind. [...] In &quot;&quot;, Jarlaxle is trying to leverage himself to become accepted as a legitimate member of the Lords&#x27; Alliance. He is one of four possible main villains in the campaign&quot;.
* Artemis Entreri, a human assassin described by Bricken as &quot;cold-blooded&quot; and Drizzt&#x27;s &quot;equal in fighting and opposite in morality&quot;, a mirror image of how Drizzt would have ended up if he had remained part of the universally evil drow society instead of forsaking it.
* Gromph Baenre is Archmage of the city of Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Gromph is a rival in power to the other archmages of the Forgotten Realms, such as Elminster and Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun. In a review of the 1995 novel &quot;Daughter of the Drow&quot;, Gideon Kibblewhite for &quot;Arcane&quot;, called Gromph the &quot;only interesting character&quot; in the book, describing him as &quot;the bitter and twisted archmage&quot;, and lamented that &quot;he rarely makes an appearance after the opening&quot;.
* Liriel Baenre is the daughter of Gromph Baenre; she originally belonged to House Vandree before her talent for arcane spellcasting was discovered by Gromph. After being sent away to hone her magical talent rather than study as a priestess, Liriel uses a book given by her father to travel to the surface lands, where she encounters followers of the goddess Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden of benevolent drow, comes to possess the magical artifact known as the Windwalker, and eventually settle down on the surface world permanently. Liriel was created by Elaine Cunningham for &quot;Daughter of the Drow&quot;, and is described by Trenton Webb of &quot;Arcane&quot; as &quot;the oddest Drow&quot; due to her lack of traits deemed as stereotypical of her people.
* Erevis Cale, first introduced in the short story &quot;Another Name For Dawn&quot; published in issue 277 of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, is a pivotal character in novels by Paul S. Kemp, including &quot;The Halls of Stormweather&quot;, &quot;Shadows Witness&quot;, the &quot;Erevis Cale Trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight War&quot; trilogy. Originally a normal human, he accepts the gift of the Fane of Shadows in &quot;Twilight Falling&quot; and becomes a shade; being imbued with the essence of matter integral to the Plane of Shadow brings about drastic changes to his appearance and physiology. Don D&#x27;Ammassa described Erevis Cale as &quot;a man tormented by questions of right and wrong&quot;.
* Alustriel Silverhand is the ruler of the city of Silverymoon in &quot;The North&quot; of the setting. Writing in 2000, &quot;Envoyer&quot; magazine reviewer Stylo counted her among the most prominent Forgotten Realms characters thanks to R.A. Salvatore&#x27;s novels.
* Szass Tam is a lich and leader of the Red Wizards of Thay.

==Reception==
In his book &quot;The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer&#x27;s Bible&quot;, Sean Patrick Fannon describes the Forgotten Realms as being &quot;the most ambitious fantasy game setting published since Tekumel&quot;, and that it &quot;may be the most widely played-in game setting in RPG history&quot;. Similarly, in literature, the novels written in the Forgotten Realms setting have formed one of &quot;the industry&#x27;s leading fantasy series&quot;. Over time these novels have gained &quot;unprecedented popularity&quot;, which led, as Marc Oxoby noted in his book, &quot;The 1990s&quot;, to the novels having an &quot;extraordinary shelf life&quot;, remaining in print for many years. This popular reception has also been reflected in public libraries; for example, Joyce Saricks states in &quot;The Readers&#x27; Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction&quot; that the novels have been among the most requested books by fans of the fantasy genre. &quot;D&amp;D&quot; chroniclers Michael Witwer &quot;et al.&quot;, in the book &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Art &amp; Arcana&quot;, noted that the &quot;level of Tolkienesque history and detail that Greenwood had infused in his creation - and almost &quot;real world&quot; quality - granted the Realms an irresistible allure [...]. While at its core the Forgotten Realms is a familiar, almost traditional, medieval-styled fantasy setting, it boasted unprecedented scope&quot;. &quot;It is, quite simply, Dungeons &amp; Dragons at its very core.&quot;

Aubrey Sitterson, for &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, included the Forgotten Realms in a 2015 roundup of the &quot;11 Best Dungeons &amp; Dragons Campaign Settings&quot; and wrote that &quot;for most people, Forgotten Realms is synonymous with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and with good reason: it&#x27;s the setting that played home to the massively popular Baldur&#x27;s Gate video game, as well as R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s Drizzt books. Currently, it&#x27;s the only campaign setting actively supported by &quot;D&amp;D&quot; makers Wizards of the Coast, which would be restrictive if Forgotten Realms wasn&#x27;t such an incredibly diverse place, housing classic European middle ages tropes, as well as a heroic fantasy take on African, Middle Eastern, and other real-world cultures&quot;. Brian Silliman, for SYFY Wire in 2017, described the Forgotten Realms as &quot;a classic fantasy backdrop&quot; and highlighted that &quot;at one time in our history, our world and this one were connected, but over time this magical realm was, well, forgotten. It is an ideal place for any &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventure, inspiring limitless possibilities for any smirking dungeon master&quot;. In 2019, academic Philip J. Clements called the &quot;highly popular&quot; Forgotten Realms &quot;an unusually well-developed D&amp;D setting&quot; and &quot;more-or-less the flagship setting for D&amp;D&quot;. He also noted that it has received the greatest number of supplements.

In a retrospective on the legacy of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, academic Daniel Heath Justice commented that the &quot;&quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; was explicitly based on the civilized-versus-savage binary and leaned in hard on racial essentialism in its sadistic black-skinned drow led by vicious matriarchs and their terrible spider goddess, firmly melding anti-Blackness with misogyny, a once-civilized people gone feral under the debased rule of women&quot;.

=== Edition updates ===
The 4th edition update to the Forgotten Realms brought massive lore changes which were &quot;tied to a number of other design philosophies&quot; and the Forgotten Realms &quot;simultaneously had become a grittier setting, on the edge of collapse, while also becoming a more fantastic one, full of wonder and mystery&quot;. Jason Wilson, for &quot;VentureBeat&quot;, highlighted that unlike the Time of Troubles cataclysm, the 4th edition Spellplague cataclysm was &quot;one players never embraced in the same manner as the earlier disaster&quot;. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, wrote:

[The 4th edition] &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide&quot; may be the most controversial D&amp;D book ever produced by Wizards. That&#x27;s entirely due to the large-scale destruction of the Realms. Similar updates have been tried by other companies — to reinvigorate settings, to make them more accessible to new players, or to make them more adventuresome. [...] It never seems to go well, because old fans feel left behind. With that said, some folks did love the changes, because the setting was now more playable, more accessible, more fantastic, and more PC centered. [...] Meanwhile, a series of adventures and novels called &quot;The Sundering&quot; (2013–2014) reversed many of the 4e changes to the Realms, but without rebooting the timeline. Instead, the Realms continues to evolve and advance, as it has since its earlier days.

R. A. Salvatore was also publicly unhappy with the 4th edition changes to the Forgotten Realms: [B]asically, we authors were handed a document and told how things were going to be. We were asked our opinions, but they mattered very little – the changes were being driven from a different direction. [...] To have characters that have built such a strong history, then have that upset on the orders of someone else was very disconcerting. I will admit that the abrupt changes forced me into an uncomfortable place, and from that place came some of the better things I&#x27;ve written, but I very much preferred the way it was done this time, with 5th Edition and the changes, where we, the authors, were told what was happening to the game and asked how we could make the world and the lore live and breathe it.Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, reported that Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s 5th edition publishing strategy, which focuses on the Forgotten Realms and newer intellectual property for campaign settings, has created a rift in the fan base where some &quot;feel that this push for new players has come at the cost of keeping the game&#x27;s current players sated&quot; by not updating campaign settings that &quot;predate the Forgotten Realms&quot;. Hoffer highlighted that Wizards of the Coast has a much slower publication schedule than with previous editions with a focus on quality and profit and &quot;the D&amp;D teams knows that they have plenty of great campaign settings in their back pocket and are either actively developing more settings or have ideas for them further down the line&quot;.

<text>Ravenloft is a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. It is an alternate time-space existence known as a &quot;pocket dimension&quot; or demiplane, called the Demiplane of Dread, which consists of a collection of land pieces called &quot;domains&quot;, brought together by a mysterious force known only as the Dark Powers. Each domain is tailored to and mystically ruled by a being called a Darklord who is forever trapped and surrounded by magical mists surrounding the domain. Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire in the original &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; &quot;Ravenloft&quot; I6 module released in 1983, became the first Darklord, both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. The story of how Count von Zarovich became Darklord of Barovia was detailed in the 1993 novel &quot;I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire&quot;. As originally established in the &quot;&quot; boxed set known as &quot;the Black Box&quot; released in 1990, the Ravenloft campaign setting was located in the Ethereal Plane. As a physical manifestation of that plane, lands, monsters and even people were created out of the mysterious mists, and the realm acted as a prison where one could enter or be transported, but means of escape were few. Other Ravenloft Domains and Darklords were eventually added in various &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition (and then later in 3rd edition) products establishing a core continent attached around Barovia which could be traveled to by others if their respective lords allowed entering or leaving their borders; while some Domains remained isolated in the mists and were referred to as Islands.

== Creative origins ==
In 1978, Tracy and Laura Hickman wrote adventures that would eventually be published as the &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; modules &quot;Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. Strahd von Zarovich was created by the Hickmans &quot;after Tracy returned home from a disappointing session of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Back in First Edition, the game was less of a storytelling game. [...] It didn&#x27;t make sense to [Tracy] why a creature like a vampire was just sitting around in a random dungeon with oozes, goblins, and zombies. So he and his wife set out to create a vampire villain with fleshed-out motivations and history&quot;. When the Hickmans began work on &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, they felt the vampire archetype had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it with a group of players every Halloween for five years on their own game system with the adventure titled &quot;Vampyr&quot;. However, the Hickmans kept being asked about their &quot;Ravenloft game&quot;, and so the Ravenloft name stuck. The duo eventually caught the attention of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s original publishers. They were hired to adapt it into the first edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and it was released as &quot;Module I6: Ravenloft&quot; in 1983 by TSR.

==Publication history==
=== 1st edition ===
The first appearance of the setting was in &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, a stand-alone &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure module, published in 1983. In 1984, it won the Strategists&#x27; Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid. It was popular enough to spawn a 1986 sequel, &quot;Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill&quot;, and an Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Gamebooks novel, &quot;Master of Ravenloft&quot;, the same year.

=== 2nd edition ===
Ravenloft was launched as a full-fledged campaign setting, for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition, in 1990, with the &quot;&quot; boxed set, popularly known as the &quot;Black Box&quot;, and winner of the Origins Award in 1991 for &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1990&quot;.

The campaign setting was revised twice during &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition: first as the &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; or &quot;Red Box&quot;, then as the &quot;Domains of Dread&quot; hardback.

In 1994, Ravenloft spun off into a sub-setting called &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot;, set on Gothic Earth, an Edgar Allan Poe-influenced alternative Earth of the 1890s, where fantasy creatures and magic exist in the shadows of civilization.

TSR also published a series of novels set in Ravenloft. Each was typically focused on one of the Darklords that inhabited the Ravenloft world, with several focusing on the figure of Count Strahd von Zarovich. Many of these early novels were by authors who would later receive wider fame as horror/dark fantasy authors. These authors have included Elaine Bergstrom, P. N. Elrod, Christie Golden, and Laurell K. Hamilton.

=== 3rd and 3.5 edition ===
A major revision of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released in 2000, the first edition published by Wizards of the Coast (which had acquired TSR in 1997). In the same year, Wizards of the Coast licensed the Ravenloft brand to White Wolf Publishing. Under its Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios (and later Arthaus imprints), White Wolf Publishing released the 3rd Edition d20 System &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; (2001) and the 3.5 Edition &quot;Ravenloft Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2003).

The campaign settings published by White Wolf introduced a number of alterations, many due to conflicts with existing Wizards of the Coast intellectual property. Specific references to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-specific deities were replaced with new names in the White Wolf Ravenloft settings (for example, Bane was changed to the Lawgiver). The license to the Ravenloft trademark reverted to Wizards of the Coast on August 15, 2005, but White Wolf retained the right to continue to sell its back stock until June 2006. The timing of this reversion meant that the Ravenloft supplement &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to the Mists&quot; did not see print. Instead, it was released by White Wolf as a free download in late September 2005. The majority of the &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide&quot; series had already been published by TSR in the 1990s, before White Wolf&#x27;s involvement.

In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot;, a hardcover version of the original 1st Ed. adventure, updated for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; v.3.5 rule set. This version includes maps from the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; adventure, and new character-generation options. &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot; is a stand-alone supplement set for any &quot;D&amp;D&quot; worlds, and only requires the three core books for usage. This book&#x27;s setting is distinct from the Ravenloft of the White Wolf product line. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted that by 2006 people were beginning to wonder if Wizards of the Coast might be preparing a fourth edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and stated that &quot;the release of &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot; (2006) might just have offered another clue to the changing winds that lay ahead. First, it was a new line for 3.5e, suggesting that their original series of 3.5e books was coming to an end. Second, it was a fond look back at one of the most notable adventures from the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; days, just the sort of thing that Wizards published in the waning days of 2e&quot;. Appelcline later noted that, once fourth edition was officially announced, &quot;the &quot;Expedition&quot; books that had begun publication in 2006 were revealed to indeed be part of Wizard&#x27;s slow slide into 4e&quot;.

=== 4th edition ===
In 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the printing of two new Ravenloft novels for 2008, &quot;Black Crusade&quot; and &quot;The Sleep of Reason&quot;, fueling more speculation. A short story by Ari Marmell, &quot;Before I Wake&quot;, based on the realms of Darkon, Lamordia, and Bluetspur was released on October 31, 2007, on the Wizards of the Coast website as a special for Halloween; it featured characters inspired by H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith.

In 2008, Ravenloft was revealed to be re-introduced to 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as was depicted in the October issue of the &quot;Dragon&quot; online magazine. The &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition supplement &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2008) established that in the retconned cosmology, the Domains of Dread (and by extension the Ravenloft setting) were now located within the Shadowfell, a mirror-plane of death and gloom lying adjacent to the mortal realm. While a 4th edition update to the Ravenloft setting was announced at Gen Con 2010, the product was never released.

In 2010, Ravenloft was the setting for the &quot;Castle Ravenloft Board Game&quot;. Ravenloft also appeared in official magazine articles, such as, &quot;Dungeon&quot; #207 &quot;Fair Barovia&quot; (October 2012) and &quot;Dragon&quot; #416 &quot;History Check: Strahd and Van Richten&quot; (October 2012).

=== 5th edition ===
In 2016, Barovia (one of the main locations within Ravenloft) was the main setting for adventure module &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; which acts as an adaptation of the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module for the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The adventure states: &quot;The lands of Barovia are from a forgotten world in the D&amp;D multiverse [...]. In time, cursed Barovia was torn from its home world by the Dark Powers and bound in mist as one of the Domains of Dread in the Shadowfell&quot;. The module was developed in-house by the Wizards of the Coast team, led by Christopher Perkins, with story contributions by original creators Tracy and Laura Hickman. Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, explained that &quot;instead of reinventing the wheel, designer Chris Perkins brought in the module&#x27;s original writers — the husband and wife team of Tracy and Laura Hickman — to create the very best version of the famous module yet. [...] Tracy and Laura have been hosting nearly annual sessions of the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; at their home, for friends and family, over the course of decades. When Perkins asked for their input, they flew out to meet with the team. The result was a torrent of ideas for new locations, characters and encounters&quot;.

Wizards of the Coast released a new edition of the &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; module, entitled &quot;Curse of Strahd: Revamped&quot;, on October 20, 2020. This module is the first released with the publisher&#x27;s new focus on diversity and inclusion. Wizards of the Coast stated that &quot;the adventure includes the latest errata and a revised depiction of the Vistani&quot; who are based on stereotypes about the Romani people.

Wizards of the Coast released a new Ravenloft campaign sourcebook, &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021), which introduces other Domains of Dread to the edition. It was published on May 18, 2021.

==Fictional setting==

Ravenloft is primarily a Gothic horror setting. Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use scenes that build apprehension and fear, culminating in the eventual face-to-face meeting with the nameless evil. Characters have a much greater significance attached to their acts, especially if they are morally impure, as they risk coming under the influence of the Dark Powers (through the game process called &quot;dark powers checks&quot;) and gradually transforming themselves into figures of evil.

The magical mists of Ravenloft could appear anywhere in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; universe, drawing evil-doers (or player characters) into the Ravenloft setting. One exception is the phlogiston of the Spelljammer setting. The phlogiston blocks all planar travel, but the Ravenloft mists can appear in deep space inside crystal shells, according to the &quot;Complete Spacefarer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;.

Luis Javier Flores Arvizu named the continuous presence of supernatural beings as one of the factors that made &quot;Ravenloft&quot; a very well received role-playing game setting during the 33 years of its existence.

===The Dark Powers===

The Dark Powers are a malevolent force who control the Demiplane of Dread. Their exact nature and number are deliberately kept vague, allowing for plot development in accordance with the Gothic tradition of storytelling – where the heroes are frequently outclassed and outnumbered by unknowable evil forces beyond their control.

The Dark Powers most frequently serve as a plot device for Ravenloft, especially concerning the Darklords, the visible rulers of the Ravenloft Demiplane. Where the player characters are often tormented and opposed by the Darklords, the Darklords are themselves tormented and opposed by the Dark Powers. The difference lies in order of power—while many &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventures focus on allowing a band of heroes to prevail over a Darklord (much as in the spirit of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;), no such victory over the Dark Powers seems possible, or even conceivable, for the Darklords. Vecna and Lord Soth &quot;escaped&quot; Ravenloft, but are the only two Darklords known to have done so; Vecna by attaining the status of Greater God (and thus becoming too powerful for the Dark Powers to contain) and Lord Soth by ignoring his domain and punishment, causing the Dark Powers to lose interest in imprisoning him, and agents of his former curse on the world of Krynn coming to collect him.

Most frequently, the Dark Powers make their wishes and intentions known through subtle manipulations of fate. Thus, Barovia&#x27;s vampire lord Strahd von Zarovich&#x27;s many attempts to win back his love, Tatyana, are doomed to failure, but the Dark Powers arrange such that he never truly loses hope. Each time, for example, Strahd&#x27;s own actions may be partially culpable for his failure, and as such he may go through crippling self-recrimination, rather than cursing the gods solely and giving up. Most other Darklords have similar tales of frustration, kept all the more unbearable because the flicker of the possibility of success is never truly extinguished.

Not all Darklords acknowledge the Dark Powers directly, however. Strahd, for example, in his own memoirs, speaks only of a force known as Death, who mocks him with the voices of his family and former colleagues throughout his life. Vlad Drakov, the Darklord of Falkovnia whose military expeditions are doomed to constant failure, seems even to be totally oblivious to any non-mortal factors in his repeated defeats.

The Dark Powers also seem capable of non-evil manipulations. Although their machinations are often directly responsible for the misery of many of Ravenloft&#x27;s inhabitants, they also appear to play a role as dispensers of justice. Some tales of innocents who have escaped Ravenloft for happier environs are attributed to the Dark Powers, who have judged a being worthy of reward and release from their misty domain.

=== Domains of Dread ===
There are many Domains of Dread that makeup the landscape of Ravenloft. The Domains are surrounded by strange mists that can ensnare both people and places in Prime Material Plane and pull them into the Domains. Each Domain is ruled by a Darklord, but each Darklord was imprisoned in their Domain by the Dark Powers. The Dark Powers &quot;are believed to have been responsible for the overall creation of the Dread Domains&quot;. The concept of Domains and locations in Ravenloft besides Barovia and Mordent was introduced in the 2nd Edition campaign setting book &quot;&quot; (1990). This book outlined that the size of Ravenloft is &quot;40,000 square miles [spanning] 26 different domains, including Barovia and Mordent. All of the core domains are overviewed in &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, as are eight &#x27;islands&#x27;&quot;. The revised 2nd Edition boxset &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; (1994) is an update to &quot;Realm of Terror&quot;, but it removes Domains that were destroyed in the Grand Conjunction adventure series and adds new Domains. The metaplot of the adventure series was used to update the setting: &quot;David Wise, leader of the &#x27;Kargat&#x27; of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; designers at TSR, has said there were a few reasons for the changes. Some domains were changed or removed because they didn&#x27;t fit into Ravenloft ecologically [...]. Some domains were removed or merged because their lords were too similar, and finally some islands of terror were kicked to the curb just because they were &#x27;less exciting&#x27;. [...] A few domains that had appeared since the publication of &quot;Ravenloft: Realm of Terror&quot; were notably missing [...]. All told, &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; covers 20 core domains and nine islands&quot;. The 5th Edition campaign guide &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021) includes an overview of 39 Domains and many Domains are given a &quot;wholesale revision&quot; while &quot;other Domains keep their original lore but are advanced in other ways&quot;. Rob Wieland, writing for Forbes, explained that in this book &quot;many of the domains have new Darklords that reflect their original character but have details changed to better fit the type of horror the domain is supposed to represent&quot;.

Some of the more notable Domains include:
* Barovia: the first Domain introduced and &quot;foreboding&quot; home of Strahd von Zarovich. This domain was &quot;inspired by Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;.
* Carnival: this domain &quot;wanders the mists&quot; itself, &quot;populated by wild performers and a powerful, living sword&quot;.
* Darkon: this domain is &quot;a broken land [...] whose central castle is frozen mid-explosion, its disparate rooms desperately trying to reassemble the whole in mid-air&quot;, and &quot;Darkon is now a Domain in decline after the disappearance of the iconic lich Azalin&quot;.
* Falkovnia: in its original incarnation, this domain&#x27;s &quot;Darklord was a fairly basic analog for Vlad the Impaler [...] and it had few defining characteristics beyond being a land ruled by a brutal warlord with a penchant for ultraviolence&quot;. In &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot;, &quot;Falkovnia has been reimagined as a nightmarish Groundhog&#x27;s Day-style loop, where a struggling nation—which happens to be ruled by a brutal warlord—is endlessly besieged by massive hordes of the walking dead, who just so happen to look like everyone this warlord has ever killed&quot;. The Darklord Vladeska &quot;Drakov&#x27;s ruthless efficiency and relentless perfectionism has turned her into a tyrant. Rather than retreat and save the lives of citizens and soldiers alike, every day she rebuilds the barricades that keep death at bay. Those same walls keep her trapped within&quot;.
* Hazlan: this domain is a magocracy ruled by the Red Wizard Hazlik who treats the domain as a &quot;vast magical laboratory&quot;. Wes Schneider, lead designer of &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot;, highlighted that &quot;Hazlan&#x27;s a great example of a Ravenloft domain where the &#x27;technology&#x27; behind its horror concept has improved since its origin. [...] Since the &#x27;90s, our collective imaginations have expanded on what an evil magic dystopia might look like. [...] Hazlan is a domain where anything wizards could do they&#x27;ve done to the extreme, and they&#x27;re still doing it, all in the name of magical discovery and with the effects scarring the realm&#x27;s people and land. This makes it the domain for all manner of weird monsters, amoral experiments, magical contagions, unnatural weather, collapsing reality, meteor showers, mutations, disasters, and so much more&quot;.
* Lamordia: this domain &quot;paid homage&quot; to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by Mary Shelley. In its original incarnation, Lamordia was a coastal domain with two small settlements and was ruled by Adam, a flesh golem-like creature created by Doctor Victor Mordenheim. In &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot;, the region is now ruled by Viktra Mordenheim, a mad scientist tormented by her inability to replicate the Unbreakable Heart device that keeps her reborn lover Elise alive, even as Elise flees from her at every turn.

===Darklords===

Darklord is the title used to refer to the mystically imprisoned and cursed ruler of a domain. A Darklord was originally an individual who had committed a truly horrific crime, which drew the attention of the enigmatic Dark Powers. The Dark Powers then proceeded to craft a personal kingdom around the Darklord. This crafted domain serves both as a kingdom and a prison: the Darklord gains incredible powers whilst within its borders but can never leave it, although most Darklords can seal their domain borders with a thought. Within their domains, the Darklords are forever tormented by the objects of their desires, which are often the objects for which they committed their crimes.

===Vistani===

The Vistani are a nomadic ethnic group. They are based on depictions of the Romani people. Since their introduction in the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module (1983) as fortune-tellers, they became a unifying element in the Ravenloft and the Masque of the Red Death campaign settings, which offer Gothic horror scenarios. In a Ravenloft adventure, the Vistani have some control of the Mists of Ravenloft, which divide realms, while the players are generally confined to a region from which they must escape by solving one or more problems. Players generally need help from the Vistani to travel reliably from one open realm to another.

The Vistani people were &quot;described as superstitious&quot; and had &quot;abilities to curse and hypnotize players or cast spells like Evil Eye&quot;. They were also originally stereotyped &quot;as &#x27;uncivilized&#x27; and heavy drinkers&quot;, but this portrayal was removed in the adventure module &quot;Curse of Strahd Revamped&quot; (2020). Their portrayal was further retconned in &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021); the Vistani people are no longer considered superstitious but instead focused on their traditional practices and their abilities are grounded in the forms of magic found in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

The fictional character Rudolph van Richten, a famous Monster Hunter in Ravenloft and author of a series of guides to hunting and slaying various monsters, had a great enmity for the Vistani for most of his monster-hunting career, but his opinion improved during his penning of &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide To The Vistani&quot;, during which he befriended a &quot;mortu&quot; (a Vistani outcast).

==Reception==
Game designer Rick Swan commented in 1994 that when the Ravenloft setting first came out, it &quot;just didn&#x27;t seem special, a Forgotten Realms variant with a few more bats&quot;, but after supplements like &quot;Forbidden Lore&quot;, &quot;The Created&quot;, and the &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide&quot; series, Swan felt that &quot;the Ravenloft campaign has proven to be a credible adventure alternative for players interested in the dark side of the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game. Though it lacks the flamboyance of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; and the, er, bite of &quot;&quot;, the Ravenloft setting remains the hobby&#x27;s most enduring fusion of horror and fantasy&quot;.

Darker Days Radio declared Ravenloft the &quot;greatest D&amp;D campaign setting&quot;, citing the unique gothic horror elements and classic villains such as Azalin Rex.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken highlighted that &quot;Vampire of the Mists&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t scary, per se, but Strahd wreaks enough horror and carnage to drive home that Ravenloft is much, much more sinister than the Forgotten Realms. [...] Ravenloft (and I guess Forgotten Realms) vampires have &quot;all&quot; the tropes: They can turn into bats, wolves, and mists, and they don&#x27;t cast reflections. They can control animals and enthrall people, to a degree. They can&#x27;t cross running water, and they have to be invited into a home to enter. Unless they&#x27;re an extremely powerful vampire like Strahd, natch&quot;.

Shelly Jones, in the journal &quot;Analog Game Studies: Volume IV&quot;, highlighted the Tarokka Deck mechanic used in both the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; (1983) module and the 5th edition &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; (2016) module to add randomization to the game and increase replayability. Jones wrote: &quot;The Tarokka Deck incorporates an inconsistency in the game play that reflects fragmented traumatic memory and reifies the inconsistency present within an abusive relationship&quot;. Jones also highlighted that &quot;without sunshine as a key time-tracking element, players are forced to rely upon other means to signal the passage of time within Barovia. Further adding to that disorientation is the knowledge that the players have been abandoned from anything familiar or real. [...] This alienating effect, based upon the physical environment as well as the psychological manifestations, traumatizes characters&quot;.

The Ravenloft setting has been criticized &quot;for reinforcing harmful stereotypes through its portrayal of the Vistani, an in-fiction analogue for the Roma people&quot;. In 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced &quot;in the editorial process for &quot;Strahd&quot;″s reprint, as well as two upcoming products, Wizards worked with a Romani consultant to present the Vistani without using reductive tropes&quot;. On this update, Jon Ryan, for &quot;IGN&quot;, wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s worth noting that the book&#x27;s illustrations of the Vistani still evoke Romani culture, and some players may still associate certain abilities [...] with outdated cultural stereotypes&quot;. Julie Muncy, for &quot;Io9&quot;, criticized the &quot;granular changes&quot; to the Vistani people as not very extensive and that &quot;while there&#x27;s a real opportunity here to do better work—the aforementioned diversity pledge also mentioned future works that will feature the Vistani people and aim to complicate their depictions—starting that work with a fancy collector&#x27;s edition feels less like a promise to do better and more like a victory lap&quot;. Muncy also highlighted that the unrevised parts, such as the art and specific magical abilities, still lean &quot;into tropes that suggest the Romani have mystical, dangerous powers, tropes that have been used in the past to target Romani for persecution&quot;.

Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook.com, highlighted that in &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021) the Domains of Dread &quot;all now function as originally intended: prisons meant to torture specific souls. Many of the original Ravenloft domains featured strange punishments that didn&#x27;t necessarily fit the crime of the Darklord. The revised domains are usually a better utilization of the ironic intent that flavors the immortal prisons of Ravenloft. The domains also now include a variety of different horror genres rather than a fixation on gothic horror. Finally, much of the misogynistic, colonialist, or racist elements have been purged out of this new iteration of Ravenloft. Although these changes will likely be the most talked about part of the book in some circles, these changes seem to have occurred naturally during the course of updating Ravenloft to reflect more diverse horror genres and to make the domains conform to Ravenloft&#x27;s internal laws&quot;.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;In many ways, Strahd is a vessel for the audience&#x27;s relationship with an ever-changing and evolving vampire legend. While a character in his own right, he is broadly drawn, so every group of players can make him their own. There are many Strahds, each defined by the tastes of the people at the table.&quot;

== In other media ==
* In 2016, Wizards of the Coast added an additional license option to their 5th Edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; open game license. It allows individuals and third party publishers to create and sell content based on specific Wizards of the Coast intellectual property, if the content is sold through the Dungeon Masters Guild storefront. Multiple third party supplements and adventures set in Ravenloft have since been released through this program.
* &quot;Tales From the Mists&quot; (2019–2020) was an official actual play streaming series broadcast on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Twitch and YouTube channels. TK Johnson was the show&#x27;s Dungeon Master with a &quot;cast of four players (Lysa Chen, Kayla Cline, Hadeel Al-Massari, and Ashley Warren) plus two rotating party slots filled by new players every four episodes&quot;. The first season was set in the city of Harmonia in the Kartakass Domain of Dread; each character is from a different domain of Ravenloft. Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook&quot;, wrote: &quot;One of &quot;Tales from the Mists&quot;&#x27; greatest strengths is that it feels very much like a gothic horror story, with an emphasis on death, the macabre, and terror lurking right around the corner. [...] While &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is perhaps best known for its combat encounters, &quot;Tales from the Mists&quot; seems to take its gothic horror roots seriously. [...] This might be an adjustment from how some people think of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but &quot;Tales from the Mists&quot; is a masterclass on how to run a horror campaign using mood and environment to set the tone instead of a constant parade of scary monsters&quot;.
* &quot;The Black Dice Society&quot; is an official actual play streaming series broadcast on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; channels which premiered on April 1, 2021, and is set across multiple Domains of Dread in Ravenloft. B. Dave Walters is the show&#x27;s Dungeon Master with a cast of six players: Tanya DePass, Noura Ibrahim, Deejay Knight, Mark Meer, Saige Ryan and Becca Scott.

<text>Mystara is a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role playing game. It was the default setting for the &quot;Basic&quot; version of the game throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Most adventures published for the &quot;Basic&quot; edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; take place in &quot;The Known World&quot;, a central continent that includes a varied patchwork of both human and non-human realms. The human realms are based on various real-world historical cultures. In addition, unlike other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings, Mystara had ascended immortal beings instead of gods.

The Mystara planet also has sub-settings. The older &quot;Blackmoor&quot; setting was retconned to exist in Mystara&#x27;s distant past. The Hollow World refers to the inner surface contained within the world of Mystara, similar to the real world legends of the Hollow Earth, while some adventures take place on the Savage Coast, a 2,000 mile long frontier coastline about 2,000 miles to the west of the Known World.

By the mid-1990s, gamers&#x27; attention started to shift towards the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and its official campaigns. Some Mystara adventures for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; were published between 1994 and 1996. Eventually, official support of the Mystara setting was transitioned to the Official Fan Site system wherein the Vaults of Pandius fansite was selected to become the official site for the future 3rd edition of Mystara, and Wizards of the Coast support was discontinued by the time the game&#x27;s third edition was released in 2000.

==Development==
Mystara originated as a fantasy world developed by Lawrence Schick and Tom Moldvay for their own &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game sessions from 1974 to 1976. Their original setting consisted of a large continent with fictionalized nations that were based on real-world historical cultures. Inspired by author H. P. Lovecraft and his work in creating a fiction shared universe, Schick and Moldvay named their setting as the &quot;Known World&quot; so it could be expanded upon by other players. Schick then went to work at TSR Hobbies as a designer for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and other games. After being promoted to director of the Design Department he brought Moldvay in to join the company as a game designer, around the time when the &quot;D&amp;D Expert Set&quot; was under development. After being told that they could not use the existing Greyhawk setting, as it was being reserved for only &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; products, Schick and Moldvay got approval to instead use their &quot;Known World&quot; as the standard &quot;D&amp;D&quot; campaign setting.

Schick and Moldvay&#x27;s &quot;Known World&quot; was used as a semi-generic setting in early adventure modules, first mentioned in Module X1, &quot;The Isle of Dread&quot;. It was then expanded upon in various &quot;D&amp;D&quot; modules and sources, particularly a series of Gazetteers, many of which originally referred to the setting as &quot;The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Game World&quot;. The first published use of the name &quot;Mystara&quot; came in 1991 from Bruce Heard in the Letters section of his Voyage of the Princess Ark series in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. While the name was used in official publications after this, it was not until the conversion to &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition in 1994 that products were produced under the Mystara title with the official Mystara logo.

Each part of the &quot;D&amp;D Gazetteer&quot; series treats one nation or empire and has three basic elements: cultural and geographic background, features, and adventures. The cultural and geographic campaign background section offers a brief history and timeline for each nation; basic geography, climate, and ecology; and, fundamental social and political concepts of the region. Each Gazetteer also offers a list of scenario ideas appropriate to the campaign setting.

Trenton Webb for the British &quot;Arcane&quot; RPG magazine described Mystara as &quot;a traditional Tolkienesque world&quot;.

== Planet of Mystara ==
Three principal land masses are described on Mystara&#x27;s outer surface: the continent of Brun, the continent of Skothar, the continent of Davania, and the island continent of Alphatia (up to AC 1010). In the officially published material, the Known World concentrated on the eastern portion of Brun and the lands of the Sea of Dawn. The continents of Mystara were designed to be similar in appearance to the continents of Laurasia and Gondwana on Earth approximately 135 million years ago.

In addition to human races, several archetypal fantasy races were included on Mystara: these include elves, dwarves, halflings, orcs, and dragons.

Nations created for the world of Mystara include the Thyatian Empire, the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, the Principalities of Glantri, the merchant-run Republic of Darokin, the Emirates of Ylaruam, the Dwarven nation of Rockhome, the Elven Kingdom of Alfheim, Halfling lands of the Five Shires, and the chaotic Alphatian Empire.

=== The continent of Brun ===
The most commonly known land mass on Mystara&#x27;s outer surface is only a tiny portion of Brun. In the officially published material, the Known World concentrated on the eastern portion of Brun along with the islands of the Sea of Dawn.

==== The Known World ====
Nations of the Known World display a great range of government types. Some countries are populated entirely by demihumans and/or humanoids. By standard convention, the boundaries of the &quot;Known World&quot; are those covered in the world map as initially published in the module X1, &quot;The Isle of Dread,&quot; plus Norwold, the Isle of Dawn, and (pre &quot;Wrath of the Immortals&quot;) Alphatia.

As the name implies, the &quot;Known World&quot; covers the most notable nations of Mystara, the ones most commonly used in Mystara-based campaigns and featured in fiction. It includes the Thyatian Empire, which could be compared to the Byzantine Empire; the Grand Duchy of Karameikos (which includes the town of Threshold, the default setting of many classic D&amp;D adventures); the Principalities of Glantri, ruled by wizard-princes; the Ethengar Khanate, a Mongol-like society; the merchant-run Republic of Darokin, which is based loosely on the mercantile states of medieval Italy; the Emirates of Ylaruam; the Heldannic Territories, ruled by an order of religious knights similar to the Teutonic Order devoted to the Immortal Vanya; the Atruaghin Clans, which have an Amerindian feel; the nation of Sind, based on the Mughal Empire; the Northern Reaches Kingdoms of Ostland, Vestland, and the Soderfjord Jarldoms, based on Scandinavia at various periods of history; the Dwarven nation of Rockhome; the elven Kingdom of Alfheim; the Halfling lands of the Five Shires; and the Alphatian Empire, ruled by wizards and other spellcasters.

To the distant Northwest of the &quot;Known World&quot;, across the Great Waste, lies the mysterious lands of Hule, ruled by Hosadus, also known as &quot;The Master&quot;. Also on the periphery of the Known World are the Kingdoms of Wendar and Denagoth, the first an elven-dominated nation and the latter a mountainous and dark realm of evil, with ill-intentions towards Wendar. The Adri Varma lies between Sind, Wendar, the Great Waste, and The Black Mountains, forming the northern border of Glantri and defining the northwestern limits of the region.

==== The Savage Coast ====
Mystara includes the Savage Coast, a coastal area located in the south-central part of the Brun continent, to the south and west of Hule. The area is a 2000-mile frontier coastline about 2000 miles west of the Known World.

This part of Mystara is affected by the Red Curse. This sinister enchantment eventually kills its inhabitants through mutation unless the (fictional) metal &quot;cinnabryl&quot; is worn in contact with the body. The specifics of the &quot;Red Curse&quot; include mutilation of the body and extreme degeneration of physical and mental health. It also imprisons the region&#x27;s inhabitants, as debilitating effects result if they leave the cursed area.

=====Atmosphere=====
Savage Coast&#x27;s swashbuckling flavor is very different from that of the Known World, closer in atmosphere to that of the Age of Discovery than the fantasy middle-ages/renaissance tone of the Known World. The Savage Coast is complete with gunpowder (&quot;smokepowder&quot;) weaponry.

=====Publication history=====
The first published information on the area was the module &quot;X9 The Savage Coast&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set&quot;. The region was later expanded in &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine issues #6 and 7 (1987) with the adventure &quot;Tortles of the Purple Sage&quot;.

Two series in &quot;Dragon&quot; Magazine, &quot;The Princess Ark&quot; and the &quot;Known World Grimoire&quot;, described the Savage Coast in more detail. These articles were partially reprinted in the D&amp;D game accessory &quot;Champions of Mystara&quot; (1993).

The &quot;Savage Coast&quot; in 1994 was spun off into a campaign setting for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2nd Edition). This area was published in its own boxed set entitled &quot;Red Steel&quot;, and later republished online as the Savage Coast. An expansion, &quot;Savage Baronies&quot;, was released the following year. These supplements were for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition, as all the previous material had been for the &quot;Classic&quot; version of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

In 1996, the setting was revised and re-released under the &quot;AD&amp;D: Odyssey&quot; line as three fully online products available for free download. This range included the base &quot;Savage Coast Campaign Book&quot; by Tim Beach and Bruce Heard, a supplement &quot;Savage Coast: Orc&#x27;s Head&quot;, and a Monstrous Compendium Appendix.

=== The continent of Davania ===
Even though most of the Known World civilizations historically originated from this part of the planet, it did not see much development while the Mystara product line was still in production. The only major appearance of the continent was in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, where parts of it were sketched out during the Voyage of the Princess Ark series, by Known World Product Manager Bruce Heard.

Many Mystara fans have been turning their attention to Davania with fan-made material in recent years.

=== The continent of Skothar ===
Very little was officially developed for this part of Mystara. Since the Mystara product line was discontinued, fans have created their material for this part of Mystara.

== The Hollow World ==

Mystara is a hollow planet, with a habitable surface on its interior called the Hollow World, inspired by conceptions like that novelized by Jules Verne. This world is lit by an eternal red sun at the center of Mystara, and serves as a &quot;cultural museum&quot;, preserving the societies that have become extinct in the outer world, &quot;based on Native American, Aztec, Viking, and ancient Rome. The existence of the Hollow World is not, in general, known to the inhabitants of the outer world. The poles are actually huge, subtly curving holes that allow passage between the outer and inner world, although it is a long, hard trek through a cold, unlit, stormy and anti-magic area. The curvature of the holes is so subtle that explorers from either surface do not notice the transition until after it is already made, causing quite a shock for most.

== Moons ==
Two moons orbit the planet. Matera is a moon much like our own, whose phases govern lycanthropy (werewolves, werebears, etc.). Only the Immortals inhabit Matera. They live in a city, Pandius, where they can meet and watch over Mystara. Patera, or Myoshima to its inhabitants, is an invisible moon that cannot be seen from Mystara. Patera&#x27;s inhabitants have a culture similar to that of medieval Japan.

== Blackmoor ==
Mystara (like Greyhawk) incorporated the Blackmoor setting by placing it in the world&#x27;s distant past. Blackmoor evolved from a feudal kingdom into a highly advanced civilization, using more and more powerful – and destructive – technology. It ended itself in an apocalyptic explosion so devastating that it changed the climate and geography of the entire planet.

== Mystara video games ==
Five video games were set in Mystara, spanning three different genres. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Order of the Griffon&quot; (TurboGrafx-16, 1992) and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun&quot; (Sega Genesis, 1992) are role-playing video games. &quot;Fantasy Empires&quot; (PC, 1993) is a strategy game. The plots and development teams of these games are unrelated.

&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Tower of Doom&quot; (1993) and its sequel &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Shadow over Mystara&quot; (1996) are two arcade beat &#x27;em up with minimal role-playing elements. These two games are among the few D&amp;D video games developed by a Japanese company, in this case by Capcom.

<text>Planescape is a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, designed by Zeb Cook, and published by TSR in 1994.

==Description==
&quot;Planescape&quot; encompasses numerous planes of existence, creating an entire cosmology called the Great Wheel, which was originally developed in the 1987 &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; by Jeff Grubb. This includes many of the other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; worlds, linking them via inter-dimensional magical portals.

===Cosmology===

The &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; cosmology as reflected in &quot;Planescape&quot; consists of a number of planes, which can be divided into the following regions:
* The Inner Planes (representing planes of elemental nature, such as Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, as well as the Positive and Negative energy planes)
* The Ethereal Plane
* The Prime Material Plane
* The Astral Plane
* The Outer Planes (representing alignments and the primary domains of the various deities, where their petitioners spend their afterlives)

&quot;Planescape&quot; &quot;solidified the Great Wheel cosmology that began in 1e and would later be reinstated in 5e as the dominant of three theoretical models&quot;.

====Outer Planes====
The Outer Planes consist of: the Abyss, Acheron, Arborea, Arcadia, Baator, Beastlands, Bytopia, Carceri, Elysium, Gehenna, Gray Waste of Hades, Limbo, Mechanus, Mount Celestia, the Outlands, Pandemonium, and Ysgard.

===Sigil===

&quot;Sigil&quot;, the &quot;City of Doors&quot;, is located atop the &quot;Spire&quot; in the Outlands. It has the shape of a torus, and the city itself is located on the inner surface of the ring. There is no sky, simply an all-pervasive light that waxes and wanes to create day and night. Sigil cannot be entered or exited save via portals. Although this makes it quite safe from any would-be invader, it also makes it a prison of sorts for those not possessing a portal key. Thus, many call Sigil &quot;The Bird Cage&quot; or &quot;The Cage&quot;. Though Sigil is commonly held to be located &quot;at the center of the planes&quot; (where it is positioned atop the infinitely tall Spire), some argue that this is impossible since the planes are infinite in all dimensions, and therefore there can never truly be a center to any or all of them. Curiously, from the Outlands, one can see Sigil atop the supposedly infinite Spire.

===Factions===

Within Sigil there are philosophy-derived factions. Before the event known as the &quot;Faction War&quot;, the groups controlled the political climate of Sigil. Each of these factions is based on one particular belief system; one faction&#x27;s beliefs make them enemies while others make them allies. There are fifteen factions in total.

====&quot;The Faction War&quot;====

In 1998, TSR published &quot;Faction War&quot;, an adventure that effectively closed the book on Planescape, as it was then ending the product line. The culmination of several adventures leading up to that point, the Faction War brought an end to the factions&#x27; control of the city. Instigated by the power-hungry Duke Rowan Darkwood, factol of the Fated, in a bid to dethrone the Lady and rule Sigil himself, the war spread throughout the city before the Lady of Pain, with the aid of a group of adventurers (the players&#x27; characters), intervened.

===Sects===
Sects are in many ways identical to the Factions, differing in that they are not based in Sigil. Sects are often highly specific to the particular planes they originate from, though historically many of the Factions were once Sects and some Sects were once Factions.

===Rules===
There are three principles (or heuristics) governing the world of Planescape: the Rule-of-Three, the Unity of Rings, and the Center of the Multiverse.

====Rule-of-Three====
The first principle, the Rule-of-Three, says simply that things tend to happen in threes. The principles which govern the planes are themselves subject to this rule.

====Unity of Rings====
The second principle is the Unity of Rings, and notes that many things on the planes are circular, coming back around to where they started.

====Center of All====
The third principle (fitting neatly into the Rule-of-Three above) is the Center of All, and states that there is a center of everything—or, rather, wherever a person happens to be &quot;is&quot; the center of the multiverse... From their own perspective, at least. As most planes are functionally infinite, disproving anyone&#x27;s centricity would be impossible. In &quot;Planescape&quot;, this is meant philosophically just as much as it is meant in terms of multiversal geography.

The fact that anywhere could be the center of the multiverse in this view also implies that nowhere can be said to be the only absolute true center. This sparks a lot of arguments and violence since some people believe the City of Doors to be the center due to its uncommon number of portals to other planes and position in the Outlands and some factions also claim different centers, each with their own significance.

== Publication history ==
=== Development ===

&quot;Planescape&quot; is an expansion of ideas presented in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (First Edition) and the original &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;. When &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition was published, a decision was made not to include angelic or demonic creatures, and so the cosmology was largely ignored. However, fan demand for a 2nd Edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; was strong enough to justify its expansion into a full-fledged campaign setting, and so in 1994 Planescape was released.

David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook developed Planescape when he was assigned to create &quot;a complete campaign world (not just a place to visit), survivable by low-level characters, as compatible with the old &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; as possible, filled with a feeling of vastness without overwhelming the referee, distinct from all other TSR campaigns, free of the words &#x27;demon&#x27; and &#x27;devil&#x27; and explainable to Marketing in 25 words or less&quot;. For inspiration, Cook listened to Pere Ubu, Philip Glass and &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, read &quot;The Dictionary of the Khazars&quot;, &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Dreams&quot;, and &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;, and for fun at &quot;Bad Movie Nights&quot;, watched such films as &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and &quot;Wolf Devil Woman&quot;.

Cook came up with the idea that all of the activity in Sigil would revolve around factions, each of which would be built upon ideas taken to their extreme. He also felt that Sigil was necessary as a crossroads for the planes and a campaign center which could be both an adventure location itself and somewhere to hide out, which characters could quickly get to and from. Cook decided to adapt the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; because the older material made survival on the planes too difficult or complex, so he ignored anything that made gameplay more complicated, which left the &quot;descriptions of twisted and strange creations&quot;.

Cook conceived of the look for the setting from images such as &quot;the gloomy prisons of Piranesi&#x27;s &quot;Le Carceri&quot; etchings, and Brian Froud&#x27;s illustrations and surrealist art&quot;, and Dana Knutson was assigned to draw whatever Cook wanted to see. According to Cook, &quot;before any of us knew it, [Knutson] drew the Lady of Pain. I&#x27;m very fond of the Lady of Pain; she really locks up the Planescape look. We all liked her so much that she became our logo&quot;.

=== 2nd edition ===
The &quot;Planescape Campaign Setting&quot; was released, for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd Edition, in April 1994. The campaign setting was followed by a series of expansions detailing the &quot;Planes of Chaos&quot; (by Wolfgang Baur and Lester W. Smith), the &quot;Planes of Law&quot; (by Colin McComb and Baur), and the &quot;Planes of Conflict&quot; (by McComb and Dale Donovan). From 1994 to 1998, &quot;&quot;Planescape&quot; was a major setting&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

The setting also had a small number of novels.

=== Later editions ===
Upon the release of 3rd Edition, Planescape, along with most other settings, were discontinued, although fan sites such as planewalker.com were allowed to continue to use the material and update it to the new edition. The 3rd Edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2001), the 3.5 Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2003), and the &quot;Planar Handbook&quot; (2004) also used the general layout of the planes and some of the details from the setting, including Sigil, but these are not part of the Planescape line.

Sigil is described in the 4th edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (2008) and expanded upon in &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide 2&quot; (2009). Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, commented that while Sigil &quot;had been largely ignored during the 3e era&quot;, it &quot;was faring better in 4e, despite the large-scale restructuring of D&amp;D&#x27;s cosmology&quot; due to small inclusions in the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2008) and &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;.

Appelcline highlighted that it was the 4th Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide 2&quot; which &quot;saw the return of the fan-favorite setting of Sigil&quot; which &quot;was laid out as a full paragon-level setting. There&#x27;s not much new here for old-time fans of &quot;Planescape&quot;, but there was one &quot;big&quot; change as a result of &quot;Faction War&quot; (1998). The factions that caused much of the conflict in &quot;Planescape&quot; are now gone. [...] The &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide 2&quot; also contains &#x27;A Conspiracy of Doors&#x27;, the first Sigil adventure to see print in many years&quot;.

The 5th Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) also contains a section explaining the planes and briefly mentions Sigil. There is also some information on Sigil in the 5th Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2014). In July 2022, &quot;Unearthed Arcana: Wonders of the Multiverse&quot; was released as part of the Unearthed Arcana public playtest series for the 5th Edition. Both &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; highlighted that the new character race – the Glitchling – and other references to the Planescape setting might indicate a reboot of the setting for 5th Edition. Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, commented that &quot;this wouldn&#x27;t be the first time that Wizards used playtest materials to tease a reboot of a classic setting&quot;.

Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, wrote that &quot;while described as a collection of material from around the Multiverse, many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fans noticed that it contained multiple references to Mechanus, Sigil, the Outlands, and other areas explored in the popular Planescape setting. [...] Based on the last handful of public playtests, it appears that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is gearing up for some sort of multiversal book in the near future. Whether this is a true Planescape re-launch or just a book that uses the D&amp;D cosmology remains to be seen&quot;.

A three-volume box set titled &quot;Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse&quot; was released in October 2023 for 5th Edition.

==Reception==
&quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine reviewer Scott Haring said &quot;Planescape&quot; is &quot;the finest game world ever produced for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&quot;. Haring described the writing as &quot;wonderful&quot;, also saying that it &quot;has got one of the most distinctive graphic looks I&#x27;ve seen in any game product&quot; and that the &quot;unusual drawings remind [him] a little of Dr. Seuss&quot;.

Trenton Webb of British RPG magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; called Planescape &quot;the premier &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; world&quot;, noting its hallmark as &quot;a bizarre juxtaposition of legend and nightmare&quot;. Game designer Rick Swan said that the original &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; had in a sense been &quot;reincarnated as the Planescape setting ... TSR&#x27;s most ambitious campaign world to date. Abandoning the straightforward but dry approach of the &quot;Manual&quot;, the Planescape set reads less like a textbook and more like a story. Characters take precedence over game systems, high adventure supplants the physics lessons&quot;.

Curtis D. Carbonell, in the book &quot;Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic&quot;, wrote: &quot;Planescape&#x27;s sophistication marked it as D&amp;D&#x27;s answer to its own simplistic medieval-European-inspired fantasy settings, [...]. Planescape channeled the Weird before China Miéville brought the &#x27;new weird&#x27; genre into focus [...]. With Planescape, we have an attempt by an AD&amp;D game setting to add layers of intellectual complexity to a game often driven by much more simplistic mechanism. The greatest commerce isn&#x27;t loot, treasure, magic items, etc.; it is belief so strong it can shape reality&quot;.

In a review of &quot;The Great Modron March&quot;, &quot;Backstab&quot; magazine contributor Philippe Tessier called the presentation of Planescape products superb in general.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;If there is a problem with &quot;Planescape&quot;, it would be its vast strangeness. There&#x27;s a lot to explain and not nearly enough space to fit it all in.&quot; However, Horvath lauded the artwork, saying, &quot;The art picks up where the words leave off. &quot;Planescape&quot; is the apex of the aesthetic-driven, high-concept &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; setting. Dana Knutson developed all of the concept artwork for the setting, which Robh Ruppel turned into covers, and Tony DiTerlizzi used to fill out the interiors.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;&quot;Planescape&quot; often feels built for something besides conflict — the art, the philosophy, and the infinite reaches encourage exploration in a way few other &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings do: Characters are encouraged to just walk off into the multiverse until they find something to wonder at.&quot;

<text>Spelljammer is a campaign setting originally published for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2nd edition) role-playing game, which features a fantastic (as opposed to scientific) outer space environment. Subsequent editions have included &quot;Spelljammer&quot; content; a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition setting update was released on August 16, 2022.

&quot;Spelljammer&quot; introduced into the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics, including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with &quot;spelljamming helms&quot;. Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space. With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere, the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction, but instead look more like galleons, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes.

The &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; to take place within the framework of outer space tropes. Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space, visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects.

Like the Planescape setting, &quot;Spelljammer&quot; unifies most of the other AD&amp;D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting (such as Dragonlance) to travel to another (such as the Forgotten Realms). However, unlike Planescape, it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres, and the &quot;phlogiston&quot; between them, to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries, and to related games and fiction with a steampunk or planetary romance flavor. A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present.

==Publication history==
Shannon Appelcline, in the book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot; (2011), highlighted that in 1989 Spelljammer was the first of a host of new campaign settings published by TSR. It was created by Jeff Grubb and &quot;introduced a universe of magical starships traversing the &#x27;crystal spheres&#x27; that contained all the earthbound AD&amp;D campaign worlds. It suggested a method to connect together all of TSR&#x27;s settings and at the same time introduced fun new Jules Verne-esque technology that had never before been seen in the game. It was innovative and popular&quot;. Appelcline commented that Spelljammer &quot;offered a way to connect every single &quot;D&amp;D&quot; fantasy world, was thus one of the first true crossovers&quot; in role-playing games.

=== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2nd edition) ===
The &quot;&quot; space fantasy boxed set was released in 1989. Several of TSR&#x27;s other campaign worlds had their own sections in the &quot;Spelljammer Boxed Set&quot; - &quot;Realmspace&quot; for the Forgotten Realms, &quot;Krynnspace&quot; for Dragonlance, and &quot;Greyspace&quot; for Greyhawk. Along with the new sphere - &quot;Clusterspace&quot; - they were known as the &quot;Big Three and Astromundi&quot;. Dark Sun, Ravenloft and Mystara weren&#x27;t included, as the first two did not fit with the setting and the Mystara only used the D&amp;D rules, not the AD&amp;D rules.

The product line would be expanded with a number of boxed sets and accessories such as &quot;Lost Ships&quot; (1990), &quot;Realmspace&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Astromundi Cluster&quot; (1993). Appelcline commented that &quot;The Astromundi Cluster&quot; acted as &quot;a soft reboot of the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; line&quot; and was more of setting focused sourcebook than previous Spelljammer books which acted more &quot;as a conduit between all of the other AD&amp;D settings&quot;. The first adventure module, titled &quot;Wildspace&quot;, was released in 1990; four connected adventure modules followed it. A longer campaign module, &quot;Heart of the Enemy&quot;, was then published in 1992 followed by an adventure anthology, &quot;Space Lairs&quot;, in 1993.

The monsters of &quot;Spelljammer&quot; were detailed in two installments of the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series, &quot;Spelljammer Appendix&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Spelljammer Appendix II&quot; in 1991.

In 1993, &quot;Space Lairs&quot; and &quot;The Astromundi Cluster&quot; were the final products of the line. Appelcline commented on the end of the setting in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; era: &quot;TSR&#x27;s fifth second-edition campaign world, Planescape (1993), was released to replace Spelljammer, which had just then ended. TSR wanted a new world-spanning setting and Slade Henson came up with the answer by suggesting a new setting built on Jeff Grubb&#x27;s first-edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; (1987). [...] Unlike Spelljammer this new setting had a strong geographical centre, the City of Sigil, resolving a flaw in the Spelljammer setting that denied players a good home base&quot;.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (3rd edition) ===
The &quot;Spelljammer&quot; line of products was discontinued by TSR before they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast in 1997.

In May 2002, Paizo published an article for Spelljammer in &quot;Dungeon&quot; #92 titled &quot;Spelljammer: Shadow of the Spider Moon&quot;. Using the D20 system, it provided new rules for firearms and spelljamming, as well as skills, feats and prestige classes. Spelljammer monsters such as neogi and giff were not used. Instead, it featured creatures from the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; such as drow, formians and yuan-ti.

In May 2005, Wizards of the Coast updated the neogi to the 3.5 edition rules in the supplement &quot;Lords of Madness&quot; (2005). The book included a chapter with a sample map of a crashed Spelljamming vessel, cultural habits of the neogi, and the monster&#x27;s stat blocks.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (4th edition) ===
A &quot;Spelljammer&quot; homage appears in the 4th edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;; the sourcebook highlights Spelljammer ships as one method of traveling between planes and provides information for in-game use of Spelljammer vessels.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (5th edition) ===
&quot;Spelljammer&quot; content also appears in the 5th Edition adventure module &quot;&quot; (2018). In the adventure, a spelljamming ship and its illithid captain appear stranded in level 19 of the titular dungeon. Then in October 2021, Wizards released the PDF &quot;Travelers of the Multiverse&quot; which is part of the &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; public playtest series. Of the six player races it included, four races (autognome, giff, hadozee, and plasmoid) are closely associated with the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting. Both &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; highlighted that this playtest could indicate a future &quot;Spelljammer&quot; reboot.

Wizards of the Coast released a new boxed set titled &quot;&quot; on August 16, 2022; this release updates the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting for the 5th Edition. The box set includes a Dungeon Master&#x27;s screen, a double-sided poster map and three 64-page hardcover books: &quot;Astral Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (a Dungeon Master guide), &quot;Boo&#x27;s Astral Menagerie&quot; (a bestiary), and &quot;Light of Xaryxis&quot; (an adventure module). A special edition, with cover art by Hydro74, was also released. A prequel adventure module, titled &quot;Spelljammer Academy&quot;, was released for free on the Wizards of the Coast website and on D&amp;D Beyond in July of the same year.

&quot;Monstrous Compendium Vol 1: Spelljammer Creatures&quot; introduced ten creatures from the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; setting to the 5th Edition in April 2022.

==Fictional setting==
=== Spelljamming helms ===
&quot;Spelljamming helms&quot; are the central setting concept which allow interplanetary and interstellar space travel for vessels which would otherwise not be spaceworthy, in the form of a helm. Any spellcaster may sit on a spelljammer helm to move the ship. The mysterious race known as the Arcane is the sole manufacturer and distributor of spelljamming helms. Within the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; universe, they are a method of converting magical energy into motive power.

===Gravity and air===
All bodies of a sufficiently large size have gravity. This gravity usually (but not always) exerts a force equal to the standard gravitational attraction on the surface of an Earth-sized planetary body. Gravity in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; universe is also an exceptionally convenient force, and almost always works such that &quot;down&quot; orients itself in a manner most humanoids would find sensible.

All bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object. Unlike real-world astrophysics, this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space. These bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time, but 3 months is considered &quot;standard&quot;.

===Crystal spheres===

A crystal sphere (also known as a crystal shell) is a gigantic spherical shell which contains an entire planetary system. Each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that is farthest from the sun or planet at the center of the sphere (the system&#x27;s primary).

The surface of the sphere is called the &quot;sphere wall&quot; and separates the void of &quot;wildspace&quot; (within the sphere) from the &quot;phlogiston&quot; (that surrounds and flows outside the sphere). The sphere wall has no gravity and appears to be impossible to damage by any normal or magical means. Openings in the sphere wall called &quot;portals&quot; allow spelljamming ships or wildspace creatures to pass through and enter or exit from a crystal sphere. Portals can spontaneously open and close anywhere on the sphere wall. Magical spells (or magical items that reproduce their effects) can allow a portal to be located. Other magic can open a new portal or collapse an existing one. Ships or creatures passing through a portal when it closes may be cut in two.

Note that unlike the Ptolemaic system, the crystal spheres are not nested within each other.

===Wildspace===
Wildspace is similar to the outer space of science fiction, with planets, asteroids and stars, but with different physics. Gravity is either none or the same as that of Earth, and is directed towards the center of planet-sized bodies; on large objects in space like spacecraft and enormous creatures gravity is directed towards a flat plane running through the object&#x27;s long axis, allowing characters to stand on the decks of ships.

===The Phlogiston===
The phlogiston is essentially a big ocean of a unique element that is neither air, fire, water, or earth. The phlogiston (also known as &quot;the Flow&quot;) is a bright, extremely combustible gas-like medium that exists between the Crystal Spheres. A signature property of the substance is that it does not exist within the boundaries of a crystal sphere, to the degree that it cannot be brought into a crystal sphere by any known means up to and including the direct will of deities. Every crystal sphere floats in the phlogiston, very slowly bobbing up and down over time. Travel between Crystal Spheres is facilitated by the formation of &quot;Flow rivers&quot; — sections of the phlogiston which have a and greatly reduce travel time. Travel through the &quot;slow flow&quot; (i.e. off the Flow rivers) is possible, but very dangerous.

===The &quot;Spelljammer&quot;===
The &quot;Spelljammer&quot; is a legendary ship which looks like a gigantic manta ray, and houses an entire city on its back. All spacefarers (people who live in wildspace) have heard of the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; but very few have ever seen it themselves. It is this ship that gives its name to &quot;spelljamming&quot;, &quot;spelljamming helms&quot; and anything else connected with spelljamming. The ship has been reported to have been seen in countless spheres for as long as records go back. Even some groundlings (people who live on planets that have very little or no commerce with spelljamming communities) have legends about it. There are hundreds of conflicting legends about this ship, and a mythology has developed about the ship that is similar to the legends surrounding &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;.

As a living thing (although it does not consume any matter, it does absorb heat and light through its ventral (or under) side and uses them to produce air and food for its inhabitants), the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; has a complex life cycle and means of procreation. Normally the ship has no captain and wanders the cosmos seemingly aimlessly. When the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; has a captain, obtained through another complex process, it will create Smalljammers (miniature versions of the &quot;Spelljammer&quot;) that go forth as its spawn. Apparently there can only be one Spelljammer at any one time. One Smalljammer will mature into a full &quot;Spelljammer&quot; ship if its predecessor is ever destroyed.

===Races===
Alien races inhabiting the Spelljammer universe included humans, dwarves, xenophobic beholders, rapacious neogi, militant giff (humanoid hippopotami), centaurlike dracons, hubristic elf armadas, spacefaring orcs called &quot;scro&quot;, mysterious arcane, the Thri-kreen insectoids, and bumbling tinker gnomes. Illithids were another major race, but were presented as more mercantile and less overtly evil than in other D&amp;D settings. The &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series added many more minor races. The simian Hadozee were also introduced into the setting, and later incorporated into the 3.5 rules in the supplemental book &quot;Stormwrack&quot;.

==Official products==
Spelljammer has acted as the official campaign setting for multiple &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying adventure modules, sourcebooks and accessories.
== In other media ==
===Comics===
Fifteen comics set in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; universe were published by DC Comics between September 1990 and November 1991 with the creative team of Barbara Kesel, Michael Collins and Dan Panosian. &quot;Spelljammer&quot; comics also uses Jasmine, a winged human character originally introduced from Forgotten Realms comics, as one of the lead characters.

=== Music ===
Wizards of the Coast released a soundtrack, titled &quot;&quot;, for &quot;Spelljammer: Adventures in Space&quot; digitally on August 16, 2022; each song on the soundrack corresponds with one of the chapters in the adventure module &quot;Light of Xaryxis&quot;.

===Novels===
Six novels set in the &quot;Spelljammer&quot; universe were published by TSR, before TSR was incorporated into Wizards of the Coast. The novels were interconnected and formed &quot;The Cloakmaster Cycle&quot;. The novels tell the story of Teldin Moore, a &#x27;groundling&#x27; farmer on Krynn who has a powerful and apparently cursed magical cloak that was given to him. He then ends up on a quest, which takes him first into wildspace and then away from his home sphere to distant crystal spheres. The series showcases the wonders and perils of the Spelljammer universe. The novels are now out of print.

===Computer games===
The only &quot;Spelljammer&quot; computer game ever produced was &quot;&quot;, published by SSI in 1992.

In 2002 a team of freelance game modification developers created &quot;The Arcane Space Tileset&quot; for &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. This tileset included Spelljamming ships, space and atmospheric terrains, along with monsters and NPCs, all set within the Spelljammer Campaign setting.

=== Web series ===
&quot;Legends of the Multiverse&quot; is an official actual play streaming series broadcast on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; channels which premiered on April 27, 2022 and is set in the Spelljammer campaign setting. It stars Deborah Ann Woll, B. Dave Walters, Gina Darling, Meagan Kenreck, and Todd Kenreck. It will also feature guest stars such as Brennan Lee Mulligan, Aabria Iyengar, Ginny Di, Anna Prosser, Deejay Knight, Emme Montgomery, Travis McElroy, SungWon Cho, and Jim Zub.

==Reception==
In the January 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (issue #12), James Wallis was not a fan of the initial release, &quot;&quot;, finding inconsistencies in the combat rules, saying that the cumulative effect of these inconsistencies is to make space combat unplayable. He did find the background &quot;imaginative and consistent&quot;, but very little of it. Although he admired the production values of the components, he found the book disorganized to the point of &quot;disarray and confusion&quot;. He concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5, saying that &quot;&quot;Spelljammer&quot; may score well physically but fails mentally [...] Scavenging &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; players who enjoy stripping tasty ideas from the carcasses of dying games may find it of interest, but I cannot recommend it to anyone else&quot;.

Alexander Sowa, for &quot;CBR&quot; in October 2021, commented that Spelljammer should be one of the classic settings Wizards of the Coast brings back for the 5th Edition. Sowa wrote that &quot;players have been asking for Spelljammer to be introduced to &quot;5e&quot; since the release of the first setting sourcebook. Wizards tossed them a bone with the Dream of The Blue Veil spell added in &quot;Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything&quot;, but it&#x27;s not a replacement for the niche Spelljammer previously filled. It&#x27;s not just a way to travel between different campaign settings; it&#x27;s a simultaneous fulfillment of sci-fi and fantasy dreams of exploration, venturing deep into unknown depths and contending with the strange and otherworldly&quot;.

Spelljammer was #3 on &quot;The Gamer&quot;&#x27;s 2022 &quot;The 8 Best Dungeons &amp; Dragons Settings Ever&quot; list — the article states that &quot;Spelljammer is one of the most unique settings on this list, with endless possibilities brought up in its planet-hopping realms. The Spelljammer setting can almost best be surmised as &#x27;pirates meets sci-fi fantasy&#x27; with its blend of magical worlds and galaxy-traversing galleons&quot;. In a separate article for &quot;The Gamer&quot;, in February 2022, Paul DiSalvo commented that &quot;while D&amp;D&#x27;s second edition was home to a wide range of Spelljammer books including several adventure modules, the setting has since faded into obscurity, with it not being prominently featured within the game&#x27;s third, fourth, and fifth editions&quot;.

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath called the game &quot;gloriously bewildering.&quot; Horvath also noted the new edition being launched for the 5th edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, commenting &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine something so weird as the original coming out today — the new version already seems different, a little less odd, a little more formulaic.&quot;

<doc id="46934" wikidata="Q2069999" url="?curid=46934" title="Drow">
<text>The drow ( or ) or dark elves are a dark-skinned and white-haired subrace of elves connected to the subterranean Underdark in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy roleplaying game. The drow have traditionally been portrayed as generally evil and connected to the evil spider goddess Lolth. However, later editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; have moved away from this portrayal and preassigned alignment. More recent publications have explored drow societies unconnected to Lolth.
== Creative origins ==
The word &quot;drow&quot; originates from the Orcadian and Shetland dialects of Scots, an alternative form of &quot;trow&quot;, which is a cognate with &quot;troll&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives no entry for &quot;drow&quot;, but two of the citations under &quot;trow&quot; name it as an alternative form of the word. Trow/drow was used to refer to a wide variety of evil sprites. Everything about the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; drow was invented by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; co-creator Gary Gygax except for the basic concept of &quot;dark elves&quot;. However, in the Prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson wrote about the black elves: &quot;... the dark elves however live down below the ground. ... [and] are blacker than pitch.&quot;

Gygax stated that &quot;Drow are mentioned in Keightley&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy Mythology&quot;, as I recall (it might have been &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;—neither book is before me, and it is not all that important anyway), and as Dark Elves of evil nature, they served as an ideal basis for the creation of a unique new mythos designed especially for the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game.&quot; Gygax later stated that he took the term from a listing in the &quot;Funk &amp; Wagnall&#x27;s Unexpurgated Dictionary&quot;, and no other source at all. &quot;I wanted a most unusual race as the main power in the Underdark, so used the reference to &#x27;dark elves&#x27; from the dictionary to create the Drow.&quot; There seems to be no work with this title. However, the following entry can be found in abridged editions of Funk &amp; Wagnall&#x27;s &quot;Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, such as &quot;The Desk Standard Dictionary of the English Language&quot;: &quot;[Scot.] In folk-lore, one of a race of underground elves represented as skillful workers in metal. Compare TROLL. [Variant of TROLL.] trow &quot; 

== Publication history ==

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition===
The drow were first mentioned in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game in the 1st Edition 1977 &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; &quot;Monster Manual&quot; under the &quot;Elf&quot; entry, where it is stated that &quot;The &#x27;Black Elves,&#x27; or drow, are only legend.&quot; No statistics are given for the drow in this book, apart from the statistics for normal elves. The drow are described as purportedly dwelling deep beneath the surface world, in strange subterranean realms. They are said to be evil, &quot;as dark as faeries are bright&quot;, and pictured in tales as poor fighters but strong magic-users. From 1978 to 1980, the &quot;Greyhawk&quot; adventure module series explored the drow in depth, including statblocks for drow and an introduction to their Underdark society.

The first hardcover &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rulebook featuring statistical information on the drow was the original &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981). Gygax wrote this entry, listed under &quot;Elf, Drow&quot;, according to the book&#x27;s credits section. The text is a slightly abridged version of the text originally found in modules G3 and D3. Likewise, Lolth&#x27;s description from module D3 is reprinted in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; under the &quot;Demon&quot; heading.

The drow were first presented as a player character race in &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (1985), also written by Gygax. Several elven sub-races are described in the book, including gray elves, wood elves, wild elves, and valley elves; the dark elves are described as the most divergent sub-race, and dark elf player characters are considered outcasts from their homeland, either by choice, differing from the standard chaotic evil alignment of the race, or having lost in some family-wide power struggle.

==== &quot;Greyhawk&quot; module storyline ====

It is hinted in G1 &quot;Steading of the Hill Giant Chief&quot; (1978) that there is a &quot;secret force, some motivational power behind this unusual banding of different races of giants.&quot; G2 &quot;The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl&quot; (1978) mentions this guiding force again in its introduction. The third module in the series, G3 &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot; (1978) again mentions the party&#x27;s need to find out whatever is behind the giants&#x27; alliance, and this time mentions the drow specifically by name. In the adventure, the player characters can discover the first hint of drow involvement in the fire giant king&#x27;s council room, on a scroll which promises &quot;powerful help from the Drow&quot;, signed by Eclavdra. Actual drow can be encountered starting on level #2 of the king&#x27;s hall, beginning with a group of drow priests, and then other drow later.

Having discovered that the drow instigated the alliance between the races of giants and its warfare against mankind, in &quot;D1 Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot; (1978) the party follows the fleeing drow into the tunnels leading northwest and deep into the earth, to eliminate the threat they pose. Examining a golden spider pin found on one of the drow priestesses, the party can discover runes in the drow language reading &quot;Lolth, Death Queen Mother&quot;. The party continues to pursue the drow in D2 &quot;Shrine of the Kuo-Toa&quot; (1978). In &quot;D3 Vault of the Drow&quot; (1978), the adventurers eventually make it to Erelhei-Cinlu, the vast subterranean city of the drow, which is thoroughly described in the module. An extensive overview of the drow power structure is given for the purpose of creating any number of mini-campaigns or adventures taking place inside the drow capital. The characters travel on to the Egg of Lolth, where they must enter the dungeon level and fight the demoness herself. The statistics and information for drow are reprinted from &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot; in the back of this module, along with statistics for Lolth herself.

The story concludes in module &quot;Q1 Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot; (1980). The astral gate from &quot;D3&quot; leads to the Abyssal realm of Lolth, goddess of the drow elves and Demon Queen of Spiders; Lolth is the architect of the sinister plot described in the two previous series of modules. At the very end of the module, the players face a final confrontation with Lolth, an exceptionally difficult challenge. The G1-G3 modules were later published together in 1981 as a single combined module as &quot;G1-2-3 Against the Giants&quot;, and the entire series of modules in which the drow originally appeared were later published together in &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot; (1986).

===Novels===
Gary Gygax&#x27;s 1986 novel for TSR&#x27;s &quot;Greyhawk Adventures&quot; series, &quot;Artifact of Evil&quot;, was the first novel to feature the drow prominently. Gygax&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Gord the Rogue&quot; novels, published by New Infinities, Inc., continued the story and the drow&#x27;s involvement, in the novels &quot;Sea of Death&quot; (1987), &quot;Come Endless Darkness&quot; (1988), and &quot;Dance of Demons&quot; (1988).

R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s 1988–1990 &quot;The Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot; featured the unlikely hero Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden as one of the protagonists, and the 1990–1991 followup &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; focused on Drizzt and the drow of the Forgotten Realms setting. Salvatore continued the story of Drizzt and the drow in his subsequent series &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; (1992–1996), &quot;Paths of Darkness&quot; (1998–2001), and &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Blades Trilogy&quot; (2002–2004). Other works continuing the story of the drow in the Forgotten Realms include Elaine Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Starlight and Shadows&quot; series (1995–1996, 2003), the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series (2002–2005, various authors), and Lisa Smedman&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Penitent&quot; series (2007–2008).

Keith Baker&#x27;s &quot;The Dreaming Dark&quot; trilogy (2005–2006) featured the story of the drow in Baker&#x27;s world of Eberron.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition&quot;===
The drow appear first for this edition in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume Two&quot; (1989), which expands the information on drow society. Also included in the entry for drow is a description and statistics for the drider. This entry is reprinted with some minor modifications in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993).

Drow society, religion, history, magic, craftwork, and language for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting is detailed significantly in &quot;The Drow of the Underdark&quot; (1991), by Ed Greenwood. Greenwood appears in the book&#x27;s introduction as a narrator, explaining how he came across the information in the book: a discussion with Elminster, and chance encounter with a former apprentice of Elminster—the drow lady, Susprina Arkhenneld—as the two explain the drow of the world to the narrator.

The drow are presented as a player character race for 2nd edition in &quot;The Complete Book of Elves&quot; (1992). Drow deities Lolth, Kiaransalee, Vhaeraun, and Zinzerena are described in &quot;Monster Mythology&quot; (1992). The drow are later presented as a playable character race again in &quot;Player&#x27;s Option: Skills &amp; Powers&quot; (1995).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition===
The drow appears in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2000). The drow of the Forgotten Realms setting appear in the hardcover &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (2001), and in &quot;Races of Faerûn&quot; (2003). The drow also appears in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for the 3.5 edition (2003).

The &quot;Underdark&quot; hardcover for the Forgotten Realms setting (2003) features the drow yet again as a player character race, as does the &quot;Player&#x27;s Guide to Faerûn&quot; (2004). &quot;Lost Empires of Faerûn&quot; describes the drow werebat (2005). The drow paragon 3-level prestige class appears in &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; (2004).

In 2004, the new Eberron campaign setting introduced drow in a world where Lolth doesn&#x27;t exist; various drow societies were then explored in more detail in &quot;Secrets of Xen&#x27;drik&quot; (2006). Additionally, the umbragen for the setting appeared as a player character race in &quot;Dragon&quot; #330 (April 2005).

The arcane guard drow, the dark sniper drow, the drow priestess, the Lolth&#x27;s sting, and the Lolth-touched drow ranger appear in &quot;Monster Manual IV&quot; (2006). The deepwyrm drow is presented as a player character race in &quot;Dragon Magic&quot; (2006).

The drow are presented as a player character race for the 3.5 edition in &quot;Expedition to the Demonweb Pits&quot; (2007) and &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; (2007). &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; also features the arcane guard, the drow assassin, the house captain, the house wizard, the drow inquisitor, the favored consort, the drow priestess, the drow slaver, the spider sentinel, the albino drow (szarkai), the szarkai fighters, the szarkai druids, and the drow warrior, along with numerous prestige classes and other monsters related to drow.

====Open gaming====
The release of the Open Game License and the System Reference Document&#x27;s inclusion of the drow race also led to a number of books related to drow being published by companies not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast, such as &quot;The Quintessential Drow&quot;, &quot;The Complete Guide to Drow&quot;, and &quot;Encyclopaedia Arcane: Drow Magic&quot;.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition===
The drow appear in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for this edition (2008), including the drow warrior, the drow arachnomancer, the drow blademaster, and the drow priest. The drow appear as a playable race in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2008) and the &quot;Essentials&quot; rulebook &quot;Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms&quot; (2010).

The drow feature in a pre-written playable module called &quot;Demon Queen&#x27;s Enclave&quot; (2008) which takes adventurers from levels 14 through 17 into the Underdark to battle the forces of Orcus and possibly ally with members of the treacherous dark elves and/or their minions. The drow of Xen&#x27;drik are also outlined in the 4E &quot;Eberron Campaign Guide&quot; (2009).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition===
The drow appear as a playable elf subrace in the &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) for this edition. They also appear in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014) for this edition. In the adventure module &quot;Out of the Abyss&quot; (2015), the players are captured by the drow at the beginning of the adventure. The drow are also discussed in the &quot;Sword Coast Adventurer&#x27;s Guide&quot; (2015) and in the &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Tome of Foes&quot; (2018) supplements, including write-ups for their pantheon updated to the 5E &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; status-quo.

The drow of Xen&#x27;drik are again outlined in &quot;&quot; (2019). The new Exandria campaign setting added a non-Lolth based society of drow which was introduced in the &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Guide to Wildemount&quot; (2020). Per Wizards of the Coast, the drow of these settings are presented as more &quot;morally and culturally complex&quot;. On June 26, 2020, Netflix and Hulu removed the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; episode of the TV series &quot;Community&quot; from their platforms due to scenes with Chang playing a dark elf by wearing elf ears and makeup resembling blackface. A statement from Sony Pictures Television said that the studio supported the decision to remove the episode.

Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, highlighted a 2021 update on Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden by Wizards of the Coast and wrote, &quot;it also notes one major change to D&amp;D canon that relates to the drow culture that Drizzt ultimately abandoned. The website points out that while Drizzt grew up in a &#x27;cult of Lolth&#x27; [...], there are two other entire cultures of drow who have no ties to Lolth whatsoever. [...] The reveal of the Lorendrow and Aevendrow seem to suggest that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is officially moving past some long-held canon about the drow&quot;. Tika Viteri, for &quot;Book Riot&quot;, highlighted that Salvatore&#x27;s &quot;Starlight Enclave&quot; (2021) &quot;contains a singular shift in the narrative of the story of the drow; Salvatore reveals that drow are not, in fact, the only dark-skinned elves in the Forgotten Realms&quot;.

==== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024&quot; ====
The drow appears as an Elven Lineage in this edition (2024) offering darkvision, and additional cantrips.

The updated rule book states that &quot;Some drow individuals and societies avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its magic. In the Eberron setting, for example, drow dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent of Xen&#x27;drik&quot;

==Reception==
Made famous by R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s Drizzt novels, these dark elves from the game influenced subsequent works of fantasy. Drow have a gender-based caste system that one author claims says &quot;a great deal about attitudes towards gender roles in the real world&quot;.

The drow originally created by Gary Gygax are now &quot;essentially the drow of fantasy fiction today&quot;, according to Ed Greenwood, who believes them to be &quot;arguably Gary Gygax&#x27;s greatest, most influential fantasy creation&quot; after the D&amp;D game itself. Designer James Jacobs considers the drow to be a rare example of a D&amp;D-invented monster becoming mainstream, with even non-gamers recognizing them. Rob Bricken, for &quot;Io9&quot;, named the drow as the eighth most memorable &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monster. In the 1990s, products which featured drow produced higher sales. While Paizo Publishing was printing &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot;, covers featuring drow often sold better than other issues in the same year. Academic Steven Holmes noted that drow &quot;remain highly visible in successful media projects&quot;.

Holmes highlighted that Gygax created drow as &quot;perfect villains—endpoints on a divide of good and evil&quot;. However, Holmes thought R. A. Salvatore&#x27;s depiction was more complicated than Gygax&#x27;s and Salvatore&#x27;s work &quot;in many ways&quot; ended up as the definitive portrayal of the drow. In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, in his review of &quot;Homeland&quot; by Salvatore, Bricken says that &quot;its greatest strength is how it explores drow society, which up to that point was best summarized as &#x27;very evil.&#x27; Prior to Drizzt, in the vein of orcs, trolls, and primary-colored dragons, the Drow were essentially categorized as more monsters for players to battle and defeat. Their skin was obsidian black, earning them the alternate name of dark elves, and marking them as the evil counterpart to the good and heroic lighter-skinned elves of the surface.&quot;

=== As player characters ===
The drow, especially when used as player characters, are surrounded by much controversy, especially after the release of Salvatore&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;. Game designer James Jacobs has said that the drow player characters often spark arguments, with some players refusing to play in a campaign that allows drow PCs. Jacobs says that &quot;even the name&quot; is controversial, having at least two pronunciations. Rob Bricken, for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, wrote that there &quot;has been one good Drow in the history of D&amp;D, and that&#x27;s Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, who is one of the Mary Sue-iest characters in all of fiction—and he&#x27;s been the star of countless novels and is the only reason any D&amp;D player has even been interested in the Drow, of which now there is a terrifying amount of material&quot;.

Matthew Beilman, for &quot;CBR&quot;, highlighted multiple reasons to play as a drow character: You will love playing a drow if you enjoy making others uncomfortable. In most &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings, the drow civilization is evil. [...] This makes them excellent campaign villains but also gives them great potential as antiheroes who lack traditional heroic attributes [...]. Playing a drow can also present an opportunity to play against traditional gender norms. [...] The drow are outsiders, even in settings that do not include Lolth and her corruptive influence. These campaigns might not have evil societies of dark elves, but they still tend to make them into foreigners with strange customs [...]. Playing a misunderstood, feared yet potentially heroic character can be great fun. In contrast, in his review of &quot;&quot; for &quot;DieHard GameFan&quot;, Alex Lucard wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ll be honest: I&#x27;ve never understood the appeal of the Drow at all. They just seemed overly angsty and dark for the sake of being dark. I&#x27;ve been bored by the novels where they are the featured race and I&#x27;ve generally avoided them unless someone is making fun of them&quot;.

=== Inherent characteristics ===

Some critics have highlighted that the drow are &quot;dark skinned and inherently evil&quot; and are connected to the &quot;racist idea that non-white people are inherently bad&quot;. In the academic journal &quot;Mythlore&quot;, Holmes argued that the depiction of drow was an example of various creators using &quot;negative estrangement&quot; within the narrative &quot;to create a &#x27;more evil&#x27; antagonist to serve as a foil for narrative protagonists&quot; and this narrative process &quot;warps&quot; and &quot;strips&quot; stereotypes &quot;of their context in order to use them like ingredients in a recipe for a compelling villain&quot;. Holmes also highlighted the inconsistent artistic portrayal over time as &quot;the black skin of the drow is not&quot; consistently used across all products—this meant that when &quot;some saw the drow as a fantastical race of spider-themed elves, others saw them as one of the very few depictions of black-skinned people in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&quot; and the inconsistent &quot;visual representation&quot; then &quot;further compounds the complexity of discussing the relationship of the drow to real world race, given that some players may see the drow as obviously modeled on real world black bodies, and others seeing them as a fantasy race with no realworld analogue&quot;.

In 2010, scholar Cory Lowell Grewell found that in the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; video game series, &quot;issues of contemporary race relations are brought to the fore in the player-Character&#x27;s interactions with the dark-skinned Drow Elves.&quot; In the book &quot;Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy&quot; (2012), author James Rocha states that the difference between drow and dark elves in the Forgotten Realms setting is rooted in racist stereotypes: &quot;an acceptable lighter skinned dark race side by side with only the most rare exceptions in the darker race, which is thought to be inherently evil, mirrors American history in a very uncomfortable fashion&quot;. In a retrospective on the legacy of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, academic Daniel Heath Justice also commented that the &quot;&quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; was explicitly based on the civilized-versus-savage binary and leaned in hard on racial essentialism in its sadistic black-skinned drow led by vicious matriarchs and their terrible spider goddess, firmly melding anti-Blackness with misogyny, a once-civilized people gone feral under the debased rule of women&quot;. 

In response to this criticism in 2020, Wizards of the Coast stated: &quot;we present orcs and drow in a new light in two of our most recent books, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Guide to Wildemount&quot;. In those books, orcs and drow are just as morally and culturally complex as other peoples. We will continue that approach in future books, portraying all the peoples of D&amp;D in relatable ways and making it clear that they are as free as humans to decide who they are and what they do&quot;. Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, highlighted a 2021 &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; lore update on the Wizards of the Coast website: While Drizzt himself is proof that all drow aren&#x27;t inherently evil, many fans still think that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; lore needs major updates when it comes to the drow. The main issue is that the drow (like other &#x27;evil&#x27; races) are presented as a large monolithic society dedicated to evil instead of a group with multiple competing interests and beliefs. It&#x27;s not that some drow, or even a city or country of drow, are seen as evil—it&#x27;s that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; lore has traditionally considered evil drow to be the default. [...] By bringing in two entirely new cultures of drow that have rejected Lolth, it seems that the lore will show that drow are just as complex and multi-faceted as the many other elven subraces in the game. Holmes commented that &quot;to some extent, the current revisions being applied to race, half races, and the drow specifically reflect longstanding tensions in gaming spaces&quot; and how audience views around &quot;narrative subjects change over time&quot;. Holmes thought Wizards of the Coast appears to be aiming for a &quot;middle ground&quot; where &quot;drow are not intrinsically evil&quot; by allowing players to decide if they want to play as an evil drow who adheres to Lolth or play as a &quot;good drow&quot; who deals with &quot;overcoming the racism of the world based on the violence of Lolth-sworn drow. This allows Wizards of the Coast to retain the brand identity of the drow that drove sales of drow-related products for thirty years, while shifting emphasis away from an implied endorsement of naturalized racism&quot;.

==Fictional description==

The drow made their first statistical appearance in the Greyhawk adventure module &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot; (1978) at the end of the module, and received a lengthy writeup. The history of the drow within the game is revealed; in ages past, the elves were torn by discord and warfare, driving out from their surface lands their selfish and cruel members, who sought safety in the underworld. These creatures, later known as the &quot;dark elvenfolk&quot; or drow, grew strong in the arcane arts over the centuries and content with their gloomy fairyland beneath the earth, though they still bear enmity towards and seek revenge against their distant kin, the elves and faeries who drove them down. They are described as chaotic evil in alignment, and highly intelligent. They are described as black-skinned and pale haired in appearance, around 5-feet tall and slight of build with somewhat sharp features, with large eyes and large pointed ears. Drow are difficult to surprise as they are able to see very well in the dark, have an intuitive sense about their underground world similar to that of dwarves, and can detect hidden or secret doors as easily as other elves do. Drow are highly resistant to magic, while all drow have the ability to use some inherent magical abilities even if they are not strictly spellcasters. The module also reveals that there are rumors of vast caverns housing whole cities of drow which exist somewhere deep beneath the earth, and now that the drow have dwelled in these dark labyrinthe places they dislike daylight and other forms of bright light as it hampers their abilities. They are able to communicate using a silent language composed of hand movements, and when coupled with facial and body expression, movement, and posture, this form of communication is the equal of any spoken language.

The &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game&#x27;s second edition product &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume Two&quot; (1989) describes the world of the drow, where violent conflict is part of everyday life, so much so that most drow encountered are ready for a fight. Their inherent magic use comes from training in magic, which all drow receive. Not long after the creation of the elves, they were torn into rival factions, one evil and one good; after a great civil war, those who followed the path of evil and chaos were driven far from the world&#x27;s forests and into the bleak, lightless caverns and tunnels of the underworld. Drow society is fragmented into opposing noble houses and merchant families, and they base their rigid class system on the belief that the strongest should rule. Female drow tend to fill many positions of great importance, with priests of the dark goddess Lolth holding a very high place in society. Drow fighters are required to go through rigorous training in their youth, and those who fail are put to death. Drow constantly war with other underground neighbors such as dwarves and deep gnomes (svirfneblin), and keep slaves of all types—including allies who fail to live up to drow expectations.

&quot;The Complete Book of Elves&quot; (1993) by Colin McComb focuses some of its attention on the drow. The &quot;Elfwar&quot; is presented, an elven myth in which the elves were one people until the Spider Queen Lolth used the dissent among the elves to gain a foothold; the elves of Lolth took the name Drow to signify their new allegiance, but as they massed to conquer the other elves, Corellon Larethian and his followers drove Lolth and her people deep into the earth, where they chose to remain. The dark elves who became the drow were originally simply elves who held more with the tenets of might than those of justice, and as they quested for power they became corrupted and turned against their fairer brethren. Any elf character of good or neutral alignment, even drow, is allowed into the realm of Arvanaith where elves go upon reaching old age. The book notes that drow player characters have a large number of benefits while suffering few disadvantages, but that &quot;the major disadvantage to being a drow &quot;is&quot; being a drow.&quot; Drow characters are extraordinarily dexterous and intelligent, but have the typically low elf constitution; also, their personalities are described as grating at best, and all other elves &quot;hate&quot; the drow which affects their reactions to a drow character.

In the 5th Edition Basic Rules, drow are described as a subrace of elves with a connection to Underdark magic. Additionally, it states, &quot;the cult of the god Lolth, Queen of Spiders, has corrupted some of the oldest drow cities, especially in the worlds of Oerth and Toril. Eberron, Krynn, and other realms have escaped the cult&#x27;s influence—for now. Wherever the cult lurks, drow heroes stand on the front lines in the war against it, seeking to sunder Lolth&#x27;s web&quot;. &quot;Mordenkainen&#x27;s Tome of Foes&quot; (2018) retells the story of Corellon and Lolth; the elves who supported Lolth were cast &quot;into darkness. They became a people wholly dedicated to Lolth and her scheming and for many, many centuries were viewed in the multi-verse as a people of evil&quot;. However, since all elves are descended from Corellon, the drow have the ability to &quot;break free of Lolth&#x27;s influence&quot; and turn to &quot;the light within themselves&quot;.

== Fictional ecology ==

=== Abilities ===

With the ability to resist magic and powerful darkvision, drow are more powerful than many of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;″ races. Drow possess natural magical abilities which enables them to summon globes of darkness, outline targets in faerie fire which causes no harm but makes the target brightly visible to everyone who sees them, and create magical balls of light. They can also levitate for short periods of time. They live to extraordinarily long ages if not killed by violence first, over a thousand years in some cases. Their hearing and vision are better than that of a human being and they are difficult to sneak up on because of this. They naturally excel at moving silently. Drow also employ the unusual hand crossbow, firing small, though very lethal, darts.

In Lolth based societies, noble drow males are commonly wizards or fighters. Female nobles are almost always clerics and almost never wizards.

===Alignment===
As a race, drow were traditionally portrayed evil. There were unusual exceptions, the most notable being Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, Jarlaxle Baenre, and Liriel Baenre. Originally, drow were chaotic evil in alignment. Beginning with 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, drow were usually neutral evil. There have been encounters with non-evil drow, but these are distrusted as much as their brethren, due to their reputation. In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, the Drow followers of Eilistraee were originally the largest group of good Drow, as Eilistraee is the patron goddess of all Drow that have a good alignment.

The 4th Edition &quot;Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms&quot; (2010) does not suggest any typical alignment for drow player characters; however, it highlights the drow that break away from the evil Lolth based societies. The 5th Edition &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (2014) described drow as &quot;more often evil than not&quot;. In 2021, official errata removed the suggested alignments for playable races, including drow, in all 5th Edition sourcebooks. As of &quot;Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse&quot; (2022), creature stat blocks that also have playable races &quot;now state that they can be any alignment&quot;.

===Environment===
Within the context of many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign settings, the drow were forced underground in what is now known as the Underdark after the great war amongst the elves, a vast system of caverns and tunnels spanning much of the continent. The drow live in city-states in the Underdark, becoming one of the most powerful races therein.

The drow are well adapted to seeing in the dark, and they loathe, are terrified of, and are easily blinded by the light of the surface. Some magic weapons, armor, and various other items of the drow disintegrate or lose their magical properties if exposed to the sun.

===Typical physical characteristics===
Drow characters are extremely intelligent, charismatic and dexterous, but share surface elves&#x27; comparative frailty and slight frames. Females tend to be bigger and stronger than males. Drow are characterized by white or silver hair and obsidian black skin. Their eyes are red (or rarely gray, violet, or yellow) in darkness and can be many different colors in normal light. In 5th Edition, drow typically have &quot;white hair and grayish skin of many hues&quot; along with better darkvision and a sensitivity to sunlight.

Drow have several kinds of innate spell powers and spell resistance. This is balanced by their weakness in daylight. Half-drow are the result of crossbreeding between another race and a drow, and share characteristics of both.

=== Society ===
Lolth based drow society is primarily matriarchal, with priestesses of their evil spider goddess Lolth in the highest seats of power. This society is based upon violence, murder, cunning, and the philosophy that only the strong survive. Hence, most drow plot endlessly to murder or otherwise incapacitate their rivals and enemy drow using deceit and betrayal. Drow, particularly in higher positions, are constantly wary of assassins and the like. One of the quirks of this constant infighting is the relatively short lifespan of the average drow. While being just as long lived as their surface cousins, living as long as a thousand years, elderly drow are rarely encountered. Consequently, they are the only race of elves that matches the fertility of &#x27;lesser&#x27; races, such as humans. Their society, as a whole, is seemingly nonviable. The only reason they do not murder themselves to extinction is by the will of Lolth, working primarily through her clergy. Lolth does not tolerate any drow that threaten to bring down her society, and the clergy make certain that perpetrators cease their destructive actions by either threatening or killing them. Matron mothers lead the various noble houses and act as &quot;high priestesses of Lolth&quot;. Matthew Beilman, for &quot;CBR&quot;, highlighted that Lolth based &quot;drow society is a lethal cloak-and-dagger affair—like a constant &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; but if every character were playing by Lannister/Bolton rules. That is to say, playing dirty and playing to &quot;win&quot;&quot;.

There are exceptions to the rule, of course. Some communities of drow worship other gods (like Vhaeraun or Eilistraee), and thus, their hierarchy changes, reverses the roles of males and females, or (such as in the case of Eilastree) even approaching something like a workable, progressive society. Drow societies can also vary vastly depending on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting.

==In various campaign settings==
Different campaign settings portray drow in various ways.

===In &quot;Eberron&quot;===
Inhabiting the jungles and Underdark in the continental isle of Xen&#x27;drik, the drow in Eberron have a much more tribalistic culture than their other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; counterparts. They are not an offshoot of the elven race like in many other worlds but rather a separate, if similar, race. Instead of the spider goddess Lolth, most tribes worship a male scorpion deity known as Vulkoor, though exceptions are common. It is believed that Vulkoor is actually one of the forms of the Mockery (a member of the Dark Six). The tribes are often xenophobic, and the social structure varies from tribe to tribe. It is known that the drow mastered elemental binding before gnomes did – including a cultural group of fire-elemental binders called the Sulatar. There is also a subgroup called the &quot;umbragen&quot;, or shadow elves, who worship the Mockery in the form of a scorpion god and Khyber or the Umbra, the Consuming Shadow, for whom the umbragen are named; the umbragen dwell underground beneath Xen&#x27;drik and are noted for producing many warlocks and soulknives.

Drow in Eberron run the gamut from almost feral in nature to being fully civilized and on par with the cultural level of Khorvaire, varying from tribe to tribe.

=== In &quot;Exandria&quot; ===
The region of Xhorhas, the eastern side of the Wildemount continent in the Exandria setting, is governed by the Kryn Dynasty and ruled by the Bright Queen Leylas Kryn. The Dynasty was founded by drow who escaped to surface after rejecting Lolth for a god of light known as the Luxon. The nation is now home to many creatures others in Wildemount would see as monstrous or evil. Due to the Luxon, the Kryn Dynasty also established a new source of magic called Dunamancy which &quot;involves the manipulation of entropy, gravity, and time&quot; where &quot;dunamancers draw power from alternate timelines and unseen realities, subtly affect the flow of time, and even tighten or loosen the grip of gravity&quot;. Compared to their neighboring country, the human-run monarchy of the Dwendalian Empire, &quot;the Dynasty is freer, both politically and culturally. They accept anyone and everyone while the Empire is restrictive and nearly inaccessible to outsiders&quot;. The Kryn Dynasty was first explored in depth in the second campaign of the web series &quot;Critical Role&quot; before being added to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; canon in the &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Guide to Wildemount&quot; (2020).

Critics have highlighted that this setting breaks from traditional fantasy tropes especially around evil races. James Grebey, for &quot;Syfy Wire&quot;, highlighted &quot;it&#x27;s a country of cast-offs and scrappy upstarts who are simply trying to thrive in a world that&#x27;s prejudiced toward them. Due in no small part to a religion that allows for souls to be reborn in another body, the Kryn society is race-neutral in a way that&#x27;s rarely seen in fantasy lore. It&#x27;s borderline progressive, even. Crucially, while there are bad actors among the Kryn, they&#x27;re not evil solely because of their race&quot;. Academics Lisa Horton and David Beard, in the book &quot;The Routledge Handbook of Remix Studies and Digital Humanities&quot;, viewed the Kryn Dynasty and Xhorhasian culture as &quot;a departure and significant extension of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; lore surrounding drow&quot; and highlighted that their religion is centered on &quot;the physical manifestation of light itself, the Luxon, and the pursuit off immortality&quot;. In contrast, Dan Arndt of &quot;The Fandomentals&quot; opined that the setting&#x27;s attempt at subverting the evil drow trope was not &quot;the biggest step up&quot; since he viewed the Wildemount drow as &quot;religious nutjobs with suicidal tendencies&quot;.

===In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;===

1991&#x27;s &quot;The Drow of the Underdark&quot;, a 128-page sourcebook all about the drow, expanded the drow significantly for the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons second edition version of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting. In the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, the dark elves were once ancient tribes of Ilythiir and Miyeritar. They were transformed into drow by the Seldarine and were cast down and driven underground by the light-skinned elves because of the Ilythiirian&#x27;s savagery during the Crown Wars. The drow had fallen under the influence of Araushnee, who was transformed into Lolth and was cast down into the Demonweb Pits along with her son Vhaeraun by the elven god Corellon Larethian because of Lolth&#x27;s and Vhaeraun&#x27;s attempt to take control of the elven pantheon (which included Araushnee&#x27;s seduction of Corellon Larethian). Drow society, being strongly matriarchal, allows the females to hold all positions of power in the government, and to choose and discard mates freely. Social station is the most important thing in drow society, making ascension to greater power a drow&#x27;s ultimate goal. Drow have a strong affinity for arachnids, as most worship the spider goddess Lolth, and spiders dwell freely among drow communities. The largest drow civilization is the subterranean city of Llurth Dreier. However, Menzoberranzan is featured most prominently in the novels.

Prior to the Spellplague descendants of the Miyeritar, dark elves later succeed in reversing their transformation and are recreated as a distinct dark elf race. According to &quot;The Complete Book of Elves&quot;, drow are not welcome in Evermeet and are turned away. Drow could also worship Ghaunadaur, Kiaransalee, Selvetarm or Vhaeraun. A special case is Eilistraee, the only drow goddess who is chaotic good instead of chaotic evil; she wants the drow to return to the light. However, all of these alternative deities (except perhaps Ghaunadaur) were killed or forgotten in the last years before the Spellplague, but they managed to return to life and regain their followers, about a century later, during the Sundering.

Amongst the most infamous of drow are the members of House Baenre, while Abeir-Toril is also home to some famous benevolent drow including Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden and his deceased father Zaknafein (both of House Do&#x27; Urden), Liriel Baenre (formerly of Menzoberranzan&#x27;s aforementioned House Baenre), and Qilué of the Seven Sisters. The drow Jarlaxle is also well-known, as he is one of the few males in Menzoberranzan to obtain a position of great power. He is the founder and leader of the mercenary band Bregan D&#x27;aerthe. These characters are from &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy&quot; (1990–1991), a series of books by R. A. Salvatore (except for Liriel Baenre and Qilue). The six drow in the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series have also gained some renown since the novels have been published.

In 2021, two new Underdark based drow societies, the Lorendrow and the Aevendrow, were introduced; both of these societies have rejected Lolth and are not evil. The Lolth based society of Menzoberranzan is now referred to as Unadrow. This retcon &quot;suggests that the beliefs and evil practices once seen as common to all drow are specifically related to the &#x27;Unadrow,&#x27; the culture of drow who have become corrupted by the evil spider goddess&quot;.

=== In &quot;Dragonlance&quot; ===
In the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting, Drow are not a native race. However, a colony of them exists in a connected pocket dimension called the Valley of Perfect Silence. These arrived by means of a crashed Spelljammer vessel, and are now worshippers of Jiathuli, an evil daughter of Takhisis. &quot;Dark Elves&quot; is a separate term in Dragonlance, referencing elves who have been cast out by the other elves for various crimes, such as worship of the evil deities. Dalamar, a student of Raistlin Majere, is the most notable of Krynn&#x27;s dark elves. However, over the years Drow have accidentally appeared in a few &quot;Dragonlance&quot; modules and novels. Similar mistakes have occurred with other standard AD&amp;D races, such as orcs and lycanthropes, which are not part of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting. Some theories say that these rare Drow may have accidentally been sent there during a plane shifting spell or related magic, a misfire as like as not that is corrected before the respective timelines are tampered with too drastically.

===In &quot;Greyhawk&quot;===
In the world of &quot;Greyhawk&quot;, the drow were driven underground by their surface-dwelling relatives because of ideological differences. There they eventually adapted to their surroundings, especially by attracting the attention of the goddess Lolth, &quot;Queen of Spiders&quot;. The center of drow civilization is the subterranean city Erelhei-Cinlu, and its surrounding Vault, commonly called the Vault of the Drow. Drow rank structure was based much more on personal experience level and proven personal abilities rather than on gender. Males were just as likely to have positions of authority over both males and females, and the tradition of matriarchy, where the highest-ranking member was always a female, was not a special directive of the Demon Queen Lolth. The vast majority of Drow Elves both male and female in the original campaign setting of Greyhawk have no authority or ranking at all and live an idle and degenerate life in the great city of the Drow.

Known drow of Greyhawk include Clannair Blackshadow, Derken Gale, Jawal Severnain, and Landis Bree of Greyhawk City; Eclavdra of House Eilserv; and Edralve of the Slave Lords. In the drow city Erelhei-Cinlu, player characters may freely enter the city and spend time there, unless they attempt to organize any escaped slave groups for open warfare against the drow; the threat of a slave uprising will bring the chaotic drow into full cooperation.

Some drow worship a nameless Elder Elemental God (said to have ties to Tharizdun) instead of Lolth. The module &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot; showcases that the House of Eilservs, led by Eclavdra in Erelhei-Cinlu, turned from worship of Lolth to the Elder Elemental God when the city&#x27;s other noble houses allied against them after proclaiming that their mistress should be the Queen of All Drow. Eilservs attempted to establish a power base through a puppet kingdom in the surface world dedicated to the worship of their new deity, so that their demands of supreme power in the Vault can no longer be denied, but this scheme was ruined.

===In other campaign settings===
* In the &quot;Mystara&quot; / &quot;Known World&quot; setting, shadow elves are a race of subterranean elves who have been mutated via magic. Aside from living underground, they have nothing in common with Drow and are not known as Dark elves.
* In Mongoose Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Drow War&quot; trilogy, the drow are recast as lawful evil villains and likened to the Nazis. The author of the series has stated that this was a deliberate reaction to the prevalence of renegade, non-evil drow characters.
* Drow appear as a playable race in &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;, which is a d20 Modern setting based on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. They are shown as very fashionable, often setting new trends. The symbol for most drow is a spider, and they often take the mage or acolyte classes.
* A supplement book about the drow was produced by Green Ronin Publishing called &quot;Plot &amp; Poison: A Guidebook to the Drow&quot; in 2002 and is based on the d20 System. It introduces several drow subtypes including aquatic drow and vupdrax (or winged drow) plus fleshes out drow life, such as how they treat slaves of the various fantasy types like elves and humans. Wizards of the Coast, seeing the heavy sales of the GRP supplement, released their own supplement book called &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; in May 2007.
* Drow in the &quot;Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting&quot; used to be elves but stayed on Golarion when the other elves left the world. Over time, the remaining elves turned into drow by powerful magic, and at this time any elf who is evil enough can spontaneously turn into a drow. The existence of drow in Golarion is virtually unknown to non-elves. Drow are also the main antagonists in the &quot;Second Darkness Adventure Path&quot; and the &quot;Rise of the Drow Trilogy&quot;. In 2023, Paizo announced that drow would be retconned out of Golarion&#x27;s lore and replaced by serpentfolk as the publisher transitions away from Wizard of the Coast&#x27;s Open Game License.

==Lolth==
Lolth is a fictional goddess in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game. Lolth (&quot;Lloth&quot; in the Drow language), the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the chief goddess of the Drow. She is also known as the &quot;Spider Queen&quot; and the &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot;; her realm, the 66th layer of the Abyss, is referred to as the Demonweb Pits. Lolth usually appears in two forms: drow and arachnid. In drow form, the Spider Queen appears as an &quot;exquisitely beautiful&quot; female dark elf, sometimes covered in clinging spiders. In her arachnid form, Lolth takes the appearance of a giant black widow spider with the head of a female drow or human peering from between the eight spider-eyes. Sometimes, the two foremost pair of her spider-legs are actually humanoid arms. In third edition, her arachnid form has taken more of a drider-like appearance, due to the events of the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; novel series.

===Conception and creation===
Lolth was created by Gary Gygax for the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting, later appeared in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; setting, and in the 3rd edition became a member of the default pantheon of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; gods. In those various settings, the drow pantheon of gods consists of the leader Lolth, as well as Kiaransalee, Vhaeraun, and Zinzerena and also the one good goddess Eilistraee. Other drow gods may be present in different campaign settings.

According to the Forgotten Realms storyline, Lolth began as an intermediary goddess abiding in the sixty-sixth layer of the Abyss, the Demonweb Pits. Through the events that transpired in War of the Spider Queen series, she transformed herself into a greater goddess as depicted in 4th edition, the Demonweb Pits becoming its own plane.

===Publication history===

Lolth was first mentioned in the modules &quot;Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot; (1978) and more fully described in &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot; (1978), and was the main antagonist of the module &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot; (1980). These modules were later reprinted as part of the &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot; collection in 1986. Lolth&#x27;s role as a deity was first explored in &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (1980). Her game statistics were reprinted in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; (1981).

Lolth&#x27;s role in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting was first detailed in Ed Greenwood&#x27;s second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; sourcebook, &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; (1991). Lolth was detailed as a deity in the book &quot;Monster Mythology&quot; (1992), including details about her priesthood. Her role in the cosmology of the Planescape campaign setting was described in &quot;On Hallowed Ground&quot; (1996). Lolth received a very detailed description of her role in the Forgotten Realms in &quot;Demihuman Deities&quot; (1998).

Lolth is detailed in &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; (2000), and &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (2002), and her role in the Forgotten Realms is revisited in &quot;Faiths and Pantheons&quot; (2002). Lolth&#x27;s priesthood is detailed for this edition in &quot;Complete Divine&quot; (2004), and her role in the Abyss is detailed in the &quot;Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss&quot; (2006). Lolth and the Drow are further detailed in both &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot; (2007), and the adventure &quot;Expedition to the Demonweb Pits&quot; (2007). &quot;Dragon&quot; #359 (September 2007), the final print issue of the magazine, described Lolth as one of the 20 most memorable villains of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.

Lolth appears as one of the evil deities described in the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; for the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (2008). The story of her dissent from and war against Corellon and Sehanine is fleshed out in the supplements &quot;Underdark&quot; and &quot;The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea&quot;. A slightly different (and arguably more powerful) version of Lolth is presented in the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide.&quot; Lolth in the Forgotten Realms has a different appearance, dogma and personality than the core Lolth. Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s D&amp;D Compendium and D&amp;D Character Builder record the core Lolth and the &quot;Realms&quot; Lolth as separate entities. Lolth (Demon Queen of Spiders) appears in the 4th edition&#x27;s &quot;Monster Manual 3&quot; (2010). She is the mascot for this volume, which includes statistics for Lolth in both drow and spider form.

In 2021, Lolth was featured on two cards as a &quot;legendary planeswalker&quot; in the &quot;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&quot; line from the &quot;&quot; collectible card game. Lolth will be featured on the alternative cover edition of the upcoming 2024 Revised 5th Edition &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; with art by Olena Richards.

===Reception===
Lolth was named as one of the greatest villains in D&amp;D history by the final issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;. Witwer &quot;et al.&quot;, in the book &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Art &amp; Arcana&quot;, considered Lolth one of the &quot;iconic D&amp;D characters&quot;, present throughout the decades of the game.

Lolth was #10 on &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s 2018 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The 15 Most Powerful Villains, Ranked&quot; list—the article states &quot;The &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; series would show Lolth&#x27;s transformation into a greater goddess, making her one of the most powerful beings in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; multiverse. [...] Lolth can appear in the form of a monstrous spider, which many fans have mocked, due to the fact that it only has sixty-six hit points. You likely won&#x27;t get a chance to get close enough to harm Lolth, due to the fact that you are battling her in her home dimension, which is filled with an army of demonic spiders. Lolth can also transform into the form of a high-level magic-user/cleric, which gives her access to a wide-range of powerful spells. This is to say nothing of her psionic abilities, though these are given to her at the discretion of the dungeon master&quot;.

Lolth was #8 on &quot;CBR&quot;″s 2020 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: 10 Endgame Bosses You Need To Use In Your Next Campaign&quot; list—the article states &quot;the DMs can even get rather creative with the stage; since Lolth is a creature of the Underdark, the fight leading up to her and the boss herself can take place in a dark and nightmarish cave that requires some spelunking and vertical maneuvers. Bonus points if the fight happens in a web network suspended midair with an abyssal drop&quot;.

==Related creatures==
Like elves, drow have other creatures associated with them either by environment or by blood. The drider, a drow transformed into a half-drow half-spider creature as a punishment, is one of the most often cited examples.

===Drider===
Only high-level priestesses in good standing with Lolth are able to initiate the transformation of a dark elf into a drider. This transformation is very painful, and lasts at least 12 hours. Driders develop a poisonous bite. Their digestion changes and they must drink blood of living creatures for sustenance. Driders still maintain the spells and special abilities they had developed as a drow. There can exist any character class of drider. They retain intelligence and memories. This usually makes them bitter, spiteful creatures. Some hunt for magic powerful enough to undo the transformation.

In previous editions, driders appear sexless due to bloating, but able to magically reproduce. In &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; edition 3.5, driders seem to retain their gender and characteristics after the transformation, but fertility is debatable.

Driders play many roles in drow society. The dark elves both fear and are revolted by driders. After transformation, they are usually pushed to the wild area around a drow city. Driders are usually found in company with tiny, huge and giant spiders. Driders speak Common, Elvish, and Undercommon. In the first and second editions of the game, Driders spoke Drow. Driders are almost always Chaotic Evil.

In the Fourth Edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, becoming a drider is actually considered holy and a blessing from Lolth.

===Draegloths===
Draegloths are half-demon, half drow monstrosities. Found in any campaign setting, they are particularly numerous in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. They are created by the unholy union between an ascending high priestess of the drow goddess Lolth and a glabrezu.

Draegloths are about ten feet tall and have four arms, the upper pair being much larger than the lower. They have large claws on the upper arms and they use them for hand-to-hand combat, for they usually prefer the feeling of tearing flesh and sinew under their claws and fangs. Their face is stretched so it resembles that of a dog. Their flesh is as dark as a drow&#x27;s, and they are covered in a fine coat of fur; they also have a white mane. They are sacred creatures to the Lolthites and are usually treated with respect.

Triel Baenre of Menzoberranzan, in the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, had a draegloth son, Jeggred.

V3.5 statistics for the draegloth can be found in &quot;Drow of the Underdark&quot;.

===Chitines and choldriths===

&quot;The chitine and the choldrith are part-elf, part-spider abominations created by magic as servitors of the spider goddess Lolth&quot; appearing in the Forgotten Realms setting. Chitine resembles a sickly, white, four-foot tall humanoid with vaguely spider-like features. They are depicted with wavy hair and sly faces with a set of spider&#x27;s fangs protruding from their mouths. Chitines also have four arms which feature an additional joint (compared to a human), giving them great flexibility and dexterity. They were created inadvertently by the drow as a result of failed experiments on normal humanoids.

Chitines typically hate their former masters, the drow, but keep worshipping Lolth. The role of priests in their society is taken up by a closely related but completely separate race, the choldriths. Chitines strongly live up to their spider heritage; in their underground cities and villages, they build with webs in the same way that humans build with wood and stone. They build everything out of it, homes, traps, clothing, weapons, and more.

<doc id="46943" wikidata="Q1295260" url="?curid=46943" title="Audio time stretching and pitch scaling">
<text>Time stretching is the process of changing the speed or duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. Pitch scaling is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed. Pitch shift is pitch scaling implemented in an effects unit and intended for live performance. Pitch control is a simpler process which affects pitch and speed simultaneously by slowing down or speeding up a recording. 

These processes are often used to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled. Time stretching is often used to adjust radio commercials and the audio of television advertisements to fit exactly into the 30 or 60 seconds available. It can be used to conform longer material to a designated time slot, such as a 1-hour broadcast. 

==Resampling==
The simplest way to change the duration or pitch of an audio recording is to change the playback speed. For a digital audio recording, this can be accomplished through sample rate conversion. When using this method, the frequencies in the recording are always scaled at the same ratio as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. Slowing down the recording to increase duration also lowers the pitch, while speeding it up for a shorter duration respectively raises the pitch, creating the so-called Chipmunk effect. When resampling audio to a notably lower pitch, it may be preferred that the source audio is of a higher sample rate, as slowing down the playback rate will reproduce an audio signal of a lower resolution, and therefore reduce the perceived clarity of the sound. On the contrary, when resampling audio to a notably higher pitch, it may be preferred to incorporate an interpolation filter, as frequencies that surpass the Nyquist frequency (determined by the sampling rate of the audio reproduction software or device) will create usually undesired sound distortions, a phenomenon that is also known as aliasing.

== Frequency domain ==

=== Phase vocoder ===

One way of stretching the length of a signal without affecting the pitch is to build a phase vocoder after Flanagan, Golden, and Portnoff.

Basic steps:
#compute the instantaneous frequency/amplitude relationship of the signal using the STFT, which is the discrete Fourier transform of a short, overlapping and smoothly windowed block of samples;
#apply some processing to the Fourier transform magnitudes and phases (like resampling the FFT blocks); and
#perform an inverse STFT by taking the inverse Fourier transform on each chunk and adding the resulting waveform chunks, also called overlap and add (OLA).

The phase vocoder handles sinusoid components well, but early implementations introduced considerable smearing on transient (&quot;beat&quot;) waveforms at all non-integer compression/expansion rates, which renders the results phasey and diffuse. Recent improvements allow better quality results at all compression/expansion ratios but a residual smearing effect still remains.

The phase vocoder technique can also be used to perform pitch shifting, chorusing, timbre manipulation, harmonizing, and other unusual modifications, all of which can be changed as a function of time.

=== Sinusoidal spectral modeling ===
Another method for time stretching relies on a spectral model of the signal. In this method, peaks are identified in frames using the STFT of the signal, and sinusoidal &quot;tracks&quot; are created by connecting peaks in adjacent frames. The tracks are then re-synthesized at a new time scale. This method can yield good results on both polyphonic and percussive material, especially when the signal is separated into sub-bands. However, this method is more computationally demanding than other methods.

== Time domain ==

=== SOLA ===
Rabiner and Schafer in 1978 put forth an alternate solution that works in the time domain: attempt to find the period (or equivalently the fundamental frequency) of a given section of the wave using some pitch detection algorithm (commonly the peak of the signal&#x27;s autocorrelation, or sometimes cepstral processing), and crossfade one period into another.

This is called time-domain harmonic scaling or the synchronized overlap-add method (SOLA) and performs somewhat faster than the phase vocoder on slower machines but fails when the autocorrelation mis-estimates the period of a signal with complicated harmonics (such as orchestral pieces).

Adobe Audition (formerly Cool Edit Pro) seems to solve this by looking for the period closest to a center period that the user specifies, which should be an integer multiple of the tempo, and between 30 Hz and the lowest bass frequency.

This is much more limited in scope than the phase vocoder based processing, but can be made much less processor intensive, for real-time applications. It provides the most coherent results for single-pitched sounds like voice or musically monophonic instrument recordings.

High-end commercial audio processing packages either combine the two techniques (for example by separating the signal into sinusoid and transient waveforms), or use other techniques based on the wavelet transform, or artificial neural network processing, producing the highest-quality time stretching.

=== Frame-based approach ===
In order to preserve an audio signal&#x27;s pitch when stretching or compressing its duration, many time-scale modification (TSM) procedures follow a frame-based approach.
Given an original discrete-time audio signal, this strategy&#x27;s first step is to split the signal 
into short &quot;analysis frames&quot; of fixed length.
The analysis frames are spaced by a fixed number of samples, called the &quot;analysis hopsize&quot; formula_1.
To achieve the actual time-scale modification, the analysis frames are then temporally relocated
to have a &quot;synthesis hopsize&quot; formula_2.
This frame relocation results in a modification of the signal&#x27;s duration by a &quot;stretching factor&quot; of
formula_3.
However, simply superimposing the unmodified analysis frames typically results in undesired artifacts
such as phase discontinuities or amplitude fluctuations.
To prevent these kinds of artifacts, the analysis frames are adapted to form &quot;synthesis frames&quot;, prior to
the reconstruction of the time-scale modified output signal.

The strategy of how to derive the synthesis frames from the analysis frames is a key difference among
different TSM procedures.

== Speed hearing and speed talking==
For the specific case of speech, time stretching can be performed using PSOLA.

Time-compressed speech is the representation of verbal text in compressed time. While one might expect speeding up to reduce comprehension, Herb Friedman says that &quot;Experiments have shown that the brain works most efficiently if the information rate through the ears—via speech—is the &#x27;average&#x27; reading rate, which is about 200–300 wpm (words per minute), yet the average rate of speech is in the neighborhood of 100–150 wpm.&quot;

Listening to time-compressed speech is seen as the equivalent of speed reading.

== Pitch scaling ==
These techniques can also be used to transpose an audio sample while holding speed or duration constant. This may be accomplished by time stretching and then resampling back to the original length. Alternatively, the frequency of the sinusoids in a sinusoidal model may be altered directly, and the signal reconstructed at the appropriate time scale.

Transposing can be called &quot;frequency scaling&quot; or &quot;pitch shifting&quot;, depending on perspective.

For example, one could move the pitch of every note up by a perfect fifth, keeping the tempo the same.
One can view this transposition as &quot;pitch shifting&quot;, &quot;shifting&quot; each note up 7 keys on a piano keyboard, or adding a fixed amount on the Mel scale, or adding a fixed amount in linear pitch space.
One can view the same transposition as &quot;frequency scaling&quot;, &quot;scaling&quot; (multiplying) the frequency of every note by 3/2.

Musical transposition preserves the ratios of the harmonic frequencies that determine the sound&#x27;s timbre, unlike the &quot;frequency shift&quot; performed by amplitude modulation, which adds a fixed frequency offset to the frequency of every note. (In theory one could perform a literal &quot;pitch scaling&quot; in which the musical pitch space location is scaled [a higher note would be shifted at a greater interval in linear pitch space than a lower note], but that is highly unusual, and not musical.)

Time domain processing works much better here, as smearing is less noticeable, but scaling vocal samples distorts the formants into a sort of Alvin and the Chipmunks-like effect, which may be desirable or undesirable.
A process that preserves the formants and character of a voice involves analyzing the signal with a channel vocoder or LPC vocoder plus any of several pitch detection algorithms and then resynthesizing it at a different fundamental frequency.

A detailed description of older analog recording techniques for pitch shifting can be found at .

== In consumer software ==

Pitch-corrected audio timestretch is found in every modern web browser as part of the HTML standard for media playback. Similar controls are ubiquitous in media applications and frameworks such as GStreamer and Unity.

<doc id="46944" wikidata="Q119906" url="?curid=46944" title="Parallax scrolling">
<text>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.

Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early 1980s. Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game &quot;Jump Bug&quot; (1981). It used a limited form of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly, adding depth to the scenery. The following year, &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982) implemented a full form of parallax scrolling, with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the distance between them. &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling. &quot;Jungle King&quot; (1982), later called &quot;Jungle Hunt&quot;, also had parallax scrolling, and was released a month after &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; in June 1982.

== Methods ==
There are four main methods of parallax scrolling used in titles for arcade system board, video game console and personal computer systems.

=== Layer method ===
Some display systems support multiple background layers that can be scrolled independently in horizontal and vertical directions and composited on one another, simulating a multiplane camera. On such a display system, a game can produce parallax by simply changing each layer&#x27;s position by a different amount in the same direction. Layers that move more quickly are perceived to be closer to the virtual camera. Layers can be placed in front of the &quot;playfield&quot;—the layer containing the objects with which the player interacts—for various reasons such as to provide increased dimension, obscure some of the action of the game, or distract the player.

=== Sprite method ===
Programmers may also make pseudo-layers of sprites—individually controllable moving objects drawn by hardware on top of or behind the layers—if they are available on the display system. For instance &quot;Star Force&quot;, an overhead-view vertically scrolling shooter for NES, used this for its starfield, and &quot;Final Fight&quot; for the Super NES used this technique for the layer immediately in front of the main playfield.

The Amiga computer has sprites which can have any height and can be set horizontal with the copper co-processor, which makes them ideal for this purpose.

Risky Woods on the Amiga uses sprites multiplexed with the copper to create an entire fullscreen parallax background layer as an alternative to the system&#x27;s dual playfield mode.

=== Repeating pattern/animation method ===
Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to &#x27;float&#x27; over a repeating background layer by animating the individual tiles&#x27; bitmaps in order to portray the parallax effect. Color cycling can be used to animate tiles quickly on the whole screen. This software effect gives the illusion of another (hardware) layer. Many games used this technique for a scrolling star-field, but sometimes a more intricate or multi-directional effect is achieved, such as in the game &quot;Parallax&quot; by Sensible Software.

=== Raster method ===

In raster graphics, the lines of pixels in an image are typically composited and refreshed in top-to-bottom order with a slight delay (called the horizontal blanking interval) between drawing one line and drawing the next line.
Games designed for older graphical chipsets—such as those of the third and fourth generations of video game consoles, those of dedicated TV games, or those of similar handheld systems—take advantage of the raster characteristics to create the illusion of more layers.

Some display systems have only one layer. These include most of the classic 8-bit systems (such as the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and original Game Boy). The more sophisticated games on such systems generally divide the layer into horizontal strips, each with a different position and rate of scrolling. Typically, strips higher on the screen will represent things farther away from the virtual camera or one strip will be held stationary to display status information. The program will then wait for horizontal blank and change the layer&#x27;s scroll position just before the display system begins to draw each scanline. This is called a &quot;raster effect&quot; and is also useful for changing the system palette to provide a gradient background.

Some platforms (such as the Commodore 64, Amiga, Master System, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS) provide a horizontal blank interrupt for automatically setting the registers independently of the rest of the program. Others, such as the NES, require the use of cycle-timed code, which is specially written to take exactly as long to execute as the video chip takes to draw one scanline, or timers inside game cartridges that generate interrupts after a given number of scanlines have been drawn. Many NES games use this technique to draw their status bars, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game&quot; and &quot;&quot; for NES use it to scroll background layers at different rates.

More advanced raster techniques can produce interesting effects. A system can achieve a very effective depth of field if layers with rasters are combined; &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic The Hedgehog 2&quot;, &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, &quot;Lionheart&quot;, &quot;Kid Chaos&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; used this effect well. If each scanline has its own layer, the &quot;Pole Position&quot; effect is produced, which creates a pseudo-3D road (or a pseudo-3D ball court as in &quot;NBA Jam&quot;) on a 2D system.

If the display system supports rotation and scaling in addition to scrolling—an effect popularly known as Mode 7—changing the rotation and scaling factors can draw a projection of a plane (as in &quot;F-Zero&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;) or can warp the playfield to create an extra challenge factor.

Another advanced technique is row/column scrolling, where rows/columns of tiles on a screen can be scrolled individually. This technique is implemented in the graphics chips of various Sega arcade system boards since the Sega Space Harrier and System 16, the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console, and the Capcom CP System, Irem M-92 and Taito F3 System arcade game boards.

== Example ==
In the following animation, three layers are moving leftward at different speeds. Their speeds decrease from front to back and correspond to increases in relative distance from the viewer. The ground layer is moving 8 times as fast as the vegetation layer. The vegetation layer is moving two times as fast as the cloud layer.

== Parallax scrolling in Web design ==
One of the first implementations of parallax scrolling in the browser was created and shared in a blog post by web developer Glutnix in 2007, this included example code and a demo using JavaScript and CSS 2 that supported Internet Explorer 6 and other browsers of that era.

In a February 2008 tutorial on web design blog Think Vitamin, web designer Paul Annett explained how he had created a parallax effect using CSS and without JavaScript for the website of Silverback, a usability testing app. He demonstrated the effect on stage at SXSW Interactive 2009, with the help of audience participation and a man in a gorilla suit.

Advocates argue it is a simple way to embrace the fluidity of the Web, citing the Silverback website as the first example they had come across.

Proponents use parallax backgrounds as a tool to better engage users and improve the overall experience that a website provides. However, a Purdue University study, published in 2013, revealed the following findings: &quot;... although parallax scrolling enhanced certain aspects of the user experience, it did not necessarily improve the overall user experience&quot;. A undated study occurring during or after 2010 by Dede Frederick, James Mohler, Mihaela Vorvoreanu, and Ronald Glotzbach noted that parallax scrolling &quot;may cause certain people to experience nausea.&quot;

<text>The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The Roman symbol of Britannia (a female personification of Great Britain) was revived in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain.

This &quot;golden age&quot; represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for its theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England&#x27;s past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repelled. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.

The Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns. It was a brief period of internal peace between the Wars of the Roses in the previous century, the English Reformation, and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics prior to Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and then the later conflict of the English Civil War and the ongoing political battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.

England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The Italian Renaissance had come to an end following the end of the Italian Wars, which left the Italian Peninsula impoverished. The Kingdom of France was embroiled in the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598). They were (temporarily) settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the Edict of Nantes. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spain&#x27;s tercios, the centuries-long Anglo-French Wars were largely suspended for most of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

The one great rival was Habsburg Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. An attempt by Philip II of Spain to invade England with the Spanish Armada in 1588 was famously defeated. In turn England launched an equally unsuccessful expedition to Spain with the Drake–Norris Expedition of 1589. Three further Spanish Armadas also failed in 1596, 1597 and 1601. The war ended with the Treaty of London the year following Elizabeth&#x27;s death.

England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of Henry VII and Henry VIII, as well as Elizabeth&#x27;s harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of trans-Atlantic trade and persistent theft of Spanish and Portuguese treasures, most notably as a result of Francis Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation.

The term &quot;Elizabethan era&quot; was already well-established in English and British historical consciousness, long before the accession of Queen Elizabeth II, and generally refers solely to the time of the earlier queen of this name.

==Romance and reality==

The Victorian era and the early 20th century idealised the Elizabethan era. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; maintains that &quot;[T]he long reign of Elizabeth I, 1558–1603, was England&#x27;s Golden Age... &#x27;Merry England&#x27;, in love with life, expressed itself in music and literature, in architecture and in adventurous seafaring&quot;. This idealising tendency was shared by Britain and an Anglophilic America. In popular culture, the image of those adventurous Elizabethan seafarers was embodied in the films of Errol Flynn.

In response and reaction to this hyperbole, modern historians and biographers have tended to take a more dispassionate view of the Tudor period.

==Government==
Elizabethan England was not particularly successful in a military sense during the period, but it avoided major defeats and built up a powerful navy. On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with low defenses, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her frugal policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of £300,000. Economically, Sir Thomas Gresham&#x27;s founding of the Royal Exchange (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; though the wealth was distributed with wild unevenness, there was clearly more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign than at the beginning. This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments that &quot;Golden Age&quot; advocates have stressed.

===Plots, intrigues, and conspiracies===
The Elizabethan Age was also an age of plots and conspiracies, frequently political in nature, and often involving the highest levels of Elizabethan society. High officials in Madrid, Paris and Rome sought to kill Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic. That would be a prelude to the religious recovery of England for Catholicism. In 1570, the Ridolfi plot was thwarted. In 1584, the Throckmorton Plot was discovered, after Francis Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. Another major conspiracy was the Babington Plot – the event which most directly led to Mary&#x27;s execution, the discovery of which involved a double agent, Gilbert Gifford, acting under the direction of Francis Walsingham, the Queen&#x27;s highly effective spy master.

The Essex Rebellion of 1601 has a dramatic element, as just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the Earl of Northumberland), paid for a performance of &quot;Richard II&quot; at the Globe Theatre, apparently with the goal of stirring public ill will towards the monarchy. It was reported at the trial of Essex by Chamberlain&#x27;s Men actor Augustine Phillips, that the conspirators paid the company forty shillings &quot;above the ordinary&quot; (i. e., above their usual rate) to stage the play, which the players felt was too old and &quot;out of use&quot; to attract a large audience.

In the last decades of the reign, Elizabeth gave James VI of Scotland an annual annuity or subsidy which contributed to an &quot;amity&quot; or peace between England and Scotland. It became clear that he would be her successor. Plots continued in the new reign. In the Bye Plot of 1603, two Catholic priests planned to kidnap King James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Most dramatic was the 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. It was discovered in time with eight conspirators executed, including Guy Fawkes, who became the iconic evil traitor in English lore.

===English Navy and defeat of the Armada===

While Henry VIII had launched the Royal Navy, Edward and Mary had ignored it and it was little more than a system of coastal defense. Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority. She risked war with Spain by supporting the &quot;Sea Dogs&quot;, such as John Hawkins and Francis Drake, who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the &quot;Dreadnaught&quot;, that allowed the ships to sail faster and maneuver better and permitted heavier guns. Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel. When Spain finally decided to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco. Superior English ships and seamanship foiled the invasion and led to the destruction of the Spanish Armada in 1588, marking the high point of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain&#x27;s over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. Moreover, the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.

Parker has speculated on the dire consequences if the Spanish had landed their invasion army in 1588. He argues that the Spanish army was larger, more experienced, better-equipped, more confident, and had better financing. The English defenses, on the other hand, were thin and outdated; England had too few soldiers and they were at best only partially trained. Spain had chosen England&#x27;s weakest link and probably could have captured London in a week. Parker adds that a Catholic uprising in the north and in Ireland could have brought total defeat.

===Colonising the New World===

The discoveries of Christopher Columbus electrified all of western Europe, especially maritime powers like England. King Henry VII commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to find a northern route to the Spice Islands of Asia; this began the search for the North West Passage. Cabot sailed in 1497 and reached Newfoundland. He led another voyage to the Americas the following year, but nothing was heard of him or his ships again.

In 1562 Elizabeth sent privateers Hawkins and Drake to seize booty from Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa. When the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified after 1585, Elizabeth approved further raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and against shipping returning to Europe with treasure. Meanwhile, the influential writers Richard Hakluyt and John Dee were beginning to press for the establishment of England&#x27;s own overseas empire. Spain was well established in the Americas, while Portugal, in union with Spain from 1580, had an ambitious global empire in Africa, Asia and South America. France was exploring North America. England was stimulated to create its own colonies, with an emphasis on the West Indies rather than in North America.

Martin Frobisher landed at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island in August 1576; He returned in 1577, claiming it in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s name, and in a third voyage tried but failed to found a settlement in Frobisher Bay.
From 1577 to 1580, Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe. Combined with his daring raids against the Spanish and his great victory over them at Cádiz in 1587, he became a famous hero—his exploits are still celebrated—but England did not follow up on his claims. In 1583, Humphrey Gilbert sailed to Newfoundland, taking possession of the harbour of St. John&#x27;s together with all land within two hundred leagues to the north and south of it.

In 1584, the queen granted Walter Raleigh a charter for the colonisation of Virginia; it was named in her honour. Raleigh and Elizabeth sought both immediate riches and a base for privateers to raid the Spanish treasure fleets. Raleigh sent others to found the Roanoke Colony; it remains a mystery why the settlers all disappeared. In 1600, the queen chartered the East India Company in an attempt to break the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far Eastern trade. It established trading posts, which in later centuries evolved into British India, on the coasts of what is now India and Bangladesh. Larger scale colonisation to North America began shortly after Elizabeth&#x27;s death.

==Distinctions==
England in this era had some positive aspects that set it apart from contemporaneous continental European societies. Torture was rare, since the English legal system reserved torture only for capital crimes like treason—though forms of corporal punishment, some of them extreme, were practised. The persecution of witches began in 1563, and hundreds were executed, although there was nothing like the frenzy on the Continent. Mary had tried her hand at an aggressive anti-Protestant Inquisition and was hated for it; it was not to be repeated. Nevertheless, more Catholics were persecuted, exiled, and burned alive than under Queen Mary.

==Religion==
Elizabeth managed to moderate and quell the intense religious passions of the time. This was in significant contrast to previous and succeeding eras of marked religious violence.

Elizabeth said &quot;I have no desire to make windows into men&#x27;s souls&quot;. Her desire to moderate the religious persecutions of previous Tudor reigns – the persecution of Catholics under Edward VI, and of Protestants under Mary I – appears to have had a moderating effect on English society. Elizabeth, Protestant, but undogmatic one, authorizing the 1559 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; which effectively reinstated the 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; with modifications which made clear that the Church of England believed in the (spiritual) Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion but without a definition how in favor of leaving this a mystery, and she had the Black Rubric removed from the Articles of Faith: this had allowed kneeling to receive communion without implying that by doing so it meant the real and essential presence of Christ in the bread and wine: she believed it so. She was not able to get an unmarried clergy or the Protestant Holy Communion celebrated to look like a Mass. The Apostolic Succession was maintained, the institution of the church continued without a break (with 98% of the clergy remaining at their posts) and the attempt to ban music in church was defeated. The Injunctions of 1571 forbade any doctrines that did not conform to the teaching of the Church Fathers and the Catholic Bishops. The Queen&#x27;s hostility to strict Calvinistic doctrines blocked the Radicals.

Almost no original theological thought came out of the English Reformation; instead, the Church relied on the Catholic Consensus of the first Four Ecumenical Councils. The preservation of many Catholic doctrines and practices was the cuckoos nest that eventually resulted in the formation of the Via Media during the 17th century. She spent the rest of her reign ferociously fending off radical reformers and Roman Catholics who wanted to modify the Settlement of Church affairs: The Church of England was Protestant, &quot;with its peculiar arrested development in Protestant terms, and the ghost which it harboured of an older world of Catholic traditions and devotional practice&quot;.

For a number of years, Elizabeth refrained from persecuting Catholics because she was against Catholicism, not her Catholic subjects if they made no trouble. In 1570, Pope Pius V declared Elizabeth a heretic who was not the legitimate queen and that her subjects no longer owed her obedience. The pope sent Jesuits and seminarians to secretly evangelize and support Catholics. After several plots to overthrow her, Catholic clergy were mostly considered to be traitors, and were pursued aggressively in England. Often priests were tortured or executed after capture unless they cooperated with the English authorities. People who publicly supported Catholicism were excluded from the professions; sometimes fined or imprisoned. This was justified on the grounds that Catholics were not persecuted for their religion but punished for being traitors who supported the Queen&#x27;s Spanish foe; in practice, however, Catholics perceived it as religious persecution and regarded those executed as martyrs.

==Science, technology, and exploration==

Lacking a dominant genius or a formal structure for research (the following century had both Sir Isaac Newton and the Royal Society), the Elizabethan era nonetheless saw significant scientific progress. The astronomers Thomas Digges and Thomas Harriot made important contributions; William Gilbert published his seminal study of magnetism, &quot;De Magnete,&quot; in 1600. Substantial advancements were made in the fields of cartography and surveying. The eccentric but influential John Dee also merits mention.

Much of this scientific and technological progress related to the practical skill of navigation. English achievements in exploration were noteworthy in the Elizabethan era. Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1581, and Martin Frobisher explored the Arctic. The first attempt at English settlement of the eastern seaboard of North America occurred in this era—the abortive colony at Roanoke Island in 1587.

While Elizabethan England is not thought of as an age of technological innovation, some progress did occur. In 1564 Guilliam Boonen came from the Netherlands to be Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s first coach-builder —thus introducing the new European invention of the spring-suspension coach to England, as a replacement for the litters and carts of an earlier transportation mode. Coaches quickly became as fashionable as sports cars in a later century; social critics, especially Puritan commentators, noted the &quot;diverse great ladies&quot; who rode &quot;up and down the countryside&quot; in their new coaches.

==Social history==
Historians since the 1960s have explored many facets of the social history, covering every class of the population.

Although home to only a small part of the population the Tudor municipalities were overcrowded and unhygienic. Most towns were unpaved with poor public sanitation. There were no sewers or drains, and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street. Animals such as rats thrived in these conditions. In larger towns and cities, such as London, common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included smallpox, measles, malaria, typhus, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and chickenpox.

Outbreaks of the Black Death pandemic occurred in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589 and 1603. The reason for the speedy spread of the disease was the increase of rats infected by fleas carrying the disease.

Child mortality was low in comparison with earlier and later periods, at about 150 or fewer deaths per 1000 babies. By age 15 a person could expect 40–50 more years of life.

===Homes and dwelling===

The great majority were tenant farmers who lived in small villages. Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, thatched huts with one or two rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs. The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and wattle and daub, or brick; stone and tiles were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with limewash, making it white, and the wood was painted with black tar to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or jetty). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in casement windows. People who could not afford glass often used polished horn, cloth or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.

Mansions had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. Wealthy Tudor homes needed many rooms, where a large number of guests and servants could be accommodated, fed and entertained. Wealth was demonstrated by the extensive use of glass. Windows became the main feature of Tudor mansions, and were often a fashion statement. Mansions were often designed to a symmetrical plan; &quot;E&quot; and &quot;H&quot; shapes were popular.

===Cities===
The population of London increased from 100,000 to 200,000 between the death of Mary Tudor in 1558 and the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. Inflation was rapid and the wealth gap was wide. Poor men, women, and children begged in the cities, as the children only earned sixpence a week. With the growth of industry, many landlords decided to use their land for manufacturing purposes, displacing the farmers who lived and worked there. Despite the struggles of the lower class, the government tended to spend money on wars and exploration voyages instead of on welfare.

===Poverty===
About one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give alms to assist the impotent poor. Tudor law was harsh on the able-bodied poor, i.e., those unable to find work. Those who left their parishes in order to locate work were termed vagabonds and could be subjected to punishments, including whipping and putting at the stocks.

The idea of the workhouse for the able-bodied poor was first suggested in 1576.

===Education===
There was an unprecedented expansion of education in the Tudor period. Until then, few children went to school. Those that did go were mainly the sons of wealthy or ambitious fathers who could afford to pay the attendance fee. Boys were allowed to go to school and began at the age of 4, they then moved to grammar school when they were 7 years old. Girls were either kept at home by their parents to help with housework or sent out to work to bring money in for the family. They were not sent to school. Boys were educated for work and the girls for marriage and running a household so when they married they could look after the house and children. Wealthy families hired a tutor to teach the boys at home. Many Tudor towns and villages had a parish school where the local vicar taught boys to read and write. Brothers could teach their sisters these skills. At school, pupils were taught English, Latin, Greek, catechism and arithmetic. The pupils practised writing in ink by copying the alphabet and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. There were few books, so pupils read from hornbooks instead. These wooden boards had the alphabet, prayers or other writings pinned to them and were covered with a thin layer of transparent cow&#x27;s horn. There were two types of school in Tudor times: petty school was where young boys were taught to read and write; grammar school was where abler boys were taught English and Latin. It was usual for students to attend six days a week. The school day started at 7:00 am in winter and 6:00 am in summer and finished about 5:00 pm. Petty schools had shorter hours, mostly to allow poorer boys the opportunity to work as well. Schools were harsh and teachers were very strict, often beating pupils who misbehaved.

Education would begin at home, where children were taught the basic etiquette of proper manners and respecting others. It was necessary for boys to attend grammar school, but girls were rarely allowed in any place of education other than petty schools, and then only with a restricted curriculum. Petty schools were for all children aged from 5 to 7 years of age. Only the most wealthy people allowed their daughters to be taught, and only at home. During this time, endowed schooling became available. This meant that even boys of very poor families were able to attend school if they were not needed to work at home, but only in a few localities were funds available to provide support as well as the necessary education scholarship.

Boys from wealthy families were taught at home by a private tutor. When Henry VIII shut the monasteries he closed their schools. He refounded many former monastic schools—they are known as &quot;King&#x27;s schools&quot; and are found all over England. During the reign of Edward VI many free grammar schools were set up to take in non-fee paying students. There were two universities in Tudor England: Oxford and Cambridge. Some boys went to university at the age of about 14.

===Food===
====Availability====
England&#x27;s food supply was plentiful throughout most of the reign; there were no famines. Bad harvests caused distress, but they were usually localized. The most widespread came in 1555–57 and 1596–98. In the towns the price of staples was fixed by law; in hard times the size of the loaf of bread sold by the baker was smaller.

Trade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread starvation and poverty. The success of the wool trading industry decreased attention on agriculture, resulting in further starvation of the lower classes. Cumbria, the poorest and most isolated part of England, suffered a six-year famine beginning in 1594. Diseases and natural disasters also contributed to the scarce food supply.

In the 17th century, the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do so in France.

England was exposed to new foods (such as the potato imported from South America), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.

====Diet====
The diet in England during the Elizabethan era depended largely on social class. Bread was a staple of the Elizabethan diet, and people of different statuses ate bread of different qualities. The upper classes ate fine white bread called manchet, while the poor ate coarse bread made of barley or rye.

: Diet of the lower class
The poorer among the population consumed a diet largely of bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces.

: Diet of the middle class
At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, who could choose among venison, beef, mutton, veal, pork, lamb, fowl, salmon, eel, and shellfish. The holiday goose was a special treat. Rich spices were used by the wealthier people to offset the smells of old salt-preserved meat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, turnips, radishes, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, strawberries, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost. Fruits and vegetables were used in desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, crystallized fruit, and syrup.

: Diet of the upper class
At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of the king or queen. Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the &quot;procession&quot; of the crowned heads of state in the summer months, when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles&#x27; lands both to avoid the plague season of London, and alleviate the royal coffers, often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court. This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble&#x27;s home, who depending on his or her production and display of fashion, generosity and entertainment, could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years.

Among the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman. Inns existed for travellers, but restaurants were not known.

Special courses after a feast or dinner which often involved a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes known as a folly) with a central table set with dainties of &quot;medicinal&quot; value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, jellies and marmalades (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. Sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though it could be as everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.

===Gender===

While the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility—especially royal wives and queens—historians have recovered scant documentation about the lives of average women. There has, however, been extensive statistical analysis of demographic and population data which includes women, especially in their childbearing roles. The role of women in society was, for that historical era, relatively unconstrained; Spanish and Italian visitors to England commented regularly, and sometimes caustically, on the freedom that women enjoyed in England, in contrast to their home cultures. England had more well-educated upper-class women than was common anywhere in Europe.

The Queen&#x27;s marital status was a major political and diplomatic topic. It also entered into the popular culture. Elizabeth&#x27;s unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman. Elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, &quot;And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin&quot;. Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen&#x27;s marriage negotiations with the Duc d&#x27;Alençon.

In contrast to her father&#x27;s emphasis on masculinity and physical prowess, Elizabeth emphasized the maternalism theme, saying often that she was married to her kingdom and subjects. She explained &quot;I keep the good will of all my husbands – my good people – for if they did not rest assured of some special love towards them, they would not readily yield me such good obedience&quot;, and promised in 1563 they would never have a more natural mother than she. Coch (1996) argues that her figurative motherhood played a central role in her complex self-representation, shaping and legitimating the personal rule of a divinely appointed female prince.

===Marriage===
Over ninety per cent of English women (and adults, in general) entered marriage at the end of the 1500s and beginning of the 1600s, at an average age of about 25–26 years for the bride and 27–28 years for the groom, with the most common ages being 25–26 for grooms (who would have finished their apprenticeships around this age) and 23 for brides. Among the nobility and gentry, the average was around 19–21 for brides and 24–26 for grooms. Many city and townswomen married for the first time in their thirties and forties and it was not unusual for orphaned young women to delay marriage until the late twenties or early thirties to help support their younger siblings, and roughly a quarter of all English brides were pregnant at their weddings.

==High culture==

===Theatre===
With William Shakespeare at his peak, as well as Christopher Marlowe and many other playwrights, actors and theatres constantly busy, the high culture of the Elizabethan Renaissance was best expressed in its theatre. Historical topics were especially popular, not to mention the usual comedies and tragedies.

===Literature===

Elizabethan literature is considered one of the &quot;most splendid&quot; in the history of English literature. In addition to drama and the theatre, it saw a flowering of poetry, with new forms like the sonnet, the Spenserian stanza, and dramatic blank verse, as well as prose, including historical chronicles, pamphlets, and the first English novels. Edmund Spenser, Richard Hooker, and John Lyly, as well as Marlowe and Shakespeare, are major Elizabethan writers.

===Music===

Travelling musicians were in great demand at Court, in churches, at country houses, and at local festivals. Important composers included William Byrd (1543–1623), John Dowland (1563–1626) Thomas Campion (1567–1620), and Robert Johnson (c. 1583–c. 1634). The composers were commissioned by church and Court, and deployed two main styles, madrigal and ayre. The popular culture showed a strong interest in folk songs and ballads (folk songs that tell a story). It became the fashion in the late 19th century to collect and sing the old songs.

===Fine arts===
It has often been said that the Renaissance came late to England, in contrast to Italy and the other states of continental Europe; the fine arts in England during the Tudor and Stuart eras were dominated by foreign and imported talent—from Hans Holbein the Younger under Henry VIII to Anthony van Dyck under Charles I. Yet within this general trend, a native school of painting was developing. In Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Nicholas Hilliard, the Queen&#x27;s &quot;limner and goldsmith&quot;, is the most widely recognized figure in this native development; but George Gower has begun to attract greater notice and appreciation as knowledge of him and his art and career has improved.

==Popular culture==
===Pastimes===

The Annual Summer Fair and other seasonal fairs such as May Day were often bawdy affairs.

Watching plays became very popular during the Tudor period. Most towns sponsored plays enacted in town squares followed by the actors using the courtyards of taverns or inns (referred to as inn-yards) followed by the first theatres (great open-air amphitheatres and then the introduction of indoor theatres called playhouses). This popularity was helped by the rise of great playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe using London theatres such as the Globe Theatre. By 1595, 15,000 people a week were watching plays in London. It was during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign that the first real theatres were built in England. Before theatres were built, actors travelled from town to town and performed in the streets or outside inns.

Miracle plays were local re-enactments of stories from the Bible. They derived from the old custom of mystery plays, in which stories and fables were enacted to teach lessons or educate about life in general. They influenced Shakespeare.

Festivals were popular seasonal entertainments.

===Sports===
There were many different types of Elizabethan sports and entertainment. Animal sports included bear and bull baiting, dog fighting and cock fighting.

The rich enjoyed tennis, fencing, jousting, and running at the ring. Hunting was strictly limited to the upper class. They favoured their packs of dogs and hounds trained to chase foxes, hares and boars. The rich also enjoyed hunting small game and birds with hawks, known as falconry.

====Jousting====
Jousting was an upscale, very expensive sport where warriors on horseback raced toward each other in full armor trying to use their lance to knock the other off his horse. It was a violent sport--King Henry II of France was killed in a tournament in 1559, as were many lesser men. King Henry VIII was a champion; he finally retired from the lists after a hard fall left him unconscious for hours.

Other sports included archery, bowling, hammer-throwing, quarter-staff contests, troco, quoits, skittles, wrestling and mob football.

====Gambling and card games====
Dice was a popular activity in all social classes. Cards appeared in Spain and Italy about 1370, but they probably came from Egypt. They began to spread throughout Europe and came into England around 1460. By the time of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, gambling was a common sport. Cards were not played only by the upper class. Many of the lower classes had access to playing cards. The card suits tended to change over time. The first Italian and Spanish decks had the same suits: Swords, Batons/ Clubs, Cups, and Coins. The suits often changed from country to country. England probably followed the Latin version, initially using cards imported from Spain but later relying on more convenient supplies from France. Most of the decks that have survived use the French Suit: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Yet even before Elizabeth had begun to reign, the number of cards had been standardized to 52 cards per deck. The lowest court subject in England was called the &quot;knave&quot;. The lowest court card was therefore called the knave until later when the term &quot;Jack&quot; became more common. Popular card games included Maw, One and Thirty, Bone-ace. (These are all games for small group players.) Ruff and Honors was a team game.

===Festivals, holidays and celebrations===
During the Elizabethan era, people looked forward to holidays because opportunities for leisure were limited, with time away from hard work being restricted to periods after church on Sundays. For the most part, leisure and festivities took place on a public church holy day. Every month had its own holiday, some of which are listed below:
* The first Monday after Twelfth Night of January (any time between 7 January and 14 January) was Plough Monday. It celebrated returning to work after the Christmas celebrations and the New Year.
* 2 February: Candlemas. Although often still very cold, Candlemas was celebrated as the first day of spring. All Christmas decorations were burned on this day, in candlelight and torchlight processions.
* 14 February: Valentine&#x27;s Day.
* Between 3 March and 9 March: Shrove Tuesday (known as Mardi Gras or Carnival on the Continent). On this day, apprentices were allowed to run amok in the city in mobs, wreaking havoc, because it supposedly cleansed the city of vices before Lent. The day after Shrove Tuesday was Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent when all were to abstain from eating and drinking certain things.24 March: Lady Day or the feast of the Annunciation, the first of the Quarter Days on which rents and salaries were due and payable. It was a legal New Year when courts of law convened after a winter break, and it marked the supposed moment when the Angel Gabriel came to announce to the Virgin Mary that she would bear a child.
* 1 May: May Day, celebrated as the first day of summer. This was one of the few Celtic festivals with no connection to Christianity and patterned on Beltane. It featured crowning a May Queen, a Green Man and dancing around a maypole.
* 21 June: Midsummer (Christianized as the feast of John the Baptist) and another Quarter Day.
* 1 August: Lammastide, or Lammas Day. Traditionally, the first day of August, in which it was customary to bring a loaf of bread to the church.
* 29 September: Michaelmas. Another Quarter Day. Michaelmas celebrated the beginning of autumn, and Michael the Archangel.
* 25 October: St. Crispin&#x27;s Day. Bonfires, revels, and an elected &#x27;King Crispin&#x27; were all featured in this celebration. Dramatized by Shakespeare in &quot;Henry V&quot;.28 October: The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show, which still takes place today in London.31 October: All Hallows Eve or Halloween. The beginning celebration of the days of the dead.
* 1 November: All Hallows or All Saints&#x27; Day, followed by All Souls&#x27; Day.
* 17 November: Accession Day or Queen&#x27;s Day, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession to the throne, celebrated with lavish court festivities featuring jousting during her lifetime and as a national holiday for dozens of years after her death.
* 24 December: The Twelve Days of Christmas started at sundown and lasted until Epiphany on 6 January. Christmas was the last of the Quarter Days for the year.

<text>A libretto (From the Italian word , ) is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term &quot;libretto&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.

The Italian word (, ) is the diminutive of the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;book&quot;). Sometimes other-language equivalents are used for libretti in that language, &quot;livret&quot; for French works, &quot;Textbuch&quot; for German and &quot;libreto&quot; for Spanish. A libretto is distinct from a synopsis or scenario of the plot, in that the libretto contains all the words and stage directions, while a synopsis summarizes the plot. Some ballet historians also use the word &quot;libretto&quot; to refer to the 15- to 40-page books which were on sale to 19th century ballet audiences in Paris and contained a very detailed description of the ballet&#x27;s story, scene by scene.

The relationship of the librettist (that is, the writer of a libretto) to the composer in the creation of a musical work has varied over the centuries, as have the sources and the writing techniques employed.

In the context of a modern English-language musical theatre piece, the libretto is considered to encompass both the book of the work (i.e., the spoken dialogue) and the sung lyrics.

==Relationship of composer and librettist==
Libretti for operas, oratorios and cantatas in the 17th and 18th centuries were generally written by someone other than the composer, often a well-known poet.

Pietro Trapassi, known as Metastasio (1698–1782) was one of the most highly regarded librettists in Europe. His libretti were set many times by many different composers. Another noted 18th-century librettist was Lorenzo Da Ponte. He wrote the libretti for three of Mozart&#x27;s greatest operas, and for many other composers as well. Eugène Scribe was one of the most prolific librettists of the 19th century, providing the words for works by Meyerbeer (with whom he had a lasting collaboration), Auber, Bellini, Donizetti, Rossini and Verdi. The French writers&#x27; duo Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy wrote many opera and operetta libretti for the likes of Jacques Offenbach, Jules Massenet and Georges Bizet. Arrigo Boito, who wrote libretti for, among others, Giuseppe Verdi and Amilcare Ponchielli, also composed two operas of his own.

The libretto is not always written before the music. Some composers, such as Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Serov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Puccini and Mascagni wrote passages of music without text and subsequently had the librettist add words to the vocal melody lines (this has often been the case with American popular song and musicals in the 20th century, as with Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart&#x27;s collaboration, although with the later team of Rodgers and Hammerstein the lyrics were generally written first, which was Rodgers&#x27; preferred modus operandi).

Some composers wrote their own libretti. Richard Wagner is perhaps most famous in this regard, with his transformations of Germanic legends and events into epic subjects for his operas and music dramas. Hector Berlioz, too, wrote the libretti for two of his best-known works, &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; and &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. Alban Berg adapted Georg Büchner&#x27;s play &quot;Woyzeck&quot; for the libretto of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.
Sometimes the libretto is written in close collaboration with the composer; this can involve adaptation, as was the case with Rimsky-Korsakov and his librettist Vladimir Belsky, or an entirely original work. In the case of musicals, the music, the lyrics and the &quot;book&quot; (i.e., the spoken dialogue and the stage directions) may each have its own author. Thus, a musical such as &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; has a composer (Jerry Bock), a lyricist (Sheldon Harnick) and the writer of the &quot;book&quot; (Joseph Stein). In rare cases, the composer writes everything except the dance arrangements – music, lyrics and libretto, as Lionel Bart did for &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

Other matters in the process of developing a libretto parallel those of spoken dramas for stage or screen. There are the preliminary steps of selecting or suggesting a subject and developing a sketch of the action in the form of a scenario, as well as revisions that might come about when the work is in production, as with out-of-town tryouts for Broadway musicals, or changes made for a specific local audience. A famous case of the latter is Wagner&#x27;s 1861 revision of the original 1845 Dresden version of his opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; for Paris.

==Literary characteristics==

The opera libretto from its inception () was written in verse, and this continued well into the 19th century, although genres of musical theatre with spoken dialogue have typically alternated verse in the musical numbers with spoken prose. Since the late 19th century some opera composers have written music to prose or free verse libretti. Much of the recitatives of George Gershwin&#x27;s opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, for instance, are merely DuBose and Dorothy Heyward&#x27;s play &quot;Porgy&quot; set to music as written – in prose – with the lyrics of the arias, duets, trios and choruses written in verse.

The libretto of a musical, on the other hand, is almost always written in prose (except for the song lyrics). The libretto of a musical, if the musical is adapted from a play (or even a novel), may even borrow their source&#x27;s original dialogue liberally – much as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; used dialogue from Lynn Riggs&#x27;s &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot; used dialogue from Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; took most of its dialogue word-for-word from George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; was adapted from the 1959 television play &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot;, which supplied most of the dialogue, and the 1954 musical version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; used J. M. Barrie&#x27;s dialogue. Even the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which is greatly different from the Edna Ferber novel from which it was adapted, uses some of Ferber&#x27;s original dialogue, notably during the miscegenation scene. And Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot; uses chunks of dialogue from Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, although it bills itself as a &quot;free adaptation&quot; of the novel.

==Language and translation==

As the originating language of opera, Italian dominated that genre in Europe (except in France) well through the 18th century, and even into the next century in Russia, for example, when the Italian opera troupe in Saint Petersburg was challenged by the emerging native Russian repertory. Significant exceptions before 1800 can be found in Purcell&#x27;s works, Handel&#x27;s first operas, ballad opera and Singspiel of the 18th century, etc.

Just as with literature and song, the libretto has its share of problems and challenges with translation. In the past (and even today), foreign musical stage works with spoken dialogue, especially comedies, were sometimes performed with the sung portions in the original language and the spoken dialogue in the vernacular. The effects of leaving lyrics untranslated depend on the piece. A man like Louis Durdilly would translate the whole libretto, dialogues and airs, into French: Così fan tutte became &quot; Ainsi font toutes, ou la Fidélité des femmes&quot;, and instead of Ferrando singing &quot;Un&#x27; aura amorosa&quot; French-speaking audiences were treated to Fernand singing &quot;Ma belle est fidèle autant qu&#x27;elle est belle&quot;.

Many musicals, such as the old Betty Grable – Don Ameche – Carmen Miranda vehicles, are largely unaffected, but this practice is especially misleading in translations of musicals like &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; or &quot;Carousel&quot;, in which the lyrics to the songs and the spoken text are often or always closely integrated, and the lyrics serve to further the plot. Availability of printed or projected translations today makes singing in the original language more practical, although one cannot discount the desire to hear a sung drama in one&#x27;s own language.

The Spanish words &quot;libretista&quot; (playwright, script writer or screenwriter) and &quot;libreto&quot; (script or screen play), which are used in the Hispanic TV and cinema industry, derived their meanings from the original operatic sense.

==Status==

Librettists have historically received less prominent credit than the composer. In some 17th-century operas still being performed, the name of the librettist was not even recorded. As the printing of libretti for sale at performances became more common, these records often survive better than music left in manuscript. But even in late 18th century London, reviews rarely mentioned the name of the librettist, as Lorenzo Da Ponte lamented in his memoirs.

By the 20th century some librettists became recognised as part of famous collaborations, as with Gilbert and Sullivan or Rodgers and Hammerstein. Today the composer (past or present) of the musical score to an opera or operetta is usually given top billing for the completed work, and the writer of the lyrics relegated to second place or a mere footnote, a notable exception being Gertrude Stein, who received top billing for &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;. Another exception was Alberto Franchetti&#x27;s 1906 opera &quot;La figlia di Iorio&quot; which was a close rendering of a highly successful play by its librettist, Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, a celebrated Italian poet, novelist and dramatist of the day. In some cases, the operatic adaptation has become more famous than the literary text on which it was based, as with Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; after a play by Maurice Maeterlinck.

The question of which is more important in opera – the music or the words – has been debated over time, and forms the basis of at least two operas, Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot; and Antonio Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Prima la musica e poi le parole&quot;.

==Publication==
Libretti have been made available in several formats, some more nearly complete than others. The text – i.e., the spoken dialogue, song lyrics and stage directions, as applicable – is commonly published separately from the music (such a booklet is usually included with sound recordings of most operas). Sometimes (particularly for operas in the public domain) this format is supplemented with melodic excerpts of musical notation for important numbers.

Printed scores for operas naturally contain the entire libretto, although there can exist significant differences between the score and the separately printed text. More often than not, this involves the extra repetition of words or phrases from the libretto in the actual score. For example, in the aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, the final lines in the libretto are &quot;Tramontate, stelle! All&#x27;alba, vincerò!&quot; (Fade, you stars! At dawn, I will win!). However, in the score they are sung as &quot;Tramontate, stelle! Tramontate, stelle! All&#x27;alba, vincerò! Vincerò! Vincerò!&quot;.

Because the modern musical tends to be published in two separate but intersecting formats (i.e., the book and lyrics, with all the words, and the piano-vocal score, with all the musical material, including some spoken cues), both are needed in order to make a thorough reading of an entire show.
