<text>In sociology, anomie or anomy () is a social condition defined by an uprooting or breakdown of any moral values, standards or guidance for individuals to follow. Anomie is believed to possibly evolve from conflict of belief systems and causes breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community (both economic and primary socialization).

The term, commonly understood to mean &quot;normlessness&quot;, is believed to have been popularized by French sociologist Émile Durkheim in his influential book &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897). Émile Durkheim suggested that Protestants exhibited a greater degree of anomie than Catholics. However, Durkheim first introduced the concept of anomie in his 1893 work &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;. Durkheim never used the term &quot;normlessness&quot;; rather, he described &quot;anomie&quot; as &quot;derangement&quot;, and &quot;an insatiable will.&quot; Durkheim used the term &quot;the malady of the infinite&quot; because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense.

For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards; or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations, i.e.:

== History ==
In 1893, Durkheim introduced the concept of &quot;anomie&quot; to describe the mismatch of collective guild labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was homogeneous in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to &quot;mechanical solidarity&quot; whose inertia hindered adaptation. He contrasted this with the self-regulating behaviour of a division of labour based on differences in constituency, equated to &quot;organic solidarity&quot;, whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.

Durkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other. When solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible, as sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour:Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity:

Durkheim&#x27;s use of &quot;anomie&quot; was in regards to the phenomenon of industrialization—mass-regimentation that could not adapt due to its own inertia. More specifically, its resistance to change causes disruptive cycles of collective behavior (e.g. economics) due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.

Later in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated &quot;anomie&quot; to the influence of a lack of norms or norms that were too rigid. However, such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a &quot;symptom&quot; of anomie, caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to self-regulation, either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete. Durkheim found that Protestant communities have noticeably higher suicide rates than Catholic ones, and justified it with individualism and lack of social cohesion prevalent amongst Protestants, creating poorly integrated society and making Protestants less likely to develop close communal ties that would be crucial in times of hardship. Conversely, he states that the Catholic faith binds individuals together and builds strong social ties, decreasing the risk of suicide and alienation. In this, Durkheim argued that religion is much more important than culture in regards to anomic suicide. This allowed Durkheim to successfully tie social cohesion to suicide rates:

In 1938, Robert K. Merton linked &quot;anomie&quot; with &quot;deviance&quot;, arguing that the discontinuity between culture and structure have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;anomie—&quot;&quot;a reborrowing with French spelling of &quot;anomy&quot;&quot;—comes from (), namely the privative alpha prefix (&quot;a-&quot;, &#x27;without&#x27;), and &quot;nomos&quot; (). The Greeks distinguished between &quot;nomos&quot;, and &quot;arché&quot; (). For example, a monarch is a single ruler but he may still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. &quot;nomos&quot;. In the original city state democracy, the majority rule was an aspect of &quot;arché&quot; because it was a rule-based, customary system, which may or may not make laws, i.e. &quot;nomos&quot;. Thus, the original meaning of &quot;anomie&quot; defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word &quot;anomie&quot; can accept greater flexibility in the word &quot;norm&quot;, and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of anarchy. However, as used by Émile Durkheim and later theorists, &quot;anomie&quot; is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory social controls of society, and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.

== Social disorder ==

Nineteenth-century French sociologist Émile Durkheim borrowed the term &quot;anomie&quot; from French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau. Durkheim used it in his influential book &quot;Suicide&quot; (1897) in order to outline the social (and not individual) causes of suicide, characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as &quot;normlessness&quot;), and an associated feeling of alienation and purposelessness. He believed that &quot;anomie&quot; is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person&#x27;s life and their subsequent depression.

In Durkheim&#x27;s view, traditional religions often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the division of labor that had been prevalent in economic life since the Industrial Revolution led individuals to pursue egoistic ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. Robert King Merton also adopted the idea of anomie to develop strain theory, defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the structural limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit deviant behavior. Friedrich Hayek notably uses the word &quot;anomie&quot; with this meaning.

According to one academic survey, psychometric testing confirmed a link between anomie and academic dishonesty among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it. In another study, anomie was seen as a &quot;push factor&quot; in tourism.

As an older variant, the 1913 &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; reports use of the word &quot;anomie&quot; as meaning &quot;disregard or violation of the law.&quot; However, &quot;anomie&quot; as a social disorder is not to be confused with anarchy: proponents of anarchism claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness. Some anarcho-primitivists argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan or tribe.

In 2003, José Soltero and Romeo Saravia analyzed the concept of anomie in regards to Protestantism and Catholicism in El Salvador. Massive displacement of population in the 1970s, economic and political crises as well as cycles of violence are credited with radically changing the religious composition of the country, rendering it one of the most Protestant countries in Latin America. According to Soltero and Saravia, the rise of Protestantism is conversationally claimed to be caused by a Catholic failure to &quot;address the spiritual needs of the poor&quot; and the Protestant &quot;deeper quest for salvation, liberation, and eternal life&quot;. However, their research does not support these claims, and showed that Protestantism is not more popular amongst the poor. Their findings do confirm the assumptions of anomie, with Catholic communities of El Salvador enjoying high social cohesion, while the Protestant communities have been associated with poorer social integration, internal migration and tend to be places deeply affected by the Salvadoran Civil War. Additionally, Soltero and Saravia found that Salvadoran Catholicism is tied to social activism, liberation theology and the political left, as opposed to the &quot;right wing political orientation, or at least a passive, personally inward orientation, expressed by some Protestant churches&quot;. They conclude that their research contradicts the theory that Protestantism responds to the spiritual needs of the poor more adequately than Catholicism, while also disproving the claim that Protestantism appeals more to women:

The study by Soltero and Saravia has also found a link between Protestantism and no access to healthcare:
==Synnomie==
Freda Adler coined &quot;synnomie&quot; as the opposite of anomie. Using Émile Durkheim&#x27;s concept of social solidarity and collective consciousness, Adler defined &quot;synnomie&quot; as &quot;a congruence of norms to the point of harmonious accommodation&quot;.

Adler described societies in a synnomie state as &quot;characterized by norm conformity, cohesion, intact social controls and norm integration&quot;. Social institutions such as the family, religion and communities, largely serve as sources of norms and social control to maintain a &quot;synnomic society&quot;.

== In culture ==
In Albert Camus&#x27;s existentialist novel &quot;The Stranger&quot;, Meursault—the bored, alienated protagonist—struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of anomie, as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Today mum died. Or maybe yesterday, I don&#x27;t know&quot;).

Fyodor Dostoyevsky expresses a similar concern about anomie in his novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. The Grand Inquisitor remarks that in the absence of God and immortal life, everything would be lawful. In other words, that any act becomes thinkable, that there is no moral compass, which leads to apathy and detachment.

In &quot;The Ink Black Heart&quot; of the &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; novels, written by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, the main antagonist goes by the online handle of &quot;Anomie&quot;.

<text>Conventional superconductors are materials that display superconductivity as described by BCS theory or its extensions. This is in contrast to unconventional superconductors, which do not. Conventional superconductors can be either type-I or type-II.

Most elemental superconductors are conventional. Niobium and vanadium are type-II, while most other elemental superconductors are type-I. Critical temperatures of some elemental superconductors:
Most compound and alloy superconductors are type-II materials. The most commonly used conventional superconductor in applications is a niobium-titanium alloy - this is a type-II superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 11 K. The highest critical temperature so far achieved in a conventional superconductor was 39 K (-234 °C) in magnesium diboride.

<doc id="51072" wikidata="Q1572108" url="?curid=51072" title="Natural deduction">
<text>In logic and proof theory, natural deduction is a kind of proof calculus in which logical reasoning is expressed by inference rules closely related to the &quot;natural&quot; way of reasoning. This contrasts with Hilbert-style systems, which instead use axioms as much as possible to express the logical laws of deductive reasoning.

== History ==
Natural deduction grew out of a context of dissatisfaction with the axiomatizations of deductive reasoning common to the systems of Hilbert, Frege, and Russell (see, e.g., Hilbert system). Such axiomatizations were most famously used by Russell and Whitehead in their mathematical treatise &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by Łukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, Jaśkowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction, first in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updating his proposal in a sequence of papers in 1934 and 1935. His proposals led to different notations
such as Fitch-style calculus (or Fitch&#x27;s diagrams) or Suppes&#x27; method for which Lemmon gave a variant now known as Suppes–Lemmon notation.

Natural deduction in its modern form was independently proposed by the German mathematician Gerhard Gentzen in 1933, in a dissertation delivered to the faculty of mathematical sciences of the University of Göttingen. The term &quot;natural deduction&quot; (or rather, its German equivalent &quot;natürliches Schließen&quot;) was coined in that paper:

Gentzen was motivated by a desire to establish the consistency of number theory. He was unable to prove the main result required for the consistency result, the cut elimination theorem—the Hauptsatz—directly for natural deduction. For this reason he introduced his alternative system, the sequent calculus, for which he proved the Hauptsatz both for classical and intuitionistic logic. In a series of seminars in 1961 and 1962 Prawitz gave a comprehensive summary of natural deduction calculi, and transported much of Gentzen&#x27;s work with sequent calculi into the natural deduction framework. His 1965 monograph &quot;Natural deduction: a proof-theoretical study&quot; was to become a reference work on natural deduction, and included applications for modal and second-order logic.

In natural deduction, a proposition is deduced from a collection of premises by applying inference rules repeatedly. The system presented in this article is a minor variation of Gentzen&#x27;s or Prawitz&#x27;s formulation, but with a closer adherence to Martin-Löf&#x27;s description of logical judgments and connectives.

===History of notation styles===
Natural deduction has had a large variety of notation styles, which can make it difficult to recognize a proof if you&#x27;re not familiar with one of them. To help with this situation, this article has a section explaining how to read all the notation that it will actually use. This section just explains the historical evolution of notation styles, most of which cannot be shown because there are no illustrations available under a public copyright license – the reader is pointed to the SEP and IEP for pictures.
* Gentzen invented natural deduction using tree-shaped proofs – see for details.
* Jaśkowski changed this to a notation that used various nested boxes.
* Fitch changed Jaśkowski method of drawing the boxes, creating Fitch notation.
* 1940: In a textbook, Quine indicated antecedent dependencies by line numbers in square brackets, anticipating Suppes&#x27; 1957 line-number notation.
* 1950: In a textbook, demonstrated a method of using one or more asterisks to the left of each line of proof to indicate dependencies. This is equivalent to Kleene&#x27;s vertical bars. (It is not totally clear if Quine&#x27;s asterisk notation appeared in the original 1950 edition or was added in a later edition.)
* 1957: An introduction to practical logic theorem proving in a textbook by . This indicated dependencies (i.e. antecedent propositions) by line numbers at the left of each line.
* 1963: uses sets of line numbers to indicate antecedent dependencies of the lines of sequential logical arguments based on natural deduction inference rules.
* 1965: The entire textbook by is an introduction to logic proofs using a method based on that of Suppes, what is now known as Suppes–Lemmon notation.
* 1967: In a textbook, briefly demonstrated two kinds of practical logic proofs, one system using explicit quotations of antecedent propositions on the left of each line, the other system using vertical bar-lines on the left to indicate dependencies.

==Notation==
Here is a table with the most common notational variants for logical connectives.
===Gentzen&#x27;s tree notation===

Gentzen, who invented natural deduction, had his own notation style for arguments. This will be exemplified by a simple argument below. Let&#x27;s say we have a simple example argument in propositional logic, such as, &quot;if it&#x27;s raining then it&#x27;s cloudly; it is raining; therefore it&#x27;s cloudy&quot;. (This is in modus ponens.) Representing this as a list of propositions, as is common, we would have:

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3

In Gentzen&#x27;s notation, this would be written like this:

:formula_4

The premises are shown above a line, called the inference line, separated by a comma, which indicates &quot;combination&quot; of premises. The conclusion is written below the inference line. The inference line represents &quot;syntactic consequence&quot;, sometimes called &quot;deductive consequence&quot;, which is also symbolized with ⊢. So the above can also be written in one line as formula_5. (The turnstile, for syntactic consequence, is of lower precedence than the comma, which represents premise combination, which in turn is of lower precedence than the arrow, used for material implication; so no parentheses are needed to interpret this formula.)

Syntactic consequence is contrasted with &quot;semantic consequence&quot;, which is symbolized with ⊧. In this case, the conclusion follows &quot;syntactically&quot; because natural deduction is a syntactic proof system, which assumes inference rules as primitives.

Gentzen&#x27;s style will be used in much of this article. Gentzen&#x27;s discharging annotations used to internalise hypothetical judgments can be avoided by representing proofs as a tree of sequents &quot;Γ ⊢A&quot; instead of a tree of judgments that A (is true).

=== Suppes–Lemmon notation ===
Many textbooks use Suppes–Lemmon notation, so this article will also give that – although as of now, this is only included for propositional logic, and the rest of the coverage is given only in Gentzen style. A proof, laid out in accordance with the Suppes–Lemmon notation style, is a sequence of lines containing sentences, where each sentence is either an assumption, or the result of applying a rule of proof to earlier sentences in the sequence. Each line of proof is made up of a sentence of proof, together with its annotation, its assumption set, and the current line number. The assumption set lists the assumptions on which the given sentence of proof depends, which are referenced by the line numbers. The annotation specifies which rule of proof was applied, and to which earlier lines, to yield the current sentence. Here&#x27;s an example proof:

This proof will become clearer when the inference rules and their appropriate annotations are specified – see .

==Propositional language syntax==
This section defines the formal syntax for a propositional logic language, contrasting the common ways of doing so with a Gentzen-style way of doing so.

=== Common definition styles ===
The formal language formula_6 of a propositional calculus is usually defined by a recursive definition, such as this one, from Bostock:

# Each sentence-letter is a formula.
# &quot;formula_7&quot; and &quot;formula_8&quot; are formulae.
# If formula_9 is a formula, so is formula_10.
# If formula_9 and formula_12 are formulae, so are formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16.
# Nothing else is a formula.
There are other ways of doing it, such as the BNF grammar formula_17.

=== Gentzen-style definition ===
A syntax definition can also be given using , by writing well-formed formulas below the inference line and any schematic variables used by those formulas above it. For instance, the equivalent of rules 3 and 4, from Bostock&#x27;s definition above, is written as follows:

:formula_18.

A different notational convention sees the language&#x27;s syntax as a categorial grammar with the single category &quot;formula&quot;, denoted by the symbol formula_19. So any elements of the syntax are introduced by categorizations, for which the notation is formula_20, meaning &quot;formula_9 is an expression for an object in the category formula_19.&quot; The sentence-letters, then, are introduced by categorizations such as formula_23, formula_24, formula_25, and so on; the connectives, in turn, are defined by statements similar to the above, but using categorization notation, as seen below:

In the rest of this article, the formula_20 categorization notation will be used for any Gentzen-notation statements defining the language&#x27;s grammar; any other statements in Gentzen notation will be inferences, asserting that a sequent follows rather than that an expression is a well-formed formula.

==Gentzen-style propositional logic==

=== Gentzen-style inference rules ===
The following is a complete list of primitive inference rules for natural deduction in classical propositional logic:
This table follows the custom of using Greek letters as &quot;schemata&quot;, which may range over any formulas, rather than only over atomic propositions. The name of a rule is given to the right of its formula tree. For instance, the first introduction rule is named formula_27, which is short for &quot;conjunction introduction&quot;.

=== Gentzen-style example proofs ===
As an example of the use of inference rules, consider commutativity of conjunction. If &quot;A&quot; ∧ &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;B&quot; ∧ &quot;A&quot;; this derivation can be drawn by composing inference rules in such a fashion that premises of a lower inference match the conclusion of the next higher inference.
formula_28
As a second example, consider the derivation of &quot;A ⊃ (B ⊃ (A ∧ B))&quot;:

formula_29

This full derivation has no unsatisfied premises; however, sub-derivations &quot;are&quot; hypothetical. For instance, the derivation of &quot;&quot;B ⊃ (A ∧ B)&quot; is hypothetical with antecedent &quot;A&quot;&quot; (named &quot;u&quot;).

== Suppes–Lemmon-style propositional logic ==

=== Suppes–Lemmon-style inference rules ===
Natural deduction inference rules, due ultimately to Gentzen, are given below. There are ten primitive rules of proof, which are the rule &quot;assumption&quot;, plus four pairs of introduction and elimination rules for the binary connectives, and the rule &quot;reductio ad adbsurdum&quot;. Disjunctive Syllogism can be used as an easier alternative to the proper ∨-elimination, and MTT and DN are commonly given rules, although they are not primitive.

=== Suppes–Lemmon-style example proof ===
Recall that an example proof was already given when introducing . This is a second example.
==Consistency, completeness, and normal forms==

A theory is said to be consistent if falsehood is not provable (from no assumptions) and is complete if every theorem or its negation is provable using the inference rules of the logic. These are statements about the entire logic, and are usually tied to some notion of a model. However, there are local notions of consistency and completeness that are purely syntactic checks on the inference rules, and require no appeals to models. The first of these is local consistency, also known as local reducibility, which says that any derivation containing an introduction of a connective followed immediately by its elimination can be turned into an equivalent derivation without this detour. It is a check on the &quot;strength&quot; of elimination rules: they must not be so strong that they include knowledge not already contained in their premises. As an example, consider conjunctions.
:formula_30

Dually, local completeness says that the elimination rules are strong enough to decompose a connective into the forms suitable for its introduction rule. Again for conjunctions:
:formula_31

These notions correspond exactly to β-reduction (beta reduction) and η-conversion (eta conversion) in the lambda calculus, using the Curry–Howard isomorphism. By local completeness, we see that every derivation can be converted to an equivalent derivation where the principal connective is introduced. In fact, if the entire derivation obeys this ordering of eliminations followed by introductions, then it is said to be &quot;normal&quot;. In a normal derivation all eliminations happen above introductions. In most logics, every derivation has an equivalent normal derivation, called a &quot;normal form&quot;. The existence of normal forms is generally hard to prove using natural deduction alone, though such accounts do exist in the literature, most notably by Dag Prawitz in 1961. It is much easier to show this indirectly by means of a cut-free sequent calculus presentation.

==First and higher-order extensions==

The logic of the earlier section is an example of a &quot;single-sorted&quot; logic, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a logic with a single kind of object: propositions. Many extensions of this simple framework have been proposed; in this section we will extend it with a second sort of &quot;individuals&quot; or &quot;terms&quot;. More precisely, we will add a new category, &quot;term&quot;, denoted formula_32. We shall fix a countable set &quot;formula_33&quot; of &quot;variables&quot;, another countable set formula_34 of &quot;function symbols&quot;, and construct terms with the following formation rules:

:formula_35

and
:formula_36

For propositions, we consider a third countable set &quot;P&quot; of &quot;predicates&quot;, and define &quot;atomic predicates over terms&quot; with the following formation rule:

:formula_37

The first two rules of formation provide a definition of a term that is effectively the same as that defined in term algebra and model theory, although the focus of those fields of study is quite different from natural deduction. The third rule of formation effectively defines an atomic formula, as in first-order logic, and again in model theory.

To these are added a pair of formation rules, defining the notation for &quot;quantified&quot; propositions; one for universal (∀) and existential (∃) quantification:

:formula_38

The universal quantifier has the introduction and elimination rules:

:formula_39

The existential quantifier has the introduction and elimination rules:
:formula_40

In these rules, the notation [&quot;t&quot;/&quot;x&quot;] &quot;A&quot; stands for the substitution of &quot;t&quot; for every (visible) instance of &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot;, avoiding capture. As before the superscripts on the name stand for the components that are discharged: the term &quot;a&quot; cannot occur in the conclusion of ∀I (such terms are known as &quot;eigenvariables&quot; or &quot;parameters&quot;), and the hypotheses named &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; in ∃E are localised to the second premise in a hypothetical derivation. Although the propositional logic of earlier sections was decidable, adding the quantifiers makes the logic undecidable.

So far, the quantified extensions are &quot;first-order&quot;: they distinguish propositions from the kinds of objects quantified over. Higher-order logic takes a different approach and has only a single sort of propositions. The quantifiers have as the domain of quantification the very same sort of propositions, as reflected in the formation rules:

:formula_41

A discussion of the introduction and elimination forms for higher-order logic is beyond the scope of this article. It is possible to be in-between first-order and higher-order logics. For example, second-order logic has two kinds of propositions, one kind quantifying over terms, and the second kind quantifying over propositions of the first kind.

==Proofs and type theory==

The presentation of natural deduction so far has concentrated on the nature of propositions without giving a formal definition of a &quot;proof&quot;. To formalise the notion of proof, we alter the presentation of hypothetical derivations slightly. We label the antecedents with &quot;proof variables&quot; (from some countable set &quot;V&quot; of variables), and decorate the succedent with the actual proof. The antecedents or &quot;hypotheses&quot; are separated from the succedent by means of a &quot;turnstile&quot; (⊢). This modification sometimes goes under the name of &quot;localised hypotheses&quot;. The following diagram summarises the change.

The collection of hypotheses will be written as Γ when their exact composition is not relevant.
To make proofs explicit, we move from the proof-less judgment &quot;A&quot; to a judgment: &quot;π &quot;is a proof of (A)&quot;&quot;, which is written symbolically as &quot;π : &quot;A&quot;&quot;. Following the standard approach, proofs are specified with their own formation rules for the judgment &quot;π &quot;proof&quot;&quot;. The simplest possible proof is the use of a labelled hypothesis; in this case the evidence is the label itself.

Let us re-examine some of the connectives with explicit proofs. For conjunction, we look at the introduction rule ∧I to discover the form of proofs of conjunction: they must be a pair of proofs of the two conjuncts. Thus:

The elimination rules ∧E1 and ∧E2 select either the left or the right conjunct; thus the proofs are a pair of projections—first (fst) and second (snd).

For implication, the introduction form localises or &quot;binds&quot; the hypothesis, written using a λ; this corresponds to the discharged label. In the rule, &quot;Γ, &quot;u&quot;:&quot;A&quot;&quot; stands for the collection of hypotheses Γ, together with the additional hypothesis &quot;u&quot;.

With proofs available explicitly, one can manipulate and reason about proofs. The key operation on proofs is the substitution of one proof for an assumption used in another proof. This is commonly known as a &quot;substitution theorem&quot;, and can be proved by induction on the depth (or structure) of the second judgment.

=== Substitution theorem ===

: &quot;If&quot; Γ ⊢ π1 : &quot;A&quot; &quot;and&quot; Γ, &quot;u&quot;:&quot;A&quot; ⊢ π2 : &quot;B&quot;, &quot;then&quot; Γ ⊢ [π1/&quot;u&quot;] π2 : B.

So far the judgment &quot;Γ ⊢ π : &quot;A&quot;&quot; has had a purely logical interpretation. In type theory, the logical view is exchanged for a more computational view of objects. Propositions in the logical interpretation are now viewed as &quot;types&quot;, and proofs as programs in the lambda calculus. Thus the interpretation of &quot;π : &quot;A&quot; is &quot;the program&quot; π has type &quot;A&quot;&quot;. The logical connectives are also given a different reading: conjunction is viewed as product (×), implication as the function arrow (→), etc. The differences are only cosmetic, however. Type theory has a natural deduction presentation in terms of formation, introduction and elimination rules; in fact, the reader can easily reconstruct what is known as &quot;simple type theory&quot; from the previous sections.

The difference between logic and type theory is primarily a shift of focus from the types (propositions) to the programs (proofs). Type theory is chiefly interested in the convertibility or reducibility of programs. For every type, there are canonical programs of that type which are irreducible; these are known as &quot;canonical forms&quot; or &quot;values&quot;. If every program can be reduced to a canonical form, then the type theory is said to be &quot;normalising&quot; (or &quot;weakly normalising&quot;). If the canonical form is unique, then the theory is said to be &quot;strongly normalising&quot;. Normalisability is a rare feature of most non-trivial type theories, which is a big departure from the logical world. (Recall that almost every logical derivation has an equivalent normal derivation.) To sketch the reason: in type theories that admit recursive definitions, it is possible to write programs that never reduce to a value; such looping programs can generally be given any type. In particular, the looping program has type ⊥, although there is no logical proof of &quot;⊥&quot;. For this reason, the &quot;propositions as types; proofs as programs&quot; paradigm only works in one direction, if at all: interpreting a type theory as a logic generally gives an inconsistent logic.

===Example: Dependent Type Theory===

Like logic, type theory has many extensions and variants, including first-order and higher-order versions. One branch, known as dependent type theory, is used in a number of computer-assisted proof systems. Dependent type theory allows quantifiers to range over programs themselves. These quantified types are written as Π and Σ instead of ∀ and ∃, and have the following formation rules:

These types are generalisations of the arrow and product types, respectively, as witnessed by their introduction and elimination rules.

Dependent type theory in full generality is very powerful: it is able to express almost any conceivable property of programs directly in the types of the program. This generality comes at a steep price — either typechecking is undecidable (extensional type theory), or extensional reasoning is more difficult (intensional type theory). For this reason, some dependent type theories do not allow quantification over arbitrary programs, but rather restrict to programs of a given decidable &quot;index domain&quot;, for example integers, strings, or linear programs.

Since dependent type theories allow types to depend on programs, a natural question to ask is whether it is possible for programs to depend on types, or any other combination. There are many kinds of answers to such questions. A popular approach in type theory is to allow programs to be quantified over types, also known as &quot;parametric polymorphism&quot;; of this there are two main kinds: if types and programs are kept separate, then one obtains a somewhat more well-behaved system called &quot;predicative polymorphism&quot;; if the distinction between program and type is blurred, one obtains the type-theoretic analogue of higher-order logic, also known as &quot;impredicative polymorphism&quot;. Various combinations of dependency and polymorphism have been considered in the literature, the most famous being the lambda cube of Henk Barendregt.

The intersection of logic and type theory is a vast and active research area. New logics are usually formalised in a general type theoretic setting, known as a logical framework. Popular modern logical frameworks such as the calculus of constructions and LF are based on higher-order dependent type theory, with various trade-offs in terms of decidability and expressive power. These logical frameworks are themselves always specified as natural deduction systems, which is a testament to the versatility of the natural deduction approach.

==Classical and modal logics==

For simplicity, the logics presented so far have been intuitionistic. Classical logic extends intuitionistic logic with an additional axiom or principle of excluded middle:

:For any proposition p, the proposition p ∨ ¬p is true.

This statement is not obviously either an introduction or an elimination; indeed, it involves two distinct connectives. Gentzen&#x27;s original treatment of excluded middle prescribed one of the following three (equivalent) formulations, which were already present in analogous forms in the systems of Hilbert and Heyting:
(XM3 is merely XM2 expressed in terms of E.) This treatment of excluded middle, in addition to being objectionable from a purist&#x27;s standpoint, introduces additional complications in the definition of normal forms.

A comparatively more satisfactory treatment of classical natural deduction in terms of introduction and elimination rules alone was first proposed by Parigot in 1992 in the form of a classical lambda calculus called λμ. The key insight of his approach was to replace a truth-centric judgment &quot;A&quot; with a more classical notion, reminiscent of the sequent calculus: in localised form, instead of Γ ⊢ &quot;A&quot;, he used Γ ⊢ Δ, with Δ a collection of propositions similar to Γ. Γ was treated as a conjunction, and Δ as a disjunction. This structure is essentially lifted directly from classical sequent calculi, but the innovation in λμ was to give a computational meaning to classical natural deduction proofs in terms of a callcc or a throw/catch mechanism seen in LISP and its descendants. (See also: first class control.)

Another important extension was for modal and other logics that need more than just the basic judgment of truth. These were first described, for the alethic modal logics S4 and S5, in a natural deduction style by Prawitz in 1965, and have since accumulated a large body of related work. To give a simple example, the modal logic S4 requires one new judgment, &quot;A valid&quot;, that is categorical with respect to truth:

:If &quot;A&quot; (is true) under no assumption that &quot;B&quot; (is true), then &quot;A valid&quot;.

This categorical judgment is internalised as a unary connective ◻&quot;A&quot; (read &quot;&quot;necessarily A&quot;) with the following introduction and elimination rules:
Note that the premise &quot;A valid&quot;&quot; has no defining rules; instead, the categorical definition of validity is used in its place. This mode becomes clearer in the localised form when the hypotheses are explicit. We write &quot;Ω;Γ ⊢ &quot;A&quot; where Γ contains the true hypotheses as before, and Ω contains valid hypotheses. On the right there is just a single judgment &quot;A&quot;&quot;; validity is not needed here since &quot;Ω ⊢ &quot;A valid&quot;&quot; is by definition the same as &quot;Ω;⋅ ⊢ &quot;A&quot;&quot;. The introduction and elimination forms are then:
The modal hypotheses have their own version of the hypothesis rule and substitution theorem.
=== Modal substitution theorem ===
; : &quot;If&quot; Ω;⋅ ⊢ π1 : &quot;A&quot; &quot;and&quot; Ω, &quot;u&quot;: (&quot;A valid&quot;) ; Γ ⊢ π2 : &quot;C&quot;, &quot;then&quot; Ω;Γ ⊢ [π1/&quot;u&quot;] π2 : &quot;C&quot;.

This framework of separating judgments into distinct collections of hypotheses, also known as &quot;multi-zoned&quot; or &quot;polyadic&quot; contexts, is very powerful and extensible; it has been applied for many different modal logics, and also for linear and other substructural logics, to give a few examples. However, relatively few systems of modal logic can be formalised directly in natural deduction. To give proof-theoretic characterisations of these systems, extensions such as labelling or systems of deep inference.

The addition of labels to formulae permits much finer control of the conditions under which rules apply, allowing the more flexible techniques of analytic tableaux to be applied, as has been done in the case of labelled deduction. Labels also allow the naming of worlds in Kripke semantics; presents an influential technique for converting frame conditions of modal logics in Kripke semantics into inference rules in a natural deduction formalisation of hybrid logic. surveys the application of many proof theories, such as Avron and Pottinger&#x27;s hypersequents and Belnap&#x27;s display logic to such modal logics as S5 and B.

==Comparison with sequent calculus==

The sequent calculus is the chief alternative to natural deduction as a foundation of mathematical logic. In natural deduction the flow of information is bi-directional: elimination rules flow information downwards by deconstruction, and introduction rules flow information upwards by assembly. Thus, a natural deduction proof does not have a purely bottom-up or top-down reading, making it unsuitable for automation in proof search. To address this fact, Gentzen in 1935 proposed his sequent calculus, though he initially intended it as a technical device for clarifying the consistency of predicate logic. Kleene, in his seminal 1952 book &quot;Introduction to Metamathematics&quot;, gave the first formulation of the sequent calculus in the modern style.

In the sequent calculus all inference rules have a purely bottom-up reading. Inference rules can apply to elements on both sides of the turnstile. (To differentiate from natural deduction, this article uses a double arrow ⇒ instead of the right tack ⊢ for sequents.) The introduction rules of natural deduction are viewed as &quot;right rules&quot; in the sequent calculus, and are structurally very similar. The elimination rules on the other hand turn into &quot;left rules&quot; in the sequent calculus. To give an example, consider disjunction; the right rules are familiar:

On the left:

Recall the ∨E rule of natural deduction in localised form:

The proposition &quot;A ∨ B&quot;, which is the succedent of a premise in ∨E, turns into a hypothesis of the conclusion in the left rule ∨L. Thus, left rules can be seen as a sort of inverted elimination rule. This observation can be illustrated as follows:

In the sequent calculus, the left and right rules are performed in lock-step until one reaches the &quot;initial sequent&quot;, which corresponds to the meeting point of elimination and introduction rules in natural deduction. These initial rules are superficially similar to the hypothesis rule of natural deduction, but in the sequent calculus they describe a &quot;transposition&quot; or a &quot;handshake&quot; of a left and a right proposition:

The correspondence between the sequent calculus and natural deduction is a pair of soundness and completeness theorems, which are both provable by means of an inductive argument.

; Soundness of ⇒ wrt. ⊢ : &quot;If&quot; Γ ⇒ &quot;A&quot;, &quot;then&quot; Γ ⊢ &quot;A&quot;.
; Completeness of ⇒ wrt. ⊢ : &quot;If&quot; Γ ⊢ &quot;A&quot;, &quot;then&quot; Γ ⇒ &quot;A&quot;.

It is clear by these theorems that the sequent calculus does not change the notion of truth, because the same collection of propositions remain true. Thus, one can use the same proof objects as before in sequent calculus derivations. As an example, consider the conjunctions. The right rule is virtually identical to the introduction rule

The left rule, however, performs some additional substitutions that are not performed in the corresponding elimination rules.
The kinds of proofs generated in the sequent calculus are therefore rather different from those of natural deduction. The sequent calculus produces proofs in what is known as the &quot;β-normal η-long&quot; form, which corresponds to a canonical representation of the normal form of the natural deduction proof. If one attempts to describe these proofs using natural deduction itself, one obtains what is called the &quot;intercalation calculus&quot; (first described by John Byrnes), which can be used to formally define the notion of a &quot;normal form&quot; for natural deduction.

The substitution theorem of natural deduction takes the form of a structural rule or structural theorem known as &quot;cut&quot; in the sequent calculus.

=== Cut (substitution) ===

: &quot;If&quot; Γ ⇒ π1 : &quot;A&quot; &quot;and&quot; Γ, &quot;u&quot;:&quot;A&quot; ⇒ π2 : &quot;C&quot;, &quot;then&quot; Γ ⇒ [π1/u] π2 : &quot;C&quot;.

In most well behaved logics, cut is unnecessary as an inference rule, though it remains provable as a meta-theorem; the superfluousness of the cut rule is usually presented as a computational process, known as &quot;cut elimination&quot;. This has an interesting application for natural deduction; usually it is extremely tedious to prove certain properties directly in natural deduction because of an unbounded number of cases. For example, consider showing that a given proposition is &quot;not&quot; provable in natural deduction. A simple inductive argument fails because of rules like ∨E or E which can introduce arbitrary propositions. However, we know that the sequent calculus is complete with respect to natural deduction, so it is enough to show this unprovability in the sequent calculus. Now, if cut is not available as an inference rule, then all sequent rules either introduce a connective on the right or the left, so the depth of a sequent derivation is fully bounded by the connectives in the final conclusion. Thus, showing unprovability is much easier, because there are only a finite number of cases to consider, and each case is composed entirely of sub-propositions of the conclusion. A simple instance of this is the &quot;global consistency&quot; theorem: &quot;⋅ ⊢ ⊥&quot; is not provable. In the sequent calculus version, this is manifestly true because there is no rule that can have &quot;⋅ ⇒ ⊥&quot; as a conclusion! Proof theorists often prefer to work on cut-free sequent calculus formulations because of such properties.

<text>Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin (9 December 1842 – 8 February 1921) was a Russian anarchist and geographer known as a proponent of anarchist communism.

Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, Kropotkin attended Page Corps and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost four years) and England. While in exile, he gave lectures and published widely on anarchism and geography. Kropotkin returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917, but he was disappointed by the Bolshevik state.

Kropotkin was a proponent of the idea of decentralized communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; (1892) and &quot;Fields, Factories, and Workshops&quot; (1899), with &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot; (1902) being his principal scientific offering. He contributed the article on anarchism to the eleventh edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and left an unfinished work on anarchist ethical philosophy.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

Kropotkin was born in Moscow on 9 December 1842, in the Konyushennaya (&quot;Equerries&quot;) district. His father, Alexander, was a typical royal officer who owned serfs in three provinces and whose family descended from the princes of Smolensk. His mother, Ekatarina Sulima, was the daughter of General Nikolai Sulima and a descendant of a Zaporozhian Cossack leader. Peter, the youngest of her four children, was three years old when she died of tuberculosis. Kropotkin&#x27;s father remarried two years later. This stepmother was indifferent towards the Kropotkin children and had a streak of jealous vindictiveness, going through great lengths to remove the memory of Kropotkin&#x27;s mother.

With his father mostly absent, Kropotkin and his older brother, Alexander, were raised by their German nurse. Kropotkin developed an enduring compassion for the estate&#x27;s servants and serfs who cared for him and relayed stories of his mother&#x27;s kindness. He was raised in the family&#x27;s Moscow mansion and an estate in Nikolskoye, Kaluga Oblast, outside Moscow.

At the age of eight, Kropotkin attended Tsar Nicholas I&#x27;s Royal Ball. Commending the child&#x27;s costume, the tsar chose Kropotkin for his Page Corps, an elite school in St. Petersburg that combined military and court education and produced the tsar&#x27;s imperial attendants. Kropotkin joined the Page Corps as a teenager and began a 14-year epistolary relationship with his brother that charts his intellectual and emotional development. By the time of his arrival, Kropotkin had already shown a populist position towards the emancipation of serfs and a nature of revolt against his father and the school&#x27;s hazing. Kropotkin began his first underground revolutionary writings at the school, where he advocated for a Russian constitution. He developed an interest in science, reading, and opera. As a top student, Kropotkin became a sergeant-major in 1861 and was thrust into court life, serving as the emperor&#x27;s personal Page de Chambre. His views of the tsar and court life soured as imperial policy changed over the next year. Privately he was preoccupied with the need to live a societally useful life.

=== Siberia ===

For his tour of service, in 1862 he chose the Amur Cossacks in east Siberia, an undesirable post that would let him study the technical mathematics of artillery, travel, live in nature, and achieve financial independence from his father. He developed a firm worldview of compassion for the poor and contrasted the pride and dignity of the yeoman peasant farmers against the indignities of serfdom. He wrote approvingly of the cultivated Transbaikalia governor-general Boleslav Kukel, to whom Kropotkin reported. Kukel engaged Kropotkin in prison reform and city self-governance projects that the central government ultimately denied. The exiled poet and political prisoner Mikhail Larionovitch Mikhailov introduced Kropotkin to anarchism by recommending he read an essay by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Kropotkin&#x27;s brother came to live with him in Irkutsk. 

After Kukel&#x27;s ouster in early 1863, Kropotkin found solace in geographical work. He led a disguised reconnaissance expedition to find a direct route through Manchuria from Chita to Vladivostok the next year. He explored the East Siberian Mountains in the north the year after. The mountain measurements from his 1866 Olekminsk-Vitimsk expedition confirmed his Manchurian hypothesis that the Siberian area from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean was a plateau and not a plain. This discovery of the Patom and Vitim Plateaus won him a gold medal from the Russian Geographical Society and led to the commercialization of the Lena gold fields. A range of mountains in this region was later named for him.

Kropotkin covered Siberia for St. Petersburg newspapers since his arrival, including the condition of the Polish political exiles who participated in the unsuccessful 1866 Baikal Insurrection. Kropotkin secured a promise from the governor-general to suspend the prisoners&#x27; death sentences, which was reneged upon. Disillusioned, Kropotkin and his brother resolved to leave the military. His time in Siberia taught him to appreciate peasant social organization and convinced him that administrative reform was an ineffectual means to improve social conditions.

After five years in Siberia, Kropotkin and his brother moved to St. Petersburg, where they continued their schooling and academic work. Kropotkin took a position with the Russian interior ministry with no duties. He studied physics, math, and geography at the university. After presenting his Vitim expedition findings, Kropotkin accepted the Russian Geographical Society&#x27;s part-time offer of its Physical Geography section Secretaryship. Kropotkin translated Herbert Spencer&#x27;s work for additional income. He continued to develop a theory, which he considered his best scientific contribution, that the East Siberian mountains were part of a large plateau and not independent ridges. Kropotkin participated in an 1870 polar expedition plan that postulated the existence of what was later discovered as the Franz Josef Land Arctic archipelago.

In early 1871, he was commissioned to study the Ice Age in Scandinavian geography, in which Kropotkin developed theories of the glaciation of Europe and the glacial lakes of its northeast. His father died later that year and Kropotkin inherited a wealthy estate in Tambov. Kropotkin turned down the Geographical Society&#x27;s offer of its general secretary position, instead choosing work on his Ice Age data and interest in bettering the lives of peasants.

=== Anarchism ===

While Kropotkin became increasingly revolutionary in his writings, he was not known for activism. He was spurred by the 1871 Paris Commune and trial of Sergey Nechayev. He and his brother attended meetings on the Franco-Prussian War and revolutionism. Likely at the encouragement of a Swiss extended family member and his own desire to see the socialist worker&#x27;s movement, Kropotkin set out to see Switzerland and Western Europe in February 1872. Over three months, he met Mikhail Sazhin in Zurich, worked and fell out with Nikolai Utin&#x27;s Marxist group in Geneva, and was introduced to the Jura Federation&#x27;s James Guillaume and Adhémar Schwitzguébel. The Jura were the main internal opposition to the Marxist-controlled First International, as followers of Mikhail Bakunin. Kropotkin was quickly impressed and was instantly converted to anarchism by the group&#x27;s egalitarianism and independence of expression, but narrowly missed meeting the leading anarchist, Bakunin, while there. Kropotkin visited Belgium&#x27;s movement before returning to Russia in May with contraband literature.

Back in St. Petersburg, Kropotkin joined the Chaikovsky Circle, a group of revolutionaries that Kropotkin considered more educational than revolutionary in their activities. Kropotkin believed in the inevitability of Social revolution and the need for stateless social organization. His Populist revolutionary program for the group focused on urban workers and peasants whereas the group&#x27;s moderates focused on students. Partially for this reason, he declined to contribute his personal wealth to the group. He viewed professionals as unlikely to forgo their privileges and judged them to not live societally useful lives. His program emphasized federated agrarian communes and a revolutionary party. While he could speak powerfully, Kropotkin was not a successful organizer.

Kropotkin&#x27;s first political memo in November 1873 covered his basic plan for stateless social reconstruction including common property, worker control of factories, shared physical labor towards societal need, and labor vouchers in lieu of money. He emphasized living among commoners and using propaganda to focus mass dissatisfaction. He rejected the Nechayev conspiracy model. Members of the circle began to be arrested in late 1873 and the Third Section secret police came for Kropotkin in March 1874.

His arrest for agitation, as a former &quot;page de chambre&quot; and officer, was scandalous. Kropotkin had just filed his Ice Age report and had been recently elected president of the Geographical Society&#x27;s Physical and Mathematical Department. At the society&#x27;s request the tsar granted Kropotkin books to finish his glaciation report. Kropotkin was held in the Peter and Paul Fortress. His brother, who had also radicalized as a follower of Lavrov, was also arrested and exiled in Siberia, where he committed suicide about a decade later.

Kropotkin was moved to the House of Detention prison military hospital in St. Petersburg for poor health, with the help of his sister. With assistance from friends, he escaped from the minimal-security prison in June 1876. By way of Scandinavia and England, Kropotkin arrived in Switzerland by the end of the year, where he met Italian anarchists Carlo Cafiero and Errico Malatesta. He visited Belgium and Zurich, where he met French geographer Élisée Reclus, who became a close friend.

=== Exile ===

Kropotkin associated with the Jura Federation and began editing its publication. There he met Ukrainian Jewish student Sophie Kropotkin, and the two were married in 1878. In 1879, he started &quot;Le Révolté&quot;, a revolutionary fortnightly, in Geneva that published his personal articulation of anarchist communism, the idea of distributing work product communally based on need rather than by work. He became the philosophy&#x27;s most prominent proponent, despite not creating it. The philosophy became part of the Jura program in 1880 at Kropotkin&#x27;s advocacy. &quot;Le Révolté&quot; also published Kropotkin&#x27;s best known pamphlet, &quot;An Appeal to the Young&quot;, in 1880. 

Switzerland expelled Kropotkin at Russia&#x27;s behest after the assassination of Alexander II in early 1881. He moved to Thonon-les-Bains, France, near Geneva, so that his wife could finish her Swiss education. Upon learning that the Holy League, a tsarist group, intended to kill him for his alleged association with the assassination, he moved to London, but could only bear to live there for a year. Upon his return in late 1882, the French arrested him for agitation, partly to appease Russia. He was sentenced to five years in Lyons. In early 1883, he was transferred to the Clairvaux Prison, where he continued his academic work. A public campaign of intellectuals and French legislators called for his release. Reclus published &quot;Words of a Rebel&quot;, a compilation of Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;Révolté&quot; writings while he was in prison, which became a main source of Kropotkin&#x27;s thoughts on revolution. As Kropotkin&#x27;s health worsened from scurvy and malaria, France released him in early 1886. He would stay in England through 1917, settling in Harrow, London, apart from brief trips to other European countries.

In London in late 1886, he co-founded &quot;Freedom&quot;, an anarchist monthly and the first English anarchist periodical, which he continued to support for almost three decades. His first and only child, Alexandra Kropotkin, was born the next year. He published multiple books over the next coming years including &quot;In Russian and French Prisons&quot; and &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;. His intellectual circle in London included William Morris and W. B. Yeats as well as old Russian friends Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky and Nikolai Tchaikovsky. Kropotkin contributed to the &quot;Geographical Journal&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;.

After 1890, according to biographers George Woodcock and Ivan Avakumović, Kropotkin became more of a scholarly recluse and less of a propagandist. His works&#x27; revolutionary zeal subsided as he turned to social, ethical, and scientific questions. He joined the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He continued to contribute to &quot;Freedom&quot; but was no longer an editor.

Several of Kropotkin&#x27;s books began as journal articles. His writings on anarchist communist social life were printed in the French successor to &quot;Le Révolté&quot; and later revised into &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; in 1892. Kropotkin&#x27;s writings on decentralizing production and industry against the countervailing trend of centralized industrialization were compiled into his &quot;Fields, Factories, and Workshops&quot; in 1899. His research throughout the 1890s on the animal instinct for cooperation as a counterpoint to Darwinism became a series of articles in &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; and, later, the book &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, which was widely translated.

Following a scientific congress in Toronto in 1897, Kropotkin toured Canada. His experience there led him to advise the Russian Doukhobors who sought to immigrate there. He helped facilitate their emigration in 1899. Kropotkin entered the United States and met John Most, Emma Goldman, and Benjamin Tucker. American publishers published his &quot;Memoirs of a Revolutionist&quot; and &quot;Fields, Factories, and Workshops&quot; by the end of the decade. He visited the United States again in 1901 at the invitation of the Lowell Institute to give lectures on Russian literature that were later published. He published &quot;The Great French Revolution&quot; (1909), &quot;The Terror in Russia&quot; (1909), and &quot;Modern Science and Anarchism&quot; (1913). His 70th birthday in 1912 had celebratory gatherings in London and Paris.

Kropotkin&#x27;s support for Western entry into World War I, siding with Britain and France, divided the anarchist movement, which had been anti-war, and damaged his esteem as a luminary of socialism. He exacerbated this by insisting, with returning to Russia, that Russians support the war as well.

=== Return to Russia ===

With the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Kropotkin returned to Russia in June 1917. He refused the Petrograd Provisional Government&#x27;s offer of a cabinet seat. In August, he advocated for defending Russia and the revolution at the National State Conference. Kropotkin applied for a residence in Moscow in 1918, which was personally approved by Vladimir Lenin, head of the Soviet government. Months later, finding life in Moscow difficult in his old age, Kropotkin moved with his family to a friend&#x27;s home in the nearby town of Dmitrov.

In 1919, Emma Goldman visited his family there. Kropotkin met Lenin in Moscow and corresponded by mail to discuss political questions of the day. He advocated for workers&#x27; cooperatives and argued against the Bolsheviks&#x27; hostage policy and centralization of authority, while simultaneously encouraging Western comrades to stop their governments&#x27; military interventions in Russia. Kropotkin ultimately had little impact on the Russian revolution, but his advocacy work for political and anarchist prisoners in Russia, and for the Russian revolution, during the last four years of his life replenished some of the goodwill he had lost due to his support for the Western powers in World War I.

Kropotkin died of pneumonia on 8 February 1921. His family refused an offer of a state funeral. With his Moscow funeral, the Bolsheviks permitted the diminished Russian anarchist movement an official, restrained occasion to memorialize their figurehead. It was the last major anarchist demonstration of the period in Russia, because the movement, and Kropotkin&#x27;s writings, were fully suppressed later that year.

== Philosophy ==
=== Critique of capitalism ===
Kropotkin critiqued what he considered to be the fallacies of the economic systems of feudalism and capitalism. He believed they create poverty and artificial scarcity and promote privilege. Alternatively, he proposed a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation. He argued that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.

Kropotkin disagreed in part with the Marxist critique of capitalism, including the labor theory of value, believing there was no necessary link between work performed and the values of commodities. His attack on the institution of wage labor was based more on the power employers exerted over employees, and not only on the extraction of surplus value from their labor. Kropotkin claimed this power was made possible by the state&#x27;s protection of private ownership of productive resources. However, Kropotkin believed the possibility of surplus value was itself the problem, holding that a society would still be unjust if the workers of a particular industry kept their surplus to themselves, rather than redistributing it for the common good.

=== Critique of state socialism ===

Kropotkin believed that a communist society could be established only by a social revolution, which he described as, &quot;... the taking possession by the people of all social wealth. It is the abolition of all the forces which have so long hampered the development of Humanity&quot;. However, he criticized forms of revolutionary methods (like those proposed by Marxism and Blanquism) that retained the use of state power, arguing that any central authority was incompatible with the dramatic changes needed by a social revolution. Kropotkin believed that the mechanisms of the state were deeply rooted in maintaining the power of one class over another, and thus could not be used to emancipate the working class. Instead, Kropotkin insisted that both private property and the state needed to be abolished together.

The economic change which will result from the Social Revolution will be so immense and so profound, it must so change all the relations based today on property and exchange, that it is impossible for one or any individual to elaborate the different social forms, which must spring up in the society of the future. [...] Any authority external to it will only be an obstacle, only a trammel on the organic labor which must be accomplished, and beside that a source of discord and hatred.

Kropotkin believed that any post-revolutionary government would lack the local knowledge to organize a diverse population. Their vision of society would be limited by their own vindictive, self-serving, or narrow ideals. To ensure order, preserve authority, and organize production the state would need to use violence and coercion to suppress further revolution, and control workers. The workers would be reliant on the state bureaucracy to organize them, so they would never develop the initiative to self-organize as they needed. This would lead to the re-creation of classes, an oppressed workforce, and eventually another revolution. Thus, Kropotkin wrote that maintaining the state would paralyze any true social revolution, making the idea of a &quot;revolutionary government&quot; a contradiction in terms:

We know that Revolution and Government are incompatible; one must destroy the other, no matter what name is given to government, whether dictator, royalty, or parliament. We know that what makes the strength and the truth of our party is contained in this fundamental formula — &quot;Nothing good or durable can be done except by the free initiative of the people, and every government tends to destroy it;&quot; and so the very best among us, if their ideas had not to pass through the crucible of the popular mind, before being put into execution, and if they should become masters of that formidable machine — the government — and could thus act as they chose, would become in a week fit only for the gallows. We know whither every dictator leads, even the best intentioned, — namely to the death of all revolutionary movement.

Rather than a centralized approach, Kropotkin stressed the need for decentralized organization. He believed that dissolving the state would cripple counter-revolution without reverting to authoritarian methods of control, writing, &quot;In order to conquer, something more than guillotines are required. It is the revolutionary idea, the truly wide revolutionary conception, which reduces its enemies to impotence by paralyzing all the instruments by which they have governed hitherto.&quot; He believed this was possible only through a widespread &quot;Boldness of thought, a distinct and wide conception of all that is desired, constructive force arising from the people in proportion as the negation of authority dawns; and finally—the initiative of all in the work of reconstruction—this will give to the revolution the Power required to conquer.&quot;

Kropotkin applied this criticism to the Bolsheviks&#x27; rule following the October Revolution. Kropotkin summarized his thoughts in a 1919 letter to the workers of Western Europe, promoting the possibility of revolution, but also warning against the centralized control in Russia, which he believed had condemned them to failure. Kropotkin wrote to Lenin in 1920, describing the desperate conditions that he believed to be the result of bureaucratic organization, and urging Lenin to allow for local and decentralized institutions. Following an announcement of executions later that year, Kropotkin sent Lenin another furious letter, admonishing the terror which Kropotkin saw as needlessly destructive.

=== Cooperation and competition ===
In 1902, Kropotkin published his book &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, which gave an alternative view of animal and human survival. At the time, some proponents of &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; such as Francis Galton proffered a theory of interpersonal competition and natural hierarchy. Instead, Kropotkin argued that &quot;it was an evolutionary emphasis on cooperation instead of competition in the Darwinian sense that made for the success of species, including the human&quot;. In the last chapter, he wrote:


Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans, but did not consider them the driving force of human history. He believed that seeking out conflict proved to be socially beneficial only in attempts to destroy injustice, as well as authoritarian institutions such as the state or the Russian Orthodox Church, which he saw as stifling human creativity and impeding human instinctual drive towards cooperation.

Kropotkin claimed that the benefits arising from mutual organization incentivizes humans more than mutual strife. His hope was that in the long run, mutual organization would drive individuals to produce. Anarcho-primitivists and anarcho-communists believe that a gift economy can break the cycle of poverty. They rely on Kropotkin, who believed that the hunter-gatherers he had visited implemented mutual aid. 
=== Mutual aid ===

In his 1892 book &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;, Kropotkin proposed a system of economics based on mutual exchanges made in a system of voluntary cooperation. He believed that in a society that is socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services it needs, there would be no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange, to prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.

Kropotkin believed that Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s collectivist economic model was just a wage system by a different name and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual&#x27;s contributions to the products of labor and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.

According to Kirkpatrick Sale, &quot;[w]ith &quot;Mutual Aid&quot; especially, and later with &quot;Fields, Factories, and Workshops&quot;, Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of individual anarchism and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.&quot;

=== Self-sufficiency ===
Kropotkin&#x27;s focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for self-sufficiency by manufacturing its own goods and growing its own food, thus lessening the need to rely on imports. To these ends, he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production.

== Personal life ==

Kropotkin married Sofia, a Ukrainian Jewish student, in Switzerland in October 1878. She was over a decade younger than Kropotkin. Kropotkin references her as a primary source of criticism and feedback. Her published story, &quot;The Wife of Number 4,237&quot;, was based on her own experience with her husband at Clairvaux prison. She created an archive in Moscow dedicated to his works before her death in 1941. Their only child, Alexandra, was born in London in 1887. Kropotkin was reserved about his private life.

As an individual, Kropotkin was known for having exceptional integrity and moral character that matched his beliefs. Henry Hyndman, an ideological adversary, recalled Kropotkin&#x27;s charm and sincerity. These traits, wrote Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, contributed to Kropotkin&#x27;s power as a public speaker. As a thinker, Kropotkin focused more acutely on issues of morality than of economics or politics and carried himself by his own principles without imposition on others. In practice, this made him more of a &quot;revolutionary humanitarian&quot; than a revolutionist by deed. He was also known for being exceptionally kind and for forgoing material comforts to live a revolutionary, principled life by example. Gerald Runkle wrote that &quot;Kropotkin with his scholarly and saintly ways ... almost brought respectability to the movement.&quot;

== Legacy ==

As the anarchists&#x27; leading theorist in his lifetime, Kropotkin wrote their most systematic doctrine in an accessible way; and led the development of anarchist-communist social doctrine. His works, inventive and pragmatic, were the most read anarchist books and pamphlets, with translations into major European and Eastern languages that influenced revolutionaries (e.g., Nestor Makhno and Emiliano Zapata) and non-anarchist reformers alike (e.g., Patrick Geddes, Ebenezer Howard), as well as a wide range of intellectuals (including the writers Ba Jin and James Joyce). Much of Kropotkin&#x27;s impact was in his intellectual writings prior to 1914. He had little influence on the Russian revolution, despite returning for it.

Emma Goldman regarded Kropotkin as her &quot;great teacher&quot; and as among the greatest minds and personalities of the 19th century. 

After Kropotkin&#x27;s 1921 death, the Bolsheviks permitted Kropotkin&#x27;s Moscow house to become a Kropotkin Museum. This closed in 1938 with his wife&#x27;s death.

Kropotkin is the namesake for multiple regional entities. The Konyushennaya district in Moscow, where Kropotkin was born, is now known by his name, as the Kropotkinsky district, including the Kropotkinskaya metro station. He is the namesake for a large town in the North Caucasus (southwest Russia) and a small town in Siberia. The Kropotkin Range he was first to cross in the Siberian Patom Highlands was named for him, as was a peak in East Antarctica.

<doc id="51078" wikidata="Q203174" url="?curid=51078" title="Thalidomide">
<text>Thalidomide, sold under the brand names Contergan and Thalomid among others, is an oral medication used to treat a number of cancers (e.g., multiple myeloma), graft-versus-host disease, and many skin disorders (e.g., complications of leprosy such as skin lesions). Thalidomide has been used to treat conditions associated with HIV: aphthous ulcers, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, diarrhea, and Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, but increases in HIV viral load have been reported.
Common side effects include sleepiness, rash, and dizziness. Severe side effects include tumor lysis syndrome, blood clots, and peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen and carries an extremely high risk of severe, life-threatening birth defects if administered or taken during pregnancy. It causes skeletal deformities such as amelia (absence of legs and/or arms), absence of bones, and phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). A single dose of thalidomide, regardless of dosage, is enough to cause teratogenic effects.
Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany, where it was available over-the-counter. When first released, thalidomide was promoted for anxiety, trouble sleeping, &quot;tension&quot;, and morning sickness. While it was initially thought to be safe in pregnancy, concerns regarding birth defects arose, resulting in its removal from the market in Europe in 1961. The total number of infants severely harmed by thalidomide use during pregnancy is estimated at over 10,000, possibly 20,000, of whom about 40% died around the time of birth. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart problems. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey, a reviewer at the FDA. The birth defects caused by thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries.
It was approved in the United States in 1998 for use as a treatment for cancer. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Thalidomide is used as a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum, as well as for maintenance therapy.

The bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) is related to leprosy. Thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where standard TB drugs and corticosteroids are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain.

It is used as a second-line treatment to manage graft-versus-host disease and aphthous stomatitis in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children, including actinic prurigo and epidermolysis bullosa; the evidence for these uses is weak. It is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft-versus-host-disease in adults because of lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials.

==Contraindications==
Prescriptions of thalidomide are accompanied by strict measures to avoid any possibility of use during pregnancy, and thalidomide should be avoided in women wanting to conceive. In the United States, the prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used and that regular pregnancy tests are taken.

==Adverse effects==

Thalidomide causes birth defects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to both men and women, as the drug can be transmitted in semen.

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with the production of several types of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, leukopenia, and lymphopenia, and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. The drug can also damage nerves, causing potentially irreversible peripheral neuropathy.

Thalidomide has several adverse cardiovascular effects, including risk of heart attacks, pulmonary hypertension, and changes in heart rhythm, such as syncope, bradycardia, and atrioventricular block.

Thalidomide can cause liver damage and severe skin reactions like Stevens–Johnson syndrome. It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk when driving and operating other machinery. As it kills cancer cells, it can cause tumor lysis syndrome. Thalidomide can prevent menstruation.

In addition, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.

Common adverse effects (reported by 1–10% of people) include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.

=== Interactions ===
There are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on P-glycoprotein and the cytochrome P450 family. It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action and bradycardic agents, like beta-blockers, due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment of thalidomide with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with various contraceptives, and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are taking thalidomide.

===Overdose===
As of 2013, eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4 grams, none of them fatal. No specific antidote for overdose exists and treatment is purely supportive.

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide was not known until the twenty-first century, although efforts to identify thalidomide&#x27;s teratogenic action generated more than 2,000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000. The primary mechanism of action of thalidomide and its analogs in both their anti-cancer and teratogenic effects is now known to be as cereblon E3 ligase modulators.

Thalidomide also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men.

=== Chirality and biological activity ===
Thalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood. The (R)-enantiomer has the desired sedative effect while the (S)-enantiomer harbors embryo-toxic and teratogenic effects. Attempting to extract solely &quot;R&quot;-thalidomide does not remove the risk of birth defects, as it was demonstrated that the &quot;safe&quot; &quot;R&quot;-thalidomide undergoes an &quot;in vivo&quot; chiral inversion to the &quot;teratogenic&quot; &quot;S&quot;-thalidomide. Under biological conditions, the enantiomers interconvert (&quot;bidirectional chiral inversion&quot; – (R)- to (S)- and vice versa).

== Chemistry ==
Thalidomide is racemic; while &quot;S&quot;-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre, which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent. The racemization process can occur &quot;in vivo&quot;. The process of conversion of one enantiomer to its mirror-image version with no other change in the molecule is called chiral inversion.

Celgene Corporation originally synthesized thalidomide using a three-step sequence starting with -glutamic acid treatment, but this has since been reformed by the use of -glutamine. As shown in the image below, &quot;N&quot;-carbethoxyphthalimide (1) can react with -glutamine to yield &quot;N&quot;-phthaloyl--glutamine (2). Cyclization of &quot;N&quot;-phthaloyl--glutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole, which then yields thalidomide (3). Celgene Corporation&#x27;s original method resulted in a 31% yield of &quot;S&quot;-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85–93% product that is 99% pure.

In 2023, it is reported that phthalic anhydride and -glutamine under suitable conditions can react directly to form thalidomide. In the procedure, phthalic anhydride and -glutamine are grounded and added into toluene solvent. The solution, along with triethylamine and acetic anhydride, is refluxed at ~110°C for 9 hours; after that the solution goes through a simple vacuum filtration procedure to obtain the product.

==History==
In 1952, thalidomide was synthesised by Chemical Industry Basel, but was found &quot;to have no effect on animals&quot; and was discarded on that basis. In 1957, it was acquired by Chemie Grünenthal in Germany. The German company had been established as a soap maker after World War II ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mückter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army&#x27;s antiviral research. While preparing reagents for the work, Mueckter&#x27;s assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product that was recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of glutethimide, a sedative. The medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug: the result was thalidomide. The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative, but it was never tested on pregnant women.

Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness. On 1 October 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began marketing it under the trade name Contergan. It was proclaimed a &quot;wonder drug&quot; for insomnia, coughs, colds and headaches.

During that period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus. Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug&#x27;s development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus. There soon appeared reports of abnormalities in children being born to mothers using thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.

While initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public. Experts estimate that thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, with over half of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany never approved thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. They were tested for toxicity on rodents only, as was usual at the time.

In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd (now part of Diageo plc), marketed thalidomide throughout the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, under the brand name Distaval, as a remedy for morning sickness. Their advertisement claimed that &quot;Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child ... Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country.&quot; Globally, more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid-1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under at least 37 different trade names.

In the US, representatives from Chemie Grünenthal approached Smith, Kline &amp; French (SKF), now GlaxoSmithKline, with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum, rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the FDA, shows that in 1956–57, as part of its in-licensing approach, Smith, Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the US involving 875 people, including pregnant women. In 1956, researchers involved in clinical trials at SKF noted that, even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice. When administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grünenthal to be &quot;sleep-inducing&quot;, the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans. After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. In 1958, Chemie Grünenthal reached an agreement with the William S. Merrell Company in Cincinnati, Ohio (later Richardson-Merrell, now part of Sanofi), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the US.

The US FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September 1960. The official in charge of the FDA review, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times and was refused each time. The distribution for &quot;testing&quot; resulted in 17 children born in the US with thalidomide-induced malformations. Oldham Kelsey was awarded the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President Kennedy in 1962 for not allowing thalidomide to be approved for sale in the US. She was also inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000.

Canada&#x27;s Food and Drug Directorate approved the sale of thalidomide by prescription in November 1960. There were many different forms sold: Kevadon, produced by the William S. Merrell Company seeking approval for its thalidomide product, was released on the market in April 1961, and the most common variant (Horner&#x27;s Talimol) was put on the market on October 23 of the same year. Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects. It was not until March 1962 that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the directorate, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. The treatment was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide&#x27;s use, and the results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965. Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests. Despite this, cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue, with at least 100 cases identified in Brazil between 2005 and 2010. 5.8 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout Brazil in this time period, largely to poor Brazilians in areas with little access to healthcare, and these cases have occurred despite the controls.

In 1998, the FDA approved the drug&#x27;s use in the treatment of ENL. Because of thalidomide&#x27;s potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that Celgene Corporation, which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name &quot;Thalomid&quot;, establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.

In 2010, the World Health Organization stated that it did not recommend thalidomide for leprosy due to the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of clofazimine.

===Cancer treatment===
Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.

Little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s.

Judah Folkman pioneered studies into the role of angiogenesis (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that solid tumors could not expand without it. In 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing the same was true of blood cancers, and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer, but especially high in people with blood cancers, and other evidence emerged as well. Meanwhile, a member of his lab, Robert D&#x27;Amato, who was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors, discovered in 1994 that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis and was effective in suppressing tumor growth in rabbits. Around that time, the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed, called Folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas. Folkman persuaded the patient&#x27;s doctor to try thalidomide, and that doctor conducted a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment. The results of that trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999.

After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.

It was also evaluated whether thalidomide can be combined with melphalan and prednisone for patients with multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs probably increases the overall survival.

==Society and culture==
===Birth defect crisis===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities, such as phocomelia, as a consequence of thalidomide use. The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment, with the time-sensitive window occurring approximately between day 20 and day 36 post-fertilisation. Thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28.

It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962.

===Notable cases===

* Lorraine Mercer MBE of the United Kingdom, born with phocomelia of both arms and legs, is the only thalidomide survivor to carry the Olympic Torch.
* Thomas Quasthoff, an internationally acclaimed bass-baritone, describes himself: &quot;1.34 meters tall, short arms, seven fingers — four right, three left — large, relatively well-formed head, brown eyes, distinctive lips; profession: singer&quot;.
* Niko von Glasow produced a documentary called &quot;NoBody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, based on the lives of 12 people affected by the drug, which was released in 2008.
* Mercédes Benegbi, born with phocomelia of both arms, drove the successful campaign for compensation from her government for Canadians who were affected by thalidomide.
* Mat Fraser, born with phocomelia of both arms, is an English rock musician, actor, writer and performance artist. He produced a 2002 television documentary &quot;Born Freak&quot;, which looked at this historical tradition and its relevance to modern disabled performers. This work has become the subject of academic analysis in the field of disability studies.
* Sue Kent, born in 1963 with phocomelia of both arms, eight inches long, no thumbs, and seven fingers – three on one hand, four on the other - has appeared as a presenter on the BBC TV show &quot;Gardener&#x27;s World&quot; since 2020, demonstrating her ability to garden using her feet and toes where others would use their hands.
* Christian Lohr, born in 1962 with phocomelia of both arms and both legs, is a Swiss politician who served for 14 years in the legislature in the Canton Thurgau including 2 years as its president and has been a member of the national legislature since 2011.

===Change in drug regulations===
The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment (US), 1965 Directive 65/65/EEC1 (EU), and the Medicines Act 1968 (UK). In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market.

=== Impact on research involving women ===
In 1977 the US Federal Drug Administration published a clinical trial guideline that excluded women of &quot;childbearing potential&quot; from the early phases of most clinical trials, which in practice led to their exclusion from later trial phases as well. This 1977 FDA guideline was implemented in response to a protectionist climate caused by the thalidomide tragedy. In the 1980s, a US task force on women&#x27;s health concluded that a lack of women&#x27;s health research (in part due to the FDA guideline) had compromised the amount and quality of information available about diseases and treatments affecting women. This led to the National Institute of Health policy that women should, when beneficial, be included in clinical trials.

=== Quality of life ===
In the 1960s, thalidomide was successfully marketed as a safer alternative to barbiturates. Due to a successful marketing campaign, thalidomide was widely used by pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, thalidomide is a teratogenic substance, and a proportion of children born during the 1960s had thalidomide embryopathy (TE). Of these babies born with TE, &quot;about 40% of them died before their first birthday&quot;. The surviving individuals are now middle-aged and they report experiencing challenges (physical, psychological, and socioeconomic) related to TE.

Individuals born with TE frequently experience a wide variety of health problems secondary to their TE. These health conditions include both physical and psychological conditions. When compared to individuals of similar demographic profiles, those born with TE report less satisfaction with their quality of life and their overall health. Access to healthcare services can also be a challenge for these people, and women, in particular, have experienced difficulty in locating healthcare professionals who can understand and embrace their needs.

===Brand names===
Brand names include Contergan, Thalomid, Talidex, Talizer, Neurosedyn, Distaval, and many others.

==Research==
Research efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide.

===Thalidomide analogs===

The exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects — except for greater myelosuppression. In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA-approved. Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.

Interest turned to pomalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013 by the FDA as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013, and is expected to be marketed in Europe under the brand name Imnovid.

===Clinical research===
There is no conclusive evidence that thalidomide or lenalidomide is useful to bring about or maintain remission in Crohn&#x27;s disease.

Thalidomide was studied in a Phase II trial for Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, a rare soft-tissue cancer most commonly seen in the immunocompromised, that is caused by the Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

<text>A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. and attracts or repels other magnets.

A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include the elements iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some alloys of rare-earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone. Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only ones attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic, all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of magnetism.

Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically &quot;soft&quot; materials like annealed iron, which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized, and magnetically &quot;hard&quot; materials, which do. Permanent magnets are made from &quot;hard&quot; ferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them very hard to demagnetize. To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, and this threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material. &quot;Hard&quot; materials have high coercivity, whereas &quot;soft&quot; materials have low coercivity. The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces. The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.

An electromagnet is made from a coil of wire that acts as a magnet when an electric current passes through it but stops being a magnet when the current stops. Often, the coil is wrapped around a core of &quot;soft&quot; ferromagnetic material such as mild steel, which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.

== Discovery and development ==

Ancient people learned about magnetism from lodestones (or magnetite) which are naturally magnetized pieces of iron ore. The word &quot;magnet&quot; was adopted in Middle English from Latin &quot;magnetum&quot; &quot;lodestone&quot;, ultimately from Greek (&quot;magnētis [lithos]&quot;) meaning &quot;[stone] from Magnesia&quot;, a place in Anatolia where lodestones were found (today Manisa in modern-day Turkey). Lodestones, suspended so they could turn, were the first magnetic compasses. The earliest known surviving descriptions of magnets and their properties are from Anatolia, India, and China around 2,500 years ago. The properties of lodestones and their affinity for iron were written of by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; in the 1st century AD.

In 11th century China, it was discovered that quenching red hot iron in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field would leave the iron permanently magnetized. This led to the development of the navigational compass, as described in Dream Pool Essays in 1088. By the 12th to 13th centuries AD, magnetic compasses were used in navigation in China, Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere.

A straight iron magnet tends to demagnetize itself by its own magnetic field. To overcome this, the horseshoe magnet was invented by Daniel Bernoulli in 1743. A horseshoe magnet avoids demagnetization by returning the magnetic field lines to the opposite pole.

In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that a compass needle is deflected by a nearby electric current. In the same year André-Marie Ampère showed that iron can be magnetized by inserting it in an electrically fed solenoid. This led William Sturgeon to develop an iron-cored electromagnet in 1824. Joseph Henry further developed the electromagnet into a commercial product in 1830–1831, giving people access to strong magnetic fields for the first time. In 1831 he built an ore separator with an electromagnet capable of lifting .

== Physics ==

=== Magnetic field ===


The magnetic flux density (also called magnetic B field or just magnetic field, usually denoted by B) is a vector field. The magnetic B field vector at a given point in space is specified by two properties:

# Its &quot;direction&quot;, which is along the orientation of a compass needle.
# Its &quot;magnitude&quot; (also called &quot;strength&quot;), which is proportional to how strongly the compass needle orients along that direction.

In SI units, the strength of the magnetic B field is given in teslas.

=== Magnetic moment ===
A magnet&#x27;s magnetic moment (also called magnetic dipole moment and usually denoted μ) is a vector that characterizes the magnet&#x27;s overall magnetic properties. For a bar magnet, the direction of the magnetic moment points from the magnet&#x27;s south pole to its north pole, and the magnitude relates to how strong and how far apart these poles are. In SI units, the magnetic moment is specified in terms of A·m2 (amperes times meters squared).

A magnet both produces its own magnetic field and responds to magnetic fields. The strength of the magnetic field it produces is at any given point proportional to the magnitude of its magnetic moment. In addition, when the magnet is put into an external magnetic field, produced by a different source, it is subject to a torque tending to orient the magnetic moment parallel to the field. The amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external field. A magnet may also be subject to a force driving it in one direction or another, according to the positions and orientations of the magnet and source. If the field is uniform in space, the magnet is subject to no net force, although it is subject to a torque.

A wire in the shape of a circle with area &quot;A&quot; and carrying current &quot;I&quot; has a magnetic moment of magnitude equal to &quot;IA&quot;.

=== Magnetization ===
The magnetization of a magnetized material is the local value of its magnetic moment per unit volume, usually denoted M, with units A/m. It is a vector field, rather than just a vector (like the magnetic moment), because different areas in a magnet can be magnetized with different directions and strengths (for example, because of domains, see below). A good bar magnet may have a magnetic moment of magnitude 0.1 A·m2 and a volume of 1 cm3, or 1×10−6 m3, and therefore an average magnetization magnitude is 100,000 A/m. Iron can have a magnetization of around a million amperes per meter. Such a large value explains why iron magnets are so effective at producing magnetic fields.

=== Modelling magnets ===

Two different models exist for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents.

Although for many purposes it is convenient to think of a magnet as having distinct north and south magnetic poles, the concept of poles should not be taken literally: it is merely a way of referring to the two different ends of a magnet. The magnet does not have distinct north or south particles on opposing sides. If a bar magnet is broken into two pieces, in an attempt to separate the north and south poles, the result will be two bar magnets, &quot;each&quot; of which has both a north and south pole. However, a version of the magnetic-pole approach is used by professional magneticians to design permanent magnets.

In this approach, the divergence of the magnetization ∇·M inside a magnet is treated as a distribution of magnetic monopoles. This is a mathematical convenience and does not imply that there are actually monopoles in the magnet. If the magnetic-pole distribution is known, then the pole model gives the magnetic field H. Outside the magnet, the field B is proportional to H, while inside the magnetization must be added to H. An extension of this method that allows for internal magnetic charges is used in theories of ferromagnetism.

Another model is the Ampère model, where all magnetization is due to the effect of microscopic, or atomic, circular bound currents, also called Ampèrian currents, throughout the material. For a uniformly magnetized cylindrical bar magnet, the net effect of the microscopic bound currents is to make the magnet behave as if there is a macroscopic sheet of electric current flowing around the surface, with local flow direction normal to the cylinder axis. Microscopic currents in atoms inside the material are generally canceled by currents in neighboring atoms, so only the surface makes a net contribution; shaving off the outer layer of a magnet will &quot;not&quot; destroy its magnetic field, but will leave a new surface of uncancelled currents from the circular currents throughout the material. The right-hand rule tells which direction positively-charged current flows. However, current due to negatively-charged electricity is far more prevalent in practice.

=== Polarity ===

The north pole of a magnet is defined as the pole that, when the magnet is freely suspended, points towards the Earth&#x27;s North Magnetic Pole in the Arctic (the magnetic and geographic poles do not coincide, see magnetic declination). Since opposite poles (north and south) attract, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the &quot;south&quot; pole of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. As a practical matter, to tell which of a magnet is north and which is south, it is not necessary to use the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at all. For example, one method would be to compare it to an electromagnet, whose poles can be identified by the right-hand rule. The magnetic field lines of a magnet are considered by convention to emerge from the magnet&#x27;s north pole and reenter at the south pole.

=== Magnetic materials ===
The term &quot;magnet&quot; is typically reserved for objects that produce their own persistent magnetic field even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Only certain classes of materials can do this. Most materials, however, produce a magnetic field in response to an applied magnetic field – a phenomenon known as magnetism. There are several types of magnetism, and all materials exhibit at least one of them.

The overall magnetic behavior of a material can vary widely, depending on the structure of the material, particularly on its electron configuration. Several forms of magnetic behavior have been observed in different materials, including:
* Ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are the ones normally thought of as magnetic; they are attracted to a magnet strongly enough that the attraction can be felt. These materials are the only ones that can retain magnetization and become magnets; a common example is a traditional refrigerator magnet. Ferrimagnetic materials, which include ferrites and the longest used and naturally occurring magnetic materials magnetite and lodestone, are similar to but weaker than ferromagnetics. The difference between ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials is related to their microscopic structure, as explained in Magnetism.
* Paramagnetic substances, such as platinum, aluminum, and oxygen, are weakly attracted to either pole of a magnet. This attraction is hundreds of thousands of times weaker than that of ferromagnetic materials, so it can only be detected by using sensitive instruments or using extremely strong magnets. Magnetic ferrofluids, although they are made of tiny ferromagnetic particles suspended in liquid, are sometimes considered paramagnetic since they cannot be magnetized.
* Diamagnetic means repelled by both poles. Compared to paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, diamagnetic substances, such as carbon, copper, water, and plastic, are even more weakly repelled by a magnet. The permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than the permeability of a vacuum. All substances not possessing one of the other types of magnetism are diamagnetic; this includes most substances. Although force on a diamagnetic object from an ordinary magnet is far too weak to be felt, using extremely strong superconducting magnets, diamagnetic objects such as pieces of lead and even mice can be levitated, so they float in mid-air. Superconductors repel magnetic fields from their interior and are strongly diamagnetic.

There are various other types of magnetism, such as spin glass, superparamagnetism, superdiamagnetism, and metamagnetism.

=== Shape ===

The shape of a permanent magnet has a large influence on its magnetic properties. When a magnet is magnetized, a demagnetizing field will be created inside it. As the name suggests, the demagnetizing field will work to demagnetize the magnet, decreasing its magnetic properties. The strength of the demagnetizing field formula_1 is proportional to the magnet&#x27;s magnetization formula_2 and shape, according to
:formula_3
Here, formula_4 is called the demagnetizing factor, and has a different value depending on the magnet&#x27;s shape. For example, if the magnet is a sphere, then formula_5.

The value of the demagnetizing factor also depends on the direction of the magnetization in relation to the magnet&#x27;s shape. Since a sphere is symmetrical from all angles, the demagnetizing factor only has one value. But a magnet that is shaped like a long cylinder will yield two different demagnetizing factors, depending on if it&#x27;s magnetized parallel to or perpendicular to its length. 

==Common uses==
* Magnetic recording media: VHS tapes contain a reel of magnetic tape. The information that makes up the video and sound is encoded on the magnetic coating on the tape. Common audio cassettes also rely on magnetic tape. Similarly, in computers, floppy disks and hard disks record data on a thin magnetic coating.
* Credit, debit, and automatic teller machine cards: All of these cards have a magnetic strip on one side. This strip encodes the information to contact an individual&#x27;s financial institution and connect with their account(s).
* Older types of televisions (non flat screen) and older large computer monitors: TV and computer screens containing a cathode-ray tube employ an electromagnet to guide electrons to the screen.
* Sensor: Permanent magnets are useful components for fabricating magnetic sensors for the detection of motion, displacement, position, and so forth.
* Speakers and microphones: Most speakers employ a permanent magnet and a current-carrying coil to convert electric energy (the signal) into mechanical energy (movement that creates the sound). The coil is wrapped around a bobbin attached to the speaker cone and carries the signal as changing current that interacts with the field of the permanent magnet. The voice coil feels a magnetic force and in response, moves the cone and pressurizes the neighboring air, thus generating sound. Dynamic microphones employ the same concept, but in reverse. A microphone has a diaphragm or membrane attached to a coil of wire. The coil rests inside a specially shaped magnet. When sound vibrates the membrane, the coil is vibrated as well. As the coil moves through the magnetic field, a voltage is induced across the coil. This voltage drives a current in the wire that is characteristic of the original sound.
* Electric guitars use magnetic pickups to transduce the vibration of guitar strings into electric current that can then be amplified. This is different from the principle behind the speaker and dynamic microphone because the vibrations are sensed directly by the magnet, and a diaphragm is not employed. The Hammond organ used a similar principle, with rotating tonewheels instead of strings.
* Electric motors and generators: Some electric motors rely upon a combination of an electromagnet and a permanent magnet, and, much like loudspeakers, they convert electric energy into mechanical energy. A generator is the reverse: it converts mechanical energy into electric energy by moving a conductor through a magnetic field.
* Medicine: Hospitals use magnetic resonance imaging to spot problems in a patient&#x27;s organs without invasive surgery.
* Chemistry: Chemists use nuclear magnetic resonance to characterize synthesized compounds. 
* Chucks are used in the metalworking field to hold objects. Magnets are also used in other types of fastening devices, such as the magnetic base, the magnetic clamp and the refrigerator magnet.
* Compasses: A compass (or mariner&#x27;s compass) is a magnetized pointer free to align itself with a magnetic field, most commonly Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.
* Art: Vinyl magnet sheets may be attached to paintings, photographs, and other ornamental articles, allowing them to be attached to refrigerators and other metal surfaces. Objects and paint can be applied directly to the magnet surface to create collage pieces of art. Metal magnetic boards, strips, doors, microwave ovens, dishwashers, cars, metal I beams, and any metal surface can be used magnetic vinyl art.
* Science projects: Many topic questions are based on magnets, including the repulsion of current-carrying wires, the effect of temperature, and motors involving magnets.

* Toys: Given their ability to counteract the force of gravity at close range, magnets are often employed in children&#x27;s toys, such as the Magnet Space Wheel and Levitron, to amusing effect.
* Refrigerator magnets are used to adorn kitchens, as a souvenir, or simply to hold a note or photo to the refrigerator door.
* Magnets can be used to make jewelry. Necklaces and bracelets can have a magnetic clasp, or may be constructed entirely from a linked series of magnets and ferrous beads.
* Magnets can pick up magnetic items (iron nails, staples, tacks, paper clips) that are either too small, too hard to reach, or too thin for fingers to hold. Some screwdrivers are magnetized for this purpose.
* Magnets can be used in scrap and salvage operations to separate magnetic metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel) from non-magnetic metals (aluminum, non-ferrous alloys, etc.). The same idea can be used in the so-called &quot;magnet test&quot;, in which a car chassis is inspected with a magnet to detect areas repaired using fiberglass or plastic putty.
* Magnets are found in process industries, food manufacturing especially, in order to remove metal foreign bodies from materials entering the process (raw materials) or to detect a possible contamination at the end of the process and prior to packaging. They constitute an important layer of protection for the process equipment and for the final consumer.
* Magnetic levitation transport, or maglev, is a form of transportation that suspends, guides and propels vehicles (especially trains) through electromagnetic force. Eliminating rolling resistance increases efficiency. The maximum recorded speed of a maglev train is .
* Magnets may be used to serve as a fail-safe device for some cable connections. For example, the power cords of some laptops are magnetic to prevent accidental damage to the port when tripped over. The MagSafe power connection to the Apple MacBook is one such example.

== Medical issues and safety ==

Because human tissues have a very low level of susceptibility to static magnetic fields, there is little mainstream scientific evidence showing a health effect associated with exposure to static fields. Dynamic magnetic fields may be a different issue, however; correlations between electromagnetic radiation and cancer rates have been postulated due to demographic correlations (see Electromagnetic radiation and health).

If a ferromagnetic foreign body is present in human tissue, an external magnetic field interacting with it can pose a serious safety risk.

A different type of indirect magnetic health risk exists involving pacemakers. If a pacemaker has been embedded in a patient&#x27;s chest (usually for the purpose of monitoring and regulating the heart for steady electrically induced beats), care should be taken to keep it away from magnetic fields. It is for this reason that a patient with the device installed cannot be tested with the use of a magnetic resonance imaging device.

Children sometimes swallow small magnets from toys, and this can be hazardous if two or more magnets are swallowed, as the magnets can pinch or puncture internal tissues.

Magnetic imaging devices (e.g. MRIs) generate enormous magnetic fields, and therefore rooms intended to hold them exclude ferrous metals. Bringing objects made of ferrous metals (such as oxygen canisters) into such a room creates a severe safety risk, as those objects may be powerfully thrown about by the intense magnetic fields.

== Magnetizing ferromagnets ==
Ferromagnetic materials can be magnetized in the following ways:
* Heating the object higher than its Curie temperature, allowing it to cool in a magnetic field and hammering it as it cools. This is the most effective method and is similar to the industrial processes used to create permanent magnets.
* Placing the item in an external magnetic field will result in the item retaining some of the magnetism on removal. Vibration has been shown to increase the effect. Ferrous materials aligned with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field that are subject to vibration (e.g., frame of a conveyor) have been shown to acquire significant residual magnetism. Likewise, striking a steel nail held by fingers in a N-S direction with a hammer will temporarily magnetize the nail.
* Stroking: An existing magnet is moved from one end of the item to the other repeatedly in the same direction (&quot;single touch&quot; method) or two magnets are moved outwards from the center of a third (&quot;double touch&quot; method).
* Electric Current: The magnetic field produced by passing an electric current through a coil can get domains to line up. Once all of the domains are lined up, increasing the current will not increase the magnetization.

== Demagnetizing ferromagnets ==

Magnetized ferromagnetic materials can be demagnetized (or degaussed) in the following ways:
* Heating a magnet past its Curie temperature; the molecular motion destroys the alignment of the magnetic domains, completely demagnetizing it
* Placing the magnet in an alternating magnetic field with intensity above the material&#x27;s coercivity and then either slowly drawing the magnet out or slowly decreasing the magnetic field to zero. This is the principle used in commercial demagnetizers to demagnetize tools, erase credit cards, hard disks, and degaussing coils used to demagnetize CRTs.
* Some demagnetization or reverse magnetization will occur if any part of the magnet is subjected to a reverse field above the magnetic material&#x27;s coercivity.
* Demagnetization progressively occurs if the magnet is subjected to cyclic fields sufficient to move the magnet away from the linear part on the second quadrant of the B–H curve of the magnetic material (the demagnetization curve).
* Hammering or jarring: mechanical disturbance tends to randomize the magnetic domains and reduce magnetization of an object, but may cause unacceptable damage.

== Types of permanent magnets ==

=== Magnetic metallic elements ===

Many materials have unpaired electron spins, and the majority of these materials are paramagnetic. When the spins interact with each other in such a way that the spins align spontaneously, the materials are called ferromagnetic (what is often loosely termed as magnetic). Because of the way their regular crystalline atomic structure causes their spins to interact, some metals are ferromagnetic when found in their natural states, as ores. These include iron ore (magnetite or lodestone), cobalt and nickel, as well as the rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium (when at a very low temperature). Such naturally occurring ferromagnets were used in the first experiments with magnetism. Technology has since expanded the availability of magnetic materials to include various man-made products, all based, however, on naturally magnetic elements.

=== Composites ===
Ceramic, or ferrite, magnets are made of a sintered composite of powdered iron oxide and barium/strontium carbonate ceramic. Given the low cost of the materials and manufacturing methods, inexpensive magnets (or non-magnetized ferromagnetic cores, for use in electronic components such as portable AM radio antennas) of various shapes can be easily mass-produced. The resulting magnets are non-corroding but brittle and must be treated like other ceramics.

Alnico magnets are made by casting or sintering a combination of aluminium, nickel and cobalt with iron and small amounts of other elements added to enhance the properties of the magnet. Sintering offers superior mechanical characteristics, whereas casting delivers higher magnetic fields and allows for the design of intricate shapes. Alnico magnets resist corrosion and have physical properties more forgiving than ferrite, but not quite as desirable as a metal. Trade names for alloys in this family include: &quot;Alni, Alcomax, Hycomax, Columax&quot;, and &quot;Ticonal&quot;.

Injection-molded magnets are a composite of various types of resin and magnetic powders, allowing parts of complex shapes to be manufactured by injection molding. The physical and magnetic properties of the product depend on the raw materials, but are generally lower in magnetic strength and resemble plastics in their physical properties.

=== Flexible magnet ===

Flexible magnets are composed of a high-coercivity ferromagnetic compound (usually ferric oxide) mixed with a resinous polymer binder. This is extruded as a sheet and passed over a line of powerful cylindrical permanent magnets. These magnets are arranged in a stack with alternating magnetic poles facing up (N, S, N, S...) on a rotating shaft. This impresses the plastic sheet with the magnetic poles in an alternating line format. No electromagnetism is used to generate the magnets. The pole-to-pole distance is on the order of 5 mm, but varies with manufacturer. These magnets are lower in magnetic strength but can be very flexible, depending on the binder used.

For magnetic compounds (e.g. Nd2Fe14B) that are vulnerable to a grain boundary corrosion problem it gives additional protection.

=== Rare-earth magnets ===

Rare earth (lanthanoid) elements have a partially occupied &quot;f&quot; electron shell (which can accommodate up to 14 electrons). The spin of these electrons can be aligned, resulting in very strong magnetic fields, and therefore, these elements are used in compact high-strength magnets where their higher price is not a concern. The most common types of rare-earth magnets are samarium–cobalt and neodymium–iron–boron (NIB) magnets.

=== Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and single-chain magnets (SCMs) ===

In the 1990s, it was discovered that certain molecules containing paramagnetic metal ions are capable of storing a magnetic moment at very low temperatures. These are very different from conventional magnets that store information at a magnetic domain level and theoretically could provide a far denser storage medium than conventional magnets. In this direction, research on monolayers of SMMs is currently under way. Very briefly, the two main attributes of an SMM are:

# a large ground state spin value (&quot;S&quot;), which is provided by ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic metal centres
# a negative value of the anisotropy of the zero field splitting (&quot;D&quot;)

Most SMMs contain manganese but can also be found with vanadium, iron, nickel and cobalt clusters. More recently, it has been found that some chain systems can also display a magnetization that persists for long times at higher temperatures. These systems have been called single-chain magnets.

=== Nano-structured magnets ===

Some nano-structured materials exhibit energy waves, called magnons, that coalesce into a common ground state in the manner of a Bose–Einstein condensate.

===Rare-earth-free permanent magnets===
The United States Department of Energy has identified a need to find substitutes for rare-earth metals in permanent-magnet technology, and has begun funding such research. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) has sponsored a Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT) program to develop alternative materials. In 2011, ARPA-E awarded 31.6 million dollars to fund Rare-Earth Substitute projects. Iron nitrides are promising materials for rare-earth free magnets.

=== Costs ===

The cheapest permanent magnets, allowing for field strengths, are flexible and ceramic magnets, but these are also among the weakest types. The ferrite magnets are mainly low-cost magnets since they are made from cheap raw materials: iron oxide and Ba- or Sr-carbonate. However, a new low cost magnet, Mn–Al alloy, has been developed and is now dominating the low-cost magnets field. It has a higher saturation magnetization than the ferrite magnets. It also has more favorable temperature coefficients, although it can be thermally unstable.
Neodymium–iron–boron (NIB) magnets are among the strongest. These cost more per kilogram than most other magnetic materials but, owing to their intense field, are smaller and cheaper in many applications.

=== Temperature ===
Temperature sensitivity varies, but when a magnet is heated to a temperature known as the Curie point, it loses all of its magnetism, even after cooling below that temperature. The magnets can often be remagnetized, however.

Additionally, some magnets are brittle and can fracture at high temperatures.

The maximum usable temperature is highest for alnico magnets at over , around for ferrite and SmCo, about for NIB and lower for flexible ceramics, but the exact numbers depend on the grade of material.

== Electromagnets ==
An electromagnet, in its simplest form, is a wire that has been coiled into one or more loops, known as a solenoid. When electric current flows through the wire, a magnetic field is generated. It is concentrated near (and especially inside) the coil, and its field lines are very similar to those of a magnet. The orientation of this effective magnet is determined by the right hand rule. The magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the electromagnet are proportional to the number of loops of wire, to the cross-section of each loop, and to the current passing through the wire.

If the coil of wire is wrapped around a material with no special magnetic properties (e.g., cardboard), it will tend to generate a very weak field. However, if it is wrapped around a soft ferromagnetic material, such as an iron nail, then the net field produced can result in a several hundred- to thousandfold increase of field strength.

Uses for electromagnets include particle accelerators, electric motors, junkyard cranes, and magnetic resonance imaging machines. Some applications involve configurations more than a simple magnetic dipole; for example, quadrupole and sextupole magnets are used to focus particle beams.

== Units and calculations ==
For most engineering applications, MKS (rationalized) or SI (Système International) units are commonly used. Two other sets of units, Gaussian and CGS-EMU, are the same for magnetic properties and are commonly used in physics.

In all units, it is convenient to employ two types of magnetic field, B and H, as well as the magnetization M, defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume.

# The magnetic induction field B is given in SI units of teslas (T). B is the magnetic field whose time variation produces, by Faraday&#x27;s Law, circulating electric fields (which the power companies sell). B also produces a deflection force on moving charged particles (as in TV tubes). The tesla is equivalent to the magnetic flux (in webers) per unit area (in meters squared), thus giving B the unit of a flux density. In CGS, the unit of B is the gauss (G). One tesla equals 104 G.
# The magnetic field H is given in SI units of ampere-turns per meter (A-turn/m). The &quot;turns&quot; appear because when H is produced by a current-carrying wire, its value is proportional to the number of turns of that wire. In CGS, the unit of H is the oersted (Oe). One A-turn/m equals 4π×10−3 Oe.
# The magnetization M is given in SI units of amperes per meter (A/m). In CGS, the unit of M is the oersted (Oe). One A/m equals 10−3 emu/cm3. A good permanent magnet can have a magnetization as large as a million amperes per meter.
# In SI units, the relation B = &quot;μ&quot;0(H + M) holds, where &quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability of space, which equals 4π×10−7 T•m/A. In CGS, it is written as B = H + 4πM. (The pole approach gives &quot;μ&quot;0H in SI units. A &quot;μ&quot;0M term in SI must then supplement this &quot;μ&quot;0H to give the correct field within B, the magnet. It will agree with the field B calculated using Ampèrian currents).

Materials that are not permanent magnets usually satisfy the relation M = &quot;χH in SI, where &quot;χ&quot; is the (dimensionless) magnetic susceptibility. Most non-magnetic materials have a relatively small &quot;χ&quot; (on the order of a millionth), but soft magnets can have &quot;χ&quot; on the order of hundreds or thousands. For materials satisfying M = &quot;χH, we can also write B = &quot;μ&quot;0(1 + &quot;χ&quot;)H = &quot;μ&quot;0&quot;μ&quot;rH = &quot;μH, where &quot;μ&quot;r = 1 + &quot;χ&quot; is the (dimensionless) relative permeability and μ =μ0μr is the magnetic permeability. Both hard and soft magnets have a more complex, history-dependent, behavior described by what are called hysteresis loops, which give either B vs. H or M vs. H. In CGS, M = &quot;χH, but &quot;χ&quot;SI = 4&quot;πχ&quot;CGS, and μ = μr.

Caution: in part because there are not enough Roman and Greek symbols, there is no commonly agreed-upon symbol for magnetic pole strength and magnetic moment. The symbol &quot;m&quot; has been used for both pole strength (unit A•m, where here the upright m is for meter) and for magnetic moment (unit A•m2). The symbol &quot;μ&quot; has been used in some texts for magnetic permeability and in other texts for magnetic moment. We will use &quot;μ&quot; for magnetic permeability and &quot;m&quot; for magnetic moment. For pole strength, we will employ &quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;. For a bar magnet of cross-section &quot;A&quot; with uniform magnetization &quot;M&quot; along its axis, the pole strength is given by &quot;qm&quot; = &quot;MA&quot;, so that &quot;M&quot; can be thought of as a pole strength per unit area.

=== Fields of a magnet ===

Far away from a magnet, the magnetic field created by that magnet is almost always described (to a good approximation) by a dipole field characterized by its total magnetic moment. This is true regardless of the shape of the magnet, so long as the magnetic moment is non-zero. One characteristic of a dipole field is that the strength of the field falls off inversely with the cube of the distance from the magnet&#x27;s center.

Closer to the magnet, the magnetic field becomes more complicated and more dependent on the detailed shape and magnetization of the magnet. Formally, the field can be expressed as a multipole expansion: A dipole field, plus a quadrupole field, plus an octupole field, etc.

At close range, many different fields are possible. For example, for a long, skinny bar magnet with its north pole at one end and south pole at the other, the magnetic field near either end falls off inversely with the square of the distance from that pole.

=== Calculating the magnetic force ===
====Pull force of a single magnet====
The strength of a given magnet is sometimes given in terms of its &quot;pull force&quot; — its ability to pull ferromagnetic objects. The pull force exerted by either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet with no air gap (i.e., the ferromagnetic object is in direct contact with the pole of the magnet) is given by the Maxwell equation:
:formula_6,

where:
* &quot;F&quot; is force (SI unit: newton)
* &quot;A&quot; is the cross section of the area of the pole (in square meters)
* &quot;B&quot; is the magnetic induction exerted by the magnet.

This result can be easily derived using Gilbert model, which assumes that the pole of magnet is charged with magnetic monopoles that induces the same in the ferromagnetic object.

If a magnet is acting vertically, it can lift a mass &quot;m&quot; in kilograms given by the simple equation:

:formula_7

where g is the gravitational acceleration.

==== Force between two magnetic poles ====
Classically, the force between two magnetic poles is given by:

:formula_8

where
:&quot;F&quot; is force (SI unit: newton)
:&quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;q&quot;&quot;m&quot;2 are the magnitudes of magnetic poles (SI unit: ampere-meter)
:&quot;μ&quot; is the permeability of the intervening medium (SI unit: tesla meter per ampere, henry per meter or newton per ampere squared)
:&quot;r&quot; is the separation (SI unit: meter).

The pole description is useful to the engineers designing real-world magnets, but real magnets have a pole distribution more complex than a single north and south. Therefore, implementation of the pole idea is not simple. In some cases, one of the more complex formulae given below will be more useful.

==== Force between two nearby magnetized surfaces of area &quot;A&quot; ====

The mechanical force between two nearby magnetized surfaces can be calculated with the following equation. The equation is valid only for cases in which the effect of fringing is negligible and the volume of the air gap is much smaller than that of the magnetized material:
:formula_9
where:
:&quot;A&quot; is the area of each surface, in m2
:&quot;H&quot; is their magnetizing field, in A/m
:&quot;μ&quot;0 is the permeability of space, which equals 4π×10−7 T•m/A
:&quot;B&quot; is the flux density, in T.

==== Force between two bar magnets ====

The force between two identical cylindrical bar magnets placed end to end at large distance formula_10 is approximately:,
:formula_11

where:

:&quot;B0&quot; is the magnetic flux density very close to each pole, in T,
:&quot;A&quot; is the area of each pole, in m2,
:&quot;L&quot; is the length of each magnet, in m,
:&quot;R&quot; is the radius of each magnet, in m, and
:&quot;z&quot; is the separation between the two magnets, in m.

:formula_12 relates the flux density at the pole to the magnetization of the magnet.

Note that all these formulations are based on Gilbert&#x27;s model, which is usable in relatively great distances. In other models (e.g., Ampère&#x27;s model), a more complicated formulation is used that sometimes cannot be solved analytically. In these cases, numerical methods must be used.

==== Force between two cylindrical magnets ====

For two cylindrical magnets with radius formula_13 and length formula_14, with their magnetic dipole aligned, the force can be asymptotically approximated at large distance formula_10 by,

:formula_16

where formula_2 is the magnetization of the magnets and formula_18 is the gap between the magnets.
A measurement of the magnetic flux density very close to the magnet formula_19 is related to formula_2 approximately by the formula
:formula_21

The effective magnetic dipole can be written as

:formula_22

Where formula_23 is the volume of the magnet. For a cylinder, this is formula_24.

When formula_25, the point dipole approximation is obtained,

:formula_26

which matches the expression of the force between two magnetic dipoles.

<text>Mikael Agricola (; c. 1510 – 9 April 1557) was a Finnish Lutheran clergyman who became the de facto founder of literary Finnish and a prominent proponent of the Protestant Reformation in Sweden, including Finland, which was a Swedish territory at the time. He is often called the &quot;father of literary Finnish&quot;.

Agricola was consecrated as the bishop of Turku (Åbo) in 1554, without papal approval. He continued the reform of the Finnish church (then a part of the Church of Sweden) along Lutheran lines. He translated the New Testament into Finnish and also produced the prayer book and hymns used in Finland&#x27;s new Lutheran Church. This work set the rules of orthography that are the basis of modern Finnish spelling. His thorough work is particularly remarkable in that he accomplished it in only three years.

He died of sudden illness while returning from a trip during which he assisted in negotiating the Treaty of Novgorod with the Tsardom of Russia.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Michael Olaui or Mikael Olofsson (Finnish &quot;Mikael Olavinpoika&quot;) was born in c. 1510 in the village of Torsby in Pernå (&quot;Pernaja&quot;), Nyland (&quot;Uusimaa&quot;), in what now is part of Finland but then was part of Sweden. He was named after the patron saint of Pernå&#x27;s church. The exact date of his birth, like most details of his life, is unknown. His family was a quite wealthy gentry family according to the local bailiff&#x27;s accounting. He had three sisters, but their names are not known. His teachers apparently recognized his aptitude for languages and his rector Bartholomeus sent him to Viborg (Fi. &quot;Viipuri&quot;; now Vyborg, Russia) for Latin school and some priestly training, where he attended the school of Erasmus. It is not known whether his first language was Finnish or Swedish; Pernå was mostly a Swedish-speaking district, but the language he used in his works indicates that he was a native speaker of Finnish. However, he mastered both languages like a native speaker and was possibly a bilingual child.

===Studies===
When Michael studied in Viborg (Viipuri) he assumed the surname Agricola (&quot;farmer&quot; gv. &quot;agriculture&quot;); surnames based on one&#x27;s father&#x27;s status and occupation were common for first-generation scholars at the time. It was probably in Viipuri where he first came in touch with the Reformation and Humanism. The Viipuri castle was ruled by a German count, Johann, who had served the king of Sweden, Gustav Vasa. The count was a supporter of the Reformation, and they already held Lutheran services.

In 1528 Agricola followed his teacher to Turku (Åbo), then the center of the Finnish side of the Swedish realm and the capital of the bishopric. There Agricola became a scribe in bishop Martinus Skytte&#x27;s office. While in Turku Agricola met Martin Luther&#x27;s first Finnish student Petrus Särkilahti, who eagerly spread the idea of the Reformation. Särkilahti died in 1529, and it was up to Agricola to continue Särkilahti&#x27;s work. Agricola was ordained for priesthood sometime in the early 1530s.

In 1536 the bishop of Turku sent Agricola to study in Wittenberg in Germany. He concentrated on the lectures of Philipp Melanchthon, who was an expert in Greek, the original language of the New Testament. In Wittenberg Agricola studied under Luther. Agricola got recommendations to Swedish King Gustav Vasa from both of the reformers. He sent two letters to Gustav, asking for a confirmation for a stipend. When the confirmation came, Agricola bought books (for example, the complete works of Aristotle). In 1537 he started translating the New Testament into Finnish.

===Rector and ordinarius===
In 1539 Agricola returned to Turku and ended up as the rector of Turku (Cathedral) School. He did not like his job, calling his students &quot;untamed animals&quot;. At the time Gustav Vasa had confiscated the property of the church when he was consolidating his power but he also drove the Reformation. In 1544 Agricola received an order from the crown to send several talented young men to Stockholm&#x27;s taxing offices. For some reason, Agricola did not obey until the order was sent again the next year, with a more menacing tone. This episode probably affected their relations negatively.

In 1546 Agricola lost his home and school in the Fire of Turku. On 22 February 1548, Gustav Vasa ordered Agricola to retire from his position as a rector. At this time Agricola was already married, but history knows his wife only by her name: Pirjo Olavintytär (Bridget, &quot;daughter of Olavi&quot;; Birgitta Olafsdotter, Brigida Olaui). His only son, Christian Agricola (Christianus Michaelis Agricola), was born 11 December 1550, and became the bishop of Tallinn in 1584.

When an old bishop died in 1554, Gustav Vasa had Agricola consecrated as the &quot;ordinarius&quot; of Turku parish – for all practical purposes Bishop of Turku and by extension the first Lutheran bishop for all Finland. Agricola was not a particularly strict or dedicated reformer, although he did remove the Canon of the Mass.

===Death===

In 1557, Agricola headed a delegation going to Russia on a diplomatic mission, and was in Moscow from 21 February to 24 March negotiating a peace treaty, the Treaty of Novgorod (1557). On 9 April he fell ill and died on Kyrönniemi peninsula near the Uusikirkko (now Polyane) village on the Karelian Isthmus. This day is also Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s birthday and it is celebrated in Finland as the day of the Finnish language. Agricola was probably buried inside Viipuri&#x27;s church, but the exact location of the grave is not known.

==Literary achievements==

===&quot;Abckiria&quot;===
Agricola had thought about translating the New Testament in his early years of study. At the time, however, there was no standard written form of Finnish, so he started developing it. His first book, &quot;Abckiria&quot;, which is nowadays known as the &quot;ABC-kirja&quot; or ABC book, was a primer for reading and a catechism. It was first printed in 1543. The catechism was included because only very few people could afford the whole Bible at the time. The first printing contained 16 pages.

A second printing was released in 1551 with 24 pages.

In 1966 Åke Åbergin, a librarian, discovered parts, while repairing book bindings, from an as yet unknown (likely the third) edition of the &quot;ABC-kirja&quot; that included the name of the printer, Amund Lauritsanpoika, and fortuitously the publishing date of 1559 (two years after the author&#x27;s death) of the final as yet undiscovered 8 pages. The pages were likely the result of an imposing error and relegated to padding paper.

===&quot;Rucouskiria&quot;===
Agricola&#x27;s &quot;Rucouskiria Bibliasta&quot; (contemporary Finnish spelling: Rukouskirja; literally, &quot;Prayer Book from the Bible&quot;) was printed in March 1544. At the beginning of the book, Agricola wrote about many topics concerning all-round education and the Reformation&#x27;s effects in Finland. The book includes four prefaces and about 700 prayers on many topics; it even has twelve structurally different kinds of prayers, instead of the usual two or three. It is the most independent work by Agricola and contains approximately 900 pages. His sources include the works of Luther, Melanchthon, and Erasmus.

===New Testament translation===
Agricola&#x27;s most prominent book is the first Finnish-language translation of the New Testament. The manuscript was completed in 1548. It contains 718 pages and many illustrations.

===Liturgical books===
While Agricola was in Wittenberg, he translated three smaller liturgical books into Finnish. These books were printed in 1549.

&quot;Käsikirja Castesta ia muista Christikunnan Menoista&quot; includes forms for christening, marriage and burial, as well as speeches for the sick, mourning and dying. It is translated from Olaus Petri&#x27;s corresponding work except for the christening and marriage portions, which are from Luther. It also contains minor elements translated from works of .

&quot;Messu eli Herran echtolinen&quot; includes the form for a service. It is also based on Olaus Petri&#x27;s work and a few Finnish manuscripts. In this book Agricola revealed his next mission: the translation of the Old Testament.

&quot;Se meiden Herran Jesusen Christusen Pina, ylesnousemus ia tauiaisen Astumus, niste Neliest Euangelisterist coghottuon&quot; tells about Jesus Christ&#x27;s suffering. It is collected from all four gospels. This book was influenced heavily by Johannes Bugenhagen, a teacher in Wittenberg. It was mainly translated from the German version, but some parts are influenced by the Swedish version and Agricola&#x27;s own translation of the New Testament.

==Commemorations==

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America remembers Bishop Agricola annually on 10 April.

Mikael Agricola Church in Helsinki is named after Agricola. As well the Agricola Lutheran Church memorializes his namesake in Toronto Canada. An asteroid 3212 Agricola is named after Agricola.

In 2007, 450 years after his death, Agricola was selected as the main motif for a commemorative coin, the €10 Mikael Agricola and Finnish language commemorative coin. This collector coin was issued to honor Agricola&#x27;s life work as a contributor to the Protestant reformation in Finland and as the father of the Finnish written language. The reverse side depicts a quill to reference the writer, while the coin&#x27;s obverse side contains an artistic interpretation of a human figure.

<text>Unconventional superconductors are materials that display superconductivity which is not explained by the usual BCS theory or its extension, the Eliashberg theory. The pairing in unconventional superconductors may originate from some other mechanism than the electron–phonon interaction. Alternatively, a superconductor is unconventional if the superconducting order parameter transforms according to a non-trivial irreducible representation of the point group or space group of the system. Per definition, superconductors that break additional symmetries to &quot;U&quot; (1) symmetry are known as unconventional superconductors. 

== History ==

The superconducting properties of CeCu2Si2, a type of
heavy fermion material, were reported in 1979 by Frank Steglich. For a long time it was believed that CeCu2Si2 was a singlet d-wave superconductor, but since the mid-2010s, this notion has been strongly contested. In the early eighties, many more unconventional, heavy fermion superconductors were discovered, including UBe13, UPt3 and URu2Si2. In each of these materials, the anisotropic nature of the pairing was implicated by the power-law dependence of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate and specific heat capacity on temperature. The presence of nodes in the superconducting gap of UPt3 was confirmed in 1986 from the polarization dependence of the ultrasound attenuation.

The first unconventional triplet superconductor, organic material (TMTSF)2PF6, was discovered by Denis Jerome, Klaus Bechgaard and coworkers in 1980 (TMTSF = Tetramethyltetraselenafulvalenium, see Fulvalene). Experimental works by Paul Chaikin&#x27;s and Michael Naughton&#x27;s groups as well as theoretical analysis of their data by Andrei Lebed have firmly confirmed unconventional nature of superconducting pairing in (TMTSF)2X (X=PF6, ClO4, etc.) organic materials.

High-temperature singlet d-wave superconductivity was discovered by J.G. Bednorz and K.A. Müller in 1986, who also discovered that the lanthanum-based cuprate perovskite material LaBaCuO4 develops superconductivity at a critical temperature (&quot;T&quot;c) of approximately 35 K (-238 degrees Celsius). This was well above the highest critical temperature known at the time (&quot;T&quot;c = 23 K), and thus the new family of materials was called high-temperature superconductors. Bednorz and Müller received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1987. Since then, many other high-temperature superconductors have been synthesized.

LSCO (La2−&quot;x&quot;Sr&quot;x&quot;CuO4) was discovered the same year (1986). Soon after, in January 1987, yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) was discovered to have a &quot;T&quot;c of 90 K, the first material to achieve superconductivity above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K). This was highly significant from the point of view of the technological applications of superconductivity because liquid nitrogen is far less expensive than liquid helium, which is required to cool conventional superconductors down to their critical temperature. In 1988 bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) with &quot;T&quot;c up to 107 K, and thallium barium calcium copper oxide (TBCCO) (T=thallium) with &quot;T&quot;c of 125 K were discovered. The current record critical temperature is about &quot;T&quot;c = 133 K (−140 °C) at standard pressure, and somewhat higher critical temperatures can be achieved at high pressure. Nevertheless, at present it is considered unlikely that cuprate perovskite materials will achieve room-temperature superconductivity.

On the other hand, other unconventional superconductors have been discovered. These include some that do not superconduct at high temperatures, such as strontium ruthenate Sr2RuO4, but that, like high-temperature superconductors, are unconventional in other ways. (For example, the origin of the attractive force leading to the formation of Cooper pairs may be different from the one postulated in BCS theory.) In addition to this, superconductors that have unusually high values of &quot;T&quot;c but that are not cuprate perovskites have been discovered. Some of them may be extreme examples of conventional superconductors (this is suspected of magnesium diboride, MgB2, with &quot;T&quot;c = 39 K). Others could display more unconventional features.

In 2008 a new class that does not include copper (layered oxypnictide superconductors), for example LaOFeAs, was discovered. An oxypnictide of samarium seemed to have a &quot;T&quot;c of about 43 K, which was higher than predicted by BCS theory. Tests at up to 45 T suggested the upper critical field of LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 to be around 64 T. Some other iron-based superconductors do not contain oxygen.

, the highest-temperature superconductor (at ambient pressure) is mercury barium calcium copper oxide (HgBa2Ca2Cu3O&quot;x&quot;), at 138 K and is held by a cuprate-perovskite material, possibly 164 K under high pressure.

Other unconventional superconductors not based on cuprate structure have too been found. Some have unusually high values of the critical temperature, &quot;T&quot;c, and hence they are sometimes also called high-temperature superconductors.

=== Graphene ===

In 2017, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on graphene proximitized to the electron-doped (non-chiral) &quot;d&quot;-wave superconductor Pr2−&quot;x&quot;Ce&quot;x&quot;CuO4 (PCCO) revealed evidence for an unconventional superconducting density of states induced in graphene. Publications in March 2018 provided evidence for unconventional superconducting properties of a graphene bilayer where one layer was offset by a &quot;magic angle&quot; of 1.1° relative to the other.

==Ongoing research==
While the mechanism responsible for conventional superconductivity is well described by the BCS theory, the mechanism for unconventional superconductivity is still unknown. After more than twenty years of intense research, the origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still not clear, being one of the major unsolved problems of theoretical condensed matter physics. It appears that unlike conventional superconductivity driven by &quot;electron-phonon&quot; attraction, genuine &quot;electronic&quot; mechanisms (such as antiferromagnetic correlations) are at play. Moreover, d-wave pairing, rather than s-wave, is significant.

One goal of much research is room-temperature superconductivity.

Despite intensive research and many promising leads, an explanation has so far eluded scientists. One reason for this is that the materials in question are generally very complex, multi-layered crystals (for example, BSCCO), making theoretical modeling difficult.

==Possible mechanisms==

The most controversial topic in condensed matter physics has been the mechanism for high-&quot;T&quot;c superconductivity (HTS). There have been two representative theories on the HTS : (See also Resonating valence bond theory )

===Weak-coupling theory===
Firstly, it has been suggested that the HTS emerges by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in a doped system. According to this weak-coupling theory, the pairing wave function of the HTS should have a &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2 symmetry. Thus, whether the symmetry of the pairing wave function is the &quot;d&quot; symmetry or not is essential to demonstrate on the mechanism of the HTS in respect of the spin fluctuation. That is, if the HTS order parameter (pairing wave function) does not have &quot;d&quot; symmetry, then a pairing mechanism related to spin fluctuation can be ruled out. The &quot;tunnel experiment&quot; (see below) seems to detect &quot;d&quot; symmetry in some HTS.

===Interlayer coupling model===
Secondly, there is the interlayer coupling model, according to which a layered structure consisting of BCS-type (s symmetry) superconductor can enhance the superconductivity by itself. By introducing an additional tunneling interaction between each layer, this model successfully explained the anisotropic symmetry of the order parameter in the HTS as well as the emergence of the HTS.

In order to solve this unsettled problem, there have been numerous experiments such as photoelectron spectroscopy, NMR, specific heat measurement, etc. Unfortunately, the results were ambiguous, where some reports supported the d symmetry for the HTS but others supported the s symmetry. This muddy situation possibly originated from the indirect nature of the experimental evidence, as well as experimental issues such as sample quality, impurity scattering, twinning, etc.

===Superexchange===
Promising experimental results from various researchers in September 2022, including Weijiong Chen, J.C. Séamus Davis and H. Eisiaki revealed that superexchange of electrons is possibly the most probable reason for high-temperature superconductivity.

==Previous studies on the symmetry of the HTS order parameter==
The symmetry of the HTS order parameter has been studied in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and, more recently, by angle-resolved photoemission and measurements of the microwave penetration depth in a HTS crystal. NMR measurements probe the local magnetic field around an atom and hence reflect the susceptibility of the material. They have been of special interest for the HTS materials because many researchers have wondered whether spin correlations might play a role in the mechanism of the HTS.

NMR measurements of the resonance frequency on YBCO indicated that electrons in the copper oxide superconductors are paired in spin-singlet states. This indication came from the behavior of the Knight shift, the frequency shift that occurs when the internal field is different from the applied field: In a normal metal, the magnetic moments of the conduction electrons in the neighborhood of the ion being probed align with the applied field and create a larger internal field. As these metals go superconducting, electrons with oppositely directed spins couple to form singlet states. In the anisotropic HTS, perhaps NMR measurements have found that the relaxation rate for copper depends on the direction of the applied static magnetic field, with the rate being higher when the static field is parallel to one of the axes in the copper oxide plane. While this observation by some group supported the d symmetry of the HTS, other groups could not observe it.

Also, by measuring the &quot;penetration depth&quot;, the symmetry of the HTS order parameter can be studied. The microwave penetration depth is determined by the superfluid density responsible for screening the external field. In the s wave BCS theory, because pairs can be thermally excited across the gap Δ, the change in superfluid density per unit change in temperature goes as exponential behavior, exp(-Δ/&quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot;). In that case, the penetration depth also varies exponentially with temperature &quot;T&quot;. If there are nodes in the energy gap as in the &quot;d&quot; symmetry HTS, electron pair can more easily be broken, the superfluid density should have a stronger temperature dependence, and the penetration depth is expected to increase as a power of T at low temperatures. If the symmetry is specially &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2 then the penetration depth should vary linearly with &quot;T&quot; at low temperatures. This technique is increasingly being used to study superconductors and is limited in application largely by the quality of available single crystals.

Photoemission spectroscopy also could provide information on the HTS symmetry. By scattering photons off electrons in the crystal, one can sample the energy spectra of the electrons. Because the technique is sensitive to the angle of the emitted electrons one can determine the spectrum for different wave vectors on the Fermi surface. However, within the resolution of the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), researchers could not tell whether the gap goes to zero or just gets very small. Also, ARPES are sensitive only to the magnitude and not to the sign of the gap, so it could not tell if the gap goes negative at some point. This means that ARPES cannot determine whether the HTS order parameter has the &quot;d&quot; symmetry or not.

==Junction experiment supporting the &quot;d-wave&quot; symmetry==

There was a clever experimental design to overcome the muddy situation. An experiment based on pair tunneling and flux quantization in a three-grain ring of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) was designed to test the symmetry of the order parameter in YBCO.
 Such a ring consists of three YBCO crystals with specific orientations consistent with the d-wave pairing symmetry to give rise to a spontaneously generated half-integer quantum vortex at the tricrystal meeting point. Furthermore, the possibility that junction interfaces can be in the clean limit (no defects) or with maximum zig-zag disorder was taken into account in this tricrystal experiment.
A proposal of studying vortices with half magnetic flux quanta in heavy-fermion superconductors in three polycrystalline configurations was reported in 1987 by V. B. Geshkenbein, A. Larkin and A. Barone in 1987.

In the first tricrystal pairing symmetry experiment, the spontaneous magnetization of half flux quantum was clearly observed in YBCO, which convincingly supported the &quot;d-wave&quot; symmetry of the order parameter in YBCO. Because YBCO is orthorhombic, it might inherently have an admixture of s-wave symmetry. So, by tuning their technique further, it was found that there was an admixture of s-wave symmetry in YBCO within about 3%. Also, it was demonstrated by Tsuei, Kirtley et al. that there was a pure &quot;d&quot;&quot;x&quot;2-&quot;y&quot;2 order parameter symmetry in the tetragonal Tl2Ba2CuO6.

<text>Year 919 ([[Roman numerals|CMXIX]]) was a common year starting on Friday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By Place===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* March 25 – Romanos Lekapenos, admiral (&quot;droungarios&quot;) of the Byzantine navy, seizes the Boukoleon Palace in Constantinople. He is named &quot;megas hetaireiarches&quot; (head of the imperial guard). Lekapenos consolidates his position and becomes regent of Emperor Constantine VII. He marries his 9-year-old daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine and assumes the new title of &quot;basileopator&quot; (one of the highest offices in the Byzantine Empire).

==== Europe ====
* May 24 – The nobles of Franconia and Saxony elect Henry the Fowler at the Imperial Diet in Fritzlar as ruler of the East Frankish Kingdom. He recognizes the stem duchies (uniting them in a German confederation) and all their sovereign privileges. Two of the four most influential duchies, Bavaria and Swabia, do not accept his rule. Henry fortifies Magdeburg against the Magyars.
* Summer – Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria (&quot;the Bad&quot;), is elected as anti-king by the East-Frankish nobles in opposition to Henry I. Burchard II, duke of Swabia, submits to Henry&#x27;s rule — allowing him to retain administrative control over his duchy. After an absence of nearly 15 years, the Magyars raid Bavaria and Northern Italy again, sacking the Po Valley (see Hungarian invasions of Europe).
* September 14 – Battle of Islandbridge: High King Niall Glúndub is killed while leading an Irish coalition against the Dublin-based Vikings of Uí Ímair, led by King Sitric Cáech.

==== Britain ====
* Lady Ælfwynn of the Mercians is brought to the court of her uncle, King Edward the Elder, and deprived of her authority in Mercia. Edward formally annexes the kingdom, ending independent Mercian rule.
* Ragnall ua Ímair, a Viking chief from Ireland, takes control of the Norse Kingdom of York (also referred to as Jórvik) and the English-ruled Earldom of Northumbria. He establishes himself as king at York.

==== Africa ====
* April 5 – The Fatimid Caliphate of Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia) launch the second Fatimid invasion of Egypt (919–921) in an attempt to seize Egypt from its Abbasid rulers. The expedition fails and the Fatimids will be forced to retreat.
* Following his death, Mara Takla Haymanot is succeeded by his eldest son Tatadim as ruler (&quot;negus&quot;) of the Zagwe Dynasty in Ethiopia.

==== China ====
* Battle of Langshan Jiang: The Wuyue navy (500 dragon ships) under Prince Qian Yuanguan who is preparing an invasion to attack the Wu Kingdom, defeats the naval forces of General Peng Yanzhang on the Yangtze River. Due to the use of flamethrower ships (using gunpowder to ignite petrol, like Greek fire) Qian Yuanguan manages to destroy 400 enemy ships and captures 7,000 prisoners.

==== Mesoamerica ====
* The Ancestral Puebloans, living in the Four Corners, begin construction at Pueblo Bonito, in modern-day New Mexico&#x27;s Chaco Canyon (approximate date).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is declared as autocephalous and elevated to the rank of patriarchate at an ecclesiastical council.

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* December 23 – King Conrad I, injured at one of his battles with Arnulf I (the Bad), dies at his residence in Weilburg Castle after a 7-year reign. On his deathbed Conrad persuades his younger brother Eberhard III to offer the East Frankish crown to Henry the Fowler, the duke of Saxony. Conrad is buried in Fulda Cathedral (also the burial place of Boniface) in Germany.

* Battle of Corbridge: High-Reeve Ealdred I persuades King Constantine II of Scotland to help him reclaim his position in Bernicia. They mount an invasion of his now Norse controlled lands. The Vikings under Ragnall ua Ímair (or Rægnald) defeat the Scots and their allies at Corbridge (Northern Northumbria), but take heavy casualties themselves. 
* Summer – Lady Æthelflæd of Mercia begins to intrigue with disaffected factions within the Norse Kingdom of York (also referred to as Jórvik). Mercian troops ravage the local countryside and peacefully overrun the fortress of Leicester (belonging to the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw), while her brother, King Edward the Elder, takes Stamford.
* June 12 – Æthelflæd dies at Tamworth while campaigning against the Vikings. She is buried with her husband Æthelred in St. Oswald&#x27;s Priory at Gloucester. Æthelflæd is succeeded by her only daughter Ælfwynn.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* August 20 – Battle of Achelous: A Byzantine expeditionary force (62,000 men) under General Leo Phokas (the Elder) is routed by the Bulgarians at the Achelous River near the fortress of Anchialos (modern Pomorie) on the Black Sea coast. Phokas flees to Mesembria (modern Nesebar) and escapes by boarding a ship. Tsar Simeon I (the Great) becomes &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the whole Balkan Peninsula, except the well-protected Byzantine capital of Constantinople and the Peloponnese.
* Fall – Battle of Katasyrtai: The Bulgarian army under Simeon I marches southwards to Constantinople. Leo Phokas, who survived at Anchelous, gathers the last Byzantine troops to intercept the Bulgarians before they reach the capital. The two armies meet near the village of Katasyrtai, just outside Constantinople. After a surprise night attack, the Byzantines are completely routed from the battlefield.

==== Europe ====
* Bulgarian–Serbian War: Simeon I sends a Bulgarian expeditionary force under Theodore Sigritsa and Marmais to Serbia. The two persuade Petar Gojniković, a Serbian prince who formed an anti-Bulgarian coalition, to meet for a peace agreement.

<text>Year 914 ([[Roman numerals|CMXIV]]) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring – Empress Zoe Karbonopsina leads a palace coup at Constantinople and, with the support of the &quot;magistros&quot; John Eladas, overthrows Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos as regent over her son, Emperor Constantine VII. She allows Nicholas to remain as patriarch, repudiates the title granted to Simeon I of Bulgaria (see 913) and nullifies the marriage plans (with a Bulgarian princess) made for her son by Nicholas.
* Summer – Byzantine–Bulgarian War: Simeon I, with the Bulgarian army, invades the themes of Thrace and Macedonia. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian troops penetrate into the regions of Dyrrhachium and Thessalonica to the west. Thrace&#x27;s largest and most important city, Adrianople (modern Turkey), is besieged and captured. However, the Byzantines promptly regain the city in exchange for a huge ransom.

==== Europe ====

* January 19 – King García I dies at Zamora (Spain) after a 4-year reign. He is succeeded by his brother Ordoño II, who becomes king of Galicia and León. Ordoño continues his expansion and settles his court in León.
* Summer – Saracens from Garigliano establish advanced strongholds in Lazio at Trevi (in the Sabine Hills, near Palestrina) and Sutri. From here, they encroach on the papal cities of Orte, Narni and Nepi with impunity.
* Viking raiders establish a settlement near Waterford (Ireland) led by Ottir (the Black). The Dublin Vikings are forced to pay tribute to the Irish kings of Meath and Leinster as the price to keeping their independence.
* In Al-Andalus a drought leads to a terrible famine in the Iberian Peninsula, which continues in 915. In his centralization effort, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman III, reconquers Seville from the Banu Hajjaj clan.

==== Britain ====
* Vikings devastate the Welsh coast and move up the Severn River. They capture Bishop Cyfeilliog of Ergyng, and he is ransomed by King Edward the Elder. The Vikings are defeated by levies from Hereford and Gloucester.
* Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, a daughter of King Alfred the Great, builds a burh or fortified dwelling at Warwick and repairs Eddisbury hill fort. She leads the Mercians in their fight against the Danish invaders.

==== Africa ====
* January 24 – The Fatimid general, Hubasa ibn Yusuf of the Kutama Berber tribe, marches out with his troops to invade Egypt. He follows the coastline, and takes possession of the only two towns of any size Syrte and Ajdabiya, without a struggle. The garrisons of the two towns—the westernmost outposts of the Abbasid Caliphate—have already fled.
* February 6 – Hubasa takes Barqah (modern-day Benghazi), the ancient capital of Cyrenaica. The Abbasid governor withdraws to Egypt, before the superior strength of the Fatimids. With this rich, fertile province fallen into his hands, it provides Hubāsa with 24,000 gold dinars in annual revenues from taxes, as well as 15,000 dinars paid by Christians.
* July 11 – Al-Qa&#x27;im bi-Amr Allah, son of the Fatimid caliph Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, leaves Raqqada at the head of an army, which is composed of Kutama warriors and the Arab &quot;jund&quot; (personal guard) in an attempt to conquer Egypt. He sends orders to Hubāsa to wait for him, but driven by ambition Hubāsa is already on his way to Alexandria.
* August 27 – Hubasa captures Alexandria, after a victorious encounter with Egyptian troops near al-Hanniyya (modern-day El Alamein). The Abbasid governor Takin al-Khazari refuses to surrender and asks for reinforcements, which reach him in September. Shortly after al-Qa&#x27;im bi-Amr Allah enters Alexandria, with the rest of his army.
* December – The Fatimid army under Hubasa leaves Alexandria, followed by al-Qa&#x27;im bi-Amr Allah. The Abbasid troops hold Fustat and begin a counter-offensive against the invaders. The Kutama cavalry suffers heavy losses to the Turkish archers.

==== Arabian Empire ====
* January 12 – Ahmad Samani, emir of the Samanid Empire, is murdered (decapitation) while sleeping in his tent at Bukhara (modern Uzbekistan) by some of his slaves. He is succeeded by his 8-year-old son, Nasr II, under the regency of Vizier Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani. The Abbasids try, in vain, to benefit from the turmoil to reconquer Sistan.
* Sajid invasion of Georgia: A Muslim army under Yusuf ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj campaigns in the Georgian principalities. He makes Tiflis his base for operations, and invades Kakheti. Yusuf proceeds to Kartli, where the fortifications of Uplistsikhe are demolished. He besieges and captures the fortress of Q&#x27;ueli, putting its defender Gobron to death.
* Hasan al-Utrush re-establishes Zaydid rule over the province Tabaristan (Northern Iran), after 14 years of Samanid occupation. He becomes the new ruler (emir) and Zaydid noblemen accept his authority.

==== Asia ====
* February 4 – The Belanjong pillar is established on Bali.
* In India Emperor Indra III of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, a grandson of Krishna II, begins his rule (until 929).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* March or April – Pope Lando dies at Rome after a reign of less than a year. He is succeeded by John X, archbishop of Ravenna, as the 122nd pope of the Catholic Church.

== Events ==
=== By place ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
* May 11 – Emperor Leo VI (the Wise) dies after a 26-year reign, in which he has completed the Byzantine code of laws (&quot;Basilika&quot;). He is succeeded by his brother Alexander III as emperor (&quot;basileus&quot;) alongside Leo&#x27;s 6-year-old son Constantine VII. Alexander becomes &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Byzantine Empire and expels Empress Zoe Karbonopsina, the mother of Constantine, from the palace and exiles her to a nunnery.

==== Europe ====
* German dukes Henry the Fowler of Saxony and Arnulf I (the Bad) of Bavaria claim themselves to be sovereign princes, not recognizing the authority of their overlord, King Conrad I of the East Frankish Kingdom, as he is not a Carolingian. Duke Erchanger II of Swabia and Conrad&#x27;s brother, Duke Eberhard III of Franconia, support the Conradines.
* Orso II Participazio becomes the doge of Venice. He sends his son Pietro to Constantinople in order to re-establish the relationship with Alexander III.
* King Ordoño II of Galicia continues his expansion of the Christian polity. He sacks the cities of Mérida and Évora.

==== Britain ====
* Lady Æthelflæd expands her policy by building defensive &quot;burghs&quot; at Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. The fortifications are needed to protect Mercia against plundering Vikings from the Danelaw (Danish territory in England).

==== Arabian Empire ====
* October 16 – Abd al-Rahman III succeeds his grandfather Abdullah ibn Muhammad (after his execution) and becomes emir of Córdoba (Al-Andalus).
* The second rebellion in two years, of the Kutama tribesmen against the Fatimid Caliphate, occurs.

<text>Kurt Julian Weill (March 2, 1900April 3, 1950) was a German-born American composer active from the 1920s in his native country, and in his later years in the United States. He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht. With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which included the ballad &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose, &quot;Gebrauchsmusik&quot;. He also wrote several works for the concert hall and a number of works on Jewish themes. He became a United States citizen in 1943.

== Family and childhood ==
Weill was born on March 2, 1900, the third of four children to Albert Weill (1867–1950) and Emma Weill (née Ackermann; 1872–1955). He grew up in a religious Jewish family in the &quot;Sandvorstadt&quot;, the Jewish quarter in Dessau in Saxony, where his father was a cantor. At the age of twelve, Weill started taking piano lessons and made his first attempts at writing music; his earliest preserved composition was written in 1913 and is titled &quot;&quot;Mi Addir&quot;: Jewish Wedding Song&quot;.

In 1915, Weill started taking private lessons with Albert Bing, kapellmeister at the &quot;Herzogliches Hoftheater zu Dessau&quot;, who taught him piano, composition, music theory, and conducting. Weill performed publicly on piano for the first time in 1915, both as an accompanist and soloist. The following years he composed numerous lieder to the lyrics of poets such as Joseph von Eichendorff, Arno Holz, and Anna Ritter, as well as a cycle of five songs titled &quot;Ofrahs Lieder&quot; to a German translation of a text by Yehuda Halevi.

Weill graduated with an Abitur from the &quot;Oberrealschule&quot; of Dessau in 1918, and enrolled at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik at the age of 18, where he studied composition with Engelbert Humperdinck, conducting with Rudolf Krasselt, and counterpoint with Friedrich E. Koch, and also attended philosophy lectures by Max Dessoir and Ernst Cassirer. The same year, he wrote his first string quartet (in B minor).

== Musical career ==
=== Early work and compositions ===
Weill&#x27;s family experienced financial hardship in the aftermath of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a répétiteur at the Friedrich-Theater under the direction of the new Kapellmeister, Hans Knappertsbusch. During this time, he composed an orchestral suite in E-flat major, a symphonic poem on Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s &quot;The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke&quot;, and &quot;Schilflieder&quot; (&quot;Reed Songs&quot;), a cycle of five songs to poems by Nikolaus Lenau. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in Lüdenscheid, where he directed opera, operetta, and singspiel for five months. He subsequently composed a cello sonata and &quot;Ninon de Lenclos&quot;, a now lost one-act operatic adaptation of a 1905 play by Ernst Hardt. From May to September 1920, Weill spent a few months in Leipzig, where his father had become the director of a Jewish orphanage, residing in the Gottschedstrasse. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed &quot;Sulamith&quot;, a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.

=== Studies with Busoni ===

Back in Berlin, Weill had an interview with Ferruccio Busoni in December 1920. After examining some of Weill&#x27;s compositions, Busoni accepted him as one of five master students in composition at the Preussische Akademie der Künste in Berlin.

From January 1921 to December 1923, Weill studied music composition with him and also counterpoint with Philipp Jarnach in Berlin. During his first year he composed his first symphony, &quot;Sinfonie in einem Satz&quot;, as well as the lieder &quot;Die Bekehrte&quot; (Goethe) and two &quot;Rilkelieder&quot; for voice and piano. Busoni, then approaching the end of his life, was a major influence on Weill. Where Weill&#x27;s early compositions reflect the post-Wagnerian Romanticism and Expressionism common in German classical music of that era, Busoni was a Neoclassicist. Busoni&#x27;s influence can be seen especially in Weill&#x27;s vocal and stage works, which moved steadily away from having the music reflect the characters&#x27; emotions to have it function as (often ironic) commentary. This was Weill&#x27;s own path to some of the same notions of Epic theater and the &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; (distancing effect) advocated by his future collaborator Brecht.

To support his family in Leipzig, Weill also worked as a pianist in a Bierkeller tavern. In 1922, Weill joined the November Group&#x27;s music faction. That year he composed a psalm, a divertimento for orchestra, and &quot;Sinfonia Sacra: Fantasia, Passacaglia, and Hymnus for Orchestra&quot;. On November 18, 1922, his children&#x27;s pantomime &quot;Die Zaubernacht&quot; (&quot;The Magic Night&quot;) premiered at the Theater am Kurfürstendamm; it was the first public performance of any of Weill&#x27;s works in the field of musical theatre.

Out of financial need, Weill taught music theory and composition to private students from 1923 to 1925. Among his students were Claudio Arrau, Maurice Abravanel, Heinz Jolles (later known as Henry Jolles), Nikos Skalkottas, and Esther Zweig. Arrau, Abravanel, and Jolles remained members of Weill&#x27;s circle of friends thereafter, and Jolles&#x27;s sole surviving composition predating the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933 is a fragment of a work for four pianos he and Weill wrote jointly.

Weill&#x27;s compositions during his last year of studies included &quot;Quodlibet&quot;, an orchestral suite version of &quot;Die Zaubernacht&quot;; &quot;Frauentanz&quot;, seven medieval poems for soprano, flute, viola, clarinet, French horn, and bassoon; and &quot;Recordare&quot; for choir and children&#x27;s choir to words from the Book of Lamentations. Further premieres that year included a performance of his &quot;Divertimento for Orchestra&quot; by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Heinz Unger on April 10, 1923, and the Hindemith-Amar Quartet&#x27;s rendering of Weill&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet&quot;, Op. 8, on June 24, 1923. In December 1923, Weill finished his studies with Busoni.

=== Success in the 1920s and early 1930s ===
In 1922 he joined the &quot;Novembergruppe&quot;, a group of leftist Berlin artists that included Hanns Eisler and Stefan Wolpe. In February 1924 the conductor Fritz Busch introduced him to the dramatist Georg Kaiser, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser&#x27;s house in Grünheide, Weill first met the singer and actress Lotte Lenya in the summer of 1924. The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (after their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill&#x27;s work, and after his death she took it upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the Kurt Weill Foundation. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide &quot;Der deutsche Rundfunk&quot;; Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.
Although he had some success with his first mature non-stage works (such as the String Quartet, Op. 8, and the Concerto for Violin and Wind Orchestra, Op. 12), which were influenced by Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, Weill tended more and more towards vocal music and musical theatre. His musical theatre work and his songs were extremely popular in Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Weill&#x27;s music was admired by composers such as Alban Berg, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Darius Milhaud and Stravinsky, but it was also criticized by others: Schoenberg, who later revised his opinion, and Anton Webern.

His best-known work is &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1928), a reworking of John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, written in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. Engel directed the original production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; in 1928. It contains Weill&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Textually &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;—like the &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; before it—is satire and social commentary; but for Weill, coming from a musical perspective, it was something else as well: &quot;It gives us the opportunity to make opera the subject matter for an evening in the theater&quot;, part of what Weill saw as a lifelong process to &quot;reform&quot; opera for the modern stage. The stage success was filmed by G. W. Pabst in two language versions: &quot;Die 3-Groschen-Oper&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;opéra de quat&#x27; sous&quot;. Weill and Brecht tried to stop the film adaptation through a well publicized lawsuit—which Weill won and Brecht lost. 

Weill continued to work with Brecht on the musical &quot;Happy End&quot; (1929), best known for the songs &quot;Surabaya Johnny&quot;, &quot;Bilbao Song&quot;, and &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Tango&quot;; the children&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Jasager&quot; (1930); and the opera &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; (1930), best known for &quot;Alabama Song&quot; (later recorded by The Doors, among many others). Weill&#x27;s working association with Brecht, although successful, came to an end over politics in 1930. Though Weill associated with socialism, after Brecht tried to push their work even further in a left-wing direction, Weill commented, according to his wife Lotte Lenya, that he was unable to &quot;set the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; to music.&quot;

While in Germany in the early 1930s, Weill also collaborated with the American virtuoso banjoist Mike Danzi in an early production of his opera &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;. During a rehearsal, Weill congratulated Danzi for his accurate interpretation of the chords found in his score while noting that most other banjoists had complained that they were not actually written for the banjo at all.

=== Life in Paris and New York ===
Weill fled Nazi Germany in March 1933. A prominent and popular Jewish composer, Weill was officially denounced for his political views and sympathies, and became a target of the Nazi authorities, who criticized and interfered with performances of his later stage works, such as &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; (&quot;Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny&quot;, 1930), (1932), and &quot;Der Silbersee&quot; (1933). With no option but to leave Germany, he went first to Paris, where he worked once more with Brecht (after a project with Jean Cocteau failed) on the ballet &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;.

On April 13, 1933, his musical &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; was given its premiere on Broadway, but closed after 13 performances to mixed reviews. In 1934 he completed his Symphony No. 2, his last purely orchestral work, conducted in Amsterdam and New York by Bruno Walter, and also the music for Jacques Deval&#x27;s play &quot;&quot;. A production of his operetta &quot;Der Kuhhandel&quot; (&quot;A Kingdom for a Cow&quot;) took him to London in 1935, and later that year he went to the United States in connection with &quot;The Eternal Road&quot;, a &quot;Biblical Drama&quot; by Franz Werfel that had been commissioned by members of New York&#x27;s Jewish community and was premiered in 1937 at the Manhattan Opera House, running for 153 performances.
He and Lotte moved to New York City on September 10, 1935, living first at the St. Moritz Hotel before moving to an apartment at 231 East 62nd Street, between Third and Second Avenues. They rented an old house with Paul Green during the summer of 1936 near Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut, the summer home of the Group Theatre, while finishing &quot;Johnny Johnson&quot;. Some of the other artists who summered there in 1936 were Elia Kazan, Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Lee J. Cobb, Will Geer, Clifford Odets, Howard da Silva and Irwin Shaw.

Rather than continue to write in the same style that had characterized his European compositions, Weill made a study of American popular and stage music. His American output contains individual songs and entire shows that not only became highly respected and admired, but have been seen as seminal works in the development of the American musical. In 1939 he wrote the music for &quot;Railroads on Parade,&quot; a musical spectacular put on at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York to celebrate the American railroad industry (book by Edward Hungerford). Unique among Broadway composers of the time, Weill insisted on writing his own orchestrations (with some very few exceptions, such as the dance music in &quot;Street Scene&quot;). He worked with writers such as Maxwell Anderson and Ira Gershwin, and wrote a film score for Fritz Lang (&quot;You and Me&quot;, 1938). Weill himself strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be both commercially and artistically successful. The most interesting attempt in this direction is &quot;Street Scene&quot;, based on a play by Elmer Rice, with lyrics by Langston Hughes. For his work on &quot;Street Scene&quot; Weill was awarded the inaugural Tony Award for Best Original Score.

In the 1940s Weill lived in downstate New York near the New Jersey border and made frequent trips both to New York City and to Hollywood for his work for theatre and film. Weill was active in political movements encouraging American entry into World War II, and after America joined the war in 1941, Weill enthusiastically collaborated in numerous artistic projects supporting the war effort both abroad and on the home front. He and Maxwell Anderson also joined the volunteer civil service by working as air raid wardens on High Tor Mountain between their homes in New City, New York and Haverstraw, New York in Rockland County. Weill became a naturalized citizen of the United States on August 27, 1943.

Weill had ideals of writing music that served a socially useful purpose. In the US, he wrote &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;, an opera including the song of the same name and other American folk songs. He also wrote a number of songs in support of the American war effort, including the satirical &quot;Schickelgruber&quot; (with lyrics by Howard Dietz), &quot;Buddy on the Nightshift&quot; (with Oscar Hammerstein) and – with Brecht again as in his earlier career – the &quot;Ballad of the Nazi Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;Und was bekam des Soldaten Weib?&quot;). Intended for broadcast to Germany, the song chronicled the progress of the Nazi war machine through the gifts sent to the proud wife at home by her man at the front: furs from Oslo, a silk dress from Paris etc., until finally, from Russia, she receives her widow&#x27;s veil.

Apart from &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; and &quot;Pirate Jenny&quot; from &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, his most famous songs include &quot;Alabama Song&quot; (from &quot;Mahagonny&quot;), &quot;Surabaya Johnny&quot; (from &quot;Happy End&quot;), &quot;Speak Low&quot; (from &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;), &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; (from the musical of that name), &quot;My Ship&quot; (from &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;), and &quot;September Song&quot; (from &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot;).

==Death==
Weill suffered a heart attack shortly after his 50th birthday and died on April 3, 1950, in New York City. He was buried in Mount Repose Cemetery in Haverstraw, New York. The text and music on his gravestone come from the song &quot;A Bird of Passage&quot; from &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;, itself adapted from a quotation from the Venerable Bede:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1.67em;&quot;&gt;This is the life of men on earth:
Out of darkness we come at birth
Into a lamplit room, and then –
Go forward into dark again.
:(lyric: Maxwell Anderson)&lt;/poem&gt;

An excerpt from Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s eulogy for Weill read:
:I wish, of course, that he had been lucky enough to have had a little more time for his work. I could wish the times in which he lived had been less troubled. But these things were as they were – and Kurt managed to make thousands of beautiful things during the short and troubled time he had ...

==Influence==
Weill&#x27;s music continues to be performed both in popular and classical contexts. In Weill&#x27;s lifetime, his work was most associated with the voice of his wife, Lotte Lenya, but shortly after his death &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; was established by Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin as a jazz standard. His music has since been recorded by many performers, ranging from Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, The Doors, Ella Fitzgerald, David Bowie, Robbie Williams, Judy Collins, John Zorn, Dagmar Krause, Steeleye Span, The Young Gods, and PJ Harvey to New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra. Singers as varied as Teresa Stratas, Ute Lemper, Gisela May, Anne Sofie von Otter, Max Raabe, Heinz Karl Gruber, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Marianne Faithfull have recorded entire albums of his music.

In 1985, Hal Willner produced &quot;Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill&quot;, a tribute album in which Weill&#x27;s songs were interpreted by a variety of artists, including Todd Rundgren, Tom Waits, Lou Reed, Charlie Haden and Sting.

Amanda Palmer, singer-pianist of the Brechtian Punk Cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls, has Kurt Weill&#x27;s name on the front of her keyboard (a pun on the name of the instrument maker Kurzweil) as a tribute to the composer. In 1991, the seminal Swiss industrial band The Young Gods released an album of Kurt Weill songs, &quot;The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill&quot;. Weill has also been often cited as an influence on Goldfrapp&#x27;s &quot;Felt Mountain&quot;. In 2008, Weill&#x27;s songs were performed by Canadian musicians (including Sarah Slean and Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara) in a tribute concert as part of the first annual Canwest Cabaret Festival in Toronto. In 2009 Duke Special released an EP, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, of five songs from an unfinished musical by Kurt Weill based on the novel by Mark Twain.

Kurt Weill is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Kurt Weill Centre==

The Kurt Weill Centre (German:&quot;Kurt-Weill-Zentrum&quot;) in Dessau was founded in 1993. It provides a museum, library, archive and media centre and organises an annual festival celebrating the composer&#x27;s work. It is housed in the Feininger house, a house designed by the architect Walter Gropius which was originally lived in by the artist Lyonel Feininger. The property is part of the World Heritage site the Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar, Dessau and Bernau. The centre, with its collection of material on Weill, is listed as a cultural memorial of national importance. The centre is one of the &quot;Beacons of light&quot; of the Konferenz Nationaler Kultureinrichtungen (Conference of National Cultural Institutions), a union of cultural institutions in the new states of Germany i.e. area that was formerly East Germany.

== Kurt Weill Foundation for Music ==
Founded by Lotte Lenya in 1962, the non-profit, private foundation is dedicated to promoting understanding of Weill&#x27;s life and works and preserving the legacies of Weill and Lenya. The foundation administers the internationally recognized Lotte Lenya Competition, a grant program, various sponsorships and fellowships, the Weill-Lenya Research Center, and the Kurt Weill Prize, and publishes the &quot;Kurt Weill Edition&quot; and the &quot;Kurt Weill Newsletter&quot;. Trustees of the New York-based organization have included Harold Prince, Victoria Clark, Jeanine Tesori, Tazewell Thompson, and Teresa Stratas.

==Relatives==
Weill&#x27;s grandmother was Jeanette Hochstetter of Liedolsheim in Baden-Württemberg. Weill was one of four members of the same Hochstetter family to lead distinguished careers in the fields of music and literature. His first cousin once removed was Caesar Hochstetter (born January 12, 1863, in Ladenburg, a suburb of Mannheim – his date and place of death are unknown but this was probably during The Holocaust), a composer and arranger who collaborated with Max Reger and who dedicated &quot;Aquarelles&quot;, Op. 25, to him.

Caesar&#x27;s younger brother was (born May 12, 1873, Mannheim – died 1942, Theresienstadt concentration camp), Professor of Literature at the University of Brussels, writer and poet and friend of Wilhelm Busch. His second cousin was the childhood prodigy pianist, Lisy Fischer (born August 22, 1900, Zürich, Switzerland – died June 6, 1999, Newcastle upon Tyne, England).

Year 895 ([[Roman numerals|DCCCXCV]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Europe ====
* The Magyars are expelled from western Siberia, and settle in the Carpathian Basin, under the leadership of Árpád (the traditional date of 896 held during the 20th century has proved to be erroneous). Emperor Leo VI (the Wise) seeks aid from the Magyars, and after crossing the Danube on Byzantine ships, they ravage Bulgarian territory.
* Simeon I (the Great), ruler (&quot;khan&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire, seeks refuge in the fortress of Drastar, while the Magyars reach the outskirts of the capital Preslav. Facing a difficult situation with war on two fronts, Simeon calls for a truce. Leo VI sends the diplomat Leo Choirosphaktes to Bulgaria, to negotiate the terms.
* King Odo (or Eudes) takes a large army against Rheims, and forces anti-king Charles the Simple to flee to Germany. King Arnulf of Carinthia, throwing off his agreements with Odo, charges his illegitimate son Zwentibold to invade the West Frankish Kingdom, and re-install Charles on the throne.
* May – Arnulf of Carinthia summons the Imperial Diet in his residence at Worms. Angered by the non-appearance of Charles the Simple, he again supports Odo&#x27;s claim to the throne of the West Frankish Kingdom. In the same assembly, he crowns Zwentibold as king of Lotharingia.
* Guy IV, duke of Spoleto, conquers Benevento (after the Byzantines have moved the capital of Byzantine Italy from Benevento to Bari). Guy makes himself prince, thereby uniting the two Italian states. The Byzantines attempt to retake Benevento, but are defeated by Lombard troops.
* December – Arnulf of Carinthia invades Italy, at the head of an East Frankish expeditionary army. He arrives in Pavia and reorganizes the Lombard state. Arnulf partitions the northern part of the kingdom: the western half (March of Lombardy) and the eastern half (March of Verona).
* Arnulf of Carinthia crosses the Po River and divides his army in two: one corps (Swabian) proceeds to Florence (via Bologna), while the other corps (Franks) moves through the Lunigiana to the precincts of Rome.
* Spytihněv I, duke of Bohemia, together with the Slavník prince Witizla, breaks away from Great Moravia, and swears allegiance to Arnulf of Carinthia in Regensburg.

==== Britain ====
* King Anarawd of Gwynedd is supplied with English troops, to assist in his reconquest of Seisyllwg (Wales). He is successful, and his brother Cadell is finally able to take his rightful place on the Seisyllwg throne.
* Autumn – King Alfred the Great blockades the Lea River and builds fortifications, trapping the Danish Vikings at Hertford. They abandon their longships and escape to Bridgnorth, located in the Severn Valley.

==== Arabian Empire ====
* Hamdan ibn Hamdun, a Taghlibi Arab chieftain, is defeated and captured by Caliph Al-Mu&#x27;tadid at the fortress of Mardin (near modern Cizre). Hamdan&#x27;s son Husayn enters Abbasid service, beginning the rise of the Hamdanid Dynasty.

==== Mexico ====
* Birth of Topiltzin, future emperor of the Toltec Empire, in Michatlauhco, modern-day Morelos (approximate date).

<text>Year 894 ([[Roman numerals|DCCCXCIV]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Byzantine–Bulgarian War: Stylianos Zaoutzes, leading minister and &quot;basileopator&quot;, convinces Emperor Leo VI (the Wise) to move the Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. This affects the commercial importance of Bulgarian trade. Simeon I, ruler (&quot;khan&quot;) of the Bulgarian Empire, mobilizes his Bulgarian forces and invades Byzantine territory, ravaging the countryside.

==== Europe ====
* Spring – King Arnulf of Carinthia invades Italy at the head of an East Frankish expeditionary army, joining up with the deposed king Berengar I at Verona. He conquers Brescia after little resistance, and sacks Bergamo after a one-month siege. The cities of Milan and Pavia open their doors to Arnulf. Emperor Guy III escapes from Pavia, to hide in the mountains of Spoleto (Umbria).
* March – Arnulf of Carinthia proceeds to Piacenza, and from there invades central Italy. After a successful campaign, he calls the invasion off and returns to Pavia – probably because Duke Rudolph I of Burgundy was threatening to invade Lorraine. Arnulf has himself proclaimed King of Italy at Pavia, leaving Berengar I as his vice-regent in Italy. 
* Arnulf of Carinthia returns to Germany through the Alps, harried by militias dispatched by Rudolph I of Burgundy and margrave Anscar I of Ivrea. Only with much difficulty is Arnulf able to get his army through the Aosta Valley and through St. Moritz, back into Germany. Guy III descends from the Apennines, and re-seizes the Italian kingdom.
* December – Guy III dies after a 4-year reign, and is succeeded by his 14-year-old son Lambert, already associated as co-emperor since 892. At the pleading of Archbishop Fulk of Reims, Pope Formosus reconciles with the young emperor. Lambert proceeds from Spoleto to Pavia, where he is acclaimed and crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
* Svatopluk I, ruler (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of Great Moravia, dies after a 34-year reign, in which he has united the Slavic tribes in his kingdom. He is succeeded by his eldest son Mojmir II. The Principality of Nitra (modern-day Slovakia) is given as an appanage to his brother Svatopluk II.
* Árpád, head of the confederation of the Hungarian tribes, comes to an agreement with the prince of the Moravians, Svatopluk II, that Hungarian and Moravian armies will together expel the Eastern Franks from Pannonia.
* Prince Petar of Serbia defeats his revolting cousin Bran; he is captured and blinded (according to a Byzantine tradition that meant to disqualify a person from taking the throne).

==== Britain ====
* The Vikings in Northumbria and East Anglia swear allegiance and hand over hostages to King Alfred the Great, but promptly break their truce by attacking the southwest of England. A Viking force returns from Exeter and sails along the coast, in an attempt to plunder Chichester. They are defeated by the Saxon garrison, losing many ships and men.
* King Anarawd of Gwynedd&#x27;s shaky alliance with the Vikings collapses. His kingdom is ravaged by the Norsemen. Anarawd is forced to ask for help from Alfred the Great and submits to his overlordship. Alfred imposes oppressive terms and forces Anarawd&#x27;s confirmation in the Christian Church, with Alfred as &#x27;godfather&#x27;.
* Autumn – Battle of Benfleet: Danish Viking forces retire to Essex, after being deprived of food by Alfred the Great (see 893). They draw their longships up the Thames and into the Lea, entrenching themselves at Benfleet.

==== Japan ====
* Emperor Uda orders commercial relations (called Imperial Japanese embassies to China) to cease with China (approximate date).
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Æthelstan, king of England (approximate date)
* Emma, queen of the West Frankish Kingdom (d. 934)
* Flodoard, Frankish canon and chronicler (or 893)
* Michael Maleinos, Byzantine nobleman and monk (d. 963)
* Matilda of Ringelheim, queen of Germany (approximate date)
* Minamoto no Tsunemoto, Japanese prince and samurai (d. 961)
* Ono no Michikaze, Japanese calligrapher (d. 966)

== Deaths ==
* April 8 – Adalelm, Frankish nobleman
* August 31 – Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Ta&#x27;i, Muslim governor
* December 12 – Guy III, king of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor
* Ali ebn-e Sahl Esfahani, Persian mystic
* Cynemund, bishop of Hereford (approximate date)
* Dae Hyeonseok, king of Balhae (Korea)
* Deng Chuna, Chinese warlord and governor
* Ibn Abi al-Dunya, Muslim scholar

<text>Year 951 ([[Roman numerals|CMLI]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* King Berengar II of Italy seizes Liguria, with help from the feudal lord Oberto I. He reorganizes the territories south of the Po River, dividing them into three new marches (frontier districts), named after their respective margraves: the &quot;Marca Aleramica&quot;, the &quot;Marca Arduinica&quot;, and the &quot;Marca Obertenga&quot;. The last division consists of Lombardy with the cities of Genoa, Luni, Tortona, Parma, and Piacenza. Berengar forces Adelaide, the widow of Lothair II, to marry his son Adalbert. However, she fiercely refuses and Berengar has her imprisoned at Garda Castle. With the help of Count Adalbert Atto of Canossa Adelaide manages to escape.
* Fall – King Otto I crosses the Brenner Pass and takes his army into Italy. He is accompanied by his brothers, Henry I (duke of Bavaria), Bruno I, and Conrad the Red (duke of Lotharingia). Otto faces no opposition and they arrive in Pavia. Berengar II has departed the day before and entrenched himself in San Marino. Otto receives the homage of the Italian nobility, marries Adelaide, and declares himself &quot;King of the Lombards&quot;.
* Otto I dispatches an embassy to Rome to apply for an imperial coronation with Pope Agapetus II – but Prince Alberic II makes it clear that this is not possible (afraid of Otto&#x27;s growing power), and opposes the request.

==== China ====
* February 9 – The Northern Han Kingdom is founded by Liu Chong (called Shizu) in modern-day Shanxi who restores the diplomatic relations with the Khitans. Northern Han becomes a protectorate of the Liao dynasty.
* February 13 – Guo Wei, a court official, leads a military coup and declares himself emperor of the new Later Zhou. The 19-year-old Emperor Liu Chengyou is killed after a 3-year reign, ending the short-lived Later Han.
* Emperor Shi Zong successfully repels a Chinese advance from the south. In October he is killed by a rebellious nephew after a three year reign. Shi Zong is succeeded by his uncle Mu Zong as ruler of the Liao dynasty.
* November 16 – Emperor Li Jing sends a Southern Tang expeditionary force (10,000 men) under Bian Hao to conquer Chu. Li Jing removes the ruling family to his own capital in Nanjing, ending the Chu Kingdom.

Africa 

* Abd ar-Rahman III consolidated his grip on North Africa by occupying Tangier in 951.

* Abd ar-Rahman III signs a peace in 951 with the new king of León, Ordoño III, in order to have a free hand against the Fatimids, whose ships are harassing the caliphal fleet in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman&#x27;s force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieges the Fatimid port of Tunis, which purchases its safety through a huge sum.

<text>Sir Francis Walsingham ( – 6 April 1590) was principal secretary to Queen Elizabeth I of England from 20 December 1573 until his death and is popularly remembered as her &quot;spymaster&quot;.

Born to a well-connected family of gentry, Walsingham attended Cambridge University and travelled in continental Europe before embarking on a career in law at the age of twenty. A committed Protestant, during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I of England he joined other expatriates in exile in Switzerland and northern Italy until Mary&#x27;s death and the accession of her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth.

Walsingham rose from relative obscurity to become one of the small coterie who directed the Elizabethan state, overseeing foreign, domestic and religious policy. He served as English ambassador to France in the early 1570s and witnessed the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. As principal secretary, he supported exploration, colonization, the development of the navy, and the plantation of Ireland. He worked to bring Scotland and England together. Overall, his foreign policy demonstrated a new understanding of the role of England as a maritime Protestant power with intercontinental trading ties. He oversaw operations that penetrated Spanish military preparation, gathered intelligence from across Europe, disrupted a range of plots against Elizabeth and secured the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.

==Origins and early life==
Francis Walsingham was born around 1532, probably at Foots Cray, near Chislehurst in Kent, the only son of William Walsingham (died 1534), a successful and well-connected London lawyer who served as a member of the commission appointed to investigate the estates of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530. William&#x27;s elder brother was Sir Edmund Walsingham, Lieutenant of the Tower of London.

Francis&#x27;s mother was Joyce Denny, a daughter of the courtier Sir Edmund Denny of Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, and a sister of the courtier Sir Anthony Denny, the principal Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King Henry VIII. After the death of her first husband she married the courtier Sir John Carey in 1538. Carey&#x27;s brother William was the husband of Mary Boleyn, the elder sister of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII.

Of Francis&#x27;s five siblings, Mary married Sir Walter Mildmay, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer for over 20 years, and Elizabeth married the parliamentarian Peter Wentworth.

Francis Walsingham matriculated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1548 with many other Protestants but as an undergraduate of high social status did not sit for a degree. From 1550 or 1551, he travelled in continental Europe, returning to England by 1552 to enrol at Gray&#x27;s Inn, one of the qualifying bodies for English lawyers.

Upon the death in 1553 of Henry VIII&#x27;s successor, Edward VI, Edward&#x27;s Catholic half-sister Mary became queen. Many wealthy Protestants, such as John Foxe and John Cheke, fled England, and Walsingham was among them. He continued his studies in law at the universities of Basel and Padua, where he was elected to the governing body by his fellow students in 1555.

==Rise to power==
Mary I died in November 1558 and was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth. Walsingham returned to England and through the support of one of his fellow former exiles, Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, he was elected to Elizabeth&#x27;s first parliament as the member for Bossiney, Cornwall, in 1559. At the subsequent election in 1563, he was returned for both Lyme Regis, Dorset, another constituency under Bedford&#x27;s influence, and Banbury, Oxfordshire. He chose to sit for Lyme Regis. In January 1562 he married Anne, daughter of Sir George Barne, Lord Mayor of London in 1552–3, and widow of wine merchant Alexander Carleill. Anne died two years later leaving her son Christopher Carleill in Walsingham&#x27;s care. In 1566, Walsingham married Ursula St. Barbe, widow of Sir Richard Worsley, and Walsingham acquired her estates of Appuldurcombe and Carisbrooke Priory on the Isle of Wight. The following year, they had a daughter, Frances. Walsingham&#x27;s other two stepsons, Ursula&#x27;s sons John and George, were killed in a gunpowder accident at Appuldurcombe in 1567.

In the following years, Walsingham became active in soliciting support for the Huguenots in France and developed a friendly and close working relationship with Nicholas Throckmorton, his predecessor as MP for Lyme Regis and a former ambassador to France. By 1569, Walsingham was working with William Cecil to counteract plots against Elizabeth. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Ridolfi plot, which hoped to replace Elizabeth with the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots. He is credited with writing propaganda decrying a conspiratorial marriage between Mary and Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and Roberto di Ridolfi, after whom the plot was named, was interrogated at Walsingham&#x27;s house.

In 1570, the Queen chose Walsingham to support the Huguenots in their negotiations with Charles IX of France. Later that year, he succeeded Sir Henry Norris as English ambassador in Paris. One of his duties was to continue negotiations for a marriage between Elizabeth and Charles IX&#x27;s younger brother Henry, Duke of Anjou. The marriage plan was eventually dropped on the grounds of Henry&#x27;s Catholicism. A substitute match with the youngest brother, Francis, Duke of Alençon, was proposed but Walsingham considered him ugly and &quot;void of a good humour&quot;. Elizabeth was 20 years older than Alençon, and was concerned that the age difference would be seen as absurd. Walsingham believed that it would serve England better to seek a military alliance with France against Spanish interests. The defensive Treaty of Blois was concluded between France and England in 1572, but the treaty made no provision for a royal marriage and left the question of Elizabeth&#x27;s successor open.

The Huguenots and other European Protestant interests supported the nascent revolt in the Spanish Netherlands, which were provinces of Habsburg Spain. When Catholic opposition to this course in France resulted in the death of Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny and the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, Walsingham&#x27;s house in Paris became a temporary sanctuary for Protestant refugees, including Philip Sidney. Ursula, who was pregnant, escaped to England with their four-year-old daughter. She gave birth to a second girl, Mary, in January 1573 while Walsingham was still in France. He returned to England in April 1573, having established himself as a competent official whom the Queen and Cecil could trust. He cultivated contacts throughout Europe, and a century later his dispatches would be published as &quot;The Complete Ambassador&quot;.

In the December following his return, Walsingham was appointed to the Privy Council of England and was made joint principal secretary (the position which later became &quot;Secretary of State&quot;) with Sir Thomas Smith. Smith retired in 1576, leaving Walsingham in effective control of the privy seal, though he was not formally invested as Lord Privy Seal. Walsingham acquired a Surrey county seat in Parliament from 1572 that he retained until his death, but he was not a major parliamentarian. He was knighted on 1 December 1577, and held the sinecure posts of Recorder of Colchester, &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; of Hampshire, and High Steward of Salisbury, Ipswich and Winchester. He was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter from 22 April 1578 until succeeded by Sir Amias Paulet in June 1587, when he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in addition to principal secretary.

==Secretary of State==
The duties of the principal secretary were not defined formally, but as he handled all royal correspondence and determined the agenda of council meetings, he could wield great influence in all matters of policy and in every field of government, both foreign and domestic. During his term of office, Walsingham supported the use of England&#x27;s maritime power to open new trade routes and explore the New World, and was at the heart of international affairs. He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and France, and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states.

Closely linked to the mercantile community, he actively supported trade promotion schemes and invested in the Muscovy Company and the Levant Company. He supported the attempts of John Davis and Martin Frobisher to discover the Northwest Passage and exploit the mineral resources of Labrador, and encouraged Humphrey Gilbert&#x27;s exploration of Newfoundland. Gilbert&#x27;s voyage was largely financed by recusant Catholics and Walsingham favoured the scheme as a potential means of removing Catholics from England by encouraging emigration to the New World. Walsingham was among the promoters of Francis Drake&#x27;s profitable 1578–1581 circumnavigation of the world, correctly judging that Spanish possessions in the Pacific were vulnerable to attack. The venture was calculated to promote the Protestant interest by embarrassing and weakening the Spanish, as well as to seize Spanish treasure. The first edition of Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principal Navigation, Voyages and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; was dedicated to Walsingham.

Walsingham advocated direct intervention in the Netherlands in support of the Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation, a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence.

Charles IX died in 1574 and the Duke of Anjou inherited the French throne as Henry III. Between 1578 and 1581 the Queen resurrected attempts to negotiate a marriage with Henry III&#x27;s youngest brother, the Duke of Alençon, who had put himself forward as a protector of the Huguenots and a potential leader of the Dutch. Walsingham was sent to France in mid-1581 to discuss an Anglo-French alliance, but the French wanted the marriage agreed first and Walsingham was under instruction to obtain a treaty before committing to the marriage. He returned to England without an agreement. Personally, Walsingham opposed the marriage, perhaps to the point of encouraging public opposition. Alençon was a Catholic and as his elder brother, Henry III, was childless, he was heir presumptive to the French throne. Elizabeth was past the age of childbearing and had no clear successor. If she died while married to him, her realms could fall under French control. By comparing the match of Elizabeth and Alençon with the match of the Protestant Henry of Navarre and the Catholic Margaret of Valois, which occurred in the week before the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, the &quot;most horrible spectacle&quot; he had ever witnessed, Walsingham raised the spectre of religious riots in England in the event of the marriage proceeding. Elizabeth put up with his blunt, often unwelcome, advice, and acknowledged his strong beliefs in a letter, in which she called him &quot;her Moor [who] cannot change his colour&quot;.

These were years of tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the unpredictable Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was compromised by his gambling debts, was in the pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may have been aware of Stafford&#x27;s duplicity, as he fed the ambassador false information, presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish.

The pro-English Regent of Scotland James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, whom Walsingham had supported, was overthrown in 1578. After the collapse of the Raid of Ruthven, another initiative to secure a pro-English government in Scotland, Walsingham reluctantly visited the Scottish court in August 1583, knowing that his diplomatic mission was unlikely to succeed. James VI dismissed Walsingham&#x27;s advice on domestic policy saying he was an &quot;absolute King&quot; in Scotland. Walsingham replied with a discourse on the topic that &quot;young princes were many times carried into great errors upon an opinion of the absoluteness of their royal authority and do not consider, that when they transgress the bounds and limits of the law, they leave to be kings and become tyrants.&quot; According to James Melville of Halhill, James VI intended to give Walsingham a valuable diamond ring as a parting gift, but James Stewart, Earl of Arran, who Walsingham had ignored, substituted a ring of crystal. A mutual defence pact was eventually agreed in the Treaty of Berwick of 1586.

Walsingham&#x27;s cousin Edward Denny fought in Ireland during the rebellion of the Earl of Desmond and was one of the English settlers granted land in Munster confiscated from Desmond. Walsingham&#x27;s stepson Christopher Carleill commanded the garrisons at Coleraine and Carrickfergus. Walsingham thought Irish farmland was underdeveloped and hoped that plantation would improve the productivity of estates. Tensions between the native Irish and the English settlers had lasting effects on the history of Ireland.

Walsingham&#x27;s younger daughter Mary died aged seven in July 1580; his elder daughter, Frances, married Sir Philip Sidney on 21 September 1583, despite the Queen&#x27;s initial objections to the match (for unknown reasons) earlier in the year. As part of the marriage agreement, Walsingham agreed to pay £1,500 of Sidney&#x27;s debts and gave his daughter and son-in-law the use of his manor at Barn Elms in Surrey. A granddaughter born in November 1585 was named Elizabeth after the Queen, who was one of two godparents along with Sidney&#x27;s uncle, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. The following year, Sidney was killed fighting the Spanish in the Netherlands and Walsingham was faced with paying off more of Sidney&#x27;s extensive debts. His widowed daughter gave birth, in a difficult delivery, to a second child shortly afterward, but the baby, a girl, was stillborn.

==Espionage==
Walsingham was driven by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism, and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and suspected conspirators. Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty on the basis of extracted evidence; he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581. Walsingham could never forget the atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England in the event of a Catholic resurgence. Walsingham&#x27;s brother-in-law Robert Beale, who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre, encapsulated Walsingham&#x27;s view: &quot;I think it time and more than time for us to awake out of our dead sleep, and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort as we shall not be able to escape.&quot; Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Walsingham&#x27;s staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas Phelippes, who was an expert in forgery and deciphering letters, and Arthur Gregory, who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection.

In May 1582, letters from the Spanish ambassador in England, Bernardino de Mendoza, to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster, who forwarded them to Walsingham. The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. By April 1583, Walsingham had a spy, identified as Giordano Bruno by historian John Bossy, deployed in the French embassy in London. Walsingham&#x27;s contact reported that Francis Throckmorton, a nephew of Walsingham&#x27;s old friend Nicholas Throckmorton, had visited the ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. In November 1583, after six months of surveillance, Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confession—an admission of guilt that clearly implicated Mendoza. The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and depose Elizabeth. Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England. Walsingham is often mentioned - negatively - in coded letters from Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French ambassador.

===Entrapment of Mary, Queen of Scots===
After the assassination in mid-1584 of William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch revolt against Spain, English military intervention in the Low Countries was agreed in the Treaties of Nonsuch of 1585. The murder of William the Silent also reinforced fears for Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s safety. Walsingham helped create the Bond of Association, the signatories of which promised to hunt down and kill anyone who conspired against Elizabeth. The Act for the Surety of the Queen&#x27;s Person, passed by Parliament in March 1585, set up a legal process for trying any claimant to the throne implicated in plots against the Queen. The following month Mary, Queen of Scots, was placed in the strict custody of Sir Amias Paulet, a friend of Walsingham. At Christmas, she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley. Walsingham instructed Paulet to open, read and pass to Mary unsealed any letters that she received, and to block any potential route for clandestine correspondence. In a successful attempt to entrap her, Walsingham arranged a single exception: a covert means for Mary&#x27;s letters to be smuggled in and out of Chartley in a beer keg. Mary was misled into thinking these secret letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham&#x27;s agents. In July 1586, Anthony Babington wrote to Mary about an impending plot to free her and kill Elizabeth. Mary&#x27;s reply was clearly encouraging and sanctioned Babington&#x27;s plans. Walsingham had Babington and his associates rounded up; fourteen were executed in September 1586. In October, Mary was put on trial under the Act for the Surety of the Queen&#x27;s Person in front of 36 commissioners, including Walsingham.

During the presentation of evidence against her, Mary broke down and pointed accusingly at Walsingham saying, &quot;all of this is the work of Monsieur de Walsingham for my destruction&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;God is my witness that as a private person I have done nothing unworthy of an honest man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my duty.&quot; Mary was found guilty and the warrant for her execution was drafted, but Elizabeth hesitated to sign it, despite pressure from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet urging him to find &quot;some way to shorten the life&quot; of Mary to relieve Elizabeth of the burden, to which Paulet replied indignantly, &quot;God forbid that I should make so foul a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot to my poor posterity, to shed blood without law or warrant.&quot; Walsingham made arrangements for Mary&#x27;s execution; Elizabeth signed the warrant on 1 February 1587 and entrusted it to William Davison, who had been appointed as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy council convened by Cecil without Elizabeth&#x27;s knowledge agreed to carry out the sentence as soon as was practical. Within a week, Mary was beheaded. On hearing of the execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have sanctioned the action and that she had not meant Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Walsingham&#x27;s share of Elizabeth&#x27;s displeasure was small because he was absent from court, at home ill, in the weeks just before and after the execution. Davison was eventually released in October 1588, on the orders of Cecil and Walsingham.

===Spanish Armada===
From 1586, Walsingham received many dispatches from his agents in mercantile communities and foreign courts detailing Spanish preparations for an invasion of England. Walsingham&#x27;s recruitment of Anthony Standen, a friend of the Tuscan ambassador to Madrid, was an exceptional intelligence triumph and Standen&#x27;s dispatches were deeply revealing. Walsingham worked to prepare England for a potential war with Spain, in particular by supervising the substantial rebuilding of Dover Harbour, and encouraging a more aggressive strategy. On Walsingham&#x27;s instructions, the English ambassador in Turkey, William Harborne, attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Ottoman Sultan to attack Spanish possessions in the Mediterranean in the hope of distracting Spanish forces. Walsingham supported Francis Drake&#x27;s raid of Cadiz in 1587, which wrought havoc with Spanish logistics. The Spanish Armada sailed for England in July 1588. Walsingham received regular dispatches from the English naval forces, and raised his own troop of 260 men as part of the land defences. On 18 August 1588, after the dispersal of the armada, naval commander Lord Henry Seymour wrote to Walsingham, &quot;you have fought more with your pen than many have in our English navy fought with their enemies&quot;.

In foreign intelligence, Walsingham&#x27;s extensive network of &quot;intelligencers&quot;, who passed on general news as well as secrets, spanned Europe and the Mediterranean. While foreign intelligence was a normal part of the principal secretary&#x27;s activities, Walsingham brought to it flair and ambition, and large sums of his own money. He cast his net more widely than others had done previously: expanding and exploiting links across the continent as well as in Constantinople and Algiers, and building and inserting contacts among Catholic exiles. Among his spies may have been the playwright Christopher Marlowe; Marlowe was in France in the mid-1580s and was acquainted with Walsingham&#x27;s kinsman Thomas Walsingham.

==Death and legacy==
From 1571 onwards, Walsingham complained of ill health and often retired to his country estate for periods of recuperation. He complained of &quot;sundry carnosities&quot;, pains in his head, stomach and back, and difficulty in passing urine. Suggested diagnoses include cancer, kidney stones, urinary infection, and diabetes. He died on 6 April 1590, at his house in Seething Lane. Historian William Camden wrote that Walsingham died from &quot;a carnosity growing &quot;intra testium tunicas&quot; [testicular cancer]&quot;. He was buried privately in a simple ceremony at 10 pm on the following day, beside his son-in-law, in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. His name appears on a modern monument in the crypt listing the important graves lost.

In his will, dated 12 December 1589, Walsingham complained of &quot;the greatness of my debts and the mean state [I] shall leave my wife and heirs in&quot;, but the true state of his finances is unclear. He received grants of land from the Queen, grants for the export of cloth and leases of customs in the northern and western ports. His primary residences, apart from the court, were in Seething Lane by the Tower of London (now the site of a Victorian office building called Walsingham House), at Barn Elms in Surrey and at Odiham in Hampshire. Nothing remains of any of his houses. He spent much of his own money on espionage in the service of the Queen and the Protestant cause. In 1586, he funded a lectureship in theology at Oxford University for the Puritan John Rainolds. He had underwritten the debts of his son-in-law, Sir Philip Sidney, had pursued the Sidney estate for recompense unsuccessfully and had carried out major land transactions in his later years. After his death, his friends reflected that poor bookkeeping had left him further in the Crown&#x27;s debt than was fair. In 1611, the Crown&#x27;s debts to him were calculated at over £48,000, but his debts to the Crown were calculated at over £43,000 and a judge, Sir Julius Caesar, ordered both sets of debts cancelled &quot;quid pro quo&quot;. Walsingham&#x27;s surviving daughter Frances received a £300 annuity, and married the Earl of Essex. Ursula, Lady Walsingham, continued to live at Barn Elms with a staff of servants until her death in 1602.

Protestants lauded Walsingham as &quot;a sound pillar of our commonwealth and chief patron of virtue, learning and chivalry&quot;. He was part of a Protestant intelligentsia that included Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser and John Dee: men who promoted an expansionist and nationalist English Renaissance. Spenser included a dedicatory sonnet to Walsingham in the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;, likening him to Maecenas who introduced Virgil to the Emperor Augustus. After Walsingham&#x27;s death, Sir John Davies composed an acrostic poem in his memory and Watson wrote an elegy, &quot;Meliboeus&quot;, in Latin. On the other hand, Jesuit Robert Persons thought Walsingham &quot;cruel and inhumane&quot; in his persecution of Catholics. Catholic sources portray a ruthless, devious man driven by religious intolerance and an excessive love for intrigue. Walsingham attracts controversy still. Although he was ruthless, his opponents on the Catholic side were no less so; the treatment of prisoners and suspects by Tudor authorities was typical of European governments of the time. Walsingham&#x27;s personal, as opposed to his public, character is elusive; his public papers were seized by the government while many of his private papers, which might have revealed much, were lost. The fragments that do survive demonstrate his personal interest in gardening and falconry.

===Portrayal in fiction===
Fictional portrayals of Walsingham tend to follow Catholic interpretations, depicting him as sinister and Machiavellian. He features in conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Christopher Marlowe, whom he predeceased. Charles Nicholl examined (and rejected) such theories in &quot;The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe&quot; (1992), which was used as a source by Anthony Burgess for his novel &quot;A Dead Man in Deptford&quot; (1993).

The 1998 film &quot;Elizabeth&quot; gives considerable, although sometimes historically inaccurate, prominence to Walsingham (portrayed by Geoffrey Rush). It fictionalizes him as irreligious and sexually ambiguous, merges chronologically distant events, and inaccurately suggests that he murdered Mary of Guise. Rush reprised the role in the 2007 sequel, &quot;&quot;. Both Stephen Murray in the 1971 BBC series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; and Patrick Malahide in the 2005 Channel Four miniseries &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; play him as a dour official.

<text>A poison is any chemical substance that is harmful or lethal to living organisms. The term is used in a wide range of scientific fields and industries, where it is often specifically defined. It may also be applied colloquially or figuratively, with a broad sense. 

Whether something is considered a poison or not may depend on the amount, the circumstances, and what living things are present. Poisoning could be accidental or deliberate, and if the cause can be identified there may be ways to neutralise the effects or minimise the symptoms.

In biology, a poison is a chemical substance causing death, injury or harm to organisms or their parts. In medicine, poisons are a kind of toxin that are delivered passively, not actively. In industry the term may be negative, something to be removed to make a thing safe, or positive, an agent to limit unwanted pests. In ecological terms, poisons introduced into the environment can later cause unwanted effects elsewhere, or in other parts of the food chain.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;poison&quot; was first used in 1200 to mean &quot;a deadly potion or substance&quot;; the English term comes from the &quot;...Old French poison, puison (12c., Modern French poison) &quot;a drink&quot;, especially a medical drink, later &quot;a (magic) potion, poisonous drink&quot; (14c.), from Latin potionem (nominative potio) &quot;a drinking, a drink&quot;, also &quot;poisonous drink&quot; (Cicero), from potare &quot;to drink&quot;. The use of &quot;poison&quot; as an adjective (&quot;poisonous&quot;) dates from the 1520s. Using the word &quot;poison&quot; with plant names dates from the 18th century. The term &quot;poison ivy&quot;, for example, was first used in 1784 and the term &quot;poison oak&quot; was first used in 1743. The term &quot;poison gas&quot; was first used in 1915.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;poison&quot; is often used colloquially to describe any harmful substance—particularly corrosive substances, carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens and harmful pollutants, and to exaggerate the dangers of chemicals. Paracelsus (1493–1541), the father of toxicology, once wrote: &quot;Everything is poison, there is poison in everything. Only the dose makes a thing not a poison&quot;
(see median lethal dose). The term &quot;poison&quot; is also used in a figurative sense: &quot;His brother&#x27;s presence poisoned the atmosphere at the party&quot;. The law defines &quot;poison&quot; more strictly. Substances not legally required to carry the label &quot;poison&quot; can also cause a medical condition of poisoning.

Some poisons are also toxins, which is any poison produced by an organism, such as the bacterial proteins that cause tetanus and botulism. A distinction between the two terms is not always observed, even among scientists. The derivative forms &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;poisonous&quot; are synonymous. Animal poisons delivered subcutaneously (e.g., by sting or bite) are also called &quot;venom&quot;. In normal usage, a poisonous organism is one that is harmful to consume, but a venomous organism uses venom to kill its prey or defend itself while still alive. A single organism can be both poisonous and venomous, but it is rare.

All living things produce substances to protect them from getting eaten, so the term &quot;poison&quot; is usually only used for substances which are poisonous to humans, while substances that mainly are poisonous to a common pathogen to the organism and humans are considered antibiotics. Bacteria are for example a common adversary for &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot; mold and humans, and since the mold&#x27;s poison only targets bacteria, humans use it for getting rid of it in their bodies. Human antimicrobial peptides which are toxic to viruses, fungi, bacteria, and cancerous cells are considered a part of the immune system.

In nuclear physics, a poison is a substance that obstructs or inhibits a nuclear reaction.

Environmentally hazardous substances are not necessarily poisons, and vice versa. For example, food-industry wastewater—which may contain potato juice or milk—can be hazardous to the ecosystems of streams and rivers by consuming oxygen and causing eutrophication, but is nonhazardous to humans and not classified as a poison.

Biologically speaking, any substance, if given in large enough amounts, is poisonous and can cause death. For instance, several kilograms worth of water would constitute a lethal dose. Many substances used as medications—such as fentanyl—have an only one order of magnitude greater than the ED50. An alternative classification distinguishes between lethal substances that provide a therapeutic value and those that do not.

==Modern definitions==
In broad metaphorical (colloquial) usage of the term, &quot;poison&quot; may refer to anything deemed harmful.

In biology, poisons are substances that can cause death, injury, or harm to organs, tissues, cells, and DNA usually by chemical reactions or other activity on the molecular scale, when an organism is exposed to a sufficient quantity.

Medicinal fields (particularly veterinary medicine) and zoology often distinguish poisons from &quot;toxins&quot; and &quot;venoms&quot;. Both poisons and venoms are toxins, which are toxicants produced by organisms in nature. The difference between venom and poison is the delivery method of the toxin. Venoms are toxins that are actively delivered by being injected via a bite or sting through a &quot;venom apparatus&quot;, such as fangs or a stinger, in a process called envenomation, whereas poisons are toxins that are passively delivered by being swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Unantidoteable refers to toxins that cannot be neutralized by modern medical technology, regardless of their type.

==Uses==
Industry, agriculture, and other sectors employ many poisonous substances, usually for reasons other than their toxicity to humans. Examples include medicines (e.g. anthelmintics used on chickens), solvents (e.g. rubbing alcohol, turpentine), cleaners (e.g. bleach, ammonia), coatings (e.g. arsenic wallpaper), and feedstocks. The toxicity itself sometimes has economic value, when it serves agricultural purposes of weed control and pest control. Most poisonous industrial compounds have associated material safety data sheets and are classified as hazardous substances. Hazardous substances are subject to extensive regulation on production, procurement, and use in overlapping domains of occupational safety and health, public health, drinking water quality standards, air pollution, and environmental protection. Due to the mechanics of molecular diffusion, many poisonous compounds rapidly diffuse into biological tissues, air, water, or soil on a molecular scale. By the principle of entropy, chemical contamination is typically costly or infeasible to reverse, unless specific chelating agents or micro-filtration processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision.

Pesticides are one group of substances whose prime purpose is their toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches). Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs and snails). Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds, which consume insects as a primary food source. Selective toxicity, controlled application, and controlled biodegradation are major challenges in herbicide and pesticide development and in chemical engineering generally, as all lifeforms on earth share an underlying biochemistry; organisms exceptional in their environmental resilience are classified as extremophiles, these for the most part exhibiting radically different susceptibilities.

==Ecological lifetime==
A poison which enters the food chain—whether of industrial, agricultural, or natural origin—might not be immediately toxic to the first organism that ingests the toxin, but can become further concentrated in predatory organisms further up the food chain, particularly carnivores and omnivores, especially concerning fat soluble poisons which tend to become stored in biological tissue rather than excreted in urine or other water-based effluents.

Apart from food, many poisons readily enter the body through the skin and lungs. Hydrofluoric acid is a notorious contact poison, in addition to its corrosive damage. Naturally occurring sour gas is a fast-acting atmospheric poison, which can be released by volcanic activity or drilling rigs. Plant-based contact irritants, such as that possessed by poison ivy, are often classed as allergens rather than poisons; the effect of an allergen being not a poison as such, but to turn the body&#x27;s natural defenses against itself. Poison can also enter the body through faulty medical implants, or by injection (which is the basis of lethal injection in the context of capital punishment).

In 2013, 3.3 million cases of unintentional human poisonings occurred. This resulted in 98,000 deaths worldwide, down from 120,000 deaths in 1990. In modern society, cases of suspicious death elicit the attention of the Coroner&#x27;s office and forensic investigators.

Of increasing concern since the isolation of natural radium by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898—and the subsequent advent of nuclear physics and nuclear technologies—are radiological poisons. These are associated with ionizing radiation, a mode of toxicity quite distinct from chemically active poisons. In mammals, chemical poisons are often passed from mother to offspring through the placenta during gestation, or through breast milk during nursing. In contrast, radiological damage can be passed from mother or father to offspring through genetic mutation, which—if not fatal in miscarriage or childhood, or a direct cause of infertility—can then be passed along again to a subsequent generation. Atmospheric radon is a natural radiological poison of increasing impact since humans moved from hunter-gatherer lifestyles and cave dwelling to increasingly enclosed structures able to contain radon in dangerous concentrations. The 2006 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko was a notable use of radiological assassination, presumably meant to evade the normal investigation of chemical poisons.

Poisons widely dispersed into the environment are known as pollution. These are often of human origin, but pollution can also include unwanted biological processes such as toxic red tide, or acute changes to the natural chemical environment attributed to invasive species, which are toxic or detrimental to the prior ecology (especially if the prior ecology was associated with human economic value or an established industry such as shellfish harvesting).

The scientific disciplines of ecology and environmental resource management study the environmental life cycle of toxic compounds and their complex, diffuse, and highly interrelated effects.

==Poisoning==

Poisoning can be either acute or chronic, and caused by a variety of natural or synthetic substances. Substances that destroy tissue but do not absorb, such as lye, are classified as corrosives rather than poisons.

=== Acute ===
Acute poisoning is exposure to a poison on one occasion or during a short period of time. Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure. Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning. Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones, although they can cause severe illness or even death. Poisoning can be caused by excessive consumption of generally safe substances, as in the case of water intoxication.

Agents that act on the nervous system can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived neurotoxins and so-called nerve gases, which may be synthesized for warfare or industry.

Inhaled or ingested cyanide, used as a method of execution in gas chambers, or as a suicide method, almost instantly starves the body of energy by inhibiting the enzymes in mitochondria that make ATP. Intravenous injection of an unnaturally high concentration of potassium chloride, such as in the execution of prisoners in parts of the United States, quickly stops the heart by eliminating the cell potential necessary for muscle contraction.

Most biocides, including pesticides, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms (secondary poisoning), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as &quot;harmful&quot; (EU).

Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by toxication. An example is &quot;wood alcohol&quot; or methanol, which is not poisonous itself, but is chemically converted to toxic formaldehyde and formic acid in the liver. Many drug molecules are made toxic in the liver, and the genetic variability of certain liver enzymes makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between individuals.

Exposure to radioactive substances can produce radiation poisoning, an unrelated phenomenon.

Two common cases of acute natural poisoning are theobromine poisoning of dogs and cats, and mushroom poisoning in humans. Dogs and cats are not natural herbivores, but a chemical defense developed by &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; can be incidentally fatal nevertheless. Many omnivores, including humans, readily consume edible fungi, and thus many fungi have evolved to become decisively inedible, in this case as a direct defense.

=== Chronic ===

Chronic poisoning is long-term repeated or continuous exposure to a poison where symptoms do not occur immediately or after each exposure. The person gradually becomes ill, or becomes ill after a long latent period. Chronic poisoning most commonly occurs following exposure to poisons that bioaccumulate, or are biomagnified, such as mercury, gadolinium, and lead.

==Management==
* Initial management for all poisonings includes ensuring adequate cardiopulmonary function and providing treatment for any symptoms such as seizures, shock, and pain.
* Injected poisons (e.g., from the sting of animals) can be treated by binding the affected body part with a pressure bandage and placing the affected body part in hot water (with a temperature of 50 °C). The pressure bandage prevents the poison being pumped throughout the body, and the hot water breaks it down. This treatment, however, only works with poisons composed of protein-molecules.
* In the majority of poisonings the mainstay of management is providing supportive care for the patient, i.e., treating the symptoms rather than the poison.

===Decontamination===
* Treatment of a recently ingested poison may involve gastric decontamination to decrease absorption. Gastric decontamination can involve activated charcoal, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or nasogastric aspiration. Routine use of emetics (syrup of Ipecac), cathartics or laxatives are no longer recommended.
** Activated charcoal is the treatment of choice to prevent poison absorption. It is usually administered when the patient is in the emergency room or by a trained emergency healthcare provider such as a Paramedic or EMT. However, charcoal is ineffective against metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and alcohols and glycols; it is also not recommended for ingestion of corrosive chemicals such as acids and alkalis.
** Cathartics were postulated to decrease absorption by increasing the expulsion of the poison from the gastrointestinal tract. There are two types of cathartics used in poisoned patients; saline cathartics (sodium sulfate, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate) and saccharide cathartics (sorbitol). They do not appear to improve patient outcome and are no longer recommended.
** Emesis (i.e. induced by ipecac) is no longer recommended in poisoning situations, because vomiting is ineffective at removing poisons.
** Gastric lavage, commonly known as a stomach pump, is the insertion of a tube into the stomach, followed by administration of water or saline down the tube. The liquid is then removed along with the contents of the stomach. Lavage has been used for many years as a common treatment for poisoned patients. However, a recent review of the procedure in poisonings suggests no benefit. It is still sometimes used if it can be performed within 1 hour of ingestion and the exposure is potentially life-threatening.
** Nasogastric aspiration involves the placement of a tube via the nose down into the stomach, the stomach contents are then removed by suction. This procedure is mainly used for liquid ingestions where activated charcoal is ineffective, e.g. ethylene glycol poisoning.
** Whole bowel irrigation cleanses the bowel. This is achieved by giving the patient large amounts of a polyethylene glycol solution. The osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol solution is not absorbed into the body, having the effect of flushing out the entire gastrointestinal tract. Its major uses are to treat ingestion of sustained release drugs, toxins not absorbed by activated charcoal (e.g., lithium, iron), and for removal of ingested drug packets (body packing/smuggling).

===Enhanced excretion===
* In some situations elimination of the poison can be enhanced using diuresis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hyperbaric medicine, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusion or chelation. However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.

==Epidemiology==
In 2010, poisoning resulted in about 180,000 deaths down from 200,000 in 1990. There were approximately 727,500 emergency department visits in the United States involving poisonings—3.3% of all injury-related encounters.

== Applications ==
Poisonous compounds may be useful either for their toxicity, or, more often, because of another chemical property, such as specific chemical reactivity. Poisons are widely used in industry and agriculture, as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, e.g. carbon monoxide, methanol and sodium cyanide, respectively. They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as ammonia and methanol. For instance, phosgene is a highly reactive nucleophile acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for polymerizing diols and diamines to produce polycarbonate and polyurethane plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic. In fact, phosgene has been used as a chemical weapon. It can be contrasted with mustard gas, which has only been produced for chemical weapons uses, as it has no particular industrial use.

Biocides need not be poisonous to humans, because they can target metabolic pathways absent in humans, leaving only incidental toxicity. For instance, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a mimic of a plant growth hormone, which causes uncontrollable growth leading to the death of the plant. Humans and animals, lacking this hormone and its receptor, are unaffected by this, and need to ingest relatively large doses before any toxicity appears. Human toxicity is, however, hard to avoid with pesticides targeting mammals, such as rodenticides.

The risk from toxicity is also distinct from toxicity itself. For instance, the preservative thiomersal used in vaccines is toxic, but the quantity administered in a single shot is negligible.

==History==

Throughout human history, intentional application of poison has been used as a method of murder, pest-control, suicide, and execution. As a method of execution, poison has been ingested, as the ancient Athenians did (see Socrates), inhaled, as with carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide (see gas chamber), injected (see lethal injection), or even as an enema. Poison&#x27;s lethal effect can be combined with its allegedly magical powers; an example is the Chinese &quot;gu&quot; poison. Poison was also employed in gunpowder warfare. For example, the 14th-century Chinese text of the &quot;Huolongjing&quot; written by Jiao Yu outlined the use of a poisonous gunpowder mixture to fill cast iron grenade bombs.

While arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental poison, its artificial concentrate was once nicknamed inheritance powder. In Medieval Europe, it was common for monarchs to employ personal food tasters to thwart royal assassination, in the dawning age of the Apothecary.

==Figurative use==
The term poison is also used in a figurative sense. The slang sense of alcoholic drink is first attested 1805, American English (e.g., a bartender might ask a customer &quot;what&#x27;s your poison?&quot; or &quot;Pick your poison&quot;).
Figurative use of the term dates from the late 15th century. Figuratively referring to persons as poison dates from 1910. The figurative term poison pen letter became well known in 1913 by a notorious criminal case in Pennsylvania, U.S.; the phrase dates to 1898.

<text>Charles VII (6 August 1697 – 20 January 1745) was elector of Bavaria from 26 February 1726 and Holy Roman Emperor from 24 January 1742 to his death. He was also King of Bohemia (as Charles Albert) from 1741 to 1743. Charles was a member of the House of Wittelsbach, and his reign as Holy Roman Emperor thus marked the end of three centuries of uninterrupted Habsburg imperial rule, although he was related to the Habsburgs by both blood and marriage.

Charles was the eldest son of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria and the Polish princess Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska. He became elector following the death of his father in 1726. In 1722, Charles married Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and niece of Emperor Charles VI. The couple had seven children together. After Charles VI died in 1740, Elector Charles claimed the Archduchy of Austria and briefly gained hold of the Bohemian throne. In 1742, he was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled until his death three years later.

==Early life and career==

Charles (Albert) () was born in Brussels and the son of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, daughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland.

His family was politically divided during the War of the Spanish Succession, and he spent many years under house arrest in Austria. The royal family had left Brussels and returned to Munich in 1701. His father, Maximilian Emanuel, fled to the Spanish Netherlands after he had been defeated at the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704, and Charles and his siblings stayed with their mother, the acting Regent, in Munich. In May 1705, after a stay in Venice, the Austrian authorities refused to allow the Electress to return to Bavaria and forced her into exile, which lasted ten years. Maximilian Emanuel went also into exile to Compiègne after on 29 April 1706, an Imperial ban was imposed on him, as he again had been defeated at the Battle of Ramillies a few days earlier. Only in 1715 was the family reconciled. After reaching his majority in August 1715, Charles undertook an educational tour to Italy from 3 December 1715 to 24 August 1716. In 1717, he served among Bavarian auxiliaries in the Austro-Turkish War.

On 5 October 1722, Charles married Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, whom he had met at the imperial court in Vienna. She was the youngest daughter of the late Emperor Joseph I and his wife, Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Bavaria had renounced all claims to the throne via the marriage, but it provided the legal basis to the inheritance of certain Austrian possessions.

In 1725, Charles visited Versailles during the wedding celebrations of Louis XV of France and established a personal contact with the French court.

In 1726, after his father had died, Charles became Duke of Bavaria and Elector Palatine and thus one of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire, and he also inherited a debt of 26 million guilders. He maintained good relations with both his Habsburg relatives and France, continuing his father&#x27;s policies.

In 1729, he instituted the knightly Order of St George and ordered the beginning of the construction of the Rothenberg Fortress.

==Holy Roman Emperor==

In continuance of the policy of his father, Charles aspired to an even higher rank. As son-in-law of Emperor Joseph I, Charles rejected the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and claimed the German territories of the Habsburg dynasty against Maria Theresa, daughter of Emperor Charles VI, in 1740. By the Treaty of Nymphenburg, which was concluded in July 1741, Charles became allied with France and Spain against Austria.

During the War of the Austrian Succession, Charles invaded Upper Austria in 1741 and planned to conquer Vienna, but his allied French troops under the Duc de Belle-Isle were instead redirected to Bohemia, capturing Prague in November 1741. That meant that Charles was crowned king of Bohemia in Prague on 19 December 1741, when the Habsburgs had not yet been defeated. He was unanimously elected king of Germany on 24 January 1742 and became Holy Roman emperor upon his coronation on 12 February 1742. His brother Clement August, the archbishop-elector of Cologne, generally sided with the Habsburg-Lorraine faction in the disputes over the Habsburg succession but cast his vote for him and personally crowned him emperor at Frankfurt. King George II of Great Britain, as the elector of Hanover, also voted to install Charles as emperor even though both Britain and Hanover were allied with Austria in the ongoing war. Charles VII was the second Wittelsbach emperor after Louis IV and the first Wittelsbach king of Germany since the reign of Rupert.

Shortly after his coronation, most of Charles&#x27;s territories were overrun by the Austrians, and Bavaria was occupied by the troops of Maria Theresa. The Emperor fled Munich and resided for almost three years in the &quot;Palais Barckhaus&quot; in Frankfurt. Most of Bohemia was lost in December 1742, when the Austrians allowed the French under the Duc de Belle-Isle and the Duc de Broglie an honourable capitulation. Charles was mocked as an emperor who neither controlled his own realm nor was in effective control of the empire itself, but the institution of the Holy Roman emperor had largely become symbolic in nature and powerless by then. A popular Latin saying about him was &quot;et caesar et nihil&quot;, meaning &quot;both emperor and nothing&quot;, a word play on &quot;aut caesar aut nihil&quot;, meaning &quot;either emperor or nothing&quot;. Bavarian General Ignaz Felix, Count of Törring-Jettenbach was compared to a drum, as people &quot;heard about him only when he was beaten&quot;.

Charles VII tried to boost his prestige from Frankfurt with numerous legal acts, such as granting imperial privilege to the University of Erlangen in 1743 and creating several new imperial nobles. Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg, was declared to be of full age in 1744, ahead of time. Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis served as Principal Commissioner for Charles VII at the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg and in 1744 the Thurn und Taxis dynasty were appointed the hereditary Postmasters General of the Imperial Reichspost.

The new commander of the Bavarian army, Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff, fought Austria in a series of battles in 1743 and 1744. In 1743, his troops and their allies took Bavaria, and Charles was able to return to Munich in April for some time before losing Bavaria again after his French allies were defeated and withdrew to the Rhine. Frederick II of Prussia&#x27;s new campaign during the Second Silesian War finally forced the Austrian army to leave Bavaria and to retreat into Bohemia. In October 1744, Charles regained Munich and returned, this time for good. With former Vice-Chancellor Friedrich Karl von Schönborn as a go-between, the Emperor then sought to reach a compromise with Vienna but failed to get more military support from France.

Suffering severely from gout, Charles died at Nymphenburg Palace in January 1745. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich. His heart was separately buried in the Shrine of Our Lady of Altötting. Georg Philipp Telemann composed his requiem &quot;I was Hoping for Light&quot;. King Frederick the Great of Prussia wrote in 1746, &quot;This death robbed me of the emperor, who was my friend&quot;.

Charles&#x27; brother Klemens August was more pro-Austrian, and Charles&#x27; son and successor Maximilian III Joseph made peace with Austria. With the Treaty of Füssen, Austria recognized the legitimacy of Charles&#x27;s election as Holy Roman Emperor.

==Cultural legacy==
Charles VII&#x27;s reign represented the height of the Bavarian Rococo era. The Nymphenburg Palace was completed during his reign. The Grand Circle (&quot;Schlossrondell&quot;), which is flanked by a string of elaborate Baroque mansions was initially planned as a basic blueprint for a new city (&quot;Carlstadt&quot;), but that was not achieved. Charles VII resided in Nymphenburg, and the palace became the favorite summer residence of the future rulers of Bavaria. Charles effected the building of the Ancestral Gallery and the Ornate Rooms at the Munich Residenz. He purchased the Palais Porcia in 1731 and had the mansion restored in Rococo style in 1736 for one of his mistresses, Countess Topor-Morawitzka. The mansion was named after her husband, Prince Porcia. He also ordered François de Cuvilliés, chief architect of the court, to build the Palais Holnstein for another one of his mistresses, Sophie Caroline von Ingenheim, Countess Holnstein, between 1733 and 1737. Cuvilliés constructed the Amalienburg as well for Charles and his wife, Maria Amalia, an elaborate hunting lodge designed in the Rococo style between 1734 and 1739 in the Nymphenburg Palace Park.

During Charles&#x27;s reign, numerous accomplished Italian, French, Bavarian, and other German architects, sculptors, painters and artisans were employed in royal service, often for many years. Among them were Dominique Girard, François de Cuvilliés, Joseph Effner, Ignaz Günther, Johann Michael Fischer, Cosmas Damian Asam and Egid Quirin Asam, Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, Matthäus Günther, Johann Baptist Straub and Johann Baptist Zimmermann.

==Children==
Charles and his wife, Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, were parents of seven children:

===Illegitimate children===
Charles Albert and his mistress Sophie Caroline von Ingenheim had a son:
* Franz Ludwig, Count of Holnstein (4 October 1723 – 22 May 1780) ∞ Anna Marie zu Löwenfeld (1735–1783), daughter of Clemens August of Bavaria. He had issue:
** Maximilian Joseph, Count of Holnstein, married to Princess Maria Josepha of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst (1774–1824), daughter of Prince Charles Albert II.

<text>A pipeline is a system of pipes for long-distance transportation of a liquid or gas, typically to a market area for consumption. The latest data from 2014 gives a total of slightly less than of pipeline in 120 countries around the world. The United States had 65%, Russia had 8%, and Canada had 3%, thus 76% of all pipeline were in these three countries. The main attribute to pollution from pipelines is caused by corrosion and leakage.

&quot;Pipeline and Gas Journal&quot;″s worldwide survey figures indicate that of pipelines are planned and under construction. Of these, represent projects in the planning and design phase; reflect pipelines in various stages of construction. Liquids and gases are transported in pipelines, and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline.

Pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum, fuels – such as oil, natural gas and biofuels – and other fluids including sewage, slurry, water, beer, hot water or steam for shorter distances and even pneumatic systems which allow for the generation of suction pressure for useful work and in transporting solid objects. Pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills, or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation, pollution, or environmental impact. Oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are pressurized into liquids known as natural gas liquids (NGLs). Natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel. Hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe. Pipelines are one of the safest ways of transporting materials as compared to road or rail, and hence in war, pipelines are often the target of military attacks.

==Oil and natural gas==



It is well documented when the first crude oil pipeline was built. Credit for the development of pipeline transport belongs indisputably to the Oil Transport Association, which first constructed a wrought iron pipeline over a track from an oil field in Pennsylvania to a railroad station in Oil Creek, in the 1860s. Some of the first major submarine pipelines were constructed across the English Channel in 1944 during Operation Pluto. These provided an estimated 8 per cent of all petroleum products used by the Allies on the Western Front between the Normandy landings and the end of Second World War.

Pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil, refined oil products or natural gas over land. For example, in 2014, pipeline transport of crude oil cost about $5 per barrel, while rail transport cost about $10 to $15 per barrel. Trucking has even higher costs due to the additional labor required; employment on completed pipelines represents only &quot;1% of that of the trucking industry.&quot;.

In the United States, 70% of crude oil and petroleum products are shipped by pipeline. (23% are by ship, 4% by truck, and 3% by rail) In Canada for natural gas and petroleum products, 97% are shipped by pipeline.

Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurized into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Small NGL processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of , can be shipped by rail, truck or pipeline. Propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch. EG: Propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure, 100 psi, give or take depending on temperature, and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than at retail stations. Pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at .

The distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter, as thousands of natural-gas processing plants are located in or near oil fields. Many Bakken Basin oil companies in North Dakota, Montana, Manitoba and Saskatchewan gas fields separate the NGLs in the field, allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers, eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane.

The most recent major pipeline to start operating in North America is a TransCanada natural gas line going north across the Niagara region bridges. This gas line carries Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania and other tied in methane or natural gas sources into the Canadian province of Ontario. It began operations in the fall of 2012, supplying 16 percent of all the natural gas used in Ontario.

This new US-supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to Ontario from western Canada in Alberta and Manitoba, thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer. To avoid delays and US government regulation, many small, medium and large oil producers in North Dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to Canada to meet up with a Canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east. This allows the Bakken Basin and Three Forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the US. The distance from the biggest oil patch in North Dakota, in Williston, North Dakota, is only about 85 miles or 137 kilometers to the Canada–US border and Manitoba. Mutual funds and joint ventures are the largest investors in new oil and gas pipelines. In the fall of 2012, the US began exporting propane to Europe, known as LPG, as wholesale prices there are much higher than in North America. Additionally, a pipeline is currently being constructed from North Dakota to Illinois, commonly known as the Dakota Access Pipeline.

As more North American pipelines are built, even more exports of LNG, propane, butane, and other natural gas products occur on all three US coasts. To give insight, North Dakota Bakken region&#x27;s oil production has grown by 600% from 2007 to 2015. North Dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price, and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery. However, pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume.

Enbridge in Canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from east-to-west (Line 9) and expanding it and using it to ship western Canadian bitumen oil eastward. From a presently rated 250,000 barrels equivalent per day pipeline, it will be expanded to between 1.0 and 1.3 million barrels per day. It will bring western oil to refineries in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Quebec and New York by early 2014. New Brunswick will also refine some of this western Canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to Europe from its deep water oil ULCC loading port.

Although pipelines can be built under the sea, that process is economically and technically demanding, so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships. Similarly, it is often more economically feasible to transport natural gas in the form of LNG, however the break-even point between LNG and pipelines would depend on the volume of natural gas and the distance it travels.

===Growth of market===
The market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in 2008. After faltering in 2009, demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew. By 2012, almost 32,000 miles (51500 km) of North American pipeline were being planned or under construction. When pipelines are constrained, additional pipeline product transportation options may include the use of drag reducing agents, or by transporting product via truck or rail.

===Construction and operation===
Oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from . Most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about . To protect pipes from impact, abrasion, and corrosion, a variety of methods are used. These can include wood lagging (wood slats), concrete coating, rockshield, high-density polyethylene, imported sand padding, sacrificial cathodes and padding machines.

Crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline. Often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging, the practice of using devices known as &quot;pigs&quot; to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline. The devices are also known as &quot;scrapers&quot; or &quot;Go-devils&quot;. &quot;Smart pigs&quot; (also known as &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; pigs) are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents, metal loss caused by corrosion, cracking or other mechanical damage. These devices are launched from pig-launcher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station down-stream, either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line.

For natural gas, pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from in diameter, depending on the type of pipeline. The gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority.

==Ammonia==
A major ammonia pipeline is the Ukrainian &quot;Transammiak&quot; line connecting the TogliattiAzot facility in Russia to the exporting Black Sea-port of Odesa.

==Alcohol fuels==

Pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in Brazil, and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in Brazil and the United States. The main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines, which are not problems with oil and natural gas. Insufficient volumes and cost-effectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines.

In the US minimal amounts of ethanol are transported by pipeline. Most ethanol is shipped by rail, the main alternatives being truck and barge. Delivering ethanol by pipeline is the most desirable option, but ethanol&#x27;s affinity for water and solvent properties require the use of a dedicated pipeline, or significant cleanup of existing pipelines.

==Coal and ore==
Slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines. The material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline; at the far end, the material must be dried. One example is a slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine (producing 26.5 million tonnes per year) to the Port of Açu in Brazil. An existing example is the Savage River Slurry pipeline in Tasmania, Australia, possibly the world&#x27;s first when it was built in 1967. It includes a bridge span at above the Savage River.

==Hydrogen==

Hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand, with transport costs similar to CNG, the technology is proven. Most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every 50 to an industrial production facility. The 1938 Rhine-Ruhr hydrogen pipeline is still in operation. , there are of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the US and in Europe.

==Water==


Two millennia ago, the ancient Romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination. Hundreds of these were built throughout Europe and elsewhere, and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the Roman Empire. The ancient Chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works. The famous Han dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189 AD) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside the capital city of Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system.

Pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills, or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation, pollution, or environmental impact.

The Goldfields Water Supply Scheme in Western Australia using 750 mm (30 inch) pipe and completed in 1903 was the largest water supply scheme of its time.

Examples of significant water pipelines in South Australia are the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline (completed 1944) and Mannum-Adelaide pipeline (completed 1955) pipelines, both part of the larger Snowy Mountains scheme.

Two Los Angeles, California aqueducts, the Owens Valley aqueduct (completed 1913) and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct (completed 1970), include extensive use of pipelines.

The Great Manmade River of Libya supplies of water each day to Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte, and several other cities in Libya. The pipeline is over long, and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over underground.

==Other systems==

===District heating===

District heating or &quot;teleheating&quot; systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water, pressurized hot water, or sometimes steam to the customer. While steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature, it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway&#x27;s district heating network.

District heating pipelines are normally installed underground, with some exceptions. Within the system, heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands. Heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations, without mixing of the fluids in either system.

===Beer===
Bars in the Veltins-Arena, a major football ground in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, are interconnected by a long beer pipeline. In Randers city in Denmark, the so-called Thor Beer pipeline was operated. Originally, copper pipes ran directly from the brewery, but when the brewery moved out of the city in the 1990s, Thor Beer replaced it with a giant tank.

A three-kilometer beer pipeline was completed in Bruges, Belgium in September 2016 to reduce truck traffic on the city streets.

===Brine===
The village of Hallstatt in Austria, which is known for its long history of salt mining, claims to contain &quot;the oldest industrial pipeline in the world&quot;, dating back to 1595. It was constructed from 13,000 hollowed-out tree trunks to transport brine from Hallstatt to Ebensee.

===Milk===
Between 1978 and 1994, a 15 km milk pipeline ran between the Dutch island of Ameland and Holwerd on the mainland, of which 8 km was beneath the Wadden Sea. Every day, 30,000 litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland. In 1994, the pipeline was abandoned.

=== Pneumatic transport ===

Rather than transporting fluids, pneumatic tubes are usually used to transport solids in a cylindrical container by compressed air or by partial vacuum. They were most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and were used to transport small solid objects within a building, e.g. documents in an office or money in a bank. By the 21st century, pneumatic tube transport had been mostly superseded by digital solutions for transporting information, but is still used in cases where convenience and speed in a local environment are important. Hospitals, for example, use them to deliver drugs and specimens.

== Marine pipelines ==

In places, a pipeline may have to cross water expanses, such as small seas, straits and rivers. In many instances, they lie entirely on the seabed. These pipelines are referred to as &quot;marine&quot; pipelines (also, &quot;submarine&quot; or &quot;offshore&quot; pipelines). They are used primarily to carry oil or gas, but transportation of water is also important. In offshore projects, a distinction is made between a &quot;flowline&quot; and a pipeline. The former is an &quot;intrafield&quot; pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads, manifolds and the platform &quot;within&quot; a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an &quot;export pipeline&quot;, is used to bring the resource to shore. The construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland, mainly because of wave and current dynamics, along with other geohazards.

==Functions==

In general, pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose:

;Gathering pipelines: Group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility. In this group, pipelines are usually short- a couple hundred metres- and with small diameters. Sub-sea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems.
;Transportation pipelines: Mainly long pipes with large diameters, moving products (oil, gas, refined products) between cities, countries and even continents. These transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multi-products pipelines.
;Distribution pipelines: Composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters, used to take the products to the final consumer. Feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream. Pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups.

==Development and planning==
When a pipeline is built, the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pump/compressor stations, it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation.

The pipeline is routed along what is known as a &quot;right of way&quot;. Pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages:

# Open season to determine market interest: Potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipeline&#x27;s capacity rights.
# Route (right of way) selection including land acquisition (eminent domain)
# Pipeline design: The pipeline project may take a number of forms, including the construction of a new pipeline, conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another, or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route.
# Obtaining approval: Once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity, the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies.
# Surveying the route
# Clearing the route
# Trenching – Main Route and Crossings (roads, rail, other pipes, etc.)
# Installing the pipe
# Installing valves, intersections, etc.
# Covering the pipe and trench
# Testing: Once construction is completed, the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity. These may include hydrostatic testing and line packing.

Russia has &quot;Pipeline Troops&quot; as part of the Rear Services, who are trained to build and repair pipelines. Russia is the only country to have Pipeline Troops.

The U.S. government, mainly through the EPA, the FERC and others, reviews proposed pipeline projects in order to comply with the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, other laws and, in some cases, municipal laws. The Biden administration has sought to permit the respective states and tribal groups to appraise and potentially block the proposed projects.

==Operation==
Field devices are instrumentation, data gathering units and communication systems. The field instrumentation includes flow, pressure, and temperature gauges/transmitters, and other devices to measure the relevant data required. These instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations, such as injection or delivery stations, pump stations (liquid pipelines) or compressor stations (gas pipelines), and block valve stations.

The information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units (RTU) that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems, such as satellite channels, microwave links, or cellular phone connections.

Pipelines are controlled and operated remotely, from what is usually known as the &quot;Main Control Room&quot;. In this center, all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database. The data is received from multiple RTUs along the pipeline. It is common to find RTUs installed at every station along the pipeline.

The SCADA system at the Main Control Room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or Human Machine Interface, showing the operational conditions of the pipeline. The operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line, as well as send operational commands (open/close valves, turn on/off compressors or pumps, change setpoints, etc.) through the SCADA system to the field.

To optimize and secure the operation of these assets, some pipeline companies are using what is called &quot;Advanced Pipeline Applications&quot;, which are software tools installed on top of the SCADA system, that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection, leak location, batch tracking (liquid lines), pig tracking, composition tracking, predictive modeling, look ahead modeling, and operator training.

==Technology==

===Components===
Pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location. The main elements of a pipeline system are:

;Initial injection station: Known also as &quot;supply&quot; or &quot;inlet&quot; station, is the beginning of the system, where the product is injected into the line. Storage facilities, pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations.

;Compressor/pump stations: Pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines, are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline. The location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain, the type of product being transported, or operational conditions of the network.

;Partial delivery station: Known also as &quot;intermediate stations&quot;, these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported.

;Block valve station: These are the first line of protection for pipelines. With these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak. Block valve stations are usually located every 20 to , depending on the type of pipeline. Even though it is not a design rule, it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines. The location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported, the trajectory of the pipeline and/or the operational conditions of the line.

;Regulator station: This is a special type of valve station, where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line. Regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak.

;Final delivery station: Known also as &quot;outlet&quot; stations or terminals, this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer. It could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines.

===Leak detection systems===
Since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country, it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets, and the population and environment where these pipelines run.

Pipeline companies face government regulation, environmental constraints and social situations. Government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation, operator training requirements, pipeline facilities, technology and applications required to ensure operational safety. For example, in the State of Washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of 8 percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less. Social factors also affect the operation of pipelines. Product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies. In this case, the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow, with a high expectation for location accuracy.

Various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines, from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance. The most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is Computational Pipeline Monitoring or CPM. CPM takes information from the field related to pressures, flows, and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported. Once the estimation is completed, the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation, which may be related to a leak.

The American Petroleum Institute has published several articles related to the performance of CPM in liquids pipelines. The API Publications are:
*RAM 1130 – Computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines
*API 1149 – Pipeline variable uncertainties &amp; their effects on leak detectability

Where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway, it is usually enclosed in a protective casing. This casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the build-up of flammable gases or corrosive substances, and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks. The &quot;casing vent&quot;, a pipe protruding from the ground, often doubles as a warning marker called a &quot;casing vent marker&quot;.

==Implementation==
Pipelines are generally laid underground because temperature is less variable. Because pipelines are usually metal, this helps to reduce the expansion and shrinkage that can occur with weather changes. However, in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge. Pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead. Pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as Trans-Alaska-Pipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground.

==Maintenance==
Maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range, surveillance for construction, erosion, or leaks by foot, land vehicle, boat, or air, and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive.

US pipeline maintenance rules are covered in Code of Federal Regulations(CFR) sections, 49 CFR 192 for natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195 for petroleum liquid pipelines.

==Regulation==
In the US, onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada–US border, by the National Energy Board (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.

==Pipelines and geopolitics==

Pipelines for major energy resources (petroleum and natural gas) are not merely an element of trade. They connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well, and the construction, placement, and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions. A notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year 2009, wherein a dispute between Russia and Ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis. Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine after talks between it and the Ukrainian government fell through. In addition to cutting off supplies to Ukraine, Russian gas flowing through Ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to Southeastern Europe and some supplies to Central and Western Europe—was cut off, creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on Russian gas as fuel. Russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers, and particularly the European Union, from interfering in its &quot;near abroad&quot;.

==Hazard identification==

Because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics such as naptha and benzene, reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an above-ground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate. Effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are well-established, and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier (e.g. a series of torrential downpours).

The introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds (collectively BTEX) to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak. Particularly if followed by rain, a pipeline breach would result in BTEX dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water, followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer. Benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with EPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) set at 5 μg/L for potable water. Although it is not well studied, single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis. Additionally, the exposure of livestock, mainly cattle, to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues, such as neurotoxicity, fetal damage and fatal poisoning.

The entire surface of an above-ground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach. Pooled petroleum is unambiguous, readily spotted, and indicates the location of required repairs. Because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment, gaps between sensors, and data that requires interpretation, small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected.

Pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks. Buried pipes draw fewer complaints. They are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature, they are shielded from ultraviolet rays, and they are less exposed to photodegradation. Buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris, electrical storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, hail, and acid rain. They are protected from nesting birds, rutting mammals, and stray buckshot. Buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage (e.g. automobile collisions) and less accessible to vandals, saboteurs, and terrorists.

==Exposure==
Previous work has shown that a &#x27;worst-case exposure scenario&#x27; can be limited to a specific set of conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off SOP developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely. Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time. Leak detection is monitored through a SCADA system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (&lt;1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill. Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection, aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies. It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day inspection interval, however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 – 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors.

Even with pipeline leak volumes within SCADA detection limits, sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions, or other problems. The Enbridge Line 6B crude oil pipeline failure in Marshall, Michigan, on July 25, 2010, was thought by operators in Edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline. The leak in wetlands along the Kalamazoo River was only confirmed 17 hours after it happened by a local gas company employee.

===Spill frequency-volume===
Although the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills, TransCanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design, operation, and safety. Whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in spill estimates. Given that the pipeline crosses 247 miles of the Ogallala Aquifer, or 14.5% of the entire pipeline length, and the 50-year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between 11 – 91 spills, approximately 1.6 – 13.2 spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer. An estimate of 13.2 spills over the aquifer, each lasting 14 days, results in 184 days of potential exposure over the 50 year lifetime of the pipeline.
In the reduced-scope worst-case exposure scenario, the volume of a pinhole leak at 1.5% of max flow-rate for 14 days has been estimated at 189,000 barrels or 7.9 million gallons of oil. According to PHMSA&#x27;s incident database, only 0.5% of all spills in the last 10 years were &gt;10,000 barrels.

===Benzene fate and transport===
Benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatility. It is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene, so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil (1% weight by volume) would not volatilize before equilibrating with water.

Using the octanol-water partition coefficient and a 100-year precipitation event for the area, a worst-case estimate of 75 mg/L of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer. The actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described, although one estimate is that up to 4.9 billion gallons of water in the Ogallala Aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the MCL. The Final Environmental Impact Statement from the State Department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize.

===Previous dilbit spill remediation difficulties===
One of the major concerns over dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up. When the aforementioned Enbridge Line 6B crude oil pipeline ruptured in Marshall, Michigan in 2010, at least 843,000 gallons of dilbit were spilled. After detection of the leak, booms and vacuum trucks were deployed. Heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams, and carried dilbit 30 miles downstream before the spill was contained. Remediation work collected over 1.1 million gallons of oil and almost 200,000 cubic yards of oil-contaminated sediment and debris from the Kalamazoo River system. However, oil was still being found in affected waters in October 2012.

==Accidents and dangers==
Pipelines can help ensure a country&#x27;s economic well-being and as such present a likely target of terrorists or wartime adversaries.
Fossil fuels can be transported by pipeline, rail, truck or ship, though natural gas requires compression or liquefaction to make vehicle transport economical. For transport of crude oil via these four modes, various reports rank pipelines as proportionately causing less human death and property damage than rail and truck and spilling less oil than truck.

===Accidents===
Pipelines conveying flammable or explosive material, such as natural gas or oil, pose special safety concerns. While corrosion, pressure, and equipment failure are common causes, excavation damage is also a leading accident type that can be avoided by calling 811 before digging near pipelines. 
*1965 – A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from stress corrosion cracking failure on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. This accident, and others of the era, led then-President Lyndon B. Johnson to call for the formation of a national pipeline safety agency in 1967. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.
*June 16, 1976 – A gasoline pipeline was ruptured by a road construction crew in Los Angeles, California. Gasoline sprayed across the area, and soon ignited, killing 9, and injuring at least 14 others. Confusion over the depth of the pipeline in the construction area seemed to be a factor in the accident.
*June 4, 1989 – The Ufa train disaster: Sparks from two passing trains detonated gas leaking from a LPG pipeline near Ufa, Russia. At least 575 people were reported killed.
*October 17, 1998 – 1998 Jesse pipeline explosion: A petroleum pipeline exploded at Jesse on the Niger Delta in Nigeria, killing about 1,200 villagers, some of whom were scavenging gasoline.
*June 10, 1999 – A pipeline rupture in a Bellingham, Washington park led to the release of 277,200 gallons of gasoline. The gasoline was ignited, causing an explosion that killed two children and one adult. Misoperation of the pipeline and a previously damaged section of the pipe that was not detected before were identified as causing the failure.
*August 19, 2000 – A natural gas pipeline rupture and fire near Carlsbad, New Mexico; this explosion and fire killed 12 members of an extended family. The cause was due to severe internal corrosion of the pipeline.
*July 30, 2004 – A major natural gas pipeline exploded in Ghislenghien, Belgium near Ath (thirty kilometres southwest of Brussels), killing at least 24 people and leaving 132 wounded, some critically.
*May 12, 2006 – An oil pipeline ruptured outside Lagos, Nigeria. Up to 200 people may have been killed. See Nigeria oil blast.
*November 1, 2007 – A propane pipeline exploded near Carmichael, Mississippi, about south of Meridian, Mississippi. Two people were killed instantly and an additional four were injured. Several homes were destroyed and sixty families were displaced. The pipeline is owned by Enterprise Products Partners LP, and runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas, to Apex, North Carolina. Inability to find flaws in pre-1971 ERW seam welded pipe flaws was a contributing factor to the accident.
*September 9, 2010 – 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion: A 30-inch diameter high pressure natural gas pipeline owned by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company exploded in the Crestmoor residential neighborhood 2 mi (3.2 km) west of San Francisco International Airport, killing 8, injuring 58, and destroying 38 homes. Poor quality control of the pipe used &amp; of the construction were cited as factors in the accident.
*June 27, 2014 – An explosion occurred after a natural gas pipe line ruptured in Nagaram village, East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, India causing 16 deaths and destroying &quot;scores of homes&quot;.
*July 31, 2014 – On the night of July 31, a series of explosions originating in underground gas pipelines occurred in the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Leaking gas filled the sewers along several major thoroughfares and the resulting explosions turned several kilometers of road surface into deep trenches, sending vehicles and debris high into the air and igniting fires over a large area. At least 32 people were killed and 321 injured.

===As targets===
Pipelines can be the target of vandalism, sabotage, or even terrorist attacks. For example, between early 2011 and July 2012, a natural gas pipeline connecting Egypt to Israel and Jordan was attacked 15 times. In 2019, a fuel pipeline north of Mexico City exploded after fuel thieves tapped into the line. At least sixty-six people were reported to have been killed. In war, pipelines are often the target of military attacks, as destruction of pipelines can seriously disrupt enemy logistics. On 26 September 2022, a series of explosions and subsequent major gas leaks occurred on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines that run to Europe from Russia under the Baltic Sea. The leaks are believed to have been caused by an act of sabotage.

== Fluid control in pipeline transport ==
In pipeline transport systems, the efficient and safe movement of fluids—whether gas, oil, water, or chemicals—relies on effective fluid control mechanisms. These mechanisms help regulate the flow, pressure, and direction of the fluids within the pipeline, preventing blockages, backflows, and ensuring smooth transportation over long distances.

=== Valves ===

Industrial valves are integral in controlling fluid flow in pipelines. They are used for starting, stopping, or regulating fluid movement. Different types of valves play distinct roles in pipeline systems, including:

* Ball valves allow for quick on/off flow control and are often used in pipeline systems where rapid changes in flow are required.
* Gate valves provide full flow control, making them suitable for pipelines that require complete shutoff or consistent flow.
* Check valves are used to prevent backflow, protecting the pipeline from potential damage caused by reverse fluid movement.

=== Flow meters ===
Flow meters are critical for monitoring and adjusting the flow of liquids and gases in pipelines. These devices ensure that the correct flow rate is maintained, preventing both under and over-supply of fluid in the pipeline.

=== Pressure regulators ===
Pressure regulators are designed to maintain stable pressure in pipelines by automatically adjusting the flow of fluid. This helps to prevent damage caused by pressure surges or drops, ensuring that the pipeline system operates within safe and efficient parameters.

=== Actuators ===
Actuators are used in conjunction with valves to control their opening and closing. Powered by electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic sources, actuators allow for automated fluid control, making them essential for pipelines that require continuous or remote monitoring.

<doc id="51112" wikidata="Q354309" url="?curid=51112" title="William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley">
<text>William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (13 September 15204 August 1598) was an English statesman, the chief adviser of Queen Elizabeth I for most of her reign, twice Secretary of State (1550–1553 and 1558–1572) and Lord High Treasurer from 1572. In his description in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, A.F. Pollard wrote, &quot;From 1558 for forty years the biography of Cecil is almost indistinguishable from that of Elizabeth and from the history of England.&quot;

Cecil set as the main goal of English policy the creation of a united and Protestant British Isles. His methods were to complete the control of Ireland, and to forge an alliance with Scotland. Protection from invasion required a powerful Royal Navy. While he was not fully successful, his successors agreed with his goals. In 1587, Cecil persuaded the Queen to order the execution of the Roman Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, after she was implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth.

He was the father of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and founder of the Cecil dynasty (marquesses of Exeter and of Salisbury), which has produced many politicians including two prime ministers.

==Early life==
Cecil was born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, in 1520, the son of Sir Richard Cecil, owner of the Burghley estate (near Stamford, Lincolnshire), and his wife, Jane Heckington.

Pedigrees, elaborated by Cecil himself with the help of William Camden the antiquary, associated him with the Welsh Cecils or Seisyllts of Allt-Yr-Ynys, Walterstone, on the border of Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. &quot;Cecil&quot; is an anglicisation of the Welsh . Lord Burghley acknowledged that the family was from the Welsh Marches in a family pedigree painted at Theobalds.

The Lord Treasurer&#x27;s grandfather, David Cecil, had moved to Stamford. David Cecil secured the favour of the first Tudor king, Henry VII, to whom he was yeoman of the chamber. He was elected Member of Parliament for Stamford five times, between 1504 and 1523. He was Sergeant-of-Arms to Henry VIII in 1526, Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1532, and a Justice of the Peace for Rutland. He, according to Burghley&#x27;s enemies, kept the best inn in Stamford. His eldest son, Richard, Yeoman of the Wardrobe (died 1554), married Jane, daughter of William Heckington of Bourne, and was father of three daughters and the future Lord Burghley.

William, the only son, was put to school at The King&#x27;s School, Grantham, and then Stamford School, which he later saved and endowed. In May 1535, at the age of fourteen, he went to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was brought into contact with the foremost scholars of the time, Roger Ascham and John Cheke, and acquired an unusual knowledge of Greek. He also acquired the affections of Cheke&#x27;s sister, Mary, and was in 1541 removed by his father to Gray&#x27;s Inn, without having taken a degree, as was common at the time for those not intending to enter the Church. The precaution proved useless and four months later Cecil committed one of the rare rash acts of his life in marrying Mary Cheke. The only child of this marriage, Thomas, the future Earl of Exeter, was born in May 1542, and in February 1543 Cecil&#x27;s first wife died. On 21 December 1546 he married Mildred Cooke, who was ranked by Ascham with Lady Jane Grey as one of the two most learned ladies in the kingdom, (aside from another of Ascham&#x27;s pupils, Elizabeth Tudor, who was later Elizabeth I) and whose sister, Anne, was the wife of Sir Nicholas Bacon and mother of Sir Francis Bacon.

==Early career==
William Cecil&#x27;s early career was spent in the service of the Duke of Somerset (a brother of the late queen, Jane Seymour), who was Lord Protector during the early years of the reign of his nephew, the young Edward VI. Cecil accompanied Somerset on his Pinkie campaign of 1547 (part of the &quot;Rough Wooing&quot;), being one of the two Judges of the Marshalsea. The other was William Patten, who states that both he and Cecil began to write independent accounts of the campaign, and that Cecil generously contributed his notes for Patten&#x27;s narrative, &quot;The Expedition into Scotland&quot;.

Cecil, according to his autobiographical notes, sat in Parliament in 1543; but his name does not occur in the imperfect parliamentary returns until 1547, when he was elected for the family borough of Stamford. In 1548, he was described as the Protector&#x27;s Master of Requests, which apparently means that he was clerk or registrar of the court of requests which Somerset, possibly at Hugh Latimer&#x27;s instigation, illegally set up in Somerset House to hear poor men&#x27;s complaints. He also seems to have acted as private secretary to the Protector, and was in some danger at the time of the Protector&#x27;s fall in October 1549. The lords opposed to Somerset ordered his detention on 10 October, and in November he was in the Tower of London.

Cecil ingratiated himself with John Dudley, then Earl of Warwick, and after less than three months he was out of the Tower. On 5 September 1550 Cecil was sworn in as one of King Edward&#x27;s two secretaries of state. In April 1551, Cecil became chancellor of the Order of the Garter. But service under Warwick (by now the Duke of Northumberland) carried some risk, and decades later in his diary, Cecil recorded his release in the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;I was freed from this miserable court&quot;).

To protect the Protestant government from the accession of a Catholic queen, Northumberland forced King Edward&#x27;s lawyers to create an instrument setting aside the Third Succession Act on 15 June 1553. (The document, which Edward titled &quot;My Devise for the Succession&quot;, barred both Elizabeth and Mary, the remaining children of Henry VIII, from the throne, in favour of Lady Jane Grey.) Cecil resisted for a while, in a letter to his wife, he wrote: &quot;Seeing great perils threatened upon us by the likeness of the time, I do make choice to avoid the perils of God&#x27;s displeasure.&quot; However, at Edward&#x27;s royal command he signed, not only the &quot;devise&quot;, but also the bond among the conspirators and the letters from the council to Mary Tudor of 9 June 1553.

Years afterwards, he pretended that he had only signed the devise as a witness, but in his apology to Queen Mary I, he did not venture to allege so flimsy an excuse; he preferred to lay stress on the extent to which he succeeded in shifting the responsibility on to the shoulders of his brother-in-law, Sir John Cheke, and other friends, and on his intrigues to frustrate the Queen to whom he had sworn allegiance.

There is no doubt that Cecil saw which way the wind was blowing, and disliked Northumberland&#x27;s scheme; but he had not the courage to resist the duke to his face. As soon as the duke had set out to meet Mary, however, Cecil became the most active intriguer against him, and to these efforts, of which he laid a full account before Queen Mary, he mainly owed his immunity. He had, moreover, had no part in the divorce of Catherine of Aragon or in the humiliation of Mary during Henry&#x27;s reign, and he made no scruple about conforming to the Catholic reaction. He went to Mass, confessed, and in no particular official capacity went to meet Cardinal Pole on his return to England in December 1554, again accompanying him to Calais in May 1555.

William Cecil was elected to Parliament as knight of the shire for Lincolnshire in 1553 (probably), 1555 and 1559 and for Northamptonshire in 1563.&quot;

In January of that year, he wrote to Sir Thomas Smith: &quot;The Parliament is begun and I trust will be short, for matters of moment to pass are not many, reviving of some old laws for penalties of some felonies and the grant of a subsidy. I think somewhat will be attempted to ascertain the realm of a successor to this crown, but I fear the unwillingness of her Majesty to have such a person known will stay the matter.&quot;

It was rumoured in December 1554 that Cecil would succeed Sir William Petre as Secretary of State, an office which, with his chancellorship of the Garter, he had lost on Mary&#x27;s accession to the throne. Probably the Queen had more to do with this rumour than Cecil, though he is said to have opposed, in the parliament of 1555 (in which he represented Lincolnshire), a bill for the confiscation of the estates of the Protestant refugees. The story, even as told by his biographer, does not represent Cecil&#x27;s conduct as having been very courageous; and it is more revealing that he found no seat in the parliament of 1558, for which Mary had directed the return of &quot;discreet and good Catholic members&quot;.

==Reign of Elizabeth==
The Duke of Northumberland had employed Cecil in the administration of the lands of Princess Elizabeth. Before Mary died he was a member of the &quot;old flock of Hatfield&quot;, and from the first, the new Queen relied on Cecil. He was the cousin of Blanche Parry, Elizabeth&#x27;s longest serving gentlewoman and close confidante. Elizabeth appointed Cecil Secretary of State. His tight control over the finances of the Crown, leadership of the Privy Council, and the creation of a capable intelligence service under the direction of Francis Walsingham made him the most important minister for the majority of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

===Foreign policy===
Dawson argues that Cecil&#x27;s long-term goal was a united and Protestant British Isles, an objective to be achieved by completing the conquest of Ireland and by creating an Anglo-Scottish alliance. With the land border with Scotland safe, the main burden of defence would fall upon the Royal Navy, Cecil proposed to strengthen and revitalise the Navy, making it the centrepiece of English power. He did obtain a firm Anglo-Scottish alliance reflecting the common religion and shared interests of the two countries, as well as an agreement that offered the prospect of a successful conquest of Ireland. However, his strategy ultimately failed. His idea that England&#x27;s safety required a united British Isles became an axiom of English policy by the 17th century.

Though a Protestant, Cecil was not a religious purist; he aided the Protestant Huguenots and Dutch just enough to keep them going in the struggles which warded danger from England&#x27;s shores. However, Cecil never developed that passionate aversion to decided measures which became a second nature to Elizabeth. His intervention in Scotland in 1559–1560 showed that he could strike hard when necessary; and his action over the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, proved that he was willing to take on responsibilities from which the Queen shrank.

Generally he was in favour of more decided intervention on behalf of continental Protestants than Elizabeth would have liked, but it is not always easy to ascertain the advice he gave. He left endless memoranda lucidly (nevertheless sometimes bordering on the ridiculous) setting forth the pros and cons of every course of action; but there are few indications of the line which he actually recommended when it came to a decision. How far he was personally responsible for the Anglican Settlement, the Poor Laws, and the foreign policy of the reign, remains to a large extent a matter of conjecture. However, it is most likely that Cecil&#x27;s views carried the day in the politics of Elizabethan England. The historian Hilaire Belloc contends that Cecil was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of England during his tenure as Secretary; pointing out that in instances where his and Elizabeth&#x27;s wills diverged, it was Cecil&#x27;s will that was imposed.

Leimon and Parker argue that Cecil was the principal protector of Edward Stafford, the English ambassador to Paris and a paid spy who helped the Spanish at the time of the Spanish Armada. However, they do not claim Cecil knew of Stafford&#x27;s treason.

===Domestic politics===
William Cecil&#x27;s share in the Religious Settlement of 1559 was considerable, and it coincided fairly with his own Anglican religious views. Like the mass of the nation, he grew more Protestant as time wore on; he was happier to persecute Catholics than Puritans; and he had no love for ecclesiastical jurisdiction. His prosecution of the English Catholics made him a recurring character in the &quot;evil counsellor polemics&quot;, written by Catholic exiles across the channel. In these pamphlets, polemicists painted a black picture of Burghley as a corrupting influence over the queen. &quot;The Queen will listen to none but unto him&quot;, exiled Catholic intelligencer Richard Verstegan wrote, &quot;and somtymes, she is faine to come to his bedsyde to entreat him in some-things.&quot; He warmly remonstrated with John Whitgift, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, over his persecuting Articles of 1583. The finest encomium was passed on him by the queen herself, when she said, &quot;This judgment I have of you, that you will not be corrupted with any manner of gifts, and that you will be faithful to the state.&quot;

===Economic policy===
William Cecil sought to ensure that policy was commensurate with the royal finances, which often led him advocating a cautious policy. His economic ideas were influenced by the Commonwealthmen of Edward VI&#x27;s reign: he believed in the necessity of safeguarding the social hierarchy, the just price and the moral duties due to labour. In his economic policy he was motivated by a variety of factors, including those of national independence and self-sufficiency, as well as seeking to balance the interests of the Crown and the subject. Cecil did not believe that economics and politics were separate or that there was a dichotomy between power and plenty. One of his biographers asserted that, for Burghley, &quot;power was for defence from external enemies; plenty for security at home. Cecil pursued both power and plenty. They were the foreign and domestic aspects of his economic nationalism&quot;. He deplored the reliance on &quot;foreign corn&quot; and during an economic depression sought to ensure employment due to his fears of &quot;tumults&quot;. Cecil used patronage to ensure the loyalty of the nobility.

===In Parliament===
William Cecil represented Lincolnshire in the Parliament of 1555 and 1559, and Northamptonshire in that of 1563, and he took an active part in the proceedings of the House of Commons until his elevation to the peerage; but there seems no good evidence for the story that he was proposed as Speaker in 1563. In January 1561, he was given the lucrative office of Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries in succession to Sir Thomas Parry. As Master of the Court of Wards, Cecil supervised the raising and education of wealthy, aristocratic boys whose fathers had died before they reached maturity. These included Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex and Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. He is widely credited with reforming an institution notorious for its corruption, but the extent of his reforms has been disputed by some scholars.

In February 1559, he was elected Chancellor of Cambridge University in succession to Cardinal Pole; he was created M.A. of that university on the occasion of Elizabeth&#x27;s visit in 1564, and M.A. of Oxford on a similar occasion in 1566. He was the first Chancellor of the University of Dublin, between 1592 and 1598.

On 25 February 1571, Queen Elizabeth elevated him as Baron Burghley. That Cecil continued to act as Secretary of State after his elevation illustrates the growing importance of the office, which under his son became a secretary of the ship of state. In 1572 Cecil privately admonished the queen for her &quot;doubtful dealing with the Queen of Scots&quot;. He made a strong attack on everything he thought Elizabeth had done wrong as queen. In his view, Mary had to be executed because she had become a rallying cause for Catholics and played into the hands of the Spanish and of the pope, who excommunicated Elizabeth in 1570 and sent in Jesuits to organise a Catholic underground. Following the Harleyford Conference of July 1586 these missionaries would set up a highly effective underground system for the transport and support of priests arriving from the Continent. Elizabeth&#x27;s indecision was maddening; finally in 1587 Elizabeth had Mary executed.

===Treasurer===
In 1572, Lord Winchester, who had been Lord High Treasurer under Edward, Mary and Elizabeth, died. His vacant post was offered to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who declined it and proposed Burghley, stating that the latter was the more suitable candidate because of his greater &quot;learning and knowledge&quot;. The new Lord Treasurer&#x27;s hold over the queen strengthened with the years.

==Burghley, Cecil House and Theobalds==
Burghley House, near the town of Stamford, was built for Cecil, between 1555 and 1587, and modelled on the privy lodgings of Richmond Palace. It was subsequently the residence of his descendants, the earls and marquesses of Exeter. The house is one of the principal examples of 16th-century Elizabethan architecture, reflecting the prominence of its founder, and the lucrative wool trade of the Cecil estates. 

Cecil House was built as his London residence, an expansion of an existing building. Queen Elizabeth I supped with him there, in July 1561, &quot;before my house was fully finished&quot;, Cecil recorded in his diary, calling the place &quot;my rude new cottage.&quot; Inherited by his elder son, Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, it was known as &quot;Exeter House&quot;.

A new Theobalds House in Cheshunt was built between 1564 and 1585 by the order of Cecil, intending to build a mansion partly to demonstrate his increasingly dominant status at the Royal Court, and to provide a palace fine enough to accommodate the Queen on her visits. The Queen visited there eight times, between 1572 and 1596. An entertainment for Elizabeth, the &quot;Hermit&#x27;s Welcome at Theobalds&quot; in May 1591 alluded to Burghley&#x27;s retirement from public life.

==Death==
Burghley collapsed (possibly from a stroke or heart attack) in 1598. Before he died, Robert, his only surviving son by his second wife, was ready to step into his shoes as the Queen&#x27;s principal adviser. Having survived all his children except Robert and Thomas, Burghley died at his London residence, Cecil House on 4 August 1598, and was buried in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Stamford.

===Descendants===
William Cecil first married Mary Cheke (Cheek), daughter of Peter Cheke of Cambridge and Agnes Duffield (and sister of John Cheke), and they had issue:
* Sir Thomas Cecil (born 5 May 1542), who inherited the Barony of Burghley upon the death of his father, and was later created Earl of Exeter.

Secondly, he married Mildred Cooke, eldest daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke of Gidea, Essex and Anne Fitzwilliam, and they had the following issue:
* Frances Cecil (born c. 1556)
* Anne Cecil (born 5 December 1556), who was the first wife of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, and, before marriage, served as a Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth I.
* Sir Robert Cecil (born 1 June 1563), who inherited his father&#x27;s political mantle, taking on the role of Chief Minister, and arranging a smooth transfer of power to the Stuart administration under King James I of England. He was created Baron Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, and finally Earl of Salisbury.
* Elizabeth Cecil (born 1 July 1564), who married William Wentworth of Nettlestead (c. 1555–1582), eldest son of Thomas Wentworth, 2nd Baron Wentworth.

Cecil&#x27;s descendants include the Marquesses of Exeter, descended from his elder son Thomas; and the Marquesses of Salisbury, descended from his younger son Robert. One of the latter branch, Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury (1830–1903), served three times as Prime Minister, under Queen Victoria and her son, King Edward VII. The latter&#x27;s nephew Arthur Balfour, who succeeded Salisbury as Prime Minister, was also a descendant.

==Private life==
William Cecil&#x27;s private life was upright; he was a faithful husband, a careful father and a dutiful master. A book-lover and antiquarian, he made a special hobby of heraldry and genealogy. It was the conscious and unconscious aim of the age to reconstruct a new landed aristocracy on the ruins of the old Catholic order. As such, Burghley was a great builder, planter and patron. All the arts of architecture and horticulture were lavished on Burghley House and Theobalds, which his son exchanged for Hatfield. 

Cecil wrote more than 128 letters to his son Robert Cecil over the course of his life, containing words of guidance and perseverance. The collection of letters show the close direction and counsel he gave his son in seeking and obtaining the office of principal secretary, 1593–1598. They describe the task of receiving and crafting a wide and large array of papers on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I and her Privy Council; finance, administration, foreign policy, and religion figure prominently, as does the shift from continental war to Ireland. These letters reveal the intimate relationship between the father and son; Burghley&#x27;s care for his family, his thoughts of death, and a unique record of illness and old age are framed by his political and spiritual anxieties for the future of the Queen and her realms.

==Public conduct==
Albert Pollard, in his article on Cecil in the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, wrote:&quot;William Cecil&#x27;s public conduct does not present itself in quite so amiable a light. As his predecessor, Lord Winchester, said of himself, he was sprung &quot;from the willow rather than the oak&quot;. Neither Cecil nor Lord Winchester were men to suffer for the sake of obstinate convictions. The interest of the state was the supreme consideration for Burghley, and to it he had no hesitation in sacrificing individual consciences. He frankly disbelieved in toleration; &quot;that state&quot;, he said, &quot;could never be in safety where there was a toleration of two religions. For there is no enmity so great as that for religion; and therefore they that differ in the service of their God can never agree in the service of their country&quot;. With a maxim such as this, it was easy for him to maintain that Elizabeth&#x27;s coercive measures were political and not religious. To say that he was Machiavellian is meaningless, for every statesman is so, more or less; especially in the 16th century men preferred efficiency to principle. On the other hand, principles are valueless without law and order; and Burghley&#x27;s craft and subtlety prepared a security in which principles might find some scope.&quot;

==Nicholas White==
The most prolonged of Cecil&#x27;s surviving personal correspondences, lasting from 1566 until 1590, is with Nicholas White, an Irish judge. It is contained in the &quot;State Papers Ireland 63&quot; and &quot;Lansdowne MS. 102&quot;, but receives hardly a mention in the literature on Cecil.

White had been a tutor to Cecil&#x27;s children during his student days in London, and the correspondence suggests that he was held in lasting affection by the family. In the end, White fell into a Dublin controversy over the confessions of an intriguing priest, which threatened the authority of the Queen&#x27;s deputised government in Ireland; out of caution Cecil withdrew his longstanding protection and the judge was imprisoned in London and died soon after.

White&#x27;s most remarked-upon service for Cecil is his report on his visit to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569, during the early years of her imprisonment. It was an acrimonious encounter in which he angrily refuted Mary&#x27;s contention that Elizabeth was treating her harshly. However, he admitted in his subsequent letter to Cecil that despite his hostility towards Mary, he had found her to be somewhat alluring and advised that she be kept under strict confinement for fear that she would have a similar impact on others. Elizabeth was jealous of her Scottish rival and, although he was at pains to stress that Mary in no way surpassed her in charm and beauty, White could well have forfeited his recently acquired favour had this relation been communicated to his queen; Cecil seems to have kept it from his royal mistress.

In February 1581, White demonstrated his independence in council, refusing to sign a letter to the queen regarding Nicholas Malby&#x27;s actions in the Munster rebellion since he was away in England during the deliberations of the meeting. Again, on 28 August 1582 White was accused of withholding his signature to conciliar deliberations on the actions of the deputy during the Pale rebellion. He continued to demonstrate his valuable insights to Burghley in regular correspondence throughout the period, including letters of December 1581 on the miseries of war, the need for temperate government, and his fear that the wild Irish were glad to see the weakness of English blood in Ireland. In a missive of 13 September 1582 White complained of the unfriendly dealings of Lucas Dillon, his erstwhile companion and fellow Irish-born councillor, stating they had been for a long time of &#x27;contrary minds&#x27;. In spite of his sympathies for the native Irish he was apparently the author of an extraordinary trial by combat in September 1583 in which Teig MacGilpatrick O&#x27;Connor and Conor MacCormac O&#x27;Connor died. His usefulness as an Irish speaker and a nominal protestant made White an essential privy councillor for two decades.

==In popular culture==
Cecil has been a character in many works of fiction connected with Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign.

He has long been considered a likely model for the character of the King&#x27;s calculating minister Polonius in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Richard Attenborough depicted him in the film &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), although the portrayal was inaccurate in many ways, including in regards to age and length of service. He was played by Ben Webster in the 1935 film &quot;Drake of England&quot;. He was a prominent supporting character in the 1937 film &quot;Fire Over England&quot;, starring Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, and Flora Robson; Burghley (spelled Burleigh in the film) was played by Morton Selten. He also appears in the 2005 television mini-series &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; with Helen Mirren, played by Ian McDiarmid; was portrayed by Ronald Hines in the 1971 TV series &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;; by Trevor Howard in the 1971 film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot;; and by Ian Hart in the 2005 miniseries &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;. He is portrayed by David Thewlis in Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Anonymous&quot; (2011). Cecil is portrayed by Ben Willbond in the BAFTA Award-winning children&#x27;s comedy television series &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;; in the spin-off film, &quot;Bill&quot; (2015), he was played by Mathew Baynton. In the BBC TV miniseries &quot;Elizabeth I&#x27;s Secret Agents&quot; (2017, broadcast on PBS in 2018 as &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Secret Agents&quot;), he is played by Philip Rosch.

As a stage character Cecil features in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s verse drama &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; and Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;Vivat! Vivat Regina!&quot;. Bolt portrays him as intelligent, pragmatic, ruthless and driven by the interests of the State and the Crown.

Cecil appears as a character in the novels &quot;I, Elizabeth&quot; by Rosalind Miles, &quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Lover&quot; and &quot;The Other Queen&quot; by Philippa Gregory, and is a prominent secondary character in several books by Bertrice Small. He is a prominent character in &quot;Legacy&quot;, a novel of Elizabeth I by Susan Kay. He also appears in the alternative history &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot;, by Harry Turtledove, in which he and his son Sir Robert Cecil are conspirators and patrons of William Shakespeare in an attempt to restore Elizabeth to power after a Spanish invasion and conquest of England. In addition, he is portrayed as a young man in &quot;Lamentation&quot; by C. J. Sansom. Burghley also appears in the espionage novels of Fiona Buckley, featuring Elizabeth I&#x27;s half-sister, Ursula Blanchard.

Guy Pearce portrays Cecil in the 2018 historical drama &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot;, directed by Josie Rourke.

William Cecil appears as a character in Deborah Harkness’ novel &quot;Shadow of Night&quot;, which is the second instalment of her “All Souls” Trilogy. Cecil is portrayed by Adrian Rawlins in the television adaptation of the triogy, &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot;.

The Elizabethan-class Airspeed Ambassador G-ALZU that crashed in the 1958 Munich air disaster, was named &quot;Lord Burghley&quot;.

<text>Clemens August of Bavaria () (17 August 1700 – 6 February 1761) was an 18th-century member of the Wittelsbach dynasty of Bavaria and Archbishop-Elector of Cologne.

==Biography==
Clemens August (Clementus Augustus) was born in Brussels, the son of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska and the grandson of King John III Sobieski of Poland. His family was split during the War of the Spanish Succession and was for many years under house arrest in Austria; only in 1715 did the family become re-united.

His uncle Joseph Clemens, Elector and Archbishop of Cologne, saw to it that Clemens August received several appointments in Altötting, the Diocese of Regensburg, and at the Prince-Provostry of Berchtesgaden, and he soon received papal confirmation as Bishop of Regensburg, and later of Cologne.

As Archbishop of Cologne, he was one of the Electors, a Prince-Bishop of Münster, Hildesheim, and Osnabrück, and a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.

According to Jan Swafford, Clemens August did not owe his position of power to his &quot;talent, intelligence or reason. In each of his exalted posts, Clemens August was splendidly brainless and incompetent, not in the least interested in governing anything. As Elector in Bonn, his attention would be given largely to pleasure in the form of ladies, music, dancing, and erecting monuments to his glory and munificence.&quot; (2014)

Clemens August, who mostly sided with the Austrian Habsburg-Lorraine side during the War of the Austrian Succession, personally crowned his brother Charles VII emperor at Frankfurt in 1742. After Charles&#x27;s death in 1745, Clemens August then again leaned toward Austria. Over time, Clemens August changed more frequently the alliances, as of Allied of Austria or France, also under the influence of his frequently changing First Ministers and high donations.

He died in Schloss Philippsburg below the Festung Ehrenbreitstein in 1761. In March 1761, shortly after his death, Pope Clement XIII rejected the succession of Clemens August&#x27;s brother Cardinal John Theodore of Bavaria as Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Cologne since the pope entertained some doubt on John Theodore&#x27;s &quot;moral conduct&quot;. This was the end of the reign of the Wittelsbach in Cologne after 178 years of continuous rule. In his will, Clemens August donated only to his successor as Elector and the court chamber of the Electorate of Cologne, but not the Elector of Bavaria. His nephew Maximilian III. Joseph then tried to challenge the will before the Supreme Court of Appeal, however, this failed on 23 January 1767.

==Cultural legacy==

Clemens August patronised the arts; among others he ordered to build the palaces of Augustusburg and Falkenlust in Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia, listed on the UNESCO cultural world heritage list, and the church of St Michael in Berg am Laim in Munich. Other palaces like Schloss Arnsberg or Schloss Herzogsfreude have been lost.

Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Flemish grandfather became a musician in Bonn during the reign of Clemens August.

==Illegitimate children==
Clemens August and his mistress Mechthild Brion had a daughter:
* Anna Marie zu Löwenfeld (1735– 26 November 1783) who married Franz Ludwig, Count of Holnstein (1723–1780), son of Clemens August&#x27;s brother Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor

<text>Transport economics is a branch of economics founded in 1959 by American economist John R. Meyer that deals with the allocation of resources within the transport sector. It has strong links to civil engineering. Transport economics differs from some other branches of economics in that the assumption of a spaceless, instantaneous economy does not hold. People and goods flow over networks at certain speeds. Demands peak. Advance ticket purchase is often induced by lower fares. The networks themselves may or may not be competitive. A single trip (the final good, in the consumer&#x27;s eyes) may require the bundling of services provided by several firms, agencies and modes.

Although transport systems follow the same supply and demand theory as other industries, the complications of network effects and choices between dissimilar goods (e.g. car and bus travel) make estimating the demand for transportation facilities difficult. The development of models to estimate the likely choices between the goods involved in transport decisions (discrete choice models) led to the development of an important branch of econometrics, as well as a Nobel Prize for Daniel McFadden.

In transport, demand can be measured in number of journeys made or in total distance traveled across all journeys (e.g. passenger-kilometers for public transport or vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) for private transport). Supply is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the generalised cost of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.

The effect of increases in supply (i.e. capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see induced demand), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see &quot;externalities&quot; below).

== Externalities ==
In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both positive and negative externalities on non-users. The consideration of these externalities – particularly the negative ones – is a part of transport economics.

Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide emergency services, increases in land value, and agglomeration benefits. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, noise pollution, light pollution, safety hazards, community severance and congestion. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous climate change is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis.

Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a public good. For example, manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air.

=== Traffic congestion ===

Traffic congestion is a negative externality caused by various factors. A 2005 American study stated that there are seven root causes of congestion, and gives the following summary of their contributions: bottlenecks 40%, traffic incidents 25%, bad weather 15%, work zones 10%, poor signal timing 5%, and special events/other 5%. Within the transport economics community, congestion pricing is considered to be an appropriate mechanism to deal with this problem (i.e. to internalise the externality) by allocating scarce roadway capacity to users. Capacity expansion is also a potential mechanism to deal with traffic congestion, but is often undesirable (particularly in urban areas) and sometimes has questionable benefits (see induced demand). William Vickrey, winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize for his work on &quot;moral hazard&quot;, is considered one of the fathers of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the New York City Subway in 1952.
In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais, a fellow Nobel prize winner &quot;for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources&quot;, Gabriel Roth who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore. Reuben Smeed, the deputy director of the Transport and Road Research Laboratory was also a pioneer in this field, and his ideas were presented to the British government in what is known as the Smeed Report.

Congestion is not limited to road networks; the negative externality imposed by congestion is also important in busy public transport networks as well as crowded pedestrian areas, e.g. on the London Underground on a weekday or any urban train station, at peak times. There is the classical excess in demand compared to supply. This is because at peak times there is a large demand for trains, since people want to go home (i.e., a derived demand). However, space on the platforms and on the trains is limited and small compared to the demand for it. As a result, there are crowds of people outside the train doors and in the train station corridors. This increases delays for commuters, which can often cause a rise in stress or other problems.

==== Congestion pricing ====

Congestion pricing is an efficiency pricing strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society. Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative demand side (as opposed to supply side) strategies offered by economists to address congestion. Congestion pricing was first implemented in Singapore in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, Singapore upgraded its system in 1998 (see Singapore&#x27;s Electronic Road Pricing). Similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, as an upgrade to the manual zone control system implemented in 1998;
London in 2003 and extended in 2007 (see London congestion charge); Stockholm in 2006, as seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis since August 2007 (see Stockholm congestion tax).

=== Pollution pricing ===
From 2008 to 2011, Milan had a traffic charge scheme, Ecopass, that exempted higher emission standard vehicles (Euro IV) and other alternative fuel vehicles This was later replaced by a more conventional congestion pricing scheme, Area C.

Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by noted regional planner Robert Cervero: &quot;True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing in fear of reprisal from their constituents... Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many.&quot;

==== Road space rationing ====

Transport economists consider road space rationing an alternative to congestion pricing, but road space rationing is considered more equitable, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less those who can afford paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can avoid the restrictions by owning a second car. Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts &quot;to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users&#x27; willingness to pay for the resource&quot;. While some &quot;opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels.&quot; Road space rationing based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as Athens (1982), México City (1989), São Paulo (1997), Santiago, Chile, Bogotá, Colombia, La Paz (2003), Bolivia, and San José (2005), Costa Rica.

==== Tradable mobility credits ====
A more acceptable policy on automobile travel restrictions, proposed by transport economists to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a rationing of peak period travel but through revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This concept is similar to the existing system of emissions trading of carbon credits, proposed by the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse emissions. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, will have the option to use the local government-issued mobility rights or congestion credits for themselves, or to trade or sell them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond the personal quota. This trading system will allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.

== Funding and financing ==

Methods of funding and financing transport network maintenance, improvement and expansion are debated extensively and form part of the transport economics field.

Funding issues relate to the ways in which money is raised for the supply of transport capacity. Taxation and user fees are the main methods of fund-raising. Taxation may be general (e.g. income tax), local (e.g. sales tax or land value tax) or variable (e.g. fuel tax), and user fees may be tolls, congestion charges or fares. The method of funding often attracts strong political and public debate.

Financing issues relate to the way in which these funds are used to pay for the supply of transport. Loans, bonds, public–private partnerships and concessions are all methods of financing transport investment.

== Regulation and competition ==
Regulation of the supply of transport capacity relates to both safety regulation and economic regulation. Transport economics considers issues of the economic regulation of the supply of transport, particularly in relation to whether transport services and networks are provided by the public sector, by the private sector, or a mixture of both.

Transport networks and services can take on any combination of regulated/deregulated and public/private provision. For example, bus services in the UK outside London are provided by both the public and private sectors in a deregulated economic environment (where no-one specifies which services are to be provided, so the provision of services is influenced by the market), whereas bus services within London are provided by the private sector in a regulated economic environment (where the public sector specifies the services to be provided and the private sector competes for the right to supply those services – i.e. franchising).

The regulation of public transport is often designed to achieve some social, geographic and temporal equity as market forces might otherwise lead to services being limited to the most popular travel times along the most densely settled corridors of development. National, regional or municipal taxes are often deployed to provide a network that is socially acceptable (e.g. extending timetables through the daytime, weekend, holiday or evening periods and intensifying the mesh of routes beyond that which a lightly regulated market would probably provide).

Franchising may be used to create a supply of transport that balances the free-market supply outcome and the most socially desirable supply outcome.

== Project appraisal and evaluation ==

The most sophisticated methods of project appraisal and evaluation have been developed and applied in the transport sector. The terms &quot;appraisal&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; are often confused in relation to the assessment of projects. Appraisal refers to &quot;ex ante&quot; (before the event) assessment and evaluation refers to &quot;ex post&quot; (after the event) assessment.

===Appraisal===

The appraisal of changes in the transport network is one of the most important applications of transport economics. In order to make an assessment of whether any given transport project should be carried out, transport economics can be used to compare the costs of the project with its benefits (both social and financial). Such an assessment is known as a cost-benefit analysis, and is usually a fundamental piece of information for decision-makers, as it places a value on the net benefits (or disbenefits) of schemes and generates a ratio of benefits to costs which may be used to prioritise projects when funding is constrained.

A primary difficulty in project appraisal is the valuation of time. Travel time savings are often cited as a key benefit of transport projects, but people in different occupations, carrying out different activities and in different social classes value time differently.

Appraising projects on the basis of their supposed reductions in travel times has come under scrutiny in recent years with the recognition that improvements in capacity generate trips that would not have been made (induced demand), partially eroding the benefits of reduced travel times. Therefore, an alternative method of appraisal is to measure changes in land value and consumer benefits from a transport project rather than the measuring benefits accruing to travellers themselves. However, this method of analysis is much more difficult to carry out.

Another problem is that many transport projects have impacts that cannot be expressed in monetary terms, such as impacts on, for example, local air quality, biodiversity and community severance. Whilst these impacts can be included in a detailed environmental impact assessment, a key issue has been how to present these assessments alongside estimates of those costs and benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms. Recent developments in transport appraisal practice in some European countries have seen the application of multi-criteria decision analysis based decision support tools. These build on existing cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment techniques and help decision makers weigh up the monetary and non-monetary impacts of transport projects. In the UK, one such application, the New Approach to Appraisal has become a cornerstone of UK transport appraisal.

===Evaluation===

The evaluation of projects enables decision makers to understand whether the benefits and costs that were estimated in the appraisal materialised. Successful project evaluation requires that the necessary data to carry out the evaluation is specified in advance of carrying out the appraisal.

The appraisal and evaluation of projects form stages within a broader policy making cycle that includes:
* identifying a rationale for a project
* specifying objectives
* appraisal
* monitoring implementation of a project
* evaluation
* feedback to inform future projects

==Social effects on poverty==

In the US those with low income living in cities face a problem called “poverty transportation.” The problem arises because many of the entry-level jobs which are sought out by those with little education are typically located in suburban areas. Those jobs are also not very accessible by public transportation because the transportation was often designed to move people around cities, which becomes a problem when the jobs are no longer located in the cities. Those who cannot afford cars inevitably suffer the worst, because they have no choice but to rely on public transport. The problem is illustrated by an estimation that 70% of entry-level jobs are located in the suburbs, while only 32% of those jobs are within a quarter mile of public transportation. More difficult (or more expensive) access to jobs and other goods &amp; services can act as a ghetto tax.

As a result of the transportation systems in use, but not adequately meeting the needs of those who rely on them, they tend to generate low revenue. And with minimal revenue or funding the transportation systems are forced to decrease service and increase fares, which causes those in poverty to face more inequality. Further those who live in cities with no public transportation become even more excluded from education and work. In places with no public transport a car is the only viable option and that creates unnecessary strain on the roads and environment.

Since automobile use tends to be greater than public transportation use, it also becomes the norm for people to work towards car ownership. Private car ownership has led to a large allocation of resources towards road and bridge maintenance. But underfunding of public transportation prevents everyone who needs transportation from having access to it. And those who can choose between public transportation and private transportation will choose private transportation rather than face the inconveniences of public transportation. The lack of customers willing to use public transport creates a cycle that ultimately never leads to the transportation systems making significant progress. Another reason for low private vehicle ownership among welfare recipients are the established asset limitations. In the U.S. the asset limit is $1000 per vehicle. This forces welfare recipients to purchase old and sub standard vehicles in order not to lose their welfare funding.

There are a number of ways in which public transportation could be improved and for it to become a better and more enticing option for other people who do not necessarily depend on it. Some of these include creating networks of overlapping routes even among different operators to give people more choice in where and how they want to go somewhere. The system should also function as a whole, to prevent drivers from dangerously racing along routes to increase profit. Providing incentives to use public transportation can also be beneficial, as ridership increases the transportation systems can appropriately respond by increasing the frequency along those transportation routes. Even creating bus only lanes or priority lanes at intersections could improve service and speed.

Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. Bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate the poverty in poor nations.

==Car taxation==
Car taxation is an instrument to influence the purchase decisions of consumers. Taxes can be differentiated to support the market introduction of fuel efficient and low carbon dioxide (CO2) emitting cars.

The European Union Commission has made a proposal for a Council Directive on passenger car taxation which is currently before the Council and Parliament.

The Commission encourages again Member States to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and to adapt their car taxation policies so as to promote the purchase of fuel efficient cars throughout the EU and help manufacturers respect the upcoming fuel efficiency framework, thus contributing their share to reducing the CO2 emissions of cars. Taxes differentiated over the whole range of cars on the market, so as to gradually induce a switch towards less emitting cars, would be an efficient way to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers.

===Tax rates on acquisition===

In 2011, for a brand new VW Golf Trendline (80 PS, 5G 2T) the taxation rate (all inclusive, i.e. VAT+registration tax+any other taxes) on acquisition was as follows:

<doc id="51117" wikidata="Q220620" url="?curid=51117" title="Meissner effect">
<text>In condensed-matter physics, the Meissner effect (or Meißner–Ochsenfeld effect) is the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor during its transition to the superconducting state when it is cooled below the critical temperature. This expulsion will repel a nearby magnet.

The German physicists Walther Meißner (anglicized &quot;Meissner&quot;) and Robert Ochsenfeld discovered this phenomenon in 1933 by measuring the magnetic field distribution outside superconducting tin and lead samples. The samples, in the presence of an applied magnetic field, were cooled below their superconducting transition temperature, whereupon the samples cancelled nearly all interior magnetic fields. They detected this effect only indirectly because the magnetic flux is conserved by a superconductor: when the interior field decreases, the exterior field increases. The experiment demonstrated for the first time that superconductors were more than just perfect conductors and provided a uniquely defining property of the superconductor state. The ability for the expulsion effect is determined by the nature of equilibrium formed by the neutralization within the unit cell of a superconductor.

A superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too strong. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. 
*In type-I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value &quot;Hc&quot;. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. 
*In type-II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value &quot;H&quot;&quot;c&quot;1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the electric current as long as the current is not too large. Some type-II superconductors exhibit a small but finite resistance in the mixed state due to motion of the flux vortices induced by the Lorentz forces from the current. As the cores of the vortices are normal electrons, their motion will have dissipation. At a second critical field strength &quot;H&quot;&quot;c&quot;2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized.

Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are type II.

==Explanation==

The Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London, who showed that the electromagnetic free energy in a superconductor is minimized provided

:formula_1

where H is the magnetic field and λ is the London penetration depth.

This equation, known as the London equation, predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor decays exponentially from whatever value it possesses at the surface. This exclusion of magnetic field is a manifestation of the superdiamagnetism emerged during the phase transition from conductor to superconductor, for example by reducing the temperature below critical temperature.

In a weak applied field (less than the critical field that breaks down the superconducting phase), a superconductor expels nearly all magnetic flux by setting up electric currents near its surface, as the magnetic field H induces magnetization M within the London penetration depth from the surface. These surface currents shield the internal bulk of the superconductor from the external applied field. As the field expulsion, or cancellation, does not change with time, the currents producing this effect (called persistent currents or screening currents) do not decay with time.

Near the surface, within the London penetration depth, the magnetic field is not completely canceled. Each superconducting material has its own characteristic penetration depth.

Any perfect conductor will prevent any change to magnetic flux passing through its surface due to ordinary electromagnetic induction at zero resistance. However, the Meissner effect is distinct from this: when an ordinary conductor is cooled so that it makes the transition to a superconducting state in the presence of a constant applied magnetic field, the magnetic flux is expelled during the transition. This effect cannot be explained by infinite conductivity, but only by the London equation. The placement and subsequent levitation of a magnet above an already superconducting material does not demonstrate the Meissner effect, while an initially stationary magnet later being repelled by a superconductor as it is cooled below its critical temperature does.

The persisting currents that exist in the superconductor to expel the magnetic field is commonly misconceived as a result of Lenz&#x27;s Law or Faraday&#x27;s Law. A reason this is not the case is that no change in flux was made to induce the current. Another explanation is that since the superconductor experiences zero resistance, there cannot be an induced emf in the superconductor. The persisting current therefore is not a result of Faraday&#x27;s Law.

==Perfect diamagnetism==
Superconductors in the Meissner state exhibit perfect diamagnetism, or superdiamagnetism, meaning that the total magnetic field is very close to zero deep inside them (many penetration depths from the surface). This means that their volume magnetic susceptibility is formula_2 = −1. Diamagnetics are defined by the generation of a spontaneous magnetization of a material which directly opposes the direction of an applied field. However, the fundamental origins of diamagnetism in superconductors and normal materials are very different. In normal materials diamagnetism arises as a direct result of the orbital spin of electrons about the nuclei of an atom induced electromagnetically by the application of an applied field. In superconductors the illusion of perfect diamagnetism arises from persistent screening currents which flow to oppose the applied field (the Meissner effect); not solely the orbital spin.

==Consequences==
The discovery of the Meissner effect led to the phenomenological theory of superconductivity by Fritz and Heinz London in 1935. This theory explained resistanceless transport and the Meissner effect, and allowed the first theoretical predictions for superconductivity to be made. However, this theory only explained experimental observations—it did not allow the microscopic origins of the superconducting properties to be identified. This was done successfully by the BCS theory in 1957, from which the penetration depth and the Meissner effect result. However, some physicists argue that BCS theory does not explain the Meissner effect.

==Paradigm for the Higgs mechanism==
The Meissner superconductivity effect serves as an important paradigm for the generation mechanism of a mass &quot;M&quot; (i.e., a reciprocal &quot;range&quot;, formula_3 where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light) for a gauge field. In fact, this analogy is an abelian example for the Higgs mechanism, which generates the masses of the electroweak and gauge particles in high-energy physics. The length formula_4 is identical with the London penetration depth in the theory of superconductivity.

<doc id="51119" wikidata="Q459381" url="?curid=51119" title="Literary theory">
<text>Literary theory is the systematic study of the nature of literature and of the methods for literary analysis. Since the 19th century, literary scholarship includes literary theory and considerations of intellectual history, moral philosophy, social philosophy, and interdisciplinary themes relevant to how people interpret meaning. In the humanities in modern academia, the latter style of literary scholarship is an offshoot of post-structuralism. Consequently, the word &quot;theory&quot; became an umbrella term for scholarly approaches to reading texts, some of which are informed by strands of semiotics, cultural studies, philosophy of language, and continental philosophy, often witnessed within Western canon along with some postmodernist theory.

==History==

The practice of literary theory became a profession in the 20th century, but it has historical roots that run as far back as ancient Greece (Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; is an often cited early example), ancient India (Bharata Muni&#x27;s &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;), and ancient Rome (Longinus&#x27;s &quot;On the Sublime&quot;). In medieval times, scholars in the Middle East (Al-Jahiz&#x27;s &quot;al-Bayan wa-&#x27;l-tabyin&quot; and &quot;al-Hayawan&quot;, and ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Badi&quot;) and Europe continued to produce works based on literary studies. The aesthetic theories of philosophers from ancient philosophy through the 18th and 19th centuries are important influences on current literary study. The theory and criticism of literature are tied to the history of literature.

Some scholars, both theoretical and anti-theoretical, refer to the 1980s and 1990s debates on the academic merits of theory as &quot;the theory wars&quot;. Proponents and critics of the turn to theory take different (and often conflicting) positions about what counts as a theory or what it means to theorize within/about/alongside literature or other cultural creations.

==Overview==
One of the fundamental questions of literary theory is &quot;what is literature?&quot; and &quot;how should or do we read?&quot; – although some contemporary theorists and literary scholars believe either that &quot;literature&quot; cannot be defined or that it can refer to any use of language. Specific theories are distinguished not only by their methods and conclusions, but even by how they create meaning in a &quot;text&quot;. However, some theorists acknowledge that these texts do not have a singular, fixed meaning which is deemed &quot;correct&quot;.

Since theorists of literature often draw on very heterogeneous traditions of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Broad schools of theory that have historically been important include historical and biographical criticism, New Criticism, formalism, Russian formalism, and structuralism, post-structuralism, Marxism or historical materialism, feminism and French feminism, post-colonialism, new historicism, deconstruction, reader-response criticism, narratology and psychoanalytic criticism.

== Differences among schools ==

The different interpretive and epistemological perspectives of different schools of theory often arise from, and so give support to, different moral and political commitments. For instance, the work of the New Critics often contained an implicit moral dimension, and sometimes even a religious one: a New Critic might read a poem by T. S. Eliot or Gerard Manley Hopkins for its degree of honesty in expressing the torment and contradiction of a serious search for belief in the modern world. Meanwhile, a Marxist critic might find such judgments merely ideological rather than critical; the Marxist would say that the New Critical reading did not keep enough. Or a post-structuralist critic might simply avoid the issue by understanding the religious meaning of a poem as an allegory of meaning, treating the poem&#x27;s references to &quot;God&quot; by discussing their referential nature rather than what they refer to.

Such a disagreement cannot be easily resolved, because it is inherent in the radically different terms and goals (that is, the theories) of the critics. Their theories of reading derive from vastly different intellectual traditions: the New Critic bases his work on an East-Coast American scholarly and religious tradition, while the Marxist derives his thought from a body of critical social and economic thought, the post-structuralist&#x27;s work emerges from twentieth-century Continental philosophy of language.

In the late 1950s, the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye attempted to establish an approach for reconciling historical criticism and New Criticism while addressing concerns of early reader-response and numerous psychological and social approaches. His approach, laid out in his &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot;, was explicitly structuralist, relying on the assumption of an intertextual &quot;order of words&quot; and universality of certain structural types. His approach held sway in English literature programs for several decades but lost favor during the ascendance of post-structuralism.

For some theories of literature (especially certain kinds of formalism), the distinction between &quot;literary&quot; and other sorts of texts is of paramount importance. Other schools (particularly post-structuralism in its various forms: new historicism, deconstruction, some strains of Marxism and feminism) have sought to break down distinctions between the two and have applied the tools of textual interpretation to a wide range of &quot;texts&quot;, including film, non-fiction, historical writing, and even cultural events.

Mikhail Bakhtin argued that the &quot;utter inadequacy&quot; of literary theory is evident when it is forced to deal with the novel; while other genres are fairly stabilized, the novel is still developing.

Another crucial distinction among the various theories of literary interpretation is intentionality, the amount of weight given to the author&#x27;s own opinions about and intentions for a work. For most pre-20th century approaches, the author&#x27;s intentions are a guiding factor and an important determiner of the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation of texts. The New Criticism was the first school to disavow the role of the author in interpreting texts, preferring to focus on &quot;the text itself&quot; in a close reading. In fact, as much contention as there is between formalism and later schools, they share the tenet that the author&#x27;s interpretation of a work is no more inherently meaningful than any other.

==Schools==
Listed below are some of the most commonly identified schools of literary theory, along with their major authors:

* Aestheticism – associated with Romanticism, a philosophy defining aesthetic value as the primary goal in understanding literature. This includes both literary critics who have tried to understand and/or identify aesthetic values and those like Oscar Wilde who have stressed art for art&#x27;s sake.
** Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, Harold Bloom
* African-American literary theory
* American pragmatism and other American approaches
** Harold Bloom, Stanley Fish, Richard Rorty
* Cognitive literary theory – applies research in cognitive science and philosophy of mind to the study of literature and culture.
** Frederick Luis Aldama, Mary Thomas Crane, Nancy Easterlin, William Flesch, David Herman, Suzanne Keen, Patrick Colm Hogan, Alan Richardson, Ellen Spolsky, Blakey Vermeule, Lisa Zunshine
* Cambridge criticism – close examination of the literary text and the relation of literature to social issues
**I.A. Richards, F.R. Leavis, Q.D. Leavis, William Empson.
* Critical race theory
* Cultural studies – emphasizes the role of literature in everyday life 
** Raymond Williams, Dick Hebdige, and Stuart Hall (British Cultural Studies); Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno; Michel de Certeau; also Paul Gilroy, John Guillory
*Darwinian literary studies – situates literature in the context of evolution and natural selection
* Deconstruction – a strategy of &quot;close&quot; reading that elicits the ways that key terms and concepts may be paradoxical or self-undermining, rendering their meaning undecidable
** Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Gayatri Spivak, Avital Ronell
* Descriptive poetics
** Brian McHale
*Feminist literary criticism
* Eco-criticism – explores cultural connections and human relationships to the natural world
* Gender (see feminist literary criticism) – which emphasizes themes of gender relations
** Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, Hélène Cixous, Julia Kristeva, Elaine Showalter
* Formalism – a school of literary criticism and literary theory having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text
* German hermeneutics and philology

<text>A genre of arts criticism, literary criticism or literary studies is the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature. Modern literary criticism is often influenced by literary theory, which is the philosophical analysis of literature&#x27;s goals and methods. Although the two activities are closely related, literary critics are not always, and have not always been, theorists.

Whether or not literary criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from literary theory is a matter of some controversy. For example, &quot;The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism&quot; draws no distinction between literary theory and literary criticism, and almost always uses the terms together to describe the same concept. Some critics consider literary criticism a practical application of literary theory, because criticism always deals directly with particular literary works, while theory may be more general or abstract.

Literary criticism is often published in essay or book form. Academic literary critics teach in literature departments and publish in academic journals, and more popular critics publish their reviews in broadly circulating periodicals such as &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, the &quot;Dublin Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Bookforum&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

== History ==
=== Classical and medieval criticism ===
Literary criticism is thought to have existed as far back as the classical period. In the 4th century BC Aristotle wrote the &quot;Poetics&quot;, a typology and explanation along with understanding of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. &quot;Poetics&quot; developed for the first time the concepts of mimesis and catharsis, which are still crucial in literary studies.

Later classical and medieval criticism often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of hermeneutics and textual exegesis have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of the three Abrahamic religions: Jewish literature, Christian literature and Islamic literature.

Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval Arabic literature and Arabic poetry from the 9th century, notably by Al-Jahiz in his &quot;al-Bayan wa-&#x27;l-tabyin&quot; and &quot;al-Hayawan&quot;, and by Abdullah ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz in his &quot;Kitab al-Badi&quot;.

=== Renaissance criticism ===
The literary criticism of the Renaissance developed classical ideas of unity of form and content into literary neoclassicism, proclaiming literature as central to culture, entrusting the poet and the author with preservation of a long literary tradition. The birth of Renaissance criticism was in 1498, with the recovery of classic texts, most notably, Giorgio Valla&#x27;s Latin translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. The work of Aristotle, especially &quot;Poetics&quot;, was the most important influence upon literary criticism until the late eighteenth century. Lodovico Castelvetro was one of the most influential Renaissance critics who wrote commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; in 1570.

=== Baroque criticism ===
The seventeenth-century witnessed the first full-fledged crisis in modernity of the core critical-aesthetic principles inherited from classical antiquity, such as proportion, harmony, unity, decorum, that had long governed, guaranteed, and stabilized Western thinking about artworks. Although Classicism was very far from spent as a cultural force, it was to be gradually challenged by a rival movement, namely Baroque, that favoured the transgressive and the extreme, without laying claim to the unity, harmony, or decorum that supposedly distinguished both nature and its greatest imitator, namely ancient art. The key concepts of the Baroque aesthetic, such as &quot;conceit&#x27; (&quot;concetto&quot;), &quot;wit&quot; (&quot;acutezza&quot;, &quot;ingegno&quot;), and &quot;wonder&quot; (&quot;meraviglia&quot;), were not fully developed in literary theory until the publication of Emanuele Tesauro&#x27;s &quot;Il Cannocchiale aristotelico&quot; (The Aristotelian Telescope) in 1654. This seminal treatise – inspired by Giambattista Marino&#x27;s epic &quot;Adone&quot; and the work of the Spanish Jesuit philosopher Baltasar Gracián – developed a theory of metaphor as a universal language of images and as a supreme intellectual act, at once an artifice and an epistemologically privileged mode of access to truth.

=== Enlightenment criticism ===
In the Enlightenment period (1700s–1800s), literary criticism became more popular. During this time literacy rates started to rise in the public; no longer was reading exclusive for the wealthy or scholarly. With the rise of the literate public, the swiftness of printing and commercialization of literature, criticism arose too. Reading was no longer viewed solely as educational or as a sacred source of religion; it was a form of entertainment. Literary criticism was influenced by the values and stylistic writing, including clear, bold, precise writing and the more controversial criteria of the author&#x27;s religious beliefs. These critical reviews were published in many magazines, newspapers, and journals. The commercialization of literature and its mass production had its downside. The emergent literary market, which was expected to educate the public and keep them away from superstition and prejudice, increasingly diverged from the idealistic control of the Enlightenment theoreticians so that the business of Enlightenment became a business with the Enlightenment. This development – particularly of emergence of entertainment literature – was addressed through an intensification of criticism. Many works of Jonathan Swift, for instance, were criticized including his book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, which one critic described as &quot;the detestable story of the Yahoos&quot;.

=== 19th-century Romantic criticism ===
The British Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new aesthetic ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could enlighten and add to the knowledge of a common subject to the level of the sublime. German Romanticism, which followed closely after the late development of German classicism, emphasized an understanding and beauty of fragmentation that can appear startlingly modern to the reader of English literature, and valued &quot;Witz&quot; – that is, &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;humor&quot; of a certain sort – more highly than the serious Anglophone Romanticism. The late nineteenth century brought renown to authors known more for their literary criticism than for their own literary work, such as Matthew Arnold.

=== The New Criticism ===
However important all of these aesthetic movements were as antecedents, current ideas about literary criticism derive almost entirely from the new direction taken in the early twentieth century. Early in the century the school of criticism known as Russian Formalism, and slightly later the New Criticism in Britain and in the United States, came to dominate the study and discussion of literature in the English-speaking world. Both schools emphasized the close reading of texts, elevating it far above generalizing discussion and speculation about either authorial intention (to say nothing of the author&#x27;s psychology or biography, which became almost taboo subjects) or reader response: together known as Wimsatt and Beardsley&#x27;s intentional fallacy and affective fallacy. This emphasis on form and precise attention to &quot;the words themselves&quot; has persisted, after the decline of these critical doctrines themselves.

=== Theory ===
In 1957 Northrop Frye published the influential &quot;Anatomy of Criticism&quot;. In his works Frye noted that some critics tend to embrace an ideology, and to judge literary pieces on the basis of their adherence to such ideology. This has been a highly influential viewpoint among modern conservative thinkers. E. Michael Jones, for example, argues in his &quot;Degenerate Moderns&quot; that Stanley Fish was influenced by his own adulterous affairs to reject classic literature that condemned adultery. Jürgen Habermas, in &quot;Erkenntnis und Interesse&quot; [1968] (&quot;Knowledge and Human Interests&quot;), described literary critical theory in literary studies as a form of hermeneutics: knowledge via interpretation to understand the meaning of human texts and symbolic expressionsincluding the interpretation of texts which themselves interpret other texts.

In the British and American literary establishment, the New Criticism was more or less dominant until the late 1960s. Around that time Anglo-American university literature departments began to witness a rise of a more explicitly philosophical literary theory, influenced by structuralism, then post-structuralism, and other kinds of Continental philosophy. It continued until the 1990s when interest in &quot;concept&quot; peaked. Many later critics, though undoubtedly still influenced by theoretical work, have been comfortable simply interpreting literature rather than writing explicitly about methodology and philosophical presumptions.

=== Current state ===
Today, approaches based in literary theory and continental philosophy largely coexist in university literature departments, while conventional methods, some informed by the New Critics, also remain active. Disagreements over the goals and methods of literary criticism, which characterized both sides taken by critics during the &quot;rise&quot; of theory, have declined.

Some critics work largely with theoretical texts, while others read traditional literature; interest in the literary canon is still great, but many critics are also interested in nontraditional texts and women&#x27;s literature, as elaborated on by certain academic journals such as &quot;Contemporary Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;, while some critics influenced by cultural studies read popular texts like comic books or pulp/genre fiction. Ecocritics have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. Darwinian literary studies studies literature in the context of evolutionary influences on human nature. And postcritique has sought to develop new ways of reading and responding to literary texts that go beyond the interpretive methods of critique. Many literary critics also work in film criticism or media studies.

=== History of the book ===
Related to other forms of literary criticism, the history of the book is a field of an inter-disciplinary inquiry drawing on the methods of bibliography, cultural history, history of literature, and media theory. Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.

Among the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.

<text>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (). The one extant family, the Manidae, has three genera: &quot;Manis&quot;, &quot;Phataginus&quot;, and &quot;Smutsia&quot;. &quot;Manis&quot; comprises four species found in Asia, while &quot;Phataginus&quot; and &quot;Smutsia&quot; include two species each, all found in sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from . Several extinct pangolin species are also known. In September 2023, nine species were reported.

Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and toenails, covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. Depending on the species, they live in hollow trees or burrows. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years. Pangolins superficially resemble armadillos, though the two are not closely related; they have undergone convergent evolution.

Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world. , there are eight species of pangolin whose conservation status is listed in the threatened tier. Three (&quot;Manis culionensis&quot;, &quot;M. pentadactyla&quot; and &quot;M. javanica&quot;) are critically endangered, three (&quot;Phataginus tricuspis&quot;, &quot;Manis crassicaudata&quot; and &quot;Smutsia gigantea&quot;) are endangered and two (&quot;Phataginus tetradactyla&quot; and &quot;Smutsia temminckii&quot;) are vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

== Etymology ==
The name of order Pholidota comes from Ancient Greek – &quot;clad in scales&quot; from &quot;pholís&quot; &quot;scale&quot;.

The name &quot;pangolin&quot; comes from the Malay word &quot;pengguling&quot; meaning &quot;one who rolls up&quot; from &quot;guling&quot; or &quot;giling&quot; &quot;to roll&quot;; it was used for the Sunda pangolin (&quot;Manis javanica&quot;). However, the modern name is &quot;tenggiling&quot;. In Javanese, it is &quot;terenggiling&quot;; and in the Philippine languages, it is &quot;goling&quot;, &quot;tanggiling&quot;, or &quot;balintong&quot; (with the same meaning).

In ancient India, according to Aelian, it was known as the &quot;phattáges&quot; (φαττάγης).

== Description ==

The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large, hardened, overlapping, plate-like scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal matures. They are made of keratin, the same material from which human fingernails and tetrapod claws are made, and are structurally and compositionally very different from the scales of reptiles. The pangolin&#x27;s scaled body is comparable in appearance to a pine cone. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armor, while it protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defense from predators.

Pangolins can emit a noxious-smelling chemical from glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a skunk. They have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing into ant and termite mounds and for climbing.

The tongues of pangolins are extremely long, and like those of the giant anteater and the tube-lipped nectar bat, the root of the tongue is not attached to the hyoid bone but is in the thorax between the sternum and the trachea. Large pangolins can extend their tongues as much as , with a diameter of only about .

==Behaviour==

Most pangolins are nocturnal animals which use their well-developed sense of smell to find insects. The long-tailed pangolin is also active by day, while other species of pangolins spend most of the daytime sleeping, curled up into a ball (&quot;volvation&quot;).

Arboreal pangolins live in hollow trees, whereas the ground-dwelling species dig tunnels to a depth of .

Some pangolins walk with their front claws bent under the foot pad, although they use the entire foot pad on their rear limbs. Furthermore, some exhibit a bipedal stance for some behavior, and may walk a few steps bipedally. Pangolins are also good swimmers.

===Diet===
Pangolins are insectivorous. Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only one or two species of insects, even when many species are available. A pangolin can consume of insects per day. Pangolins are an important regulator of termite populations in their natural habitats.

Pangolins have very poor vision. They also lack teeth. They rely heavily on smell and hearing, and they have other physical characteristics to help them eat ants and termites. Their skeletal structure is sturdy and they have strong front legs used for tearing into termite mounds. They use their powerful front claws to dig into trees, soil, and vegetation to find prey, then proceed to use their long tongues to probe inside the insect tunnels and to retrieve their prey.

The structure of their tongue and stomach is key to aiding pangolins in obtaining and digesting insects. Their saliva is sticky, causing ants and termites to stick to their long tongues when they are hunting through insect tunnels. Without teeth, pangolins cannot also chew; but while foraging, they ingest small stones (gastroliths), which accumulate in their stomachs to help to grind up ants. This part of their stomach is called the gizzard, and it is also covered in keratinous spines. These spines further aid in the grinding up and digestion of the pangolin&#x27;s prey.

Some species, such as the tree pangolin, use their strong, prehensile tails to hang from tree branches and strip away bark from the trunk, exposing insect nests inside.

===Reproduction===
Pangolins are solitary and meet only to have sex, with mating typically taking place at night after the male and female pangolin meet near a watering hole. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 40% more. While the mating season is not defined, they typically mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Rather than the males seeking out the females, males mark their location with urine or feces and the females find them. If competition over a female occurs, the males use their tails as clubs to fight for the opportunity to mate with her.

Gestation periods differ by species, ranging from roughly 70 to 140 days. African pangolin females usually give birth to a single offspring at a time, but the Asiatic species may give birth to from one to three. Weight at birth is , and the average length is . At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother&#x27;s tail as she moves about, although, in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first two to four weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother&#x27;s back. Weaning takes place around three months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At two years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.

===Phylogeny===
====Among placentals====
The order Pholidota was long considered to be the sister taxon to Xenarthra (neotropical anteaters, sloths, and armadillos), but recent genetic evidence indicates their closest living relatives are the carnivorans, with which they form a clade, the Ferae. Palaeanodonts are even closer relatives to pangolins, being classified with pangolins in the clade Pholidotamorpha. The split between carnivorans and pangolins is estimated to have occurred 79.47 Ma (million years) ago.

====Among Manidae====
The first dichotomy in the phylogeny of extant Manidae separates Asian pangolins (&quot;Manis&quot;) from African pangolins (&quot;Smutsia&quot; and &quot;Phataginus&quot;). Within the former, &quot;Manis pentadactyla&quot; is the sister group to a clade comprising &quot;M. crassicaudata&quot; and &quot;M. javanica&quot;. Within the latter, a split separates the large terrestrial African pangolins of the genus &quot;Smutsia&quot; from the small arboreal African pangolins of the genus &quot;Phataginus&quot;.

Asian and African pangolins are thought to have diverged about 41.37 Ma ago. Moreover, the basal position of &quot;Manis&quot; within Pholidota suggests the group originated in Eurasia, consistent with their laurasiatherian phylogeny.

==Threats==

Pangolins are in high demand in southern China and Vietnam because their scales are believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicine. Their meat is also considered a delicacy. 100,000 are estimated to be trafficked a year to China and Vietnam, amounting to over one million over the past decade. This makes them the most trafficked animal in the world. This, coupled with deforestation, has led to a large decrease in the numbers of pangolins. Some species, such as &quot;Manis pentadactyla&quot; have become commercially extinct in certain ranges as a result of overhunting. In November 2010, pangolins were added to the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s list of evolutionarily distinct and endangered mammals. All eight species of pangolin are assessed as threatened by the IUCN, while three are classified as critically endangered. All pangolin species are currently listed under Appendix I of CITES which prohibits international trade, except when the product is intended for non-commercial purposes and a permit has been granted.

China had been the main destination country for pangolins until 2018, where it was surpassed by Vietnam. In 2019, Vietnam was reported to have seized the largest volumes of pangolin scales, surpassing Nigeria that year.

Pangolins are also hunted and eaten in Ghana and are one of the more popular types of bushmeat, while local healers use the pangolin as a source of traditional medicine.

Though pangolins are protected by an international ban on their trade, populations have suffered from illegal trafficking due to beliefs in East Asia that their ground-up scales can stimulate lactation or cure cancer or asthma. In the past decade, numerous seizures of illegally trafficked pangolin and pangolin meat have taken place in Asia. In one such incident in April 2013, of pangolin meat were seized from a Chinese vessel that ran aground in the Philippines. In another case in August 2016, an Indonesian man was arrested after police raided his home and found over 650 pangolins in freezers on his property. The same threat is reported in Nigeria, where the animal is on the verge of extinction due to overexploitation. The overexploitation comes from hunting pangolins for game meat and the reduction of their forest habitats due to deforestation caused by timber harvesting. The pangolin are hunted as game meat for both medicinal purposes and food consumption.

== Virology ==
=== COVID-19 infection ===
The nucleic acid sequence of a specific receptor-binding domain of the spike protein belonging to coronaviruses taken from pangolins was found to be a 99% match with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes COVID-19 and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers in Guangzhou, China, hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 had originated in bats, and prior to infecting humans, was circulating among pangolins. The illicit Chinese trade of pangolins for use in traditional Chinese medicine was suggested as a vector for human transmission. However, whole-genome comparison found that the pangolin and human share only up to 92% of their RNA. Ecologists worried that the early speculation about pangolins being the source may have led to mass slaughters, endangering them further, which was similar to what happened to Asian palm civets during the SARS outbreak. It was later proved that the testing which suggested that pangolins were a potential host for the virus was flawed, when genetic analysis showed that the spike protein and its binding to receptors in pangolins had minimal effect from the virus, and therefore were not likely mechanisms for COVID-19 infections in humans.

=== &quot;Pestivirus&quot; and &quot;Coltivirus&quot; ===
In 2020, two novel RNA viruses distantly related to pestiviruses and coltiviruses have been detected in the genomes of dead &quot;Manis javanica&quot; and &quot;Manis pentadactyla&quot;. To refer to both sampling site and hosts, they were named Dongyang pangolin virus (DYPV) and Lishui pangolin virus (LSPV). The DYPV pestivirus was also identified in &quot;Amblyomma javanense&quot; nymph ticks from a diseased pangolin.

==Folk medicine==
Pangolin scales and flesh are used as ingredients for various traditional Chinese medicine preparations. While no scientific evidence exists for the efficacy of those practices, and they have no logical mechanism of action, their popularity still drives the black market for animal body parts, despite concerns about toxicity, transmission of diseases from animals to humans, and species extermination. The ongoing demand for parts as ingredients continues to fuel pangolin poaching, hunting and trading.

The first record of pangolin scales occurs in &quot;Ben Cao Jinji Zhu&quot; (&quot;Variorum of Shennong&#x27;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot;, 500 CE), which recommends pangolin scales for protection against ant bites; burning the scales as a cure for people crying hysterically during the night. During the Tang dynasty, a recipe for expelling evil spirits with a formulation of scales, herbs, and minerals appeared in 682, and in 752 CE the idea that pangolin scales could also stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, one of the main uses today, was recommended in the &quot;Wai Tai Mi Yao&quot; (&quot;Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library&quot;). In the Song dynasty, the notion of penetrating and clearing blockages was emphasized in the &quot;Taiping sheng hui fan&quot; (&quot;Formulas from Benevolent Sages Compiled During the Era of Peace and Tranquility&quot;), compiled by Wang Huaiyin in 992.

In the 21st century, the main uses of pangolin scales are quackery practices based on unproven claims the scales dissolve blood clots, promote blood circulation, or help lactating women secrete milk. The supposed health effects of pangolin meat and scales claimed by folk medicine practitioners are based on their consumption of ants, long tongues, and protective scales.

The official pharmacopoeia of the People&#x27;s Republic of China included Chinese pangolin scales as an ingredient in TCM formulations. Pangolins were removed from the pharmacopoeia starting from the first half of 2020. Although pangolin scales have been removed from the list of raw ingredients, the scales are still listed as a key ingredient in various medicines.

Pangolin parts are also used for medicinal purposes in other Asian countries such as India, Nepal and Pakistan. In some parts of India and Nepal, locals believe that wearing the scales of a pangolin can help prevent pneumonia. Pangolin scales have also been used for medicinal purposes in Malaysia, Indonesia and northern Myanmar. Indigenous people in southern Palawan, Philippines, have held the belief that elders could avoid prostate illnesses by wearing belts made with the scales.

==Conservation==
As a result of increasing threats to pangolins, mainly in the form of illegal, international trade in pangolin skin, scales, and meat, these species have received increasing conservation attention in recent years. , the IUCN considered all eight species of pangolin on its Red List of Threatened Species as threatened. The IUCN SSC Pangolin Specialist Group launched a global action plan to conserve pangolins, dubbed &quot;Scaling up Pangolin Conservation&quot;, in July 2014. This action plan aims to improve all aspects of pangolin conservation with an added emphasis on combating poaching and trafficking of the animal while educating communities on its importance. Another suggested approach to fighting pangolin (and general wildlife) trafficking consists in &quot;following the money&quot; rather than &quot;the animal&quot;, which aims to disrupt smugglers&#x27; profits by interrupting money flows. Financial intelligence gathering could thus become a key tool in protecting these animals, although this opportunity is often overlooked. In 2018, a Chinese NGO launched the Counting Pangolins movement, calling for joint efforts to save the mammals from trafficking. Wildlife conservation group TRAFFIC has identified 159 smuggling routes used by pangolin traffickers and aims to shut these down.

Many attempts have been made to breed pangolins in captivity, but due to their reliance on wide-ranging habitats and very particular diets, these attempts are often unsuccessful. Pangolins have significantly decreased immune responses due to a genetic dysfunction, making them extremely fragile. They are susceptible to diseases such as pneumonia and the development of ulcers in captivity, complications that can lead to an early death. In addition, pangolins rescued from illegal trade often have a higher chance of being infected with parasites such as intestinal worms, further lessening their chance for rehabilitation and reintroduction to the wild.

The idea of farming pangolins to reduce the number being illegally trafficked is being explored with little success. The third Saturday in February is promoted as World Pangolin Day by the conservation NPO Annamiticus. World Pangolin Day has been noted for its effectiveness in generating awareness about pangolins.

In 2017, Jackie Chan made a public service announcement called &quot;WildAid: Jackie Chan &amp; Pangolins (Kung Fu Pangolin)&quot;.

In December 2020, a study found that it is &quot;not too late&quot; to establish conservation efforts for Philippine pangolins (&quot;Manis culionensis&quot;), a species that is only found on the island province of Palawan.

===Taiwan===
Taiwan is one of the few conservation grounds for pangolins in the world after the country enacted the 1989 Wildlife Conservation Act. The introduction of Wildlife Rehabilitation Centers in places like Luanshan (Yanping Township) in Taitung and Xiulin townships in Hualien became important communities for protecting pangolins and their habitats and has greatly improved the survival of pangolins. These centers work with local aboriginal tribes and forest police in the National Police Agency to prevent poaching, trafficking, and smuggling of pangolins, especially to black markets in China. These centers have also helped to reveal the causes of death and injury among Taiwan&#x27;s pangolin population. Today, Taiwan has the highest population density of pangolins in the world.

<text>Pierrot ( , ; ), a stock character of pantomime and commedia dell&#x27;arte, has his origins in the late 17th-century Italian troupe of players performing in Paris and known as the Comédie-Italienne. The name is a diminutive of &quot;Pierre&quot; (Peter), using the suffix &quot;&quot; and derives from the Italian Pedrolino. His character in contemporary popular culture—in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts, as well as works for the stage, screen, and concert hall—is that of the sad clown, often pining for love of Columbine (who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Harlequin). Performing unmasked, with a whitened face, he wears a loose white blouse with large buttons and wide white pantaloons. Sometimes he appears with a frilled collaret and a hat, usually with a close-fitting crown and wide round brim and, more rarely, with a conical shape like a dunce&#x27;s cap.

Pierrot&#x27;s character developed from that of a buffoon to become an avatar of the disenfranchised. Many cultural movements found him amenable to their respective causes: Decadents turned him into a disillusioned foe of idealism; Symbolists saw him as a lonely fellow-sufferer; Modernists made him into a silent, alienated observer of the mysteries of the human condition. Much of that mythic quality (&quot;I&#x27;m Pierrot,&quot; said David Bowie: &quot;I&#x27;m Everyman&quot;) still adheres to the &quot;sad clown&quot; in the postmodern era.

==Origins: 17th century==

Pierrot is sometimes said to be a French variant of the sixteenth-century Italian Pedrolino, but the two types have little but their names (&quot;Little Pete&quot;) and social stations in common. Both are comic servants, but Pedrolino, as a so-called &quot;first&quot; Zanni, often acts with cunning and daring. an engine of the plot in the scenarios where he appears. Pierrot, on the other hand, as a &quot;second&quot;&#x27; Zanni, stands &quot;on the periphery of the action&quot;. He dispenses advice and courts his master&#x27;s young daughter, Columbine, bashfully.

His origins among the Italian players in France go back to Molière&#x27;s peasant Pierrot in &quot;Don Juan, or The Stone Guest&quot; (1665). In 1673, the Comédie-Italienne made its own contribution to the Don Juan legend with an &quot;Addendum to &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;&quot;, which included Molière&#x27;s Pierrot. Thereafter the character—sometimes a peasant, but more often now an Italianate &quot;second&quot; Zanni—appeared fairly regularly in the Italians&#x27; offerings, his role always taken by one Giuseppe Giaratone (or Geratoni, fl. 1639-1697).

Among the French dramatists writing roles for Pierrot were Jean de Palaprat, Claude-Ignace Brugière de Barante, Antoine Houdar de la Motte, and Jean-François Regnard. They present him as an anomaly among busy social personalities around him. Columbine laughs at his advances; his masters who are in pursuit of pretty young wives brush off his warnings to act their age. His isolation bears the pathos of Watteau&#x27;s portraits.

==18th century==

===France===

An Italian company was called back to Paris in 1716, and Pierrot was reincarnated by the actors Pierre-François Biancolelli (son of the Harlequin of the banished troupe of players) and, after Biancolelli abandoned the role, the celebrated Fabio Sticotti (1676–1741) and his son Antoine Jean (1715–1772). But the character seems to have been regarded as unimportant by this company, since he appears infrequently in its new plays.

The character appeared often in the 18th century on Parisian stages. Sometimes he spoke gibberish, sometimes the audience itself sang his lines, inscribed on placards held aloft. He could appear as a valet, a cook, or an adventurer; his character is not strictly defined.

In the 1720s, Pierrot came into his own. In plays such as &quot;Trophonius&#x27;s Cave&quot; (1722) and &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (1725), one meets an engaging Pierrot. The accomplished comic actor Jean-Baptiste Hamoche portrayed him with success. After 1733, he rarely appears in new plays.

Pierrot also appeared in the visual arts and in folksongs (&quot;Au clair de la lune&quot;). The art of Claude Gillot (&quot;Master André&#x27;s Tomb&quot; [c. 1717]), of Gillot&#x27;s students Watteau (&quot;Italian Actors&quot; [c. 1719]) and Nicolas Lancret (&quot;Italian Actors near a Fountain&quot; [c. 1719]), of Jean-Baptiste Oudry (&quot;Italian Actors in a Park&quot; [c. 1725]), of Philippe Mercier (&quot;Pierrot and Harlequin&quot; [n.d.]), and of Jean-Honoré Fragonard (&quot;A Boy as Pierrot&quot; [1776–1780]), features him prominently.

===England===
As early as 1673, just months after Pierrot had made his debut in the &quot;Addendum to &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;&quot;, Scaramouche Tiberio Fiorilli and a troupe assembled from the Comédie-Italienne entertained Londoners with selections from their Parisian repertoire. And in 1717, Pierrot&#x27;s name first appears in an English entertainment: a pantomime by John Rich entitled &quot;The Jealous Doctor; or, The Intriguing Dame&quot;. Thereafter, until the end of the century, Pierrot appeared fairly regularly in English pantomimes (which were originally mute harlequinades; in the 19th century, the harlequinade was a &quot;play within a play&quot; during the pantomime), finding his most notable interpreter in Carlo Delpini (1740–1828). Delpini, according to the popular-theater historian, M. Willson Disher, &quot;kept strictly to the idea of a creature so stupid as to think that if he raised his leg level with his shoulder he could use it as a gun.&quot; Pierrot was later displaced by the English clown.

===Denmark===
In 1800, a troupe of Italian players led by Pasquale Casorti performed in Dyrehavsbakken. Casorti&#x27;s son, Giuseppe (1749–1826), began appearing as Pierrot in pantomimes, which now had a formulaic plot structure. Pierrot is still a fixture at Bakken, at nearby Tivoli Gardens and Tivoli Friheden in Aarhus.

===Germany===
Ludwig Tieck&#x27;s &quot;The Topsy-Turvy World&quot; (1798) is an early—and highly successful—example of the introduction of the commedia dell&#x27;arte characters into parodic metatheater (Pierrot is a member of the audience watching the play).

===Spain===
The penetration of Pierrot and his companions of the &quot;commedia&quot; into Spain is documented in a painting by Goya, &quot;Itinerant Actors&quot; (1793). It foreshadows the work of such Spanish successors as Picasso and Fernand Pelez, both of whom also showed strong sympathy with the lives of traveling saltimbancos.

==19th century==

===Pantomime of Deburau at the Théâtre des Funambules===

The Théâtre des Funambules was a little theater licensed in its early years to present only mimed and acrobatic acts. It was the home, beginning in 1816, of Jean-Gaspard Deburau (1796–1846), the most famous Pierrot ever. He was immortalized by Jean-Louis Barrault in Marcel Carné&#x27;s film &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (1945).

Deburau, from the year 1825, was the only actor at the Funambules to play Pierrot, and he did so in several types of pantomime: rustic, melodramatic, &quot;realistic&quot;, and fantastic. His style, according to Louis Péricaud, formed &quot;an enormous contrast with the exuberance, the superabundance of gestures, of leaps, that ... his predecessors had employed&quot;. He altered the costume: he dispensed with the frilled collaret, substituted a skullcap for a hat, and greatly increased the wide cut of both blouse and trousers. Deburau&#x27;s Pierrot avoided the crude Pierrots—timid, sexless, lazy, and greedy—found in earlier pantomime.

The Funambules Pierrot appealed to audiences in the faery-tale style which incorporate the &quot;commedia&quot; types. The plot often hinged on Cassander&#x27;s pursuit of Harlequin and Columbine, having to deal with a clever and ambiguous Pierrot. Deburau early—about 1828—caught the attention of the Romantics. In 1842, Théophile Gautier published a fake review of a &quot;Shakespeare&quot; pantomime he claimed to have seen at the Funambules. It placed Pierrot in the company of over-reachers in high literature such as Don Juan or Macbeth.

===Pantomime after Baptiste: Charles Deburau, Paul Legrand, and their successors===

Deburau&#x27;s son, Jean-Charles (or, as he preferred, &quot;Charles&quot; [1829–1873]), assumed Pierrot&#x27;s blouse the year after his father died. Another important Pierrot of mid-century was Charles-Dominique-Martin Legrand, known as Paul Legrand (1816–1898; see photo at top of page). He began appearing at the Funambules as Pierrot in 1845.
Legrand left the Funambules in 1853 for the Folies-Nouvelles, which attracted the fashionable set, unlike the Funambules&#x27; working-class audiences. Legrand often appeared in realistic costume, his chalky face his only concession to tradition, leading some advocates of pantomime, such as Gautier, to lament that he was betraying the character of the type. Legrand&#x27;s Pierrot influenced future mimes.

===Pantomime and late 19th-century art===

====France====
;Popular and literary pantomime


In the 1880s and 1890s, the pantomime reached a type of apogee, and Pierrot became ubiquitous. Moreover, he acquired a female counterpart, Pierrette, who rivaled Columbine for his affections. A Cercle Funambulesque was founded in 1888, and Pierrot (sometimes played by female mimes, such as Félicia Mallet) dominated its productions until its demise in 1898. Sarah Bernhardt even donned Pierrot&#x27;s blouse for Jean Richepin&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot the Murderer&quot; (1883).

But French mimes and actors were not the only figures responsible for Pierrot&#x27;s ubiquity: the English Hanlon brothers (sometimes called the Hanlon-Lees), gymnasts and acrobats who had been schooled in the 1860s in pantomimes from Baptiste&#x27;s repertoire, traveled (and dazzled) the world well into the 20th century with their pantomimic sketches and extravaganzas featuring riotously nightmarish Pierrots. The Naturalists—Émile Zola especially, who wrote glowingly of them—were captivated by their art. Edmond de Goncourt modeled his acrobat-mimes in his &quot;The Zemganno Brothers&quot; (1879) upon them; J.-K. Huysmans (whose &quot;Against Nature&quot; [1884] would become Dorian Gray&#x27;s bible) and his friend Léon Hennique wrote their pantomime &quot;&quot; (1881) after seeing them perform at the Folies Bergère (and, in turn, Jules Laforgue wrote his pantomime &quot;Pierrot the Cut-Up&quot; [&quot;Pierrot fumiste&quot;, 1882] after reading the scenario by Huysmans and Hennique). It was in part through the enthusiasm that they excited, coupled with the Impressionists&#x27; taste for popular entertainment, such as the circus and the music-hall, as well as the new bohemianism that then reigned in artistic quarters such as Montmartre (and which was celebrated by such denizens as Adolphe Willette, whose cartoons and canvases are crowded with Pierrots)—it was through all this that Pierrot achieved almost unprecedented currency and visibility towards the end of the century.
;Visual arts, fiction, poetry, music, and film
He invaded the visual arts—not only in the work of Willette, but also in the illustrations and posters of Jules Chéret; in the engravings of Odilon Redon (&quot;The Swamp Flower: A Sad Human Head&quot; [1885]); and in the canvases of Georges Seurat (&quot;Pierrot with a White Pipe [Aman-Jean]&quot; [1883]; &quot;The Painter Aman-Jean as Pierrot&quot; [1883]), Léon Comerre (&quot;Pierrot&quot; [1884], &quot;Pierrot Playing the Mandolin&quot; [1884]), Henri Rousseau (&quot;A Carnival Night&quot; [1886]), Paul Cézanne (&quot;Mardi gras [Pierrot and Harlequin]&quot; [1888]), Fernand Pelez (&quot;Grimaces and Miseries&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Saltimbanques&quot; [1888]), Pablo Picasso (&quot;Pierrot and Columbine&quot; [1900]), Guillaume Seignac (&quot;Pierrot&#x27;s Embrace&quot; [1900]), Théophile Steinlen (&quot;Pierrot and the Cat&quot; [1889]), and Édouard Vuillard (&quot;The Black Pierrot&quot; [c. 1890]). The mime &quot;Tombre&quot; of Jean Richepin&#x27;s novel &quot;Nice People&quot; (&quot;Braves Gens&quot; [1886]) turned him into a pathetic and alcoholic &quot;phantom&quot;; Paul Verlaine imagined him as a gormandizing naïf in &quot;Pantomime&quot; (1869), then, like Tombre, as a lightning-lit specter in &quot;Pierrot&quot; (1868, pub. 1882). Laforgue put three of the &quot;complaints&quot; of his first published volume of poems (1885) into &quot;Lord&quot; Pierrot&#x27;s mouth—and dedicated his next book, &quot;The Imitation of Our Lady the Moon&quot; (1886), completely to Pierrot and his world (Pierrots were legion among the minor, now-forgotten poets: for samples, see Willette&#x27;s journal &quot;The Pierrot&quot;, which appeared between 1888 and 1889, then again in 1891). In the realm of song, Claude Debussy set both Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;Pantomime&quot; and Banville&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot&quot; (1842) to music in 1881 (not published until 1926)—the only precedents among works by major composers being the &quot;Pierrot&quot; section of Telemann&#x27;s &quot;Burlesque Overture&quot; (1717–22), Mozart&#x27;s 1783 &quot;Masquerade&quot; (in which Mozart himself took the role of Harlequin and his brother-in-law, Joseph Lange, that of Pierrot), and the &quot;Pierrot&quot; section of Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Carnival&quot; (1835). Even the embryonic art of the motion picture turned to Pierrot before the century was out: he appeared, not only in early celluloid shorts (Georges Méliès&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare&quot; [1896], &quot;The Magician&quot; [1898]; Alice Guy&#x27;s &quot;Arrival of Pierrette and Pierrot&quot; [1900], &quot;Pierrette&#x27;s Amorous Adventures&quot; [1900]; Ambroise-François Parnaland&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot&#x27;s Big Head/Pierrot&#x27;s Tongue&quot; [1900], &quot;Pierrot-Drinker&quot; [1900]), but also in Emile Reynaud&#x27;s Praxinoscope production of &quot;Poor Pierrot&quot; (1892), the first animated movie and the first hand-colored one.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, Félicien Rops depicted a grinning Pierrot who witnesses an unromantic backstage scene (&quot;Blowing Cupid&#x27;s Nose&quot; [1881]). James Ensor painted Pierrots obsessively, in various poses from prostrate to bowing his head in despondency, sometimes even with a smiling skeleton. The Belgian poet and dramatist Albert Giraud also identified with the Zanni: the fifty rondels of his &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; (&quot;Moonstruck Pierrot,&quot; 1884) inspired generations of composers (see Pierrot lunaire below), and his verse-play &quot;Pierrot-Narcissus&quot; (1887) offered a definitive portrait of the poet-dreamer. The choreographer Joseph Hansen staged the ballet &quot;Macabre Pierrot&quot; in 1884 in collaboration with the poet Théo Hannon.

====England====

Pierrot figured prominently in the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, and various writers referenced him in their poetry. Ethel Wright painted &quot;Bonjour, Pierrot!&quot; (a greeting to a dour clown sitting disconsolate with his dog) in 1893. The Pierrot of popular taste also spawned a uniquely English entertainment. In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex, resolved to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers, and called them the seaside Pierrots who, as late as the 1950s, performed on the piers of Brighton, Margate, and Blackpool. They inspired the Will Morris Pierrots, named after their Birmingham founder. They originated in the Smethwick area in the late 1890s and played to large audiences in the Midlands. Walter Westley Russell committed these performers to canvas in &quot;The Pierrots&quot; (c. 1900).

Pierrot&#x27;s mask claimed the attention of the great theater innovator Edward Gordon Craig. Craig&#x27;s involvement with the figure grew with time. In 1897, Craig, dressed as Pierrot, gave a quasi-impromptu stage-reading of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s story &quot;What the Moon Saw&quot; as part of a benefit performance for theater artists in need.

====Austria and Germany====
Although he lamented that &quot;the Pierrot figure was inherently alien to the German-speaking world&quot;, the playwright Franz Blei introduced him enthusiastically into his playlet &quot;The Kissy-Face: A Columbiade&quot; (1895), and his fellow-Austrians Richard Specht and Richard Beer-Hofmann made an effort to naturalize Pierrot—in their plays &quot;Pierrot-Hunchback&quot; (1896) and &quot;Pierrot-Hypnotist&quot; (1892, first pub. 1984), respectively—by linking his fortunes with those of Goethe&#x27;s Faust. Still others among their countrymen simply sidestepped the issue of naturalization: Hermann Bahr took his inspiration for his &quot;Pantomime of the Good Man&quot; (1893) directly from his encounter with the exclusively French Cercle Funambulesque; Rudolf Holzer set the action of his &quot;Puppet Loyalty&quot; (1899), unapologetically, in a fabulous Paris; and Karl Michael von Levetzow settled his &quot;Two Pierrots&quot; (1900) in the birthplace of Pierrot&#x27;s comedy, Italy.
In Germany, Frank Wedekind introduced the &quot;femme-fatale&quot; of his first &quot;Lulu&quot; play, &quot;Earth Spirit&quot; (1895), in a Pierrot costume. In a similar spirit, the painter Paul Hoecker put cheeky young men into Pierrot costumes to ape their complacent burgher elders in &quot;Pierrots with Pipes&quot; () and swilling champagne in &quot;Waiting Woman&quot; ().

====Italy====
Canio&#x27;s Pagliaccio in the famous opera (1892) by Leoncavallo is close enough to a Pierrot to deserve a mention here. Much less well-known is the work of two other composers—Mario Pasquale Costa and Vittorio Monti. Costa&#x27;s pantomime &quot;L&#x27;Histoire d&#x27;un Pierrot&quot; (&quot;Story of a Pierrot&quot;), which debuted in Paris in 1893, was so admired in its day that it eventually reached audiences on several continents, was paired with &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; by New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera Company in 1909, and was premiered as a film by Baldassarre Negroni in 1914. Its libretto, like that of Monti&#x27;s &quot;mimodrama&quot; &quot;Noël de Pierrot&quot; a.k.a. &quot;A Clown&#x27;s Christmas&quot; (1900), was written by Fernand Beissier, one of the founders of the Cercle Funambulesque. (Monti would go on to acquire his own fame by celebrating another spiritual outsider much akin to Pierrot—the Gypsy. His &quot;Csárdás&quot; [c. 1904], like &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, has found a secure place in the standard musical repertoire).

The portrait and genre painter Vittorio Matteo Corcos produced &quot;Portrait of Boy in Pierrot Costume&quot; in 1897.

====Spain====
In 1895, the playwright and future Nobel laureate Jacinto Benavente wrote rapturously in his journal of a performance of the Hanlon-Lees, and three years later he published his only pantomime: &quot;The Whiteness of Pierrot&quot;. A true fin de siècle mask, Pierrot paints his face black to commit robbery and murder; then, after restoring his pallor, he hides himself, terrified of his own undoing, in a snowbank—forever. Thus does he forfeit his union with Columbine (the intended beneficiary of his crimes) for a frosty marriage with the moon.

====North America====
Pierrot and his fellow masks were late in coming to the United States, which, unlike England, Russia, and the countries of continental Europe, had had no early exposure to commedia dell&#x27;arte. The Hanlon-Lees made their first U.S. appearance in 1858, and their subsequent tours, well into the 20th century, of scores of cities throughout the country accustomed their audiences to their fantastic, acrobatic Pierrots. But the Pierrot that would leave the deepest imprint upon the American imagination was that of the French and English Decadents, a creature who quickly found his home in the so-called little magazines of the 1890s (as well as in the poster-art that they spawned). One of the earliest and most influential of these in America, &quot;The Chap-Book&quot; (1894–98), which featured a story about Pierrot by the aesthete Percival Pollard in its second number, was soon host to Beardsley-inspired Pierrots drawn by E.B. Bird and Frank Hazenplug (the Canadian poet Bliss Carman should also be mentioned for his contribution to Pierrot&#x27;s dissemination in mass-market publications such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;). Like most things associated with the Decadence, such exotica discombobulated the mainstream American public, which regarded the little magazines in general as &quot;freak periodicals&quot; and declared, through one of its mouthpieces, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, that &quot;each new representative of the species is, if possible, more preposterous than the last&quot;. And yet the Pierrot of that species was gaining a foothold elsewhere. The composers Amy Beach and Arthur Foote devoted a section to Pierrot (as well as to Pierrette, his Decadent counterpart) in two ludic pieces for piano—Beach&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (1894) and Foote&#x27;s &quot;Five Bagatelles&quot; (1893).

The fin de siècle world in which this Pierrot resided was clearly at odds with the reigning American Realist and Naturalist aesthetic (although such figures as Ambrose Bierce and John LaFarge were mounting serious challenges to it). It is in fact jarring to find the champion of American prose Realism, William Dean Howells, introducing &quot;Pastels in Prose&quot; (1890), a volume of French prose-poems containing a Paul Margueritte pantomime, &quot;The Death of Pierrot&quot;, with words of warm praise (and even congratulations to each poet for failing &quot;to saddle his reader with a moral&quot;). So uncustomary was the French Aesthetic viewpoint that, when Pierrot made an appearance in &quot;Pierrot the Painter&quot; (1893), a pantomime by Alfred Thompson, set to music by the American composer Laura Sedgwick Collins, &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered it as an event, although it was only a student production. It was found to be &quot;pleasing&quot; because, in part, it was &quot;odd&quot;. Not until the first decade of the next century, when the great (and popular) fantasist Maxfield Parrish worked his magic on the figure, would Pierrot be comfortably naturalized in America.

Of course, writers from the United States living abroad—especially in Paris or London—were aberrantly susceptible to the charms of the Decadence. Such a figure was Stuart Merrill, who consorted with the French Symbolists and who compiled and translated the pieces in &quot;Pastels in Prose&quot;. Another was William Theodore Peters, an acquaintance of Ernest Dowson and other members of the Rhymers&#x27; Club and a driving force behind the conception and theatrical realization of Dowson&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot of the Minute&quot; (1897; see England above). Of the three books that Peters published before his death (of starvation) at the age of forty-two, his &quot;Posies out of Rings: And Other Conceits&quot; (1896) is most notable here: in it, four poems and an &quot;Epilogue&quot; for the aforementioned Dowson play are devoted to Pierrot (from the mouth of Pierrot &quot;loquitur&quot;: &quot;Although this pantomime of life is passing fine,/Who would be happy must not marry Columbine&quot;).

Another pocket of North-American sympathy with the Decadence—one manifestation of what the Latin world called &quot;modernismo&quot;—could be found in the progressive literary scene of Mexico, its parent country, Spain, having been long conversant with the commedia dell&#x27;arte. In 1897, Bernardo Couto Castillo, another Decadent who, at the age of twenty-two, died even more tragically young than Peters, embarked on a series of Pierrot-themed short—&quot;Pierrot Enamored of Glory&quot; (1897), &quot;Pierrot and His Cats&quot; (1898), &quot;The Nuptials of Pierrot&quot; (1899), &quot;Pierrot&#x27;s Gesture&quot; (1899), &quot;The Caprices of Pierrot&quot; (1900)—culminating, after the turn of the century (and in the year of Couto&#x27;s death), with &quot;Pierrot-Gravedigger&quot; (1901). For the Spanish-speaking world, according to scholar Emilio Peral Vega, Couto &quot;expresses that first manifestation of Pierrot as an alter ego in a game of symbolic otherness ...&quot;.

====Central and South America====
Inspired by the French Symbolists, especially Verlaine, Rubén Darío, the Nicaraguan poet widely acknowledged as the founder of Spanish-American literary modernism (&quot;modernismo&quot;), placed Pierrot (&quot;sad poet and dreamer&quot;) in opposition to Columbine (&quot;fatal woman&quot;, the arch-materialistic &quot;lover of rich silk garments, golden jewelry, pearls and diamonds&quot;) in his 1898 prose-poem &quot;The Eternal Adventure of Pierrot and Columbine&quot;.

====Russia====
In the last year of the century, Pierrot appeared in a Russian ballet, &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Millions&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Harlequinade&quot; (1900), its libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa, its music by Riccardo Drigo, its dancers the members of St. Petersburg&#x27;s Imperial Ballet. It would set the stage for the later and greater triumphs of Pierrot in the productions of the Ballets Russes.

==19th-century legacy==
The Pierrot bequeathed to the 20th century had acquired a rich and wide range of personae. He was the naïve butt of practical jokes and amorous scheming (Gautier); the prankish but innocent waif (Banville, Verlaine, Willette); the narcissistic dreamer clutching at the moon, which could symbolize many things, from spiritual perfection to death (Giraud, Laforgue, Willette, Dowson); the frail, neurasthenic, often doom-ridden soul (Richepin, Beardsley); the clumsy, although ardent, lover, who wins Columbine&#x27;s heart, or murders her in frustration (Margueritte); the cynical and misogynistic dandy, sometimes dressed in black (Huysmans/Hennique, Laforgue); the Christ-like victim of the martyrdom that is Art (Giraud, Willette, Ensor); the androgynous and unholy creature of corruption (Richepin, Wedekind); the madcap master of chaos (the Hanlon-Lees); the purveyor of hearty and wholesome fun (the English pier Pierrots)—and various combinations of these. Like the earlier masks of commedia dell&#x27;arte, Pierrot now knew no national boundaries. Thanks to the international gregariousness of modernism, he would soon be found everywhere.

==Pierrot and modernism==

Pierrot played a seminal role in the emergence of modernism in the arts. He was a key figure in every art-form except architecture.

With respect to poetry, T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough work&quot;, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; (1915), owed its existence to the poems of Jules Laforgue, whose &quot;ton &#x27;pierrot&#x27;&quot; informed all of Eliot&#x27;s early poetry. (Laforgue, he said, &quot;was the first to teach me how to speak, to teach me the poetic possibilities of my own idiom of speech.&quot;) Prufrock is a Pierrot transplanted to America. Another prominent Modernist, Wallace Stevens, was undisguised in his identification with Pierrot in his earliest poems and letters—an identification that he later complicated and refined through such avatars as Bowl (in &quot;Bowl, Cat and Broomstick&quot; [1917]), Carlos (in &quot;Carlos Among the Candles&quot; [1917]), and, most importantly, Crispin (in &quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot; [1923]).

As for fiction, William Faulkner began his career as a chronicler of Pierrot&#x27;s amorous disappointments and existential anguish in such little-known works as his play &quot;The Marionettes&quot; (1920) and the verses of his &quot;Vision in Spring&quot; (1921), works that were an early and revealing declaration of the novelist&#x27;s &quot;fragmented state&quot; (some critics have argued that Pierrot stands behind the semi-autobiographical Nick Adams of Faulkner&#x27;s fellow-Nobel laureate Ernest Hemingway, and another contends that James Joyce&#x27;s Stephen Dedalus, again an avatar of his own creator, also shares the same parentage).

In music, historians of modernism generally place Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s 1912 song-cycle &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot; at the very pinnacle of high-modernist achievement. And in ballet, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s Petrushka (1911), in which the traditionally Pulcinella-like clown wears the heart of Pierrot, is often argued to have attained the same stature.

Students of modernist painting and sculpture are familiar with Pierrot (in many different attitudes, from the ineffably sad to the ebulliently impudent) through the masterworks of his acolytes, including Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Georges Rouault, Salvador Dalí, Max Beckmann, August Macke, Paul Klee, Jacques Lipchitz—the list is very long (see Visual arts below).

As for the drama, Pierrot was a regular fixture in the plays of the Little Theatre Movement (Edna St. Vincent Millay&#x27;s &quot;Aria da Capo&quot; [1920], Robert Emmons Rogers&#x27; &quot;Behind a Watteau Picture&quot; [1918], Blanche Jennings Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Dream Maker&quot; [1922]), which nourished the careers of such important Modernists as Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Susan Glaspell, and others.

In film, a beloved early comic hero was the Little Tramp of Charlie Chaplin, who conceived the character, in Chaplin&#x27;s words, as &quot;a sort of Pierrot&quot;.

As the diverse incarnations of the 19th-century Pierrot would predict, the hallmarks of the modernist Pierrot are his ambiguity and complexity.

One of his earliest appearances was in Alexander Blok&#x27;s &quot;The Puppet Show&quot; (1906), called by one theater-historian &quot;the greatest example of the harlequinade in Russia&quot;. Vsevolod Meyerhold, who both directed the first production and took on the role, dramatically emphasized the multifacetedness of the character: according to one spectator, Meyerhold&#x27;s Pierrot was &quot;nothing like those familiar, falsely sugary, whining Pierrots. Everything about him is sharply angular; in a hushed voice he whispers strange words of sadness; somehow he contrives to be caustic, heart-rending, gentle: all these things yet at the same time impudent.&quot;

==&quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;==

The fifty poems that were published by Albert Giraud (born Emile Albert Kayenbergh) as &quot;Pierrot lunaire: Rondels bergamasques&quot; in 1884 were set to music several times. The best known version is by Arnold Schoenberg, i.e., his Opus 21: &quot;Dreimal sieben Gedichte aus Albert Girauds&quot; Pierrot lunaire (&quot;Thrice-Seven Poems from Albert Giraud&#x27;s&quot; Pierrot lunaire—Schoenberg was numerologically superstitious). This led, among other things, to ensemble groups&#x27; appropriating Pierrot&#x27;s name, such as the English Pierrot Players (1967–70). The Pierrot behind those cycles has invaded worlds well beyond those of composers, singers, and ensemble-performers. Theatrical groups such as the Opera Quotannis have brought Pierrot&#x27;s Passion to the dramatic stage; dancers such as Glen Tetley have choreographed it; poets such as Wayne Koestenbaum have derived original inspiration from it. It has been translated into still more distant media by painters, such as Paul Klee; fiction-writers, such as Helen Stevenson; filmmakers, such as Bruce LaBruce; and graphic-novelists, such as Antoine Dodé. A passionately sinister Pierrot Lunaire has even shadowed DC Comics&#x27; Batman. Pierrot is aptly honored in the title of a song by the British rock-group The Soft Machine: &quot;Thank You Pierrot Lunaire&quot; (1969).

==Carnivals==
Pierrot appears among the revelers at various international carnivals. His name suggests kinship with the Pierrot Grenade of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, being a satire on the richer and more respectable Pierrot. Pierrot Grenade was a finely dressed masquerader and deeply supreme scholar/jester proud of his ability to spell any word in his own fashion and quoting Shakespearean characters as Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony, and Othello at length.
