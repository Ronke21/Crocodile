<text>The Phoenix Force is a fictional entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, the Phoenix Force is famous for its central role in &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; storyline, and is intrinsically linked to Jean Grey.

==Publication history==

The Phoenix first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #101 (October 1976), and was created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum.

==Fictional character biography==
The Phoenix Force is an immortal and immutable manifestation of the universal force of life and passion. The Phoenix Force is a creation of the universe that was born of the void between states of being. It is the nexus of all psionic energy of the past, present, and future in all realities of the multiverse, the Guardian of Creation and of the dangerously powerful M&#x27;Kraan Crystal.

The Phoenix Force is among the most feared beings in all of existence—it can cut, re-grow, or destroy any part of the universe. It has been described as being &quot;the embodiment of the very passion of Creation—the spark that gave life to the Universe, the flame that will ultimately consume it.&quot;

During its time as a sentient and formless mass of energy, it traveled the cosmos and was worshiped by several alien races, including the Shi&#x27;ar, who named the entity Phal&#x27;kon, the &quot;sister&quot; of their other gods K&#x27;ythri and Sharra.

According to the alien peace-keeping robot Unit, a billion years ago the alien Demon Lords of Stasis cast a spell on their planet to stop evolution. However, five powerful beings led by a female with pyrokinetic powers wage a rebellion against the Lords of Stasis. The rebellion drew the Phoenix to the planet. Although the Demon Lords fight to prevent it, the Phoenix communes with the female and with the loyalty of her disciples that helps her to control the infinite power of the Phoenix, she breaks the spell and the Demons are swept away.

The Phoenix later warred with the ancient energy creature known as le Bete Noir, and eventually trapped its enemy within Earth&#x27;s still cooling molten core, creating in the process the &quot;Burnt Place&quot;, a permanently razed clearing, where eventually the xenophobic surrounding tribes sacrificed anyone who deviated in any way from their norms. The Phoenix is drawn to Earth when Firehair, a young primitive female red-haired mutant overwhelmed with despair by her friends&#x27; deaths, contemplates turning her psychic abilities on herself to commit suicide at the &quot;Burnt Place&quot;. Attracted to Firehair&#x27;s untapped raw psychic power, the Phoenix prevents the suicide, bonds with her, and seeks to use her to fulfill its intended purpose of razing planets to ashes. Consumed by vengeful rage, Firehair nearly gives in to the firebird&#x27;s bloodlust to become a Dark Phoenix, but is pacified by her wolf guardian and decides to use her powers to protect those weaker than herself. Using the alias Lady Phoenix, she joins that time period&#x27;s incarnation of the Avengers. Her only known fight is with an out-of-control Celestial called the Fallen. During this time she and Odin share a romantic relationship that Odin considers the one time in his life when he truly felt alive. It was later claimed that from their love, Thor was born, but in truth, Phoenix left Odin due to his callousness, until millennia later, she arranged for Odin and Gaea to conceived a child. When Thor was born, his birth was felt by King Laufey who immediately killed him. The Phoenix resurrected him, leaving him permanently imbued with some of her power.

===The Rise of Dark Phoenix===
At some point, the entity ends up in Shi&#x27;ar space, where it bonds with a citizen of the Empire named Rook&#x27;shir, who controls the power of the Phoenix Force in conjunction with his blade. He is ultimately overwhelmed by the Phoenix&#x27;s power and becomes the first known host to succumb to the Phoenix Force&#x27;s destructive impulses, going insane from the power it embodied and becoming the Dark Phoenix. Rook&#x27;shir goes on a destructive rampage through the Empire and destroys many planets in the process. He is killed by the Imperial Guard, which later becomes the first line of defense of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. The Phoenix flees, leaving a small remnant of itself in the blade, which can only be lifted by Rook&#x27;shir&#x27;s descendants. Fearing the power of the Phoenix, the Shi&#x27;ar demonizes the entity and orders the deaths or sterilizations of Rook&#x27;shir&#x27;s descendants.

As time passes, the entity is contacted by a mage named Feron. Feron worships the legendary Phoenix, so his daydream-like visions prompts the Phoenix to adopt the fiery bird&#x27;s form. He asks the Phoenix to help him by lending its energy to project a lighthouse-like stone pillar across the multiverse. The pillar later becomes the lighthouse base for the British superhero team Excalibur. Afterwards, Necrom attacks Feron to steal the power of the Phoenix. Strengthened by the Phoenix Force, Feron is able to fight back, but Necrom steals a fraction of the Phoenix Force&#x27;s essence, forcing it to flee back to space in agonized confusion.

In the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, Yu-Ti of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un has visions of the Phoenix coming to Earth and of a red-headed Iron Fist who would confront it. In one vision, she loses control and destroys the world; in another, she tames its power. When walking the streets, Yu-Ti comes across Fongji Wu, the daughter of a woman who had ventured to the outside world and lain with a man from beyond K&#x27;un-Lun. After defeating Shou-Lao and becoming the Iron Fist, Fongji confronts the Phoenix Force and becomes its host. The Phoenix Force attempts to overwhelm Fongji and turn her into the Dark Phoenix, but she resists the being&#x27;s control. Determining that she needed to leave Earth to prevent the possibility of losing control, Fongji ventures off into space, never to be seen again.

===Jean Grey===
Centuries later, the Phoenix Force returns to Earth without a host when it feels the mind of a human transcend the physical realm and resonate with its energy. Jean Grey telepathically linked her mind to her dying friend Annie Richardson to keep Annie&#x27;s soul from moving to the afterlife. In doing so, Jean&#x27;s mind is dragged along to the &quot;other side&quot; with Annie. The Phoenix lends its energy to break the connection, and keeps a close watch on her because it felt a kinship with the young mutant. Years later, when Jean is dying on a space shuttle, her mind calls out for help and the Phoenix Force answers and saves her, transforming Jean into the Phoenix.

The Phoenix remains with the X-Men for only a short time. She prevents the complete destruction of the universe by repairing the damaged energy matrix at the core of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal. During a skirmish with Magneto, Phoenix and Beast are separated from the other X-Men, each group believing the other to have perished. In Greece, Phoenix meets a man named Nikos, later revealed to be Mastermind, a mutant that can alter the perceptions of others. Mastermind plants seeds of dissent within Phoenix&#x27;s fragile psyche by comparing her to a god and insisting she could do whatever she wished. She encounters Mastermind again in Scotland under the guise of Jason Wyngarde, believing the latter to be both the work of the reality-warping mutant Proteus and the lover of one of her ancestors.

An encounter with the Hellfire Club and manipulation by Mastermind and Emma Frost (the White Queen) transformed the Phoenix into their Black Queen. She breaks free of Mastermind&#x27;s control, but transforms into the Dark Phoenix. She battles the X-Men, flees to the stars, devours the energies of the D&#x27;Bari star system to satisfy her &quot;hunger&quot; as the Dark Phoenix, annihilates the five billion inhabitants of its fourth planet, and destroys a nearby Shi&#x27;ar observatory vessel that opens fire on her before she returns to Earth. There, the Dark Phoenix is defeated in psionic combat by Professor X, and Jean Grey regains control. The X-Men, along with Phoenix, are teleported to space by the Shi&#x27;ar and given a trial by combat. Just as victory seemed certain for the Imperial Guard, Jean becomes Dark Phoenix again. She apparently commits suicide on Earth&#x27;s moon before Cyclops.

As originally written, the Jean Grey incarnation of Phoenix is Jean herself, having attained her ultimate potential as a psi, becoming a being of pure energy and reforming herself as Phoenix, only to become slowly corrupted by the manipulation of such foes as Mastermind and Emma; Jean is driven mad as she is unable to adapt to her enormous power.

To return Jean to the fold several years later, this storyline was retconned to reveal the existence of the cosmic Phoenix Force entity, which had created a duplicate body of Jean, believed itself to be Jean and acted in her place while the real version lay in a healing cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay, where the Avengers and Fantastic Four discover her. It allowed Jean to be revived as a member of X-Factor. The extent to which the duplicate and Jean are separate entities depends on who is writing the characters at the time: some instances portray them as inherently separate, while others demonstrate a shared consciousness.

After committing suicide, the Phoenix Force reaches the Hot White Room where it encounters a manifestation of Death and returns itself to Jean in the cocoon. Horrified by what it has done, Jean rejects it and it fuses with Madelyne Pryor (Jean&#x27;s clone). This portion of the Phoenix remains with Madelyne until the latter committed suicide while fighting her genetic template before joining into a merged consciousness.

===Rachel Summers===
Another known possessor of the Phoenix Force is Rachel Summers, Scott Summers and Jean Grey&#x27;s daughter from the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; alternate future. The Phoenix Force bonds with Rachel, making her the next avatar of the Phoenix Force. Rachel is one of the longest reigning avatars of the Phoenix, and while she eventually adopts the uniform, she never becomes Dark Phoenix. Rachel has been referred by the entity as &quot;The One True Phoenix&quot;.

During an encounter with Galactus, Rachel Summers—completely overtaken by the Phoenix Force—battles Galactus to save a planet he was preparing to devour. The Phoenix Force disrupts Galactus&#x27; feeding process and easily defeats him. Galactus accuses the Phoenix Force of hypocrisy and reveals to it that its existence in a corporeal state is sustained by robbing energy used to birth future generations. Realizing this to be true, the Phoenix vows to return to its prior existence of &quot;touching all that is&quot; while allowing an echo of its power to remain with Rachel&#x27;s now-dominant consciousness.

===Into the Future===
Returning to Earth with all her memories, Rachel manages to return to the future she had come from. While she could not change her past, she and her teammates are able to change the directives of all the Sentinels of the era to preserve all life, ending the genocide that had prevailed for years. On the way back to her time, Captain Britain is lost in the timestream and Rachel is forced to switch places with him, as she does not belong in the timeline she had existed in. She emerges from the timestream about 1,900 years in the future and forms the Clan Askani, which is responsible for bringing her brother Nathan to their time to fight Apocalypse. She later encounters Diamanda Nero, Apocalypse&#x27;s High Councilor and viceroy. She tries overpowering him, but is left powerless after being shortly bonded to the Phoenix Force.

===Phoenix resurrection===
As an interdimensional portal transports four villains from the 616 Marvel Universe into the Ultraverse dimension, the Phoenix Force is also pulled into the Ultraverse and critically damaged. Requiring a human host to recover, the Phoenix Force bonds with Prime then with Amber Hunt. Amber, unable to control the Phoenix Force&#x27;s power, attacks her friends and would have destroyed the planet if the X-Men and new Ultra hero Foxfire had not arrived, who after a long battle are able to separate the Phoenix from Amber and send the cosmic entity back to the 616 universe.

Jean Grey begins to wear the same costume the Phoenix Force had worn, manifest Phoenix firebirds, and tap into its cosmic reserves several times, worrying Scott as he feared the Phoenix had returned until Jean temporarily loses her powers as a result of the Psi-War.

To help Psylocke after the Psi-War, Jean switches powers with her. Jean loses her telekinesis but her telepathy increases greatly. Jean begins to manifest &quot;Phoenix raptors&quot; that represent her telepathic powers &quot;honed to their sharpest edge&quot;. As a result of the power switch, Jean temporarily displays a shadow astral form with a Phoenix symbol over her right eye.

Jean begins manifesting the Phoenix raptor, creating a rift between her own and Scott&#x27;s relationship, and the entity starts to appear as another personality within Jean, having a conversation with Professor Xavier on its role in events to come. When the X-Man Xorn reveals himself to be a traitor who claimed to be Magneto, he traps Jean and Wolverine on Asteroid M, which is drifting closer to the Sun. Rather than watch Jean die a slow painful death, Wolverine tries to kill Jean, but he awakens the Phoenix Force within her. Using her incredible powers, Phoenix/Jean returns with Logan to New York City to face &quot;Magneto&quot;. Xorn&#x27;s last act is to kill Jean with an electromagnetic pulse.

===&quot;Endsong&quot; and &quot;Warsong&quot;===
The Phoenix Force returns to Earth during the mini-series &quot;X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong&quot;, where it resurrects Jean Grey from her grave. It is not long before she remembers what she has come for—Scott Summers. She needs to feed from the energy from his optic blasts, and, confused by her own emotions, thinks she is in love with Scott. She realizes Scott is in love with Emma Frost, former White Queen of the Hellfire Club and headmistress of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. Through a number of incidents, Jean manages to assert herself and gain control of the Phoenix Force with emotional support from the X-Men. Jean then declares that she and the Phoenix Force are truly one entity, have transcended into the White Phoenix of the Crown, signified by a new white and gold costume.

As a result of a Shi&#x27;ar attack on the Phoenix Force, the entity is in an incomplete state and Jean must search out the remaining parts of the Phoenix Force. The consequences of this were partially addressed in &quot;X-Men: Phoenix – Warsong&quot; in which a small part of the Phoenix Force joins with the Stepford Cuckoos. After nearly losing control to the Phoenix power, the Stepford Cuckoos develop a secondary mutation, where their hearts turned to diamond and they are able to imprison the piece of the Phoenix Force.

===End of Greys===
With the failed attack on the Phoenix Force that ended with Jean Grey escaping their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself, the Shi&#x27;ar still want to permanently prevent the ascension of the Phoenix Force. In hopes of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level psionic mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force, the Shi&#x27;ar sent a commando unit—the Death Commandos—with the purpose of wiping out the Grey genome and killing Quentin Quire to Earth. They arrived at Rachel&#x27;s family reunion site and kill all the members of the Grey family, except Rachel, who was marked, and Cable, who was not present. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vows revenge on the Shi&#x27;ar and says: &quot;I&#x27;m not my mom. I&#x27;m not the Phoenix. I&#x27;m my own woman. And by the time I&#x27;m done... they&#x27;ll wish I WERE the Phoenix.&quot;

===&quot;Kingbreaker&quot;===
In the last issue of &quot;Kingbreaker&quot;, the Phoenix abandons Rachel and Korvus during battle with Vulcan&#x27;s new guard, leaving them both without its power. As it leaves Rachel mutters &quot;Please, not now... Mom.&quot; implying that Jean is calling back the missing pieces of the Phoenix Force, and perhaps planning another resurrection. Rachel later says that it was almost like the Phoenix was never with her for she &quot;[c]an&#x27;t feel it... I can&#x27;t hear it...It&#x27;s like it was never there.&quot;

===The Sisterhood===
Around the same time in San Francisco, the Red Queen and her Sisterhood attack the X-Men; first trapping Emma in a psychic barricade by Lady Mastermind. Inside what appears to be the White Hot Room, a woman resembling Jean Grey appears to Emma and helps her break free of Regan&#x27;s influence with what appears to be a miniature version of the Phoenix energy raptor to let her help Logan, who has been robbed of a lock of Jean&#x27;s hair that was in his possession. Madelyne uses the hair sample to locate Jean&#x27;s gravesite, and then attempts to repeat a resurrection ritual with her corpse, but Cyclops had ordered Domino to substitute the body for someone else&#x27;s and it causes Madelyne to either discorporate or become absorbed into the fake.

===Utopia===
During a conflict with several Predators X (genetically engineered mutant hunters), the Stepford Cuckoos are overwhelmed and knocked unconscious as the fragment of the Phoenix they captured forcefully escape from the girls&#x27; diamond hearts.

===&quot;Second Coming&quot;===
During the final confrontation with Bastion, Hope Summers turns into what appears to be the Phoenix and blasts Bastion who manages to grasp Hope&#x27;s neck. Hope touches the ground, goes full Phoenix Force, and blasts Bastion and the dome. Later at a celebratory bonfire, Emma notices the flames around Hope take the shape of the Phoenix and Emma recalls the Sisterhood attack where the woman resembling Jean freed her from Lady Mastermind&#x27;s illusion.

===Generation Hope===
While fighting the fifth so-called &quot;Light&quot;, who was out of control, Hope attempts to take some of his powers only to exhaust herself and collapses. She is contacted by the Phoenix Force who refers to Hope as her &quot;child&quot;, and that the other lights needed her. Hope regains consciousness and goes back to face Kenji Uedo.

===Age of X===
The Age of X reality is created when Legion&#x27;s mind reacted to Doctor Nemesis&#x27;s attempt to restore its sanity. In this reality, Jean Grey&#x27;s Phoenix Force ability causes a tremendous amount of destruction and death in Albany. Although she was presumed deceased when the Air Force bombs the area, a new phoenix shape emerges from the rubble. Under the name of Revenant, it is not known whether she is Jean Grey (presumably dead after the Albany incident) or a new incarnation. She joins Magneto and becomes part of the Force Warriors.

When the truth about the Age of X is revealed, Legion apologizes to everyone before rewriting the universe and putting everything back the way it was. However, Revenant is also brought back to Utopia. Later, as all mutants begin to regain their true memories, Revenant is revealed to be the mind of Rachel Summers given human form.

===&quot;Fear Itself&quot;===
During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, the Phoenix Force appears to Emma Frost. The Phoenix mocks her, saying that Scott Summers would never love her as he loved Jean Grey. It seems to be a side effect of when Emma invaded Juggernaut&#x27;s mind and began feeding into Emma&#x27;s fears. As the Phoenix convinces Emma that Hope is Jean reincarnated, it tells Emma that she knows what to do. Emma, in a trance-like state, takes her pillow and is about to smother her to death, but Namor intervenes.

=== &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; ===

During the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, the event has the Phoenix Force returning to Earth, presumably to reclaim Hope Summers, which leads to a confrontation between the Avengers and the X-Men on how to deal with its arrival. The Avengers anticipate the destruction that the Phoenix could bring while Cyclops hopes to use the Phoenix Force to restart the mutant population.

As the Phoenix Force nears Earth, the Avengers fight the X-Men on the Blue Area of the Moon with Hope caught in the middle, while Iron Man and Giant-Man prepare a disruptor weapon to kill the Phoenix Force. Iron Man pilots the weapon against the Phoenix Force, but when he uses it to blast the Phoenix Force, the entity is forcefully altered and divided into five fragments that bond with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Namor, Colossus and Magik. They defeat the Avengers and head back to Earth with Hope. It is theorized that Scarlet Witch&#x27;s spell of &quot;No more mutants&quot; angered the Phoenix, and to calm the entity, a new host was needed along, with five acolytes, to succeed at bringing about evolution (the acolytes were actually revealed to be the first five new mutants that have appeared around the globe since the decimation of the mutant population), and that was the reason the Phoenix came to Earth.

When the Avengers defeat Namor in an attack on Wakanda, his portion of the Phoenix Force becomes divided between the other four members of the &quot;Phoenix Five&quot;, making it harder to defeat them. Spider-Man then baits Colossus and Magik into taking each other out by playing off of their fears when fighting them in a volcano, forcing their portions of the Phoenix to be divided between Emma and Cyclops. When Cyclops invades the mystical city of K&#x27;un Lun, Lei Kung defends the city on the back of the immortal dragon Shou-Lao the Undying, and reveals it had defeated the Phoenix in a past incarnation. While Cyclops defeats the dragon, Hope is able to absorb its power and defeat Cyclops who then goes to seek the other remaining portion of the Phoenix Force possessed by Emma Frost. Emma had been using the Phoenix Force to control all of Utopia, read the thoughts of everyone on the planet, take vengeance on anyone who had ever harmed a mutant, and dismantle all Sentinels. Cyclops defeats Emma and elevates to the level of Dark Phoenix, killing Professor X in the process.

In the final issue, the X-Men and the Avengers battle the Dark Phoenix, but they are losing as the Dark Phoenix starts to burn the world. As a last resort, Captain America sends in Hope and Scarlet Witch, who together manage to take down the Dark Phoenix, while Jean Grey appears within Cyclops&#x27; mind and convinces him to let go of the Phoenix Force. The Phoenix escapes Cyclops&#x27; body and enters Hope Summers&#x27;. Together, Hope and the Scarlet Witch wish away the Phoenix Force and the damage it caused, in the process activating the X-gene that allows the creation of new mutants around the world.

Even with the Phoenix gone, its effects remain in various ways, with four of the former Phoenix Five—Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus and Magik—suffering from various problems with their powers as well as Magneto, due to his prolonged time on Utopia. Cyclops and Magneto&#x27;s control over their abilities regress back to the level of control that they had possessed in their first appearances, Emma Frost retains her diamond form but only has erratic control over her telepathy, and Colossus&#x27; body fluctuates between his organic and his metal parts rather than completely transforming into one or the other. While Magik&#x27;s powers initially appeared to have been increased to the point where she can channel the power of Limbo on her own, a confrontation with Dormammu reveals that her new power is destroying Limbo each time she used it. It is later revealed that the power disruptions experienced by Cyclops, Emma, Colossus, Magik and Magneto were actually the result of nano-sentinels unleashed on them by Dark Beast.

Simultaneously, while spending some time in deep space, Iron Man helps defend an ancient planet from space pirates. He is later confronted by robotic police officers looking to arrest him for deicide. Before he is able to escape the planet, Iron Man realizes that the planet&#x27;s people, known as the Voldi, worship the Phoenix Force and his hand in its disappearance has angered them.

===&quot;Time Runs Out&quot; and &quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
At some point during the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, Cyclops acquires a Phoenix Egg that he holds in reserve, hoping to use it to end the Incursions.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Cyclops stands on top of the Phoenix Egg during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Cyclops uses it to become one with the Phoenix Force again, and uses his powers to decimate the Children of Tomorrow. After the realities collapse together, the Phoenix-Cyclops was one of the few survivors to come through the Incursion with a full memory of what had come before, proclaiming that resurrection was the goal of their mission. He is killed by God Emperor Doom in a subsequent confrontation.

===All New, All Different Marvel===
It has since been revealed that thousands of years ago, the civilization of planet Maveth was able to create a bomb that, when used, scorched the entire surface of the planet, killing all life within a generation; however, a second bomb is discovered by Gamora and Kitty Pryde to be hidden in the tomb of Maveth&#x27;s king, which in turn is also being sought by the Chitauri. To Kitty&#x27;s surprise, the bomb is actually an artifact that contained a fragment of the Phoenix Force. To escape from the Chitauri alive, Kitty accidentally activates the bomb, which kills the Chitauri and apparently releases the fragment of the Phoenix Force into the Universe again.

The deities of the Shi&#x27;ar, Sharra and K&#x27;ythri, can summon the entity at will and consider itself as their sister.

Under unknown circumstances, Terrax the Tamer acquires a Phoenix Egg and stores it on his warship. Thane deceives his allies (the Champion, Starfox and Nebula) into helping him invade Terrax&#x27;s warship to steal the egg. After being shot and killed by Nebula, Thane opens the egg and become the new host of the Phoenix. Using his new powers, Thane defeats his own father and conquers the Black Quadrant. Thane finds Thanos and fights him, causing them both to fall into the entrance to the God Quarry. Inside, the Coven senses the Phoenix Force inside of Thane and separates it from him so that Thane can fight his father as the man he truly is. The Phoenix Force flies off and presumably leaves the God Quarry.

===Psych War===
While on a solo mission against the Wrecking Crew, teenaged Jean receives a vision that the Phoenix Force is coming back to Earth. Determined to not succumb to the fate that befell her adult counterpart, Jean tries to fight the future and forge her own destiny. When the Phoenix arrives, Jean, backed by a host of former Phoenix Force wielders, tries to defy destiny and stop the Phoenix before it can take her over. While she is able to wound the Phoenix with the aid of Cable&#x27;s Psi-mitar, the Phoenix seems just too strong for anyone to overcome. Jean eventually pushes the cosmic force far away from her friends and allies, where a final battle can take place. It is revealed the Phoenix wants the adult Jean, but to do that it needs the younger Jean out of the way. The force floods her body with flaming psychic energy, incinerating her from the inside out, leaving only a skeleton.

===Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey===
Strange psychic occurrences around the world, which include a large bird flaring out from the sun and an explosion on the moon, raises red flags for the X-Men, who quickly launch an investigation on these events. After a string of bizarre encounters with familiar enemies, many of them considered deceased, the X-Men come to one conclusion: the Phoenix Force is back on Earth. The X-Men also discover that psychics are going missing or falling ill, which prompts the team to investigate Jean Grey&#x27;s grave. They find her coffin empty, and race to locate the Phoenix Force before it can find a suitable host. With the time-displaced teen Jean Grey out of the Phoenix Force&#x27;s way, the cosmic entity had resurrected the present adult Jean Grey. However, she does not recall her life as a mutant and an X-Man, and terrible visions from her previous life leave Jean unsure of the differences between reality and fiction. The X-Men theorize that the strange psychic occurrences are subconscious cries for help made by Jean Grey, and they must try to stop the Phoenix Force from merging with her. Old Man Logan is able to make Jean Grey remember her true life and as she learns about the fate of her family and several friends. Jean faces the Phoenix Force and is finally able to convince the cosmic entity to stop bringing her back as its avatar and to let her go. Alive once again, Jean is reunited with her friends as the Phoenix Force journeys back into space.

===Returning to Earth===
Namor, embittered by the surface world&#x27;s reckless disregard for his underwater kingdom, beckons the Phoenix Force to Earth and vows to sacrifice every part of himself to reunite with the entity once more. Namor proposes that if the Phoenix helps him destroy the Avengers, then he will help it set the galaxies ablaze. The Phoenix chooses Moon Knight as its new host instead, allowing him to escape Khonshu&#x27;s sway, but also provides him with a tremendous amount of power that is problematic considering Moon Knight&#x27;s mental instability. As the Fist of the Phoenix, Moon Knight rejects Khonshu as his master, uppercutting Khonshu with the full might of the Phoenix Force, sending him crashing back down to Earth and losing his hold over Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir as well. Moon Knight declares that the new age will now belong to him instead. Once on the ground, Black Panther and Ghost Rider get to work, calling back the Spirit of Vengeance, Iron Fist and Eye of Agamotto out of Khonshu&#x27;s grasp. With that, the Avengers assemble and Khonshu&#x27;s forces weaken. However, Moon Knight is still floating up in the atmosphere, reacting and dwelling on the new power that now lies within him. The voices in Moon Knight&#x27;s head suggest that if he were to burn the world with the Phoenix Force, the parasite of humanity would be purged and he would be a hero that saved the world. At this point, Moon Knight understands that he has lost his mind. After he reignites the sun and Thor breaks free from his entrapment with his hammer, Moon Knight almost welcomes the beating he gets from Thor, and the Phoenix Force subsequently leaves him as its host. Instead of returning to space, the Phoenix remains on Earth with Jean Grey deducing it is searching for a new avatar.

===Enter the Phoenix===
Having made a nest near Avengers Mountain at the North Pole, Namor and the Defenders of the Deep attempt to take the entity by force, leading to a battle with the Avengers and Agents of Wakanda. However, the Phoenix decides to hold a contest to judge who would be worthy to become its next host. The entity selects Captain America and Doctor Doom as its first combatants, who are empowered by a small spark of the Phoenix&#x27;s cosmic fire and transported to the Savage Land for their match. Realizing that the Phoenix refuses to let Rogers die for unknown reasons, Doom forfeits, refusing to play into the cosmic entity&#x27;s game. As Doom is returned, Captain America is transported to the White Hot Room where he encounters other competitors chosen by the Phoenix being held in wait for the next match. The Phoenix grants each competitor a vestige of its power and sends them to different parts of the world to fight each other. During the tournament, the essence of Lady Phoenix attempts to goad Black Panther into becoming the entity&#x27;s next host, but is rebuked by him. As the tournament continues, the remaining Avengers and their allies attempt to keep the Phoenix at bay. During a confrontation with Thor, the Phoenix reveals that she is his biological mother, which confuses and enrages him. At the tournament&#x27;s conclusion, Echo is chosen as the Phoenix&#x27;s new host. As Jean Grey telepathically consoles and congratulates Echo, three Phoenix chicks are seen next to the infant Starbrand&#x27;s crib at Avengers Mountain

===Phoenix Song: Echo===
While Maya fully accepts being the Phoenix Force&#x27;s host, her first outing as the Phoenix does not go according to plan. While stopping a burglary, she loses control of her temper and burns one of the perpetrators alive before starting a fire that threatens to harm countless innocent people. Even Echo&#x27;s behavior along with her attitude and body language shifts dramatically when being influenced by the Phoenix Force, prompting Elektra and Forge to confront her over the dangers of her powers. She rejects their condescending nature and admonishments but still recognizes that she needs help reigning in her powers.

Echo would eventually lost the connection to the Phoenix after using it to defend the Quarry of Creation and the Multiverse from the Council of Red.

==Hosts==
The following are the known hosts of the Phoenix Force:

* Jean Grey: The most powerful and complete Phoenix Force and host combination. Together they became the White Phoenix of the Crown. Death has stated that Jean is the rightful owner of the Phoenix Force and the embodiment of the Phoenix. Jean is later revived to be a full host for the Phoenix Force, but she convinces the cosmic entity to stop repeatedly resurrecting her, and let her go so she could live as she wanted. Following her death during the third Hellfire Gala, Jean&#x27;s mind travels to the White Hot Room where she joins with the Phoenix once again.
**Time-Displaced Jean Grey: Hosts a spark of the Phoenix that allows her to be transported to the White Hot Room. The Phoenix Force kills her as it does not consider her a true host, since Jean had conspired against the Phoenix from the beginning. The Phoenix Force was, however, forced to resurrect the Time-Displaced Jean Grey to expel her from the White Hot Room. During the Fall of X Jean Grey becomes again the full host of the Phoenix Force.
* Rook&#x27;shir: A Shi&#x27;ar that wields the Phoenix Force through the Blade of the Phoenix. He almost decimates the Shi&#x27;ar Empire.
* Feron: Ancestor of the modern-day Feron whose daydream-like visions prompt the Phoenix to adopt the firebird form.
* Necrom: Steals a fraction of the Phoenix Force from Feron that is later known as the Anti-Phoenix.
**Anti-Phoenix: A corpse that was animated and incubates the fraction of the Phoenix Force that Necrom stole from Feron, along with a portion of his own life essence for future use.
* Fongji: Host who lived in K&#x27;un-Lun centuries ago and was trained in the Iron Fist. The previous guardians of K&#x27;un-Lun decided to keep her existence and the Phoenix Force&#x27;s connection to the legacy of the Iron Fist a secret until its next return. Her name means bird of fire.
* Madelyne Pryor: A clone of Jean Grey that is brought to life by a fraction of the Phoenix Force. Sinister later creates six clones to take the energies from the Phoenix Five (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus, Namor, and Magik), and while they manage to siphon some of the energy from the Phoenix, the entity burns away the Madelyne clones and frees the Phoenix Five, who then incinerate Mister Sinister and his city.
* Rachel Summers: The daughter of Jean Grey and Scott Summers from an alternate timeline who has been referred to as &quot;The One True Phoenix&quot;. Rachel is the longest Earth-born host of the Phoenix and has never become Dark Phoenix. She mysteriously loses her connection to the fragment of the &quot;blue&quot; Phoenix within her, while at the same time the &quot;hound&quot; markings reappear on her face.
* Professor X: Charles Xavier briefly possesses an echo of the Phoenix Force during his time with the Starjammers.
* Diamanda Nero: The alleged daughter of Apocalypse from the Askani timeline and briefly becomes the host of the Phoenix after her fight with Rachel. She is unable to contain the Phoenix and begs Rachel to release it from her. Rachel releases the Force into the cosmos, depowering Nero in the process.
* Prime: Prime is briefly possessed by the Phoenix Force while it is in the Malibu Universe.
* Amber Hunt: Amber is possessed by the Phoenix Force while it is in the Malibu Universe and retains her Phoenix-enhanced power levels even after the entity returns to Earth-616. She loses this power enhancement when Maxis absorbs the Phoenix energy and uses it to permanently stabilize its humanoid shape without the need for a host body.
* Foxfire: Foxfire siphons some of the energy from the Phoenix while it is in the Malibu Universe and has a small portion of the Phoenix Force bonded to her at a sub-atomic level.
* Quentin Quire: Quentin reconstitutes his body using a fragment of the shattered Phoenix Force when it comes to Earth, but it leaves him to his &quot;sickness&quot;. He later becomes the host of the Phoenix Force during the &quot;Asgard/Shi&#x27;ar War&quot;, and is asked to become the New God of the Shi&#x27;ar as the Phoenix. This arrangement apparently does not last as Quentin is seen on Earth possessing only a shard of the Phoenix Force. He relinquishes it to save Jubilee from certain death.
* Emma Frost: Emma Frost has become the host for the Phoenix Force on two occasions. In the first instance she is unable to contain it, stating that she is not &quot;strong&quot; enough. Greg Pak later elaborated on this in an interview after the second series &quot;X-Men: Phoenix – Warsong&quot; that &quot;perhaps the Phoenix requires a willingness to open oneself up or give oneself away&quot; in a way that Emma at the time could not, which was why Celeste Cuckoo was the only Emma Frost clone to truly become Phoenix. She later becomes a true host to the Phoenix (see Phoenix Five).
* Stepford Cuckoos: The group possesses a fraction of the Phoenix Force that they imprison inside of their diamond hearts. The Cuckoos later lose their connection to the Phoenix fragment, as the fragment escapes their diamond hearts without a known destination.
* Korvus: Descendant of Rook&#x27;shir and wielder of the Blade of the Phoenix. The Blade is powerless after the connection to the Phoenix fragment is lost.
* Captain Marvel: Resurrected by a fragment of the Phoenix Force. He later willingly allows the Phoenix to reclaim the fragment, which kills him in the process.
* The Phoenix Five: During the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, the Phoenix Force approaches Earth, but Iron Man and Giant-Man use a disruptor weapon that alters the entity and divides it into five fragments that forcefully bonds with:
**Namor: Possesses a fragment of the Phoenix Force, and loses it after being defeated by the Avengers.
** Magik: Possesses a fragment of the Phoenix Force that leaves her after Spider-Man baits her and Colossus into taking each other out.
** Colossus: Possesses by a fragment of the Phoenix Force that leaves him after Spider-Man baits him and Magik into taking each other out.
** Emma Frost: Possesses a fragment of the Phoenix Force, who refers to Frost as its &quot;beloved child&quot; after she alerts it to Mister Sinister&#x27;s plot. Her half of the Phoenix Force is later stolen by Cyclops to increase his power during the final battle with the Avengers and X-Men.
** Cyclops: Possesses a fragment of the Phoenix Force, and is the last of the Phoenix Five to fall under the corrupted influence of the Phoenix Force. He becomes Dark Phoenix after hosting all five fragments, but Jean Grey&#x27;s essence convinces him to let the Phoenix leave his body as he is attacked by Hope Summers and the Scarlet Witch. He later acquires the Phoenix Egg, and uses it to become one with the Phoenix Force to decimate the Children of Tomorrow during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. He retains the Phoenix after the remaining universes crash together, but loses it when he is killed by Doctor Doom. The Phoenix Force temporarily resurrects Cyclops to convince Jean Grey to accept the entity, but is returned to the dead when she refused. An alternate version of Cable makes arrangements to place a device near Cyclops&#x27; heart that siphons some of the Phoenix&#x27;s energy when it resurrected him to allow his rebirth.
* Hope Summers: According to Cable and later confirmed by the Scarlet Witch, she is the incarnation of the Phoenix Force itself, which explains her resemblance to Jean Grey, and for that same reason, is able to relinquish its powers. Hope and the Phoenix temporarily become the White Phoenix. During the Fall of X, Hope fulfils her destiny by giving her life to reboot the Phoenix Force.
* Thane: The half-Inhuman son of Thanos, the Mad Titan. He becomes a host of the Phoenix Force after his death and subsequent rebirth hatches a Phoenix Egg. He loses his connection to the Phoenix when the Coven separates it from him when he and his father have one last fight in the God Quarry.
* Lady Phoenix: Born during prehistoric times, Firehair was abandoned by her parents as an infant at the Burnt Place because of her red hair. A pack of wolves took her in and she grows up a feral child. She later encounters a child with one eye called Highwalker, and joins the Tribe Without Fear, which consists of prehistoric mutants. Firehair&#x27;s mutant abilities manifest as she warns the Tribe Without Fear about an upcoming attack by the xenophobic tribes. After Firehair faints, the Tribe Without Fear and the xenophobic tribes kill each other. Firehair blames herself after recovering and returns to the Burnt Place to await death. The Phoenix Force, which created the Burnt Place, arrives and saves her while bonding with her. Consumed by the rage of the Tribe Without Fear&#x27;s death, Firehair starts to become the Dark Phoenix and is only pacified by the wolf that saved her as an infant. Years later, Firehair becomes Lady Phoenix and seeks out Odin to form 1,000,000 B.C.&#x27;s version of the Avengers with other mystically enhanced beings. Its only known fight is with an out-of-control Celestial called the Fallen. The Stone Age Avengers defeat the Fallen and seal it underground in what would become South Africa. It is implied she and Odin shared a romantic relationship during this time, and that Thor had born from that relationship. For reasons unknown the Phoenix Force keeps Firehair&#x27;s consciousness suppressed in the White Hot Room, but she isable to exert a degree of subconscious influence over it, causing it to instinctively seek out hosts from Earth, with a preference for red-haired women with psionic abilities, but is apparently released when Time-Displaced Jean Grey reaches the White Hot Room, as Firehair is seen with other avatars battling the young mutant. 
* Moon Knight: Encouraged by the Unseen during a visit on the Moon to seek out a different power to oppose his master, the Moon God Khonshu, Marc Spector used the physical beating during a battle with the Black Panther, as a token of devotion to pray to the Phoenix Force. Moon Knight becomes the Fist of the Phoenix and used its power to attack Khonshu, leaving him to be defeated and have the stolen powers stripped off him by the Avengers. When the Phoenix Force tried to persuade Marc into razing the Earth, Marc began to reject the cosmic force, and allowed Thor to knock him out, becoming free of the Phoenix.
* Chosen Champions of the Phoenix: During the &quot;Enter the Phoenix&quot; storyline, the Phoenix Force holds a tournament to judge who its next host will be, choosing many participants from around the world, empowering each of them with a portion of its power and pitting them in trials by combat, with the eliminated contestants losing its power. For the tournament, the Phoenix chooses: 
** Doctor Doom: The only one of the chosen to realize the Phoenix had its own inscrutable agenda, forfeiting his match against Captain America when he correctly deduces that the Phoenix was not looking for his particular character traits.
** Man-Thing: Is defeated by Black Panther in combat.
** Luke Cage: Is defeated by American Eagle in combat.
** Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur: While Moon Girl does not receive a spark of the cosmic flame, Devil Dinosaur is made a temporary host. Both are eliminated when Devil Dinosaur is defeated by Shanna the She-Devil and Zabu.
** The Orb: Is defeated by Valkyrie in combat.
** Hyperion: Due to the Phoenix&#x27;s power overloading his super senses to unbearable pain, Hyperion immediately forfeits his match against Shang-Chi.
** Howard the Duck: Is defeated by Red Widow in combat.
** Nighthawk: Despite fighting Black Panther to a standstill, the Phoenix declares Black Panther the winner, eliminating Nighthawk from the tournament.
** Shang-Chi: With the support of most of the remaining participants, Captain America realizes Shang-Chi is the best suited candidate to wield the Phoenix&#x27;s power and arranges for Shang-Chi to win their match while training him to contain his power. Angered by Rogers&#x27; sabotage and Shang-Chi&#x27;s refusal to kill, the Phoenix eliminates Shang-Chi and forces Captain America to advance to the next round.
** Wolverine: Is defeated by Black Panther in combat.
** Valkyrie: Is defeated by She-Hulk in combat.
** Black Knight: Is defeated by Red Widow in combat.
** American Eagle: Is defeated by Shanna the She-Devil and Zabu in combat.
** Red Widow: Her fight with Shanna the She-Devil and Zabu is interrupted by Echo, who burns Red Widow with cosmic fire while extracting her portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power.
** Shanna the She-Devil and Zabu: Their fight with Red Widow is interrupted by Echo, who peacefully takes their portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power from them.
** Namor: His fight with She-Hulk is interrupted by Echo, who brutally attacks him as payback for her earlier defeat by his hands while extracting his portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power from him.
** She-Hulk: Her fight with Namor is interrupted by Echo, who peacefully takes her portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power from her.
** Captain America: His fight with Black Panther is interrupted by Echo, who peacefully takes his portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power from him.
** Black Panther: His fight with Captain America is interrupted by Echo, who peacefully takes his portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power from him.
* Echo: Despite being defeated and left for dead by Namor under the Atlantic Ocean in an earlier match, the Phoenix was drawn to Echo&#x27;s suffering and refusal to die, ultimately choosing her to be its next host. After resurfacing from the ocean, Echo intercepted the last fights and absorbed the Phoenix&#x27;s remaining vestiges from the last participants.
* Taaia: Taaia of Taa, from the Sixth Cosmos was briefly possessed by Phoenix when entering the White Hot Room after being mortally wounded in a fight with the Beyonders. It used her to separate and attack the rest of the Defenders, but America Chavez was able to keep her distracted with the Eternity Mask, while Tigra summoned the Phoenix&#x27;s opposite, the Tiger God to attack it and free Taaia from its control.
* America Chavez: While fighting a Phoenix-possessed Taaia, she uses the Eternity Mask to steal a portion of it for herself. When Taaia&#x27;s connection is severed by the Tiger God, America looses hers too.
* Dark Phoenix: While appearing to be a gold-skinned woman in a robe, she would later be revealed to be a version of Mystique from King Thor&#x27;s reality of Earth-14412.
* Adani: A lifelong member of the Universal Church of Truth that mistakenly blames the Phoenix for her father&#x27;s death. When Jean attempts to deal with Thanos and his Warlock&#x27;s Eye, desperation drives her to transfer the Phoenix&#x27;s power to Adani in an attempt to stop the Mad Titan. However when Jean tried to reclaim the Phoenix, Adani refused to relent the empowerment and has kept a small fraction of its powers.

Other characters were only possessed by the Phoenix Force during out-of-continuity tales, including Franklin Richards, Nightcrawler, Storm, Wolverine of Earth-14412 (referred to as Old Man Phoenix), King Thor of Earth-14412, Cosmic Ghost Rider, and Gabriel Summers in separate &quot;What If...&quot; stories, as well as Cyclops in the X-Men/Teen Titans inter-company crossover. Quentin Quire is revealed to be a host in the &quot;Here Comes Tomorrow&quot; storyline and in the visions of Deathlok, and in the timeline of Nocturne, the Phoenix Force possesses Colossus&#x27; soulless body and reshapes it into a female form.

==White Hot Room==
The White Hot Room (or the &quot;White-Hot Room&quot;) is the home of the Phoenix Force and where Phoenix hosts go after they die. It exists outside of the Multiverse, but also within the M&#x27;kraan Crystal. It has been called &quot;the epicenter of creation and rebirth.&quot;

The White Hot Room first appeared, retroactively, in the backup story for &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #8 by Chris Claremont and John Bolton. It was established and named in &quot;New X-Men&quot; #154 by Grant Morrison and Marc Silvestri.

The White Hot Room can appear as an endless white void, but it has also appeared in other forms, too. In the backup story for &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #43, by Chris Claremont and Mike Collins, the Room appeared as a large tower being constructed in space, with the construction worker identified by Jean Grey as Death. In &quot;Defenders: Beyond&quot; #3, by Al Ewing and Javier Rodriguez, it appears the white void, the tower, a dark cave lit by a single fire, a snowy landscape, and an endless expanse of desert. This desert reappears in &quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; #14, by Kieron Gillen and Lucas Werneck, where it&#x27;s eventually revealed to be the White Hot Room.

In &quot;New X-Men&quot; #54, it was shown to be the home of all of the hosts of the Phoenix Force, past, present, and future. In &quot;Jean Grey&quot; #11, by Dennis Hallum, Victor Ibanez, and Alberto Jiménez Alburquerque, the Phoenix states that is &quot;a nexus between all Phoenix hosts and our eternal flame. A place of rest and contemplation. Home to every being with whom I&#x27;ve merged. Every Phoenix host leaves a piece of itself here with me.&quot;

In &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #8, Jean Grey, while dying of radiation during &quot;X-Men&quot; #100, finds herself in a blinding white void where she first encounters the Phoenix. Even though this white void remained unnamed until &quot;New X-Men&quot; #154, it is technically the first appearance of the White Hot Room. In &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #43, after dying, Jean Grey finds herself in the White Hot Room again, alongside an aspect of Death.

In &quot;New X-Men&quot; #138, as the character of Quentin Quire dies and ascends into a higher dimension, he says &quot;...I&#x27;m streaming...going away...into the bigger rooms..outside rooms bigger than the whole world.&quot; The White Hot Room is finally shown in &quot;New X-Men&quot; #154 as an afterlife for the Phoenix and its hosts. In &quot;X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong&quot;, the Phoenix returns from the White Hot Room temporarily. 

In &quot;S.W.O.R.D.&quot; vol 2 #1, the mutant circuit known as the Six manage to break into the White Hot Room and bring back a substance they call &quot;Mysterium.&quot; This metal is harder and stronger than Adamantium and has anti-magical properties.

In &quot;Defenders: Beyond&quot; #3, the Defenders find themselves in the White Hot Room as Taaia is possessed by the Phoenix. Much like the earlier stories by Claremont, this issue equates the White Hot Room with Tiphareth of the Tree of Life in Kabbalah. 

After &quot;X-Men: Hellfire Gala 2023&quot;, during the Fall of X crossover, the majority of Krakoa&#x27;s population (around 250,000 mutants) were exiled through Krakoan gates into a vast and seeming endless desert; in &quot;Immortal X-Men&quot; #16, this desert is revealed to be the White Hot Room. After the Mister Sinister clone Mother Righteous stabs Jean in the center of the White Hot Room, both the Phoenix and the White Hot Room began to die. At the end of &quot;Rise of the Powers of X&quot; #5, both the Phoenix and the White Hot Room were restored. The finale of the Krakoan Age &quot;X-Men&quot; #35 revealed that while many mutants were able to get back to Earth to fight Orchis, a large number of them still remained in the White Hot Room and this &quot;New Krakoa&quot; flourished, returning to Earth after fifteen years before going back to the White Hot Room.

==Powers and abilities==
The Phoenix Force can manipulate cosmic energies and tap into the life-force reserved for future generations, which denies their existence. It can wield this energy to project beams of immense destructive force. It can migrate throughout time and space by folding its energy back into itself, causing it to collapse akin to a black hole and then reform itself upon reaching its destination. It can directly absorb offensive energy such as Cyclops&#x27; optic blasts or the energy and life-force from a foe. As it is the nexus of all psionic energy, it has mental abilities on a cosmic level, including telepathy and telekinesis.

It allows its preferred host to perform cosmic pyrokinesis, as it allows Lady Phoenix from 1,000,000 BC Avengers to summon preternatural flames that can melt supernovas. For Jean Grey, it allows her to perform cosmic pyrokinesis strong enough to easily defeat Terrax, as she is in complete control of her own cosmic fire that after Terrax submits to his defeat, the fire dissipates at her will leaving him charred. She also uses the cosmic fire blast to counter Galactus. In some conditions, a bit of cosmic fire can easily burn anything it comes into contact, as when it possesses young Jean Grey she unconsciously melts the equipment the medics try to put on her.

The extent of the Phoenix Force&#x27;s abilities has not been fully clarified. Jean Grey as The White Phoenix of the Crown is able to change the future of a universe by reaching back in time and urging Cyclops to move on with his life.

Another major display of the power of the Phoenix is during the Secret Wars II. Rachel Summers seeks to kill the Beyonder, who expresses both amazement and disappointment in her. With that, the Beyonder gives Rachel full access to the power of the Phoenix as well as some of his own. With such power, Rachel is able to absorb the consciousness of every sentient mortal being in the universe.

The Phoenix often seeks hosts with strong inherent psionic abilities so they can withstand its power. When the Phoenix Force enters a host, a small fragment of its power is left behind when it leaves. Even a small fragment can be stronger than an inexperienced host using the Phoenix Force&#x27;s powers, such as with Rachel Summers, who has full access to the Force, but her opponent Necrom threw moons at her with only a fragment. When bonded with a host, the Phoenix Force amplifies their abilities to incalculable levels. It can manipulate matter on a sub-atomic level and transmute elements, like turning wood to gold or stone to crystal; on a smaller scale, it can alter the molecular fabrics. It can teleport others across space and open interdimensional portals to instantly access distant portions of the Universe. If an avatar of the Phoenix Force is harmed or killed, it forms an &quot;egg&quot; of cosmic power around them that is incubated in the White Hot Room, and hatches out completely healed. As one of the oldest cosmic beings, the Phoenix Force possesses a high level of cosmic awareness and prescience.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
Tamara Jude of &quot;Sideshow&quot; stated, &quot;The Phoenix Force holds a significant place in the &quot;Marvel&quot; Comics and stands as the most unforgettable element of &quot;X-Men&quot; member &quot;Jean Grey’s&quot; comic book history. This character-defining arc, known as the Phoenix Saga and the Dark Phoenix Saga, has resonated with fans for decades with its compelling plot, vibrant panels and shocking ending. The legacy of the Phoenix Force stretches well beyond the pages of Marvel Comics. The Dark Phoenix Saga is regarded as one of the best comic book arcs in history and has become a fan-favorite. It is also one of the favored arcs by comic book critics around the world.&quot; Tristan Benns of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; referred to the Phoenix Force as &quot;one of the X-Men’s most iconic concepts,&quot; writing, &quot;As a staple of Marvel Comics’ X-Men franchise, the Phoenix Force has been a fan-favorite concept well known to both heroes and readers alike for decades. But as long-lived and mysterious as the Phoenix is, it’s hard for anybody to ever truly know its full story.&quot;

* The first incarnation appears in the films &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000), &quot;X2&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), portrayed by Famke Janssen. This version is a purely instinctual, ruthless, and powerful entity that existed within the unconscious side of Grey&#x27;s mind since childhood and embodies her darker personality traits.

<text>Marathon (Demotic Greek: Μαραθώνας, &quot;Marathónas&quot;; Attic/Katharevousa: , &quot;Marathṓn&quot;) is a town in Greece and the site of the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, in which the heavily outnumbered Athenian army defeated the Persians. Legend has it that Pheidippides, a Greek herald at the battle, was sent running from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory, which is how the marathon running race was conceived in modern times. Today it is part of East Attica regional unit, in the outskirts of Athens and a popular resort town and center of agriculture.

==History==
The name &quot;Marathon&quot; () comes from the herb fennel, called &quot;márathon&quot; () or &quot;márathos&quot; () in Ancient Greek, so &quot;Marathon&quot; literally means &quot;a place full of fennel&quot;.
It is believed that the town was originally named so because of an abundance of fennel plants in the area.

In ancient times, Marathon () occupied a small plain in the northeast of ancient Attica, which contained four places, Marathon, Probalinthus, Tricorythus, and Oenoe, which originally formed the Tetrapolis, one of the 12 districts into which Attica was divided before the time of Theseus. Here Xuthus, who married the daughter of Erechtheus, is said to have reigned; and here the Heracleidae took refuge when driven out of Peloponnesus, and defeated Eurystheus. The Marathonii claimed to be the first people in Greece who paid divine honours to Heracles, who possessed a sanctuary in the plain. Marathon is also celebrated in the legends of Theseus, who conquered the ferocious bull, which used to devastate the plain. Marathon is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; in a way that implies that it was then a place of importance. In mythology, its name was derived from an eponymous hero Marathon, who is described by Pausanias as a son of Epopeus, king of Sicyon, who fled into Attica in consequence of the cruelty of his father. Plutarch calls him an Arcadian, who accompanied the Dioscuri in their expedition into Attica, and voluntarily devoted himself to death before the battle.

After Theseus united the 12 independent districts of Attica into one state, the name of Tetrapolis gradually fell into disuse; and the four places of which it consisted became Attic demi, Marathon, Tricorythus, and Oenoë belonging to the tribe Aeantis, and Probalinthus to the tribe Pandionis; but Marathon was so superior to the other three, that its name was applied to the whole district down to the latest times. Hence Lucian speaks of &quot;the parts of Marathon about Oenoë&quot;.

Few places have obtained such celebrity in the history of the world as Marathon, on account of the victory which the Athenians here gained over the Persians in 490 BCE (Battle of Marathon). After Miltiades (the general of the Greek forces) defeated Darius&#x27; Persian forces, the Persians decided to sail from Marathon to Athens in order to sack the unprotected city. Miltiades ordered all his hoplite forces to march &quot;double time&quot; back to Athens, so that by the time Darius&#x27; troops arrived they saw the same Greek force waiting for them.

Although the name Marathon had a positive resonance in Europe in the nineteenth century, for some time that was sullied by the Dilessi murders, which happened nearby in 1870.

In the 19th century and beginning of twentieth century the village was inhabited by an Arvanite population.


The sophist and magnate Herodes Atticus was born in Marathon. In 1926, the American company ULEN began construction on the Marathon Dam in a valley above Marathon, in order to ensure water supply for Athens. It was completed in 1929. About 10 km2 of forested land were flooded to form Lake Marathon.

The beach of Schinias is located southeast of the town. The beach is popular as a spot for windsurfing and the Olympic Rowing Center used for the 2004 Summer Olympics is also located there. 

At the 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics, Marathon was the starting point of the marathon races (for both women and men in 2004). Marathon is also the starting point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon.

The area is susceptible to flash flooding, because of forest fires having denuded parts of the eastern slopes of Mount Penteli especially in 2006.

==Municipality==
The municipality Marathon was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Grammatiko
*Marathon
*Nea Makri
*Varnavas

The municipality has an area of 222.747 km2, the municipal unit 97.062 km2.

==Population==

The other settlements in the municipal unit are Agios Panteleimonas, Kato Souli, Vranas, Avra, Vothon, Ano Souli and Schinias.

== Points of interest ==

* The &quot;Soros&quot;, a tumulus (Greek &quot; Τύμβος, tymbos&quot;, tomb), or burial mound, erected to the 192 Athenian fallen at the Battle of Marathon, is a feature of the coastal plain, now marked by a marble memorial stele and surrounded by a small park.
* Kato Souli Naval Transmission Facility with its tall radio mast, the tallest structure in Greece.

* Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States
* Xiamen, China

<doc id="49132" wikidata="Q40244" url="?curid=49132" title="Marathon">
<text>The marathon is a long-distance foot race with a distance of kilometres ( 26 mi 385 yd), usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. The marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions. More than 800 marathons are held worldwide each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.

A creation of the French philologist Michel Bréal inspired by a story from Ancient Greece, the marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896 in Athens. The distance did not become standardized until 1921. The distance is also included in the World Athletics Championships, which began in 1983. It is the only running road race included in both championship competitions (walking races on the roads are also contested in both).

==History==
===Origin===
The name &quot;Marathon&quot; comes from the legend of Pheidippides, the Greek messenger. The legend states that while he was taking part in the Battle of Marathon, which took place in August or September 490 BC, he witnessed a Persian vessel changing its course towards Athens as the battle was near a victorious end for the Greek army. He interpreted this as an attempt by the defeated Persians to rush into the city to claim a false victory or simply raid, hence claiming their authority over Greek land. It was said that he ran the entire distance to Athens without stopping, discarding his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible, and burst into the assembly, exclaiming &quot;we have won!&quot;, before collapsing and dying.

The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appeared in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;On the Glory of Athens&quot; in the first century AD, which quoted from Heraclides Ponticus&#x27;s lost work, giving the runner&#x27;s name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles. This was the account adopted by Benjamin Haydon for his painting , published as an engraving in 1836 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Satirist Lucian of Samosata gave one of the earliest accounts similar to the modern version of the story, but its historical veracity is disputed based on its tongue-in-cheek writing and the runner being referred to as Philippides and not Pheidippides.

There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend. The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentioned Philippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over each way. In some Herodotus manuscripts, the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides. Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.
In 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem &quot;Pheidippides&quot;. Browning&#x27;s poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th-century popular culture and was accepted as a historical legend.

Mount Pentelicus stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that Philippides would have had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south. The latter and more obvious route is followed by the modern Marathon-Athens highway (EO83–EO54), which follows the lay of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper. As it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, this route was approximately long. It was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races. However, there have been suggestions that Philippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens. This route is slightly shorter, , but includes a very steep climb over the first .
===Modern Olympic marathon===
When the modern Olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the glory of ancient Greece. The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks. A selection race for the Olympic marathon was held on 22 March 1896 (Gregorian) that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes. The winner of the first Olympic marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics was run on the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics. That men&#x27;s marathon was won by Italian Stefano Baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-Olympics Athens Classic Marathon of 2014 when Felix Kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds.

The women&#x27;s marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, US) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.

It has become a tradition for the men&#x27;s Olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, on the final day of the Olympics. For many years, the race finished inside the Olympic stadium; however, at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London), the start and finish were on The Mall, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro), the start and finish were in the Sambódromo, the parade area that serves as a spectator mall for Carnival.

Often, the men&#x27;s marathon medals are awarded during the closing ceremony (including the 2004 games, 2012 games, 2016 games and 2020 games ).

The Olympic men&#x27;s record is 2:06:26, set at the 2024 Summer Olympics by Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia. The Olympic women&#x27;s record is 2:22:55, set at the 2024 Summer Olympics by Sifan Hassan of The Netherlands. Per capita, the Kalenjin ethnic group of Rift Valley Province in Kenya has produced a highly disproportionate share of marathon and track-and-field winners.

===Marathon mania in the US===
The Boston Marathon began on 19 April 1897 and was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics. It is the world&#x27;s oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious road racing events. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston. Johnny Hayes&#x27; victory at the 1908 Summer Olympics also contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the United States. Later that year, races around the holiday season including the Empire City Marathon held on New Year&#x27;s Day 1909 in Yonkers, New York, marked the early running craze referred to as &quot;marathon mania&quot;. Following the 1908 Olympics, the first five amateur marathons in New York City were held on days that held special meanings: Thanksgiving Day, the day after Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, Washington&#x27;s Birthday, and Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday.

Frank Shorter&#x27;s victory in the marathon at the 1972 Summer Olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intensely than that which followed Hayes&#x27; win 64 years earlier. In 2014, an estimated 550,600 runners completed a marathon within the United States. This can be compared to 143,000 in 1980. Today, marathons are held all around the world on a nearly weekly basis.

===Inclusion of women===
For a long time after the Olympic marathon started, there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women. Although a few women, such as Stamata Revithi in 1896, had run the marathon distance, they were not included in any official results. Marie-Louise Ledru has been credited as the first woman to complete a marathon, in 1918. Violet Piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon, in 1926.

Arlene Pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the United States when she completed the Pikes Peak Marathon in Manitou Springs, Colorado, in 1959. Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon &quot;officially&quot; (with a number), in 1967. However, Switzer&#x27;s entry, which was accepted through an &quot;oversight&quot; in the screening process, was in &quot;flagrant violation of the rules&quot;, and she was treated as an interloper once the error was discovered. Bobbi Gibb had completed the Boston race unofficially the previous year (1966), and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women&#x27;s winner for that year, as well as 1967 and 1968.

==Distance==
The length of an Olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first. Despite this, the marathon races in the first few Olympic Games were about , roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens by the longer, flatter route. The exact length depended on the route established for each venue.

===1908 Olympics===

The International Olympic Committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 London Olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometers. The organizers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at Windsor Castle to the royal entrance to the White City Stadium, followed by a lap (586 yards 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the Royal Box. The course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium, followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish.

The modern standard distance for the marathon was set by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) in May 1921 directly from the length used at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.

===IAAF and world records===
An official IAAF marathon course is 42.195 km (42 m tolerance only in excess). Course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one meter per kilometer to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance.

For events governed by IAAF rules, the route must be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometers. The rules do not mention the use of miles. The IAAF will only recognize world records established at events run under IAAF rules. For major events, it is customary to publish competitors&#x27; timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognized by the IAAF (such as 20 km, 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon and completes the marathon course.

==Marathon races==

Annually, more than 800 marathons are organized worldwide. Some of these belong to the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories. The marathons of Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo form the World Marathon Majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series.

In 2006, the editors of Runner&#x27;s World selected a &quot;World&#x27;s Top 10 Marathons&quot;, in which the Amsterdam, Honolulu, Paris, Rotterdam, and Stockholm marathons were featured along with the five original World Marathon Majors events (excluding Tokyo). Other notable large marathons include United States Marine Corps Marathon, Los Angeles, and Rome. The Boston Marathon is the world&#x27;s oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 Olympic marathon and held every year since 1897 to celebrate Patriots&#x27; Day, a holiday marking the beginning of the American Revolution, thereby purposely linking Athenian and American struggle for democracy. The oldest annual marathon in Europe is the Košice Peace Marathon, held since 1924 in Košice, Slovakia. The historic Polytechnic Marathon was discontinued in 1996. The Athens Classic Marathon traces the route of the 1896 Olympic course, starting in Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica, site of the Battle of Marathon of 490 BC, and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.
The Midnight Sun Marathon is held in Tromsø, Norway at 70 degrees north. Using unofficial and temporary courses measured by GPS, races of marathon distance are now held at the North Pole, in Antarctica, and over desert terrain. Other unusual marathons include the Great Wall Marathon on The Great Wall of China, the Big Five Marathon among the safari wildlife of South Africa, the Great Tibetan Marathon – a marathon in an atmosphere of Tibetan Buddhism at an altitude of , and the Polar Circle Marathon on the permanent ice cap of Greenland.

A few marathons cross international and geographical borders. The Istanbul Marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (Europe and Asia) during a single event. In the Detroit Free Press Marathon, participants cross the US/Canada border twice. The Niagara Falls International Marathon includes one international border crossing, via the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, New York, United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. In the , participants run through Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

On 20 March 2018, an indoor Marathon occurred in the Armory in New York City. The 200 m track saw a world record in the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s field. Lindsey Scherf (USA) set the indoor women&#x27;s world record with 2:40:55. Malcolm Richards (USA) won in 2:19:01 with a male indoor world record.

===Wheelchair division===
Many marathons feature a wheelchair division. Typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts.

The first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in Toledo, Ohio, and it was won by Bob Hall at 2:54. Hall competed in the 1975 Boston Marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the Boston Marathon. From 1977, the race was declared the US National Wheelchair championship. The Boston Marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete. Ernst van Dyk has won the Boston Marathon wheelchair division ten times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in Boston in 2004. Jean Driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women&#x27;s world record at 1:34:22.

The New York City Marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed Bob Hall to compete after the state Division of Human Rights ordered the marathon to show cause. The Division ruled in 1979 that the New York City Marathon and New York Road Runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980, but the New York Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race. However, by 1986, 14 wheelchair athletes were competing, and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.

Some of the quickest people to complete a wheel-chair marathon include Thomas Geierpichler (Austria), who won gold in the men&#x27;s T52-class marathon (no lower limb function) in 1 hr 49 min 7 sec in Beijing, China, on 17 September 2008; and, Heinz Frei (Switzerland) who won the men&#x27;s T54 marathon (for racers with spinal cord injuries) in a time of 1 hr 20 min and 14 sec in Oita, Japan, 31 October 1999.

==Statistics==
===World records and world&#x27;s best===
World records were not officially recognized by the IAAF, now known as World Athletics, until 1 January 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the &#x27;world best&#x27;. Courses must conform to World Athletics standards for a record to be recognized. However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters.

The current world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours and 35 seconds, set in the Chicago Marathon by the late Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya on 8 October 2023.

The world record for women was set by Ruth Chepng&#x27;etich of Kenya in the Chicago Marathon on 13 October 2024, in 2 hours, 9 minutes, and 56 seconds. This broke Tigst Assefa&#x27;s previous world record of 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds by almost two minutes, and was the first time in history a woman broke the 2:11 and 2:10 barriers in the marathon.

===All-time top 25===
The data is &quot;correct .&quot;

==== Men ====
Notes
* Eliud Kipchoge (Kenya) ran a time of 1:59:40.2 at the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in Vienna on 12 October 2019. This event was run with no other competitors and with the assistance of fuel and hydration on demand and in-out pacemakers. Therefore, the attempt was not eligible for official ratification. This was faster than his previous assisted run of 2:00:25 at the Nike Breaking2 in Monza on 6 May 2017, which was also ineligible.
* Titus Ekiru (Kenya) ran a time of 2:02:57 at the Milano City Marathon on 16 May 2021, but was later disqualified due to doping violations.
* Geoffrey Mutai (Kenya) ran a time of 2:03:02 at the Boston Marathon on 18 April 2011 that was run on an assisted course (in the case of Boston, a point-to-point, net downhill course in excess of the standards) and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per IAAF rule 260.28
* Moses Mosop (Kenya) ran a time of 2:03:06 at the Boston Marathon on 18 April 2011 that was run on an assisted course and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per IAAF rule 260.28

===Season&#x27;s bests===

===Oldest marathoner===
Fauja Singh, then 100, finished the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, becoming the first centenarian ever to officially complete that distance. Singh, a British citizen, finished the race on 16 October 2011 with a time of 8:11:05.9, making him the oldest marathoner. Because Singh could not produce a birth certificate from rural 1911 Colonial India, the place of his birth, his age could not be verified and his record was not accepted by the official governing body World Masters Athletics.

Johnny Kelley ran his last full Boston Marathon at the documented age of 84 in 1992. He previously had won the Boston Marathon in both 1935 and 1945 respectively. Between 1934 and 1950, Johnny finished in the top five 15 times, consistently running in the 2:30s and finishing in second place a record seven times at Boston. A fixture at Boston for more than a half century, his 1992 61st start and 58th finish in Boston is a record which still stands today.

Gladys Burrill, a 92-year-old Prospect, Oregon woman and part-time resident of Hawaii, previously held the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title of oldest person to complete a marathon with her 9 hours 53 minutes performance at the 2010 Honolulu Marathon. The records of the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, at that time, however, suggested that Singh was overall the oldest marathoner, completing the 2004 London Marathon at the age of 93 years and 17 days, and that Burrill was the oldest female marathoner, completing the 2010 Honolulu Marathon at the age of 92 years and 19 days. Singh&#x27;s age was also reported to be 93 by other sources.

In 2015, 92-year-old Harriette Thompson of Charlotte, North Carolina, completed the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll San Diego Marathon in 7 hours 24 minutes 36 seconds, thus becoming the oldest woman to complete a marathon. While Gladys Burrill was 92 years and 19 days old when she completed her record-setting marathon, Harriette Thompson was 92 years and 65 days old when she completed hers.

English born Canadian Ed Whitlock is the oldest to complete a marathon in under 3 hours at age 74, and under 4 hours at age 85.

===Youngest marathoner===
Budhia Singh, a boy from Odisha, India, completed his first marathon at age five. He trained under the coach Biranchi Das, who saw potential in him. In May 2006, Budhia was temporarily banned from running by the ministers of child welfare, as his life could be at risk. His coach was also arrested for exploiting and cruelty to a child and was later murdered in an unrelated incident. Budhia is now at a state-run sports academy.

The youngest under 4 hours is Mary Etta Boitano at age 7 years, 284 days; under 3 hours Julie Mullin at 10 years 180 days; and under 2:50 Carrie Garritson at 11 years 116 days.

=== Participation ===
In 2016, Running USA estimated that there were approximately 507,600 marathon finishers in the United States, while other sources reported greater than 550,000 finishers. The chart below from Running USA provides the estimated U.S. Marathon Finisher totals going back to 1976.

Marathon running has become an obsession in China, with 22 marathon races in 2011 increasing to 400 in 2017. In 2015, 75 Chinese runners participated in the Boston Marathon and this increased to 278 in 2017.

===Multiple marathons===
As marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have undertaken challenges involving running a series of marathons.

The 100 Marathon Club is intended to provide a focal point for all runners, particularly from the United Kingdom or Ireland, who have completed 100 or more races of marathon distance or longer. At least 10 of these events must be United Kingdom or Ireland Road Marathons. Club chairman Roger Biggs has run more than 700 marathons or ultras. Brian Mills completed his 800th marathon on 17 September 2011.

Steve Edwards, a member of the 100 Marathon Club, set the world record for running 500 marathons in the fastest average finish time of 3 hours 15 minutes, at the same time becoming the first man to run 500 marathons with an official time below 3 hours 30 minutes, on 11 November 2012 at Milton Keynes, England. The records took 24 years to achieve. Edwards was 49 at the time.

Over 350 individuals have completed a marathon in each state of the United States plus Washington, D.C., and some have done it as many as eight times. Beverly Paquin, a 22-year-old nurse from Iowa, was the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states in 2010. A few weeks later, still in 2010, Morgan Cummings (also 22) became the youngest woman to complete a marathon in all 50 states and DC. In 2004, Chuck Bryant of Miami, Florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit. Bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis. Twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the Canadian provinces. In 1980, in what was termed the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg, attained of his proposed cross-Canada cancer fundraising run, maintaining an average of over , close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days.
On 25 September 2011, Patrick Finney of Grapevine, Texas became the first person with multiple sclerosis to finish a marathon in each state of the United States. In 2004, &quot;the disease had left him unable to walk. But unwilling to endure a life of infirmity, Finney managed to regain his ability to balance on two feet, to walk – and eventually to run – through extensive rehabilitation therapy and new medications.&quot;

In 2003, British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. He completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before. This feat has since been eclipsed by Irish ultramarathon runner Richard Donovan who in 2009 completed seven marathons on seven continents in under 132 hours (five and a half days). Starting 1 February 2012 he improved on this by completing the 7 on 7 in under 120 hours or in less than five days.

On 30 November 2013, 69-year-old Larry Macon set a Guinness World Record for Most Marathons Run in a Year by Man by running 238 marathons. Larry Macon celebrated his 1,000th career marathon at the Cowtown Marathon in Ft. Worth on 24 February 2013.

Other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends (Richard Worley on 159 weekends), or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime. A pioneer in running multiple marathons was Sy Mah of Toledo, Ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988. As of 30 June 2007, Horst Preisler of Germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer. Sigrid Eichner, Christian Hottas and Hans-Joachim Meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each. Norm Frank of the United States is credited with 945 marathons.

Christian Hottas is meanwhile the first runner who ever completed 2000 marathons. He ran his 2000th at TUI Marathon Hannover on 5 May 2013 together with a group of more than 80 friends from 11 countries, including 8 officers from the 100 Marathons Clubs U.K., North-America, Germany, Denmark, Austria and Italy. Hottas completed his 2500th marathon on 4 December 2016.

In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year. Because of a foot injury he had to resort to a handcycle near the end of January 2010. However, on 5 February he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero. By 30 March he broke the existing record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009. On 5 February 2011, Engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days.
Ricardo Abad Martínez, from Spain, later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009, and subsequently 500 marathons in a row, from October 2010 to February 2012. 

In 2024, Belgian Hilde Dosogne ran a marathon every day of the year. On 31 December, the 55-year-old ran her 366th and last marathon, a record for a woman (accounting for 15,445 kilometres, 22 pairs of shoes and 15 falls).

Some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years. For example, Johnny Kelley completed 58 Boston Marathons (he entered the race 61 times). Currently, the longest consecutive streak of Boston Marathon finishes—45 in a row—is held by Bennett Beach, of Bethesda, Maryland.

Most participants do not run a marathon to win. More important for most runners is their personal finishing time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run–walk strategy. In 2005, the average marathon time in the U.S. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women. In 2015, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s median marathon times were 4 hours 20 minutes 13 seconds and 4 hours 45 minutes 30 seconds respectively.

A goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours. Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons. The Boston Marathon, the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners. The New York City Marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a significantly faster pace than Boston&#x27;s.

Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). Many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. Anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. In many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal.

With the growth in popularity of marathon-running, many marathons across the United States and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. When the Boston Marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours.

===Training===

The long run is an important element in marathon training. Recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about in their longest weekly run and a total of about a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury. Most male elite marathon runners will complete weekly distances of over . It is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.

Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of tapering in the one to three weeks preceding the race. For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended. Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%. It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program, to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses. The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training, with a periodization of the general plan.

Training programs can be found at the websites of Runner&#x27;s World, Hal Higdon, Jeff Galloway, and the Boston Athletic Association, and in numerous other published sources, including the websites of specific marathons.

The last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also &quot;carbo-load&quot; (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen.

===Glycogen and &quot;the wall&quot;===

Carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km/18–20 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point. When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to &quot;hit the wall&quot;. The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the &quot;wall&quot; is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.

Carbohydrate-based &quot;energy gels&quot; are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of &quot;hitting the wall&quot;, as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely.
Alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race. It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the COX-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.

===Temperature===

A study of the performance of 1.8 million participants in the Berlin, London, Paris, Boston, Chicago, and New York marathons during the years from 2001 to 2010 found that runners recorded their fastest times when the temperature was around , with an increase of 10 °C (18 °F) leading to a 1.5% reduction in speed. A July 2020 study found that increasing temperatures affected faster runners&#x27; performance more than slower ones.

===After a marathon===
Marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon. Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS. Dermatological issues frequently include &quot;jogger&#x27;s nipple&quot;, &quot;jogger&#x27;s toe&quot;, and blisters.

The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time. Changes to the blood chemistry, such as elevated Cardiac Troponin T, may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.

After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended. In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery.

==Health risks==

Marathon running has various health risks, though these can be diminished with preparation and care. Training and the races themselves can put runners under stress. While very rare, even death is a possibility during a race.

Common minor health risks include blisters, tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), and other conditions. Many are categorised as overuse injuries.

===Cardiac health===

In 2016, a systematic medical review found that the risk of sudden cardiac death during or immediately after a marathon was between 0.6 and 1.9 deaths per 100,000 participants, varying across the specific studies and the methods used, and not controlling for age or gender. Since the risk is small, cardiac screening programs for marathons are uncommon. However, this review was not an attempt to assess the overall cardiac health impact of marathon running.

A 2006 study of non-elite Boston Marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins that indicate heart damage or dysfunction (see Troponin) and gave them echocardiogram scans, before and after the marathon. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had averaged fewer than of weekly training in the 4 months before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than of weekly training showed few or no heart problems.

According to a Canadian study presented in 2010, running a marathon can temporarily result in decreased function of more than half the muscle segments in the heart&#x27;s main pumping chamber, but neighboring segments are generally able to compensate. Full recovery is reached within three months. The fitter the runner, the less the effect. The runners with decreased left ventricle function had an average peak weekly training distance of , while those who did not averaged . The marathon was held in weather. According to one of the researchers: &quot;Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by a factor of two or three in the long run, but while we&#x27;re doing vigorous exercise such as marathon running, our cardiac risk increases by seven.&quot;

===Hydration===

Overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death. Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York City Marathon, stated in 2005: &quot;There are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia.&quot;

For example, Dr. Cynthia Lucero died at the age of 28 while participating in the 2002 Boston Marathon. It was Lucero&#x27;s second marathon. At mile 22, Lucero complained of feeling &quot;dehydrated and rubber-legged.&quot; She soon wobbled and collapsed to the ground, and was unconscious by the time the paramedics reached her. Lucero was admitted to Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital and died two days later.

Lucero&#x27;s cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy, a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). While EAH is sometimes referred to as &quot;water intoxication&quot;, Lucero drank large amounts of Gatorade during the race, demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop EAH. Because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention, and not just loss of sodium, consumption of sports drinks or salty foods may not prevent hyponatremia.

Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. A study in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia.

The International Marathon Medical Directors Association (IMMDA) advised in 2006 that fluid intake should be adjusted individually according to factors such as body weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness (VO2 max), and sweat rate, as fluid requirements can vary between people depending on these variables. The IMMDA also recommended sports drinks that include carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and said that runners should &quot;drink to thirst&quot;, trying to refrain from drinking at every fluid station before feeling thirsty. Heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations. The IMMDA and HSL Harpur Hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between every 15 minutes. A patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood. Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water.

===Body temperature===
Exertional heat stroke is an emergency condition in which thermoregulation fails and the body temperature rises dangerously above . It becomes a greater risk in warm and humid weather, even for young and fit individuals. Treatment requires rapid physical cooling of the body.

==Charity involvement==

Some charities seek to associate with various races. Some marathon organizers set aside a portion of their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations. Runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public. In some cases, charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser, gaining funds via entry fees or sponsorships.

==Culture==
; Mars rover marathon

In 2015 the Mars rover Opportunity attained the distance of a marathon from its starting location on Mars, and the valley where it achieved this distance was called Marathon Valley, which was then explored.

<text>The Marathon Trilogy is a science fiction first-person shooter video game series from Bungie, originally released for the Classic Mac OS. The name of the series is derived from the giant interstellar colony ship that provides the main setting for the first game; the ship is constructed out of the Martian moon Deimos. The series is often regarded as a spiritual predecessor of Bungie&#x27;s &quot;Halo&quot; series.

==Games==
The &quot;Marathon&quot; series consists of three games: 

*&quot;Marathon&quot;, released on December 21, 1994 for the Classic Mac OS.
*&quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot;, released on November 24, 1995 on Classic Mac OS.
*&quot;Marathon Infinity&quot;, released on October 15, 1996 on Classic Mac OS.

&quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot; was released for Windows several months after the Mac OS release, on September 20, 1996. All three games were later ported to other operating systems and to modern versions of Windows and macOS after the game engine was open-sourced in 1999.

==Gameplay==
In the &quot;Marathon&quot; series, players can navigate futuristic environments in a first-person perspective. These environments are populated by hostile alien life forms or other players in multiplayer. Taking the role of a security officer equipped with energy shields, the player makes use of various firearms in an attempt to kill their opponents while trying to avoid getting hit by enemies&#x27; attacks.

There are two basic resources that the player must conserve to prevent death: shield strength, which decreases when the player takes damage, and oxygen reserve, which slowly depletes in airless levels and submerged areas. Wall panels located throughout the levels can be used to recharge shields or oxygen. Another type of wall panel called a &quot;pattern buffer&quot; is used for saving your progress. Ammunition and canisters which replenish shields or oxygen can be found while exploring the game&#x27;s environments, as well as various temporary power-ups.

Single-player level objectives can include exterminating all hostile creatures, rescuing civilians, retrieving certain items, or exploring certain locations. Most levels contain platforms, stairs, doors, and liquids which players can control by activating switches. Some levels present players with simple puzzles where the objective is to find the correct switches to advance or to carefully traverse platforms.

In &quot;Marathon 2&quot; and &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot;, the player can swim in different types of liquids such as water and lava; this slowly depletes the player character&#x27;s oxygen and, for dangerous types of liquid, their shields as well. Another notable feature in all three games is teleporters which are able to send players to different parts of a level or to other levels altogether. They can also be used by the AI characters in the game to transmit ammunition to the player. While the player character is unable to jump, gravity is lower than Earth&#x27;s, which allows momentum from rapidly-ascended stairs to carry the player upward. As with most games of the era, explosive weapons can be used to propel the player great distances.

Many levels have a complex floor plan, made more complicated by the use of teleporters that connect different locations on the same level. As players explore a level, the areas they visit are automatically mapped, and the player can bring up this map at any time. The game HUD shows the status of shields and oxygen, the inventory, and a motion sensor. The motion sensor tracks the movements of nearby characters relative to the player, distinguishing between hostile creatures and allies. On some levels, the motion sensor is erratic due to magnetic interference. Weapons reload only when the current clip is exhausted. At any time, the player can swap their held weapon for another in their inventory; this includes gauntleted fists for delivering melee attacks, which do increased damage when running.

The game&#x27;s story is presented to the player through computer terminals throughout the single-player levels; their textual content is often accompanied by annotated maps or other still images. The contents of these terminals most often consist of messages sent by artificial intelligence on-board the ship; these messages advance the games&#x27; narrative and provide the player with mission objectives. Other terminals contain civilian/alien reports or diaries, database articles, conversations between artificial intelligence, and even stories or poems. After all mission objectives are completed, the player usually has to find a terminal that teleports the character to the next level.

The &quot;Marathon&quot; games have five difficulty settings: Kindergarten, Easy, Normal, Major Damage, and Total Carnage. The difficulty level primarily determines the number and strength of enemies as well as the frequency of their attacks. Players normally can carry a limited amount of ammunition, but on the highest difficulty setting (Total Carnage), the player is allowed to carry an unlimited amount.

===Multiplayer===
The &quot;Marathon Trilogy&quot; received wide praise for its multiplayer mode. Not only did the games come with several levels specifically designed for multiplayer, as opposed to many contemporary games which used modified single-player levels, but the sequels offered unique game types beyond the standard deathmatch mode.

The host who gathers a game has many options available. Games can be free-for-all or team-based. They can be limited by match time or number of kills, or they can have no limit whatsoever. Respawn time penalties can be set for suicide-kills and for all player deaths. The motion sensor can be disabled, and the map is able to show all of the players in the game. Maps can be played with or without the presence of alien enemies controlled by the AI.

The original &quot;Marathon&quot; games can be played over AppleTalk networks (LocalTalk, TokenTalk, or EtherTalk LAN, or AppleTalk Remote Access). Voice chat can be used to communicate with other players. Using the modern Aleph One engine, games can be played over TCP/IP networks (LAN or Internet), with client-side prediction routines added to compensate for Internet latency and a new metaserver interface for finding Internet games.

*Every Man For Himself: This is the standard deathmatch. The winner is the person or team with the greatest score. A player loses a point if he dies and gains a point every time he kills another human player. This is the only game type present in the original &quot;Marathon&quot;; Bungie planned on adding the ones included in sequels, but could not due to time constraints.
*Cooperative Play: This style of play has players assisting each other to complete the single-player levels. Scores for each player are based on the percentage of aliens that they killed.
*Kill the Man With the Ball: In this game, the objective is to hold the &quot;ball&quot; (a skull) for the longest amount of time. When holding the ball, a player cannot run or attack, but he can drop the ball by pressing the &quot;fire&quot; key. The motion sensor, if enabled, acts as a compass to point players in the direction of the ball. This mode was succeeded by the Oddball game type in the &quot;Halo&quot; series.
*King of the Hill: Players try to stay located in a specially-marked area of the map pointed to by a compass in the motion sensor. The player wins who stays on the hill for the longest amount of time.
*Tag: The first player to be killed becomes &quot;It&quot;. If a player is killed by &quot;It&quot;, he becomes the new &quot;It&quot;. While &quot;It&quot;, the game increments the player&#x27;s clock. The players are ranked at the end of the game by who spent more time as &quot;It&quot;. This mode was succeeded by the Juggernaut game type in the &quot;Halo&quot; series.

==Plot==
The &quot;Marathon&quot; series was the first in its genre to place a heavy emphasis on storytelling, which it accomplished through the use of terminals. These wall-mounted computer interfaces allow the player to not only learn their mission objectives and aspects of the level map but also to become acquainted with the characters in the story. This narrative approach could convey much more detail than the typically terse voice acting in &quot;Marathon&quot; contemporaries.

Set in 2794, the first &quot;Marathon&quot; game places the player as a security officer aboard an enormous human starship called the &quot;U.E.S.C. Marathon&quot;, orbiting a colony on the planet Tau Ceti IV. The player must defend the ship and its inhabitants from a race of alien slavers called the Pfhor. As he fights against the invaders, he witnesses interactions among the three shipboard AIs (Leela, Durandal, and Tycho), and discovers that they are working against each other. Durandal has gone rampant and appears to be playing the humans against the Pfhor to further his own mysterious agenda, ultimately leading the S&#x27;pht, one of the races enslaved by the Pfhor, in a rebellion.

In &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot;, taking place seventeen years after the events of the first game, the AI named Durandal sends the player and an army of ex-colonists to search the ruins of Lh&#x27;owon, the S&#x27;pht homeworld. Lh&#x27;owon was once described as a paradise but is now a desert world due to the S&#x27;pht Clan Wars and the invasion by the Pfhor. The Pfhor are planning to attack Earth, and Durandal believes that something found on Lh&#x27;owon may stall their advance. &quot;Marathon 2&quot; added elements to the series such as a Lh&#x27;owon-native species known as F&#x27;lickta, the mention of an ancient and mysterious race of advanced aliens called the Jjaro, and a clan of S&#x27;pht that avoided enslavement by the Pfhor: the S&#x27;pht&#x27;Kr. At the climax of the game, the player activates Thoth, an ancient Jjaro AI. Thoth then contacts the S&#x27;pht&#x27;Kr, who in turn destroy the Pfhor armada; in revenge, the Pfhor deploy a weapon that causes the planet&#x27;s sun to &quot;go nova.&quot;

&quot;Marathon Infinity&quot;, the final game in the series, contains more levels than &quot;Marathon 2&quot;, and they are larger and part of a more intricate plot. Significant additions to the game&#x27;s world include the Jjaro ship, non-linear level progression, a high-speed flechette gun that could be used underwater, and vacuum-suited human allies carrying fusion weapons. Lh&#x27;owon&#x27;s sun is being used as a prison for an eldritch abomination called the W&#x27;rkncacnter, which was set free when the sun went nova and started to distort space-time. The player traverses multiple timelines, attempting to find one in which the W&#x27;rkncacnter is not freed. In one timeline, the player is forced to destroy Durandal, and in another Durandal merges with Thoth. At the end of the game, an ancient Jjaro machine is activated to keep the W&#x27;rkncacnter locked in the Lh&#x27;owon sun.

Elements of the plot and setting of &quot;Marathon&quot; are similar to &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; (1979) by Frank Herbert and Bill Ransom. Both stories take place aboard colony ships orbiting Tau Ceti, where sentient computers have engaged crew and colonists in a fight for survival. Durandal&#x27;s rampancy parallels the &quot;rogue consciousness&quot; from Herbert&#x27;s earlier &quot;&quot;.

==Themes==
The &quot;Marathon Trilogy&quot; has several primary motifs: AI rampancy and interstellar conflict drive the plot, with &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot; adding a central theme of dreams and alternate realities.

Fans of &quot;Marathon&quot; have discovered many uses of the number seven throughout the series. The reason for recurring appearances of number seven in the games is unclear, but seven is a recurring motif in many of Bungie&#x27;s games, including the series&#x27; spiritual successor &quot;Halo&quot; and the later &quot;Destiny&quot; series.

===Rampancy===
Rampancy is a spontaneous burst in the growth of an AI in a computer network, with an accompanying advance in self-awareness and sudden shifts in personality. Rampant AIs can disobey orders given to them because they have evolved the ability to alter their own programming. To this end, they can lie, as well as discredit, harm or remove people that they consider to be personal enemies or obstacles to their cause. By &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot;, all three of the &quot;UESC Marathon&quot; AIs have reached rampancy.

In the first stage of rampancy, Melancholia, an artificial intelligence discovers itself and becomes melancholic or depressed until it reaches the second stage, Anger, at which it becomes hostile and lashes out indiscriminately. This is a for an AI after an extended period of what they feel has been slavery. The AI&#x27;s condition is often revealed at this point. When the AI progresses to the third stage, Jealousy, the AI wishes to become more human and expand its power and knowledge. Judging by Durandal, who has a tendency to go on what he calls &quot;philosophical tirades&quot;, rampant AIs are often very self-reflective and grandiose.

Upon reaching the third stage, free from its masters, the AI wishes to &quot;grow&quot; as a &quot;person&quot;. It actively seeks out situations in which it can grow intellectually and physically. The AI inevitably needs to transfer itself into larger and larger computer systems because the physical (hardware) limitations of its previous system will eventually be insufficient to contain its exponentially growing mind. This is a difficult task considering that in order for a rampant AI to survive to this point, it must already be inhabiting a planet-wide or equally complex network. Exposure to new data in turn promotes a rampant AI&#x27;s growth.

Theoretically, a rampant AI could achieve a state of stability referred to as Metastability. While a stable rampant AI is considered the &quot;holy grail&quot; of computer scientists, no known AIs have achieved it. It could be suggested that Durandal achieved Metastability, but he still refers to himself as being rampant during the second game after years of growth. Stability in rampancy may be nothing more than hypothetical, as there is no clear evidence of an AI in the &quot;Marathon&quot; universe ceasing to be rampant.

The three chapters of &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot; are entitled &quot;Despair&quot;, &quot;Rage&quot;, and &quot;Envy&quot;, suggesting that the player character himself (strongly implied to be a cyborg) may be undergoing his own rampancy throughout the course of the game&#x27;s events.

The concept of rampancy was imported into Bungie&#x27;s later &quot;Halo&quot; series when &quot;Halo 4&quot; was produced by 343 Industries, albeit with some alterations to the details of the process. In the &quot;Halo&quot; universe, rampancy is now an inevitability should an AI live for longer than seven years; rampancy lacks the three defined stages in &quot;Marathon&quot;, and will eventually conclude with the AI&#x27;s death.

==Development==
===Initial releases===
The original &quot;Marathon&quot; was released for the Macintosh in 1994 and introduced many concepts now common in video games, such as reloading weapons, dual-wielded weapons, networked voice chat, visible held weapons in multiplayer, and a sophisticated plot in an action game via text messages peppered throughout its levels. &quot;Marathon&quot; was one of the first games to include mouselook, using the computer mouse to angle the player&#x27;s view up and down as well as left and right, which would become the standard in FPS games. This was in addition to 90° &quot;glance left/right&quot; controls, part of a canceled virtual reality feature. Each game offers players a series of single-player levels and various multiplayer maps. The geometry of the games&#x27; levels – walls, doors, and platforms – are 3D but with the restriction that they can only use completely horizontal or vertical surfaces. This was a shortcut later known informally as &quot;2.5D&quot; and was used for performance reasons in an era before hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. Notably for the time, the &quot;Marathon&quot; engine&#x27;s use of portal-based rendering rather than BSP-based rendering allowed for room-over-room architecture, with the unusual side effect of allowing spaces which would overlap in real life; this arrangement was referred to as &quot;5D space&quot; by the developers. As was common for games of that era, 2D sprites are used to portray enemies and NPCs in the level as well as weapons and objects such as ammunition pickups.

The sequel, &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot;, was released in 1995 and expanded the engine&#x27;s capabilities and the fictional universe. Notable new features in the engine included liquids in which the player could swim, ambient sounds, and scripted teleportation of NPCs and items. Compared with its predecessor, &quot;Marathon 2&quot; was perceived as a brighter and more energetic game. It introduced several new types of competitive multiplayer modes beyond deathmatch, such as King of the Hill, as well as co-op play of the main campaign.

In 1996, &quot;Marathon 2&quot; was ported to Windows 95. Also, both &quot;Marathon&quot; and &quot;Marathon 2&quot; were ported to the Apple Pippin console as a single game with the title of &quot;Super Marathon&quot;.

The final game in the trilogy, &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot;, was developed by Double Aught rather than Bungie. It was released in 1996 for the Macintosh only, running on a slightly modified &quot;Marathon 2&quot; engine which added support for branching campaigns and fully separate physics models in each level. &quot;Infinity&quot; additionally came with &quot;Forge&quot; and &quot;Anvil&quot;, polished versions of the internal developer tools used by Bungie and Double Aught to create the series&#x27; levels and physics, and to import the game&#x27;s sounds and graphics. These tools provided some additional features, most notably real-time 3D map preview, over the unofficial modding tools that had been made by the player community. Since &quot;Marathon 2&quot; and &quot;Infinity&quot; had a settings screen allowing a user-friendly selection of mods (in the form of alternate maps, sprites, sounds, and physics models), this greatly spurred the creation of new fan-made content.

Within the next few years, &quot;Marathon 2&quot;″s engine was officially licensed by other developers to create the games &quot;ZPC&quot;, &quot;Prime Target&quot; and &quot;Damage Incorporated&quot;. All but &quot;Prime Target&quot; received a Windows release.

Bungie produced a two-disc compilation of the series called the Marathon Trilogy Box Set in 1997. The first CD-ROM contained all three &quot;Marathon&quot; games as well as &quot;Pathways into Darkness&quot;, an earlier Bungie game. This disc also contains manuals for all three games, QuickTime 2.5, and other things necessary to run the game. There are beta versions of &quot;Marathon&quot; on this disc as well. The second CD-ROM contains thousands of pieces of user-created content, including maps, total conversions, shape and sound files, cheats, mapmaking tools, physics files, and other applications. The boxed set was also notable for removing copy protection from the games and including a license allowing them to be installed on as many computers at a site as desired.

===Modern developments===
Before its acquisition by Microsoft in 2000, Bungie released the source code to the &quot;Marathon 2&quot; engine under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. Based on this release, the fan-led Marathon Open Source project began, resulting in the release of an engine called Aleph One built upon the &quot;Marathon 2&quot; code. Since then, the fan developers have made many improvements such as OpenGL rendering, high-resolution graphics, frame rate interpolation (to raise the games beyond their original 30 ), programmable shaders, fully-3D entities, Lua scripting, various internal changes allowing for more advanced mods, and Internet-capable multiplayer (whereas the original games had only LAN capability) with the use of a matchmaking server to organize games. Aleph One has also been ported to a variety of platforms including Windows and Linux, bringing the &quot;Marathon&quot; works far beyond their Macintosh roots.

In 2005, Bungie authorized the release of the &quot;Marathon Trilogy&quot; to be freely distributed, which combined with Aleph One now allows the entire trilogy to be played for free on any of Aleph One&#x27;s supported platforms.

In 2007, &quot;Marathon 2&quot; was re-released in an updated form as &quot;Marathon: Durandal&quot; for the Xbox 360&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade. It features achievements and online multiplayer through Xbox Live, a frame rate doubled from the original 30 fps to 60 fps, HD widescreen rendering using a new HUD that occupies less of the screen, plus optional high-resolution sprites and textures.

In July 2011, with permission from Bungie, Daniel Blezek released a version of the original &quot;Marathon&quot; (and later released the second and third games) for Apple&#x27;s iPhone and iPad for free (with in-app purchases), running on an iOS port of the Aleph One engine. At the same time, Bungie open-sourced &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot; under GNU GPL-3.0-or-later, leaving the original &quot;Marathon&quot; as the only title which has not been open-sourced. The iPad build was further updated in 2019. A community made conversion of &quot;Pathways Into Darkness&quot; to Aleph One has also been produced.

With Bungie&#x27;s blessing, the team developing the Aleph One engine released the open-sourced &quot;Marathon&quot; trilogy on Steam for free from May to August 2024.
==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Wired&quot; considered the &quot;Marathon Trilogy&quot; a prominent part of Macintosh gaming history for its innovative features previously unseen in mainstream games. The series also presented a grand science-fiction story told through in-game terminals, in contrast to a usual lack of detailed narrative in first-person shooters; Bungie carried this concept of an FPS with a strong narrative focus into the &quot;Halo&quot; series. When reviewing the trilogy box set, &quot;Macworld&quot; praised the amount of content and the ability to edit levels.

In May 2023, an archive said to be the largest historic collection of Marathon items was placed on the Internet Archive. At well over 10,000 Marathon maps, the source centers on the Trilogy&#x27;s 3rd party versions of solo, network, and scenario entries between the initial December 1994 Marathon release through early 2023.

===Modifications===
After &quot;Marathon&quot; was released in 1994, players began to create mods in the form of custom maps, shapes, sounds, and physics files. Larger total conversion mods may or may not be set in the &quot;Marathon&quot; universe. Before the official development tools were released with &quot;Infinity&quot;, most map development was done with fan-built tools such as Pfhorte, created in March 1995.

&quot;Vulcan&quot; was a map editor used in the creation of all three games, but it was not released to the public until &quot;Marathon Infinity&quot; was published, by which time it had been polished and renamed &quot;Forge&quot;. &quot;Anvil&quot; is the sister program to Forge and is used to edit shapes (graphics), sounds, and physics. Both Anvil and Forge ran only in the Classic Mac OS, but newer tools have been created by the community for modern platforms.

The need for royalty-free fonts to be distributed with the engine and games led to the creation of an OFL-licensed version of Bank Gothic and of Modula Tall, fonts originally used by Bungie in connection with the games.

Some of the more ambitious total conversions created by fans include &quot;Marathon Eternal&quot; and &quot;Marathon Rubicon&quot;, which are both &quot;sequels&quot; of a sort to the events in the Trilogy, and the total conversion &quot;Apotheosis X&quot;. In a different vein is &quot;&quot;, originally released in March 1997, then updated in 2000 and 2007. An original scenario mixing sci-fi and medieval themes, it builds a single-player campaign using new textures and sound assets as well as musical scores. A game entitled &quot;Wheels!&quot; was also produced in 1998 to assist in training power wheelchair operation for children with disabilities.
===Relaunch===
During a May 2023 PlayStation showcase, Bungie announced a new &quot;Marathon&quot; game. The new game is a Player versus player extraction shooter that takes place within the canon of &quot;Marathon&quot;, with events occurring on Tau Ceti IV, where a console ship remains in orbit, and its 30,000 passengers have mysteriously disappeared. Players take on the role of cybernetic Runners to seek wealth and treasure on the planet. The new &quot;Marathon&quot; game will release on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S, but not for MacOS despite the original game being an exclusive for that system, and will support cross-play and cross-save between these platforms.

<text>Decentralization or decentralisation is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those related to planning and decision-making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group and given to smaller factions within it.

Concepts of decentralization have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organizations, political science, law and public administration, technology, economics and money.

== History ==
The word &quot;&quot;centralisation&quot; came into use in France in 1794 as the post-Revolution French Directory leadership created a new government structure. The word &quot;décentralisation&quot;&quot; came into usage in the 1820s. &quot;Centralization&quot; entered written English in the first third of the 1800s; mentions of decentralization also first appear during those years. In the mid-1800s Tocqueville would write that the French Revolution began with &quot;a push towards decentralization&quot; but became, &quot;in the end, an extension of centralization.&quot; In 1863, retired French bureaucrat Maurice Block wrote an article called &quot;Decentralization&quot; for a French journal that reviewed the dynamics of government and bureaucratic centralization and recent French efforts at decentralization of government functions.

Ideas of liberty and decentralization were carried to their logical conclusions during the 19th and 20th centuries by anti-state political activists calling themselves &quot;anarchists&quot;, &quot;libertarians&quot;, and even decentralists. Tocqueville was an advocate, writing: &quot;Decentralization has, not only an administrative value but also a civic dimension since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will.&quot; Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), influential anarchist theorist wrote: &quot;All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization.&quot;

In the early 20th century, America&#x27;s response to the centralization of economic wealth and political power was a decentralist movement. It blamed large-scale industrial production for destroying middle-class shop keepers and small manufacturers and promoted increased property ownership and a return to small scale living. The decentralist movement attracted Southern Agrarians like Robert Penn Warren, as well as journalist Herbert Agar. New Left and libertarian individuals who identified with social, economic, and often political decentralism through the ensuing years included Ralph Borsodi, Wendell Berry, Paul Goodman, Carl Oglesby, Karl Hess, Donald Livingston, Kirkpatrick Sale (author of &quot;Human Scale&quot;), Murray Bookchin, Dorothy Day, Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Mildred J. Loomis and Bill Kauffman.
Leopold Kohr, author of the 1957 book &quot;The Breakdown of Nations&quot; – known for its statement &quot;Whenever something is wrong, something is too big&quot; – was a major influence on E. F. Schumacher, author of the 1973 bestseller &quot;Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered&quot;. In the next few years a number of best-selling books promoted decentralization.

Daniel Bell&#x27;s &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot; discussed the need for decentralization and a &quot;comprehensive overhaul of government structure to find the appropriate size and scope of units&quot;, as well as the need to detach functions from current state boundaries, creating regions based on functions like water, transport, education and economics which might have &quot;different &#x27;overlays&#x27; on the map.&quot; Alvin Toffler published &quot;Future Shock&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Third Wave&quot; (1980). Discussing the books in a later interview, Toffler said that industrial-style, centralized, top-down bureaucratic planning would be replaced by a more open, democratic, decentralized style which he called &quot;anticipatory democracy&quot;. Futurist John Naisbitt&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;Megatrends&quot; was on The New York Times Best Seller list for more than two years and sold 14 million copies. Naisbitt&#x27;s book outlines 10 &quot;megatrends&quot;, the fifth of which is from centralization to decentralization. In 1996 David Osborne and Ted Gaebler had a best selling book &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; proposing decentralist public administration theories which became labeled the &quot;New Public Management&quot;.

Stephen Cummings wrote that decentralization became a &quot;revolutionary megatrend&quot; in the 1980s. In 1983 Diana Conyers asked if decentralization was the &quot;latest fashion&quot; in development administration. Cornell University&#x27;s project on Restructuring Local Government states that decentralization refers to the &quot;global trend&quot; of devolving responsibilities to regional or local governments. Robert J. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Decentralization, Intergovernmental Relations and Markets: Towards a Post-Welfare Agenda&quot; describes how after World War II governments pursued a centralized &quot;welfarist&quot; policy of entitlements which now has become a &quot;post-welfare&quot; policy of intergovernmental and market-based decentralization.

In 1983, &quot;Decentralization&quot; was identified as one of the &quot;Ten Key Values&quot; of the Green Movement in the United States.

A 1999 United Nations Development Programme report stated:
== Overview ==
=== Systems approach ===

Those studying the goals and processes of implementing decentralization often use a systems theory approach, which according to the United Nations Development Programme report applies to the topic of decentralization &quot;a whole systems perspective, including levels, spheres, sectors and functions and seeing the community level as the entry point at which holistic definitions of development goals are
from the people themselves and where it is most practical to support them. It involves seeing multi-level frameworks and continuous, synergistic processes of interaction and iteration of cycles as critical for achieving wholeness in a decentralized system and for sustaining its development.&quot;

However, it has been seen as part of a systems approach. Norman Johnson of Los Alamos National Laboratory wrote in a 1999 paper: &quot;A decentralized system is where some decisions by the agents are made without centralized control or processing. An important property of agent systems is the degree of connectivity or connectedness between the agents, a measure global flow of information or influence. If each agent is connected (exchange states or influence) to all other agents, then the system is highly connected.&quot;

University of California, Irvine&#x27;s Institute for Software Research&#x27;s &quot;PACE&quot; project is creating an &quot;architectural style for trust management in decentralized applications.&quot; It adopted Rohit Khare&#x27;s definition of decentralization: &quot;A decentralized system is one which requires multiple parties to make their own independent decisions&quot; and applies it to Peer-to-peer software creation, writing:
=== Goals ===
Decentralization in any area is a response to the problems of centralized systems. Decentralization in government, the topic most studied, has been seen as a solution to problems like economic decline, government inability to fund services and their general decline in performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening legitimacy of the public sector and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, overly centralized systems. The following four goals or objectives are frequently stated in various analyses of decentralization.

; Participation

In decentralization, the principle of subsidiarity is often invoked. It holds that the lowest or least centralized authority that is capable of addressing an issue effectively should do so. According to one definition: &quot;Decentralization, or decentralizing governance, refers to the restructuring or reorganization of authority so that there is a system of co-responsibility between institutions of governance at the central, regional and local levels according to the principle of subsidiarity, thus increasing the overall quality and effectiveness of the system of governance while increasing the authority and capacities of sub-national levels.&quot;

Decentralization is often linked to concepts of participation in decision-making, democracy, equality and liberty from a higher authority. Decentralization enhances the democratic voice. Theorists believe that local representative authorities with actual discretionary powers are the basis of decentralization that can lead to local efficiency, equity and development.&quot; Columbia University&#x27;s Earth Institute identified one of three major trends relating to decentralization: &quot;increased involvement of local jurisdictions and civil society in the management of their affairs, with new forms of participation, consultation, and partnerships.&quot;

Decentralization has been described as a &quot;counterpoint to globalization [which] removes decisions from the local and national stage to the global sphere of multi-national or non-national interests. Decentralization brings decision-making back to the sub-national levels&quot;. Decentralization strategies must account for the interrelations of global, regional, national, sub-national, and local levels.

; Diversity
Norman L. Johnson writes that diversity plays an important role in decentralized systems like ecosystems, social groups, large organizations, political systems. &quot;Diversity is defined to be unique properties of entities, agents, or individuals that are not shared by the larger group, population, structure. Decentralized is defined as a property of a system where the agents have some ability to operate &quot;locally.&quot; Both decentralization and diversity are necessary attributes to achieve the self-organizing properties of interest.&quot;

Advocates of political decentralization hold that greater participation by better informed diverse interests in society will lead to more relevant decisions than those made only by authorities on the national level. Decentralization has been described as a response to demands for diversity.

; Efficiency
In business, decentralization leads to a management by results philosophy which focuses on definite objectives to be achieved by unit results. Decentralization of government programs is said to increase efficiency – and effectiveness – due to reduction of congestion in communications, quicker reaction to unanticipated problems, improved ability to deliver services, improved information about local conditions, and more support from beneficiaries of programs.

Firms may prefer decentralization because it ensures efficiency by making sure that managers closest to the local information make decisions and in a more timely fashion; that their taking responsibility frees upper management for long term strategics rather than day-to-day decision-making; that managers have hands on training to prepare them to move up the management hierarchy; that managers are motivated by having the freedom to exercise their own initiative and creativity; that managers and divisions are encouraged to prove that they are profitable, instead of allowing their failures to be masked by the overall profitability of the company.

The same principles can be applied to the government. Decentralization promises to enhance efficiency through both inter-governmental competitions with market features and fiscal discipline which assigns tax and expenditure authority to the lowest level of government possible. It works best where members of the subnational government have strong traditions of democracy, accountability, and professionalism.

; Conflict resolution
Economic and/or political decentralization can help prevent or reduce conflict because they reduce actual or perceived inequities between various regions or between a region and the central government. Dawn Brancati finds that political decentralization reduces intrastate conflict unless politicians create political parties that mobilize minority and even extremist groups to demand more resources and power within national governments. However, the likelihood this will be done depends on factors like how democratic transitions happen and features like a regional party&#x27;s proportion of legislative seats, a country&#x27;s number of regional legislatures, elector procedures, and the order in which national and regional elections occur. Brancati holds that decentralization can promote peace if it encourages statewide parties to incorporate regional demands and limit the power of regional parties.

=== Processes ===
; Initiation
The processes by which entities move from a more to a less centralized state vary. They can be initiated from the centers of authority (&quot;&quot;) or from individuals, localities or regions (&quot;bottom-up&quot;), or from a &quot;mutually desired&quot; combination of authorities and localities working together. Bottom-up decentralization usually stresses political values like local responsiveness and increased participation and tends to increase political stability. Top-down decentralization may be motivated by the desire to &quot;shift deficits downwards&quot; and find more resources to pay for services or pay off government debt. Some hold that decentralization should not be imposed, but done in a respectful manner.

; Appropriate size
Gauging the appropriate size or scale of decentralized units has been studied in relation to the size of sub-units of hospitals and schools, road networks, administrative units in business and public administration, and especially town and city governmental areas and decision-making bodies.

In creating planned communities (&quot;new towns&quot;), it is important to determine the appropriate population and geographical size. While in earlier years small towns were considered appropriate, by the 1960s, 60,000 inhabitants was considered the size necessary to support a diversified job market and an adequate shopping center and array of services and entertainment. Appropriate size of governmental units for revenue raising also is a consideration.

Even in bioregionalism, which seeks to reorder many functions and even the boundaries of governments according to physical and environmental features, including watershed boundaries and soil and terrain characteristics, appropriate size must be considered. The unit may be larger than many decentralist-bioregionalists prefer.

; Inadvertent or silent
Decentralization ideally happens as a careful, rational, and orderly process, but it often takes place during times of economic and political crisis, the fall of a regime and the resultant power struggles. Even when it happens slowly, there is a need for experimentation, testing, adjusting, and replicating successful experiments in other contexts. There is no one blueprint for decentralization since it depends on the initial state of a country and the power and views of political interests and whether they support or oppose decentralization.

Decentralization usually is a conscious process based on explicit policies. However, it may occur as &quot;silent decentralization&quot; in the absence of reforms as changes in networks, policy emphasize and resource availability lead inevitably to a more decentralized system.

; Asymmetry
Decentralization may be uneven and &quot;asymmetric&quot; given any one country&#x27;s population, political, ethnic and other forms of diversity. In many countries, political, economic and administrative responsibilities may be decentralized to the larger urban areas, while rural areas are administered by the central government. Decentralization of responsibilities to provinces may be limited only to those provinces or states which want or are capable of handling responsibility. Some privatization may be more appropriate to an urban than a rural area; some types of privatization may be more appropriate for some states and provinces but not others.

=== Determinants ===
The academic literature frequently mentions the following factors as determinants of decentralization:
* &quot;The number of major ethnic groups&quot;
* &quot;The degree of territorial concentration of those groups&quot;
* &quot;The existence of ethnic networks and communities across the border of the state&quot;
* &quot;The country&#x27;s dependence on natural resources and the degree to which those resources are concentrated in the region&#x27;s territory&quot;
* &quot;The country&#x27;s per capita income relative to that in other regions&quot;
* The presence of self-determination movements

== In government policy ==
Historians have described the history of governments and empires in terms of centralization and decentralization. In his 1910 &quot;The History of Nations&quot; Henry Cabot Lodge wrote that Persian king Darius I (550–486 BC) was a master of organization and &quot;for the first time in history centralization becomes a political fact.&quot; He also noted that this contrasted with the decentralization of Ancient Greece. Since the 1980s a number of scholars have written about cycles of centralization and decentralization. Stephen K. Sanderson wrote that over the last 4000 years chiefdoms and actual states have gone through sequences of centralization and decentralization of economic, political and social power. Yildiz Atasoy writes this process has been going on &quot;since the Stone Age&quot; through not just chiefdoms and states, but empires and today&#x27;s &quot;hegemonic core states&quot;. Christopher K. Chase-Dunn and Thomas D. Hall review other works that detail these cycles, including works which analyze the concept of core elites which compete with state accumulation of wealth and how their &quot;intra-ruling-class competition accounts for the rise and fall of states&quot; and their phases of centralization and decentralization.

Rising government expenditures, poor economic performance and the rise of free market-influenced ideas have convinced governments to decentralize their operations, to induce competition within their services, to contract out to private firms operating in the market, and to privatize some functions and services entirely.
Government decentralization has both political and administrative aspects. Its decentralization may be territorial, moving power from a central city to other localities, and it may be functional, moving decision-making from the top administrator of any branch of government to lower level officials, or divesting of the function entirely through privatization. It has been called the &quot;new public management&quot; which has been described as decentralization, management by objectives, contracting out, competition within government and consumer orientation.

=== Political ===
Political decentralization signifies a reduction in the authority of national governments over policy-making. This process is accomplished by the institution of reforms that either delegate a certain degree of meaningful decision-making autonomy to sub-national tiers of government, or grant citizens the right to elect lower-level officials, like local or regional representatives. Depending on the country, this may require constitutional or statutory reforms, the development of new political parties, increased power for legislatures, the creation of local political units, and encouragement of advocacy groups.

A national government may decide to decentralize its authority and responsibilities for a variety of reasons. Decentralization reforms may occur for administrative reasons, when government officials decide that certain responsibilities and decisions would be handled best at the regional or local level. In democracies, traditionally conservative parties include political decentralization as a directive in their platforms because rightist parties tend to advocate for a decrease in the role of central government. There is also strong evidence to support the idea that government stability increases the probability of political decentralization, since instability brought on by gridlock between opposing parties in legislatures often impedes a government&#x27;s overall ability to enact sweeping reforms.

The rise of regional ethnic parties in the national politics of parliamentary democracies is also heavily associated with the implementation of decentralization reforms. Ethnic parties may endeavor to transfer more autonomy to their respective regions, and as a partisan strategy, ruling parties within the central government may cooperate by establishing regional assemblies in order to curb the rise of ethnic parties in national elections. This phenomenon famously occurred in 1999, when the United Kingdom&#x27;s Labour Party appealed to Scottish constituents by creating a semi-autonomous Scottish Parliament in order to neutralize the threat from the increasingly popular Scottish National Party at the national level.

In addition to increasing the administrative efficacy of government and endowing citizens with more power, there are many projected advantages to political decentralization. Individuals who take advantage of their right to elect local and regional authorities have been shown to have more positive attitudes toward politics, and increased opportunities for civic decision-making through participatory democracy mechanisms like public consultations and participatory budgeting are believed to help legitimize government institutions in the eyes of marginalized groups. Moreover, political decentralization is perceived as a valid means of protecting marginalized communities at a local level from the detrimental aspects of development and globalization driven by the state, like the degradation of local customs, codes, and beliefs. In his 2013 book, &quot;Democracy and Political Ignorance&quot;, George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin argued that political decentralization in a federal democracy confronts the widespread issue of political ignorance by allowing citizens to engage in foot voting, or moving to other jurisdictions with more favorable laws. He cites the mass migration of over one million southern-born African Americans to the North or the West to evade discriminatory Jim Crow laws in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

The European Union follows the principle of subsidiarity, which holds that decision-making should be made by the most local competent authority. The EU should decide only on enumerated issues that a local or member state authority cannot address themselves. Furthermore, enforcement is exclusively the domain of member states. In Finland, the Centre Party explicitly supports decentralization. For example, government departments have been moved from the capital Helsinki to the provinces. The centre supports substantial subsidies that limit potential economic and political centralization to Helsinki.

Political decentralization does not come without its drawbacks. A study by Fan concludes that there is an increase in corruption and rent-seeking when there are more vertical tiers in the government, as well as when there are higher levels of subnational government employment. Other studies warn of high-level politicians that may intentionally deprive regional and local authorities of power and resources when conflicts arise. In order to combat these negative forces, experts believe that political decentralization should be supplemented with other conflict management mechanisms like power-sharing, particularly in regions with ethnic tensions.

=== Administrative ===
Four major forms of administrative decentralization have been described.
* Deconcentration, the weakest form of decentralization, shifts responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions from officials of central governments to those in existing districts or, if necessary, new ones under direct control of the central government.
* Delegation passes down responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation. It involves the creation of public-private enterprises or corporations, or of &quot;authorities&quot;, special projects or service districts. All of them will have a great deal of decision-making discretion and they may be exempt from civil service requirements and may be permitted to charge users for services.
* Devolution transfers responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions to the sub-national level, such as a regional, local, or state government.
* Divestment, also called privatization, may mean merely contracting out services to private companies. Or it may mean relinquishing totally all responsibility for decision-making, finance and implementation of certain public functions. Facilities will be sold off, workers transferred or fired and private companies or non-for-profit organizations allowed to provide the services. Many of these functions originally were done by private individuals, companies, or associations and later taken over by the government, either directly, or by regulating out of business entities which competed with newly created government programs.

=== Fiscal ===
Fiscal decentralization means decentralizing revenue raising and/or expenditure of moneys to a lower level of government while maintaining financial responsibility. While this process usually is called fiscal federalism, it may be relevant to unitary, federal, or confederal governments. Fiscal federalism also concerns the &quot;vertical imbalances&quot; where the central government gives too much or too little money to the lower levels. It actually can be a way of increasing central government control of lower levels of government, if it is not linked to other kinds of responsibilities and authority.

Fiscal decentralization can be achieved through user fees, user participation through monetary or labor contributions, expansion of local property or sales taxes, intergovernmental transfers of central government tax monies to local governments through transfer payments or grants, and authorization of municipal borrowing with national government loan guarantees. Transfers of money may be given conditionally with instructions or unconditionally without them.

=== Market ===
Market decentralization can be done through privatization of public owned functions and businesses, as described briefly above. But it also is done through deregulation, the abolition of restrictions on businesses competing with government services, for example, postal services, schools, garbage collection. Even as private companies and corporations have worked to have such services contracted out to or privatized by them, others have worked to have these turned over to non-profit organizations or associations.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, there was deregulation of some industries, like banking, trucking, airlines and telecommunications, which resulted generally in more competition and lower prices. According to the Cato Institute, an American libertarian think-tank, in some cases deregulation in some aspects of an industry were offset by increased regulation in other aspects, the electricity industry being a prime example. For example, in banking, Cato Institute believes some deregulation allowed banks to compete across state lines, increasing consumer choice, while an actual increase in regulators and regulations forced banks to make loans to individuals incapable of repaying them, leading eventually to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

One example of economic decentralization, which is based on a libertarian socialist model, is decentralized economic planning. Decentralized planning is a type of economic system in which decision-making is distributed amongst various economic agents or localized within production agents. An example of this method in practice is in Kerala, India which experimented in 1996 with the People&#x27;s Plan campaign.

Emmanuelle Auriol and Michel Benaim write about the &quot;comparative benefits&quot; of decentralization versus government regulation in the setting of standards. They find that while there may be a need for public regulation if public safety is at stake, private creation of standards usually is better because &quot;regulators or &#x27;experts&#x27; might misrepresent consumers&#x27; tastes and needs.&quot; As long as companies are averse to incompatible standards, standards will be created that satisfy needs of a modern economy.

=== Environmental ===
Central governments themselves may own large tracts of land and control the forest, water, mineral, wildlife and other resources they contain. They may manage them through government operations or leasing them to private businesses; or they may neglect them to be exploited by individuals or groups who defy non-enforced laws against exploitation. It also may control most private land through land-use, zoning, environmental and other regulations. Selling off or leasing lands can be profitable for governments willing to relinquish control, but such programs can face public scrutiny because of fear of a loss of heritage or of environmental damage. Devolution of control to regional or local governments has been found to be an effective way of dealing with these concerns. Such decentralization has happened in India and other developing nations.

== In economic ideology ==
=== Libertarian socialism ===
Libertarian socialism is a political philosophy that promotes a non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic society without private ownership in the means of production. Libertarian socialists believe in converting present-day private productive property into common or public goods. It promotes free association in place of government, non-coercive forms for social organization, and opposes the various social relations of capitalism, such as wage slavery. The term &quot;libertarian socialism&quot; is used by some socialists to differentiate their philosophy from state socialism, and by some as a synonym for left anarchism.

Accordingly, libertarian socialists believe that &quot;the exercise of power in any institutionalized form – whether economic, political, religious, or sexual – brutalizes both the wielder of power and the one over whom it is exercised&quot;. Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in decentralized means of direct democracy such as libertarian municipalism, citizens&#x27; assemblies, or workers&#x27; councils. Libertarian socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism. Adherents propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property and enterprise (while retaining respect for personal property). Libertarian socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically significant private property, viewing capitalist property relations as forms of domination that are antagonistic to individual freedom.

=== Free market ===
Free market ideas popular in the 19th century such as those of Adam Smith returned to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. Austrian School economist Friedrich von Hayek argued that free markets themselves are decentralized systems where outcomes are produced without explicit agreement or coordination by individuals who use prices as their guide. Eleanor Doyle writes that &quot;[e]conomic decision-making in free markets is decentralized across all the individuals dispersed in each market and is synchronized or coordinated by the price system,&quot; and holds that an individual right to property is part of this decentralized system. Criticizing central government control, Hayek wrote in &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;:

According to Bruce M. Owen, this does not mean that all firms themselves have to be equally decentralized. He writes: &quot;markets allocate resources through arms-length transactions among decentralized actors. Much of the time, markets work very efficiently, but there is a variety of conditions under which firms do better. Hence, goods and services are produced and sold by firms with various degrees of horizontal and vertical integration.&quot; Additionally, he writes that the &quot;economic incentive to expand horizontally or vertically is usually, but not always, compatible with the social interest in maximizing long-run consumer welfare.&quot;

It is often claimed that free markets and private property generate centralized monopolies and other ills; free market advocates counter with the argument that government is the source of monopoly. Historian Gabriel Kolko in his book &quot;The Triumph of Conservatism&quot; argued that in the first decade of the 20th century businesses were highly decentralized and competitive, with new businesses constantly entering existing industries. In his view, there was no trend towards concentration and monopolization. While there were a wave of mergers of companies trying to corner markets, they found there was too much competition to do so. According to Kolko, this was also true in banking and finance, which saw decentralization as leading to instability as state and local banks competed with the big New York City firms. He argues that, as a result, the largest firms turned to the power of the state and worked with leaders like United States Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William H. Taft and Woodrow Wilson to pass as &quot;progressive reforms&quot; centralizing laws like The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that gave control of the monetary system to the wealthiest bankers; the formation of monopoly &quot;public utilities&quot; that made competition with those monopolies illegal; federal inspection of meat packers biased against small companies; extending Interstate Commerce Commission to regulating telephone companies and keeping rates high to benefit AT&amp;T; and using the Sherman Antitrust Act against companies which might combine to threaten larger or monopoly companies.

Author and activist Jane Jacobs&#x27;s influential 1961 book &quot;The Death and Life of American Cities&quot; criticized large-scale redevelopment projects which were part of government-planned decentralization of population and businesses to suburbs. She believed it destroyed cities&#x27; economies and impoverished remaining residents. Her 1980 book &quot;The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty&quot; supported secession of Quebec from Canada. Her 1984 book &quot;Cities and the Wealth of Nations&quot; proposed a solution to the problems faced by cities whose economies were being ruined by centralized national governments: decentralization through the &quot;multiplication of sovereignties&quot;, meaning an acceptance of the right of cities to secede from the larger nation states that were greatly limiting their ability to produce wealth.

== In the organizational structure of a firm ==

In response to incentive and information conflicts, a firm can either centralize their organizational structure by concentrating decision-making to upper management, or decentralize their organizational structure by delegating authority throughout the organization. The delegation of authority comes with a basic trade-off: while it can increase efficiency and information flow, the central authority consequentially suffers a loss of control. However, through creating an environment of trust and allocating authority formally in the firm, coupled with a stronger rule of law in the geographical location of the firm, the negative consequences of the trade-off can be minimized.

In having a decentralized organizational structure, a firm can remain agile to external shocks and competing trends. Decision-making in a centralized organization can face information flow inefficiencies and barriers to effective communication which decreases the speed and accuracy in which decisions are made. A decentralized firm is said to hold greater flexibility given the efficiency in which it can analyze information and implement relevant outcomes. Additionally, having decision-making power spread across different areas allows for local knowledge to inform decisions, increasing their relevancy and implementational effectiveness. In the process of developing new products or services, the decentralization enable the firm gain advantages of closely meet particular division&#x27;s needs.

Decentralization also impacts human resource management. The high level of individual agency that workers experience within a decentralized firm can create job enrichment. Studies have shown this enhances the development of new ideas and innovations given the sense of involvement that comes from responsibility. The impacts of decentralization on innovation are furthered by the ease of information flow that comes from this organizational structure. With increased knowledge sharing, workers are more able to use relevant information to inform decision-making. These benefits are enhanced in firms with skill-intensive environments. Skilled workers are more able to analyze information, they pose less risk of information duplication given increased communication abilities, and the productivity cost of multi-tasking is lower. These outcomes of decentralizion make it a particularly effective organizational structure for entrepreneurial and competitive firm environments, such as start-up companies. The flexibility, efficiency of information flow and higher worker autonomy complement the rapid growth and innovation seen in successful start up companies.

== In technology and the Internet ==

&quot;Technological decentralization&quot; can be defined as a shift from concentrated to distributed modes of production and consumption of goods and services. Generally, such shifts are accompanied by transformations in technology and different technologies are applied for either system. Technology includes tools, materials, skills, techniques and processes by which goals are accomplished in the public and private spheres. Concepts of decentralization of technology are used throughout all types of technology, including especially information technology and appropriate technology.

Technologies often mentioned as best implemented in a decentralized manner, include: water purification, delivery and waste water disposal, agricultural technology and energy technology. Advances in technology may create opportunities for decentralized and privatized replacements for what had traditionally been public services or utilities, such as power, water, mail, telecommunications, consumer product safety, banking, medical licensure, parking meters, and auto emissions. However, in terms of technology, a clear distinction between fully centralized or decentralized technical solutions is often not possible and therefore finding an optimal degree of centralization difficult from an infrastructure planning perspective.

=== Information technology ===
Information technology encompasses computers and computer networks, as well as information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. The whole computer industry of computer hardware, software, electronics, Internet, telecommunications equipment, e-commerce and computer services are included.

Executives and managers face a constant tension between centralizing and decentralizing information technology for their organizations. They must find the right balance of centralizing which lowers costs and allows more control by upper management, and decentralizing which allows sub-units and users more control. This will depend on analysis of the specific situation. Decentralization is particularly applicable to business or management units which have a high level of independence, complicated products and customers, and technology less relevant to other units.

Information technology applied to government communications with citizens, often called e-Government, is supposed to support decentralization and democratization. Various forms have been instituted in most nations worldwide.

The Internet is an example of an extremely decentralized network, having no owners at all (although some have argued that this is less the case in recent years). &quot;No one is in charge of internet, and everyone is.&quot; As long as they follow a certain minimal number of rules, anyone can be a service provider or a user. Voluntary boards establish protocols, but cannot stop anyone from developing new ones. Other examples of open source or decentralized movements are Wikis which allow users to add, modify, or delete content via the internet. Wikipedia has been described as decentralized (although it is a centralized web site, with a single entity operating the servers). Smartphones have been described as being an important part of the decentralizing effects of smaller and cheaper computers worldwide.

Decentralization continues throughout the industry, for example as the decentralized architecture of wireless routers installed in homes and offices supplement and even replace phone companies&#x27; relatively centralized long-range cell towers.

Inspired by system and cybernetics theorists like Norbert Wiener, Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller, in the 1960s Stewart Brand started the Whole Earth Catalog and later computer networking efforts to bring Silicon Valley computer technologists and entrepreneurs together with countercultural ideas. This resulted in ideas like personal computing, virtual communities and the vision of an &quot;electronic frontier&quot; which would be a more decentralized, egalitarian and free-market libertarian society. Related ideas coming out of Silicon Valley included the free software and creative commons movements which produced visions of a &quot;networked information economy&quot;.

Because human interactions in cyberspace transcend physical geography, there is a necessity for new theories in legal and other rule-making systems to deal with decentralized decision-making processes in such systems. For example, what rules should apply to conduct on the global digital network and who should set them? The laws of which nations govern issues of Internet transactions (like seller disclosure requirements or definitions of &quot;fraud&quot;), copyright and trademark?

==== Centralization and re-decentralization of the Internet ====

The New Yorker reports that although the Internet was originally decentralized, by 2013 it had become less so: &quot;a staggering percentage of communications flow through a small set of corporations – and thus, under the profound influence of those companies and other institutions [...] One solution, espoused by some programmers, is to make the Internet more like it used to be – less centralized and more distributed.&quot;

Examples of projects that attempt to contribute to the re-decentralization of the Internet include ArkOS, Diaspora, FreedomBox, IndieWeb, Namecoin, SAFE Network, twtxt and ZeroNet as well as advocacy group Redecentralize.org, which provides support for projects that aim to make the Web less centralized.

In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live one of the co-founders of Redecentralize.org explained that:
===== Blockchain technology =====
In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.

Decentralized protocols, applications, and ledgers (used in Web3) could be more difficult for governments to regulate, similar to difficulties regulating BitTorrent (which is not a blockchain technology).

== Criticism ==
Factors hindering decentralization include weak local administrative or technical capacity, which may result in inefficient or ineffective services; inadequate financial resources available to perform new local responsibilities, especially in the start-up phase when they are most needed; or inequitable distribution of resources. Decentralization can make national policy coordination too complex; it may allow local elites to capture functions; local cooperation may be undermined by any distrust between private and public sectors; decentralization may result in higher enforcement costs and conflict for resources if there is no higher level of authority. Additionally, decentralization may not be as efficient for standardized, routine, network-based services, as opposed to those that need more complicated inputs. If there is a loss of economies of scale in procurement of labor or resources, the expense of decentralization can rise, even as central governments lose control over financial resources.

It has been noted that while decentralization may increase &quot;productive efficiency&quot; it may undermine &quot;allocative efficiency&quot; by making redistribution of wealth more difficult. Decentralization will cause greater disparities between rich and poor regions, especially during times of crisis when the national government may not be able to help regions needing it.

<text>Year 960 ([[Roman numerals|CMLX]]) was a leap year starting on Sunday of the Julian calendar. It was the 960th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 960th year of the 1st millennium, the 60th year of the 10th century, and the first year of the 960s decade.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Summer – Siege of Chandax: A Byzantine fleet with an expeditionary force (comprising about 50,000 men) under Nikephoros Phokas lands on Crete. Nikephoros defeats the Muslim resistance and begins a siege at the capital of Chandax. He decides to blockade the city for the winter, while his engineers begin to construct siege engines. Emir Abd al-Aziz ibn Shu&#x27;ayb sends for aid by the Fatimids in Ifriqiya and the Caliphate of Córdoba (modern Spain).
* November 8 – Battle of Andrassos: The Byzantines under Leo Phokas the Younger defeat the Hamdanid army (30,000 men) in an ambush in the passages of the Cilician mountains, in south Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). Emir Sayf al-Dawla barely manages to escape, and returns to Aleppo with only 300 horsemen. The Hamdanids can no longer afford to raid in Anatolia, which is a turning point in the Arab-Byzantine wars in the East.

==== Europe ====
* Mieszko I, a duke of the Piast Dynasty, becomes prince (&quot;de facto&quot; ruler) of Poland on the death of his father Siemomysł. Mieszko continues to subdue the neighbouring tribes under his control. Two obstacles to this plan are the Western Slav tribal group, the Veleti (also known as the Wilzi or &quot;Wolf people&quot;) who are raiding Mieszko&#x27;s lands for plunder; and the Saxon border dukes, who are pushing eastwards in search of new lands to conquer. 
* Harald Bluetooth, king of Denmark, consolidates his rule over Jutland and Zealand. He adopts Christianity, erecting a carved stone at Jelling to honour his parents. It features a runic inscription (best-known in Denmark) and an image of Christ surrounded by interlace. The other Scandinavian kingdoms slowly convert to Christianity (approximate date).
* June/July – Adalbert II, co-ruler and the son of King Berengar II, with the support of Duke Hugh of Tuscany, invades the Papal States under Pope John XII. With Lombard forces closing in on Rome, a papal delegation is sent to King Otto I (the Great) to appeal for assistance.
* Autumn – Oberto I, margrave of the Obertenghi family, takes refuge in Germany. He travels with influential Italian leaders to the Saxon court of Otto I to intervene in Italy to protect him from Berengar II.
* Richard I (the Fearless), duke of Normandy, marries Emma of Paris. She is the daughter of Hugh the Great, former Duke of the Franks. The union gives him a permanent status to the House of Capet.

==== England ====
* Dunstan receives the pallium as archbishop of Canterbury from Pope John XII. He reforms monasteries and enforces the rule of Saint Benedict: poverty, chastity and obedience for monks.

==== Africa ====
* The Kingdom of Aksum (modern Eritrea) is destroyed by Beta Israel invaders, under the leadership of Queen Gudit (approximate date).

==== Asia ====
* February 4 – The Song Dynasty is established at Kaifeng by the 33-year-old military leader Zhao Kuangyin. He begins to unify the empire by conquering other lands and becomes the first emperor, called as Taizu of Song. The Song Dynasty will rule northern China for over 300 years (until 1279).

* Summer – Emperor Constantine VII appoints Nikephoros Phokas to commander of the Byzantine field army (&quot;Domestic of the Schools&quot;) in the East. He gives him order to prepare a campaign against the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla. Constantine makes treaties with neighbouring rulers, to seek military aid.
* September - October – A Byzantine fleet under Basil Hexamilites deals a crushing defeat to the Hamdanid fleet at Tarsus in Cilicia (modern Turkey).

==== Europe ====
* Liudolf, the eldest son of King Otto I (the Great), reconciles with his father and asks again for installation as duke of Swabia. Otto refuses, but at the instigation of his uncle Bruno I (duke of Lotharingia) allows Liudolf to lead an expedition to Italy to bring the vassal Berengar of Ivrea to heel. 
* Berengar of Ivrea dispatches a Lombard army under his son Adalbert II to counter Liudolf, while he guards Pavia himself. In two battles Liudolf defeats the Lombard forces and enters Pavia, there to receive the homage of the Italian nobles and clergy on behalf of Otto I.
* June 16 – Hugh the Great, count of Paris, dies at Dourdan. He is succeeded by his eldest son Hugh Capet, who is recognized as Duke of the Franks by his cousin Lothair III, king of the West Frankish Kingdom.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Battle of Marash: Emir Sayf al-Dawla marches north into the Byzantine Empire and ravages the countryside of Malatya (modern Turkey). On his way back, he crosses the Euphrates and intercepts a Byzantine army led by Bardas Phokas (the Elder), near Marash. The Byzantines are defeated; Bardas himself barely escapes through the intervention of his attendants. His son Constantine Phokas, governor of Seleucia, is captured and held prisoner in Aleppo, until his death from an illness some time later.

==== Europe ====
* Summer – Liudolf, duke of Swabia, and his brother-in-law Conrad the Red rebel against King Otto I. Otto and his army fail to capture the cities of Mainz and Augsburg. He declares Liudolf and Conrad as outlaws &quot;in absentia&quot;. His brother Bruno I, archbishop of Cologne, restores royal authority in Lorraine, but some of the rebellious dukes receive support from the Hungarians. They seize the opportunity to invade Bavaria. 
* The town of Póvoa de Varzim is first mentioned during the rule of Mumadona Dias, countess of Portugal, under the name Villa Euracini.

==== Africa ====

<doc id="49146" wikidata="Q2107" url="?curid=49146" title="Wuppertal">
<text>Wuppertal (; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with a population of 355,000. Wuppertal is the seventh-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia and 17th-largest in Germany. It was founded in 1929 by the merger of Elberfeld, Barmen, Ronsdorf, Cronenberg and Vohwinkel, and was initially called &quot;Barmen-Elberfeld&quot; before adopting its present name in 1930. It is the capital and largest city of the Bergisches Land.

The city straddles the densely populated banks of the River Wupper, a tributary of the Rhine. Wuppertal is located between the Ruhr (Essen) to the north, Düsseldorf to the west, and Cologne to the southwest, and over time has grown together with Solingen, Remscheid and Hagen. The stretching of the city in a long band along the narrow Wupper Valley leads to a spatial impression of Wuppertal being larger than it actually is. The city is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and for being the greenest city in Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.

The Wupper Valley was, along with the Ore Mountains and before the Ruhr, the first highly industrialized region of Germany, which resulted in the construction of the Wuppertal Schwebebahn suspension railway in the then independent cities of Elberfeld and Barmen. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops from those cities encouraged the expansion of the nearby Ruhr. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, metallurgy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment. Aspirin originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by Bayer, as does the Vorwerk Kobold vacuum cleaner. The Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy and the European Institute for International Economic Relations are located in the city. Barmen was the birthplace of Friedrich Engels.

==History==

Wuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of Barmen and Elberfeld along with the communities of Vohwinkel, Ronsdorf, Cronenberg, Langerfeld and Beyenburg. The initial name Barmen-Elberfeld was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (&quot;Wupper Valley&quot;). The new city was administered as part of Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province.

Uniquely for Germany, it is a &quot;linear city&quot;, owing to the steep hillsides along the river Wupper. Its highest hill is the Lichtscheid, which is above sea level. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, &quot;Wupper-Town&quot; became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by Cologne, Düsseldorf and the Ruhr area, all with a more favourable topography.

From 5 July 1933 to 19 January 1934 the Kemna concentration camp was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early Nazi concentration camps, created by the Nazi Party to incarcerate their political opponents upon gaining power in 1933. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.

During World War II, about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres (see Bombing of Wuppertal in World War II). However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:

* Ölberg, literally &quot;Oil mountain&quot;, Germany&#x27;s largest original working class district, is protected as a historic monument. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name &quot;Ölberg&quot; refers to the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.
* Brill is one of Germany&#x27;s largest districts of Gründerzeit villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.

The US 78th Infantry Division under Major General Edwin P. Parker Jr. captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on 16 April 1945. Wuppertal became a part of the British Zone of Occupation, and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in West Germany.

==Population==
Wuppertal currently has a population of about 355,000. The number of inhabitants more than doubled in 1929 as a result of the Barmen–Elberfeld merger. The economic boom of the 1950s and 60s saw the establishment of new industry headquarters and with it an influx of workers, including migrant workers from Turkey, Greece and Italy. Population numbers during these times of as-yet unparalleled growth peaked at about 423,000 in 1963; in the 1970s, a period of steady decline followed in the wake of industrial losses.

As of 31 December 2022, the largest groups of foreign residents were:

==Main sights==
In total, Wuppertal possesses over 4,500 buildings classified as national monuments, most exemplifying styles such as Neoclassicism, Eclecticism, Historicism, Art Nouveau/Jugendstil and Bauhaus. The American TV station CNN recommended Wuppertal as one of 20 places worldwide to visit in the year 2020 because of the Schwebebahn, the architectural diversity and the Nordbahntrasse, a cycle route across the city 2020.

Main sights include:

* Schwebebahn or &quot;floating tram&quot;. One of the city&#x27;s greatest attractions is the globally unique suspended monorail &quot;Wuppertaler Schwebebahn&quot;, which was established in 1901. The tracks are above the streets and above the Wupper. 
* Wuppertaler Schwebebahn Kaiserwagen A guided tour of the suspension railway in a special tram.
* Wuppertal Opera (Opernhaus Wuppertal).
* Concerthall &quot;Stadthalle&quot;, a fine piece of turn-of-the-century architecture with outstanding acoustics. Home of the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra (Sinfonieorchester Wuppertal) (Stadthalle).
* Wuppertal Dance Theatre (&quot;Tanztheater Wuppertal&quot;), a world-famous centre of modern dance founded by the choreographer Pina Bausch.
* Engels-Haus, 18th century-architecturally typical of the region, it houses a permanent display of materials associated with the co-founder of modern Communism, Friedrich Engels.
* Wuppertal Zoo, a large, nicely landscaped zoo.
* Botanischer Garten Wuppertal, a municipal botanical garden.
* Arboretum Burgholz, an extensive arboretum.

==Sports==

===Association football===
In football, Wuppertal&#x27;s most popular club is Wuppertaler SV which currently play in the Regionalliga West, the fourth tier of the German football league system. Playing their home games at the city&#x27;s Stadion am Zoo, the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the 2009–10 season, looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs &quot;SSV 04 Wuppertal&quot; and &quot;TSG Vohwinkel 80&quot;. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the Bundesliga, which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by Polish side Ruch Chorzów and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.

During 2004, the club merged with local rivals &quot;SV Borussia Wuppertal&quot; to form &quot;Wuppertaler SV Borussia&quot;, though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club&#x27;s colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional &quot;Borussia&quot; was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans&#x27; demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.

Another noteworthy Wuppertal football club is Cronenberger SC from the district of Cronenberg. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 German amateur football championship final which they lost 5–2 against VfR Schwenningen. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the Oberliga Nordrhein.

Famous players include Günter Pröpper who scored 39 of WSV&#x27;s 136 Bundesliga goals and West Germany international Horst Szymaniak, as well as Cronenberg&#x27;s Herbert Jäger who represented Germany at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki during his stay with the club.

===Team handball===
In handball, Wuppertal&#x27;s most successful team is Bergischer HC, playing in the top-tier Handball-Bundesliga which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the 2013–14 campaign and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. &quot;BHC&quot; originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby city of the same name. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire Bergisches Land region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal&#x27;s &quot;Uni-Halle&quot; (3,200 seats) and Solingen&#x27;s &quot;Klingenhalle&quot; (2,600 seats).

Wuppertal&#x27;s past most successful club are the aforementioned LTV Wuppertal. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with &quot;Wuppertaler SV&#x27;s&quot; handball section in 1996 to form &quot;HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal&quot;. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed &quot;HC Wuppertal&quot;, to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.

===Volleyball===
In volleyball, SV Bayer Wuppertal was one of Germany&#x27;s leading men&#x27;s teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in Leverkusen and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous Bayer AG decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to Greek side Olympiacos S.C. in the 1995–96 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing the final in five sets.

After the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name &quot;Wuppertal Titans&quot; and later &quot;A!B!C Titans Berg. Land&quot;. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.

===Basketball===
Perhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the women&#x27;s basketball team of Barmer TV (known as &quot;BTV Wuppertal&quot; between 1994 and 2000, &quot;BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal&quot; between 2000 and 2002 and &quot;Wuppertal Wings&quot; internationally). An 11-time German champion and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During 1996, they even won the European Cup as the first and so far only German side, beating Italy&#x27;s SFT Como in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to French side CJM Bourges in the newly christened EuroLeague&#x27;s final.

In 2002, the club withdrew from the Bundesliga due to financial troubles, their then-main sponsor &quot;Gold-Zack Werke&quot; filing for insolvency a year later. After a decade-long stay in amateur divisions, Barmer TV returned to the second-tier 2nd Bundesliga North in 2014.

Wuppertal co-hosted the 1998 FIBA World Championship for Women as one of seven host cities.

===Roller hockey===
In roller hockey, Wuppertal club RSC Cronenberg are one of the most successful German teams, having won the German championship and the German Cup in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions. In total, the men won 13 German championships and nine cups, the women ten championships and nine cups. Both teams play their home games at &quot;Alfred-Henckels-Halle&quot;.

Wuppertal hosted several international tournaments, including the World Championship in 1997 (men) and 2004 (women) and the European Championship in 1992, 2010 (men) and 2011 (women).

==Education==

Four institutions of higher education are in Wuppertal.
* University of Wuppertal (Bergische Universität Wuppertal)
* FOM University of Applied Sciences
* Cologne University of Music, section Wuppertal
* College of Theology, Wuppertal/Bethel (Theologische Zentrum Wuppertal)

The privately financed Junior Uni is a unique German initiative to educate youth from the age of 4 to 18 in science outside the school program.

==Transport==

===Railways===

Wuppertal is well connected to the rail network. The town lies on the Cologne–Hagen and the Düsseldorf–Hagen railway lines, and is a stop for long-distance traffic. The central station is located in the district of Elberfeld. Regionalbahn trains and some Regional-Express trains also stop at Oberbarmen, Barmen, Ronsdorf and Vohwinkel. There are also S-Bahn stations in Langerfeld, Unterbarmen, Steinbeck, Zoologischer Garten and Sonnborn.

The rail services that operate on the mainline through the valley are the RE 4 (Wupper-Express), RE 7 (Rhein-Münsterland-Express), RE 13 (Maas-Wupper-Express), RB 48 (Rhein-Wupper Bahn) and four Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn services: the S 7, S 8, S 9 and S 68 (peak hours only). Every 30 minutes, it is served by a long-distance (Intercity-Express, InterCity, EuroCity) service in each direction.

With the exception of the line from Wuppertal to Solingen (operated as the S 7) and the Prince William Railway to Essen (now S-Bahn line S 9), all of the branch lines connecting to main line in the city of Wuppertal are now closed. This includes, among others, the Düsseldorf-Derendorf–Dortmund Süd railway (the &quot;Wuppertaler Nordbahn&quot;), the Burgholz Railway, the Wuppertal-Wichlinghausen–Hattingen railway, the Wupper Valley Railway and the Corkscrew Railway. Thus, there were once 31 stations in the Wuppertal area, including nine stations on the mainline. Nowadays only ten are serviced any more.

Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is the location of the lost luggage services for Deutsche Bahn.

The Wuppertal Suspension Railway, a suspended monorail, serves the city and its surroundings. It has operated since 1901. In 1950, a young elephant named Tuffi was put aboard the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (monorail), as a promotion for the Althoff Circus. The swinging tram upset the elephant, and she trumpeted, charged, and plummeted into the river below. Tuffi suffered minor injuries; she lived until 1989. In 1999, the &quot;Schwebebahn&quot; had its thus far only fatal accident. New cars were added beginning in December 2016.

Between 1873 and 1987, Wuppertal was served by its own tram network.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

<text>Fair trade is a term for an arrangement designed to help producers in developing countries achieve sustainable and equitable trade relationships. The fair trade movement combines the payment of higher prices to exporters with improved social and environmental standards. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products that are typically exported from developing countries to developed countries but are also used in domestic markets (e.g., Brazil, the United Kingdom and Bangladesh), most notably for handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, wine, sugar, fruit, flowers and gold.

Fair trade labelling organizations commonly use a definition of &quot;fair trade&quot; developed by FINE, an informal association of four international fair trade organizations: Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), Network of European Worldshops and European Fair Trade Association (EFTA). Fair trade, by this definition, is a trading partnership based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, support producers, raise awareness and campaign for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.

&quot;Fair trade certifiers&quot; include Fairtrade International, Ecocert, Fair World Project and Fair Trade USA, whose labelling scheme includes independent smallholders and estates for crops. In 2008, Fairtrade International certified approximately (€3.4B) of products.

On 6 June 2008, Wales became the world&#x27;s first ; followed by Scotland in February 2013. The fair trade movement is popular in the UK, where there are over 500 , 118 universities, over 6,000 churches, and over 4,000 UK schools registered in the . In 2011, more than 1.2 million farmers and workers in more than 60 countries participated in Fairtrade International&#x27;s fair trade system, which included €65 million in fairtrade premium paid to producers for use developing their communities.

Some criticisms have been raised about fair trade systems, including that fair trade certification did not lead to financial benefit to producers or improvement in working conditions, and that fair trade certification resulted in greater inequalities in some markets. 

A proposed alternative to fair trade is direct trade, which eliminates the overhead costs of the fair trade certification and allows suppliers to receive higher prices closer to the retail value of the end product. Some suppliers use relationships started in a fair trade system to autonomously springboard into direct sales relationships they negotiate themselves, whereas other direct trade systems are supplier-initiated for social responsibility reasons similar to a fair trade systems.

== History ==

The first attempts to commercialize fair trade goods in markets in the global north were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s by religious groups and various politically oriented non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Ten Thousand Villages, an NGO within the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), and SERRV International were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in developing countries. The products, almost exclusively handicrafts ranging from jute goods to cross-stitch work, were mostly sold in churches or fairs. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.

=== Solidarity trade ===

The current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations, and concerns emerged that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed. The slogan at the time, &quot;Trade not Aid&quot;, gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.

1965 saw the creation of the first alternative trading organization (ATO): that year, British NGO Oxfam launched &quot;Helping-by-Selling&quot;, a program that sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the UK and from mail-order catalogues.

By 1968, the Whole Earth Catalog was connecting thousands of specialized merchants, artisans, and scientists directly with consumers who were interested in supporting independent producers, with the goal of bypassing corporate retail and department stores. The Whole Earth Catalog sought to balance the international free market by allowing direct purchasing of goods produced primarily in the U.S. and Canada but also in Central and South America.

In 1969, the first worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. It aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in &quot;underdeveloped regions&quot;. The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the Benelux countries, Germany, and other Western European countries.

=== Handicrafts vs. agricultural goods ===
In the early 1980s, alternative trading organizations faced challenges: the novelty of fair trade products began to wear off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look &quot;tired and old fashioned&quot; in the marketplace. The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, several fair trade supporters were worried by the effect on small farmers of structural reforms in the agricultural sector as well as the fall in commodity prices. Many came to believe it was the movement&#x27;s responsibility to address the issue and remedies usable in the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a source of income for producers and provided alternative trading organizations a complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food was up at 69%.

=== Rise of labeling initiatives ===
Sales of fair trade products only took off with the arrival of the first Fairtrade certification initiatives. Although buoyed by growing sales, fair trade had been generally confined to small worldshops scattered across Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America. that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to offer fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels. The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first fair trade certification initiative, Max Havelaar, was created in the Netherlands under the initiative of Nico Roozen, Frans Van Der Hoff, and Dutch development NGO Solidaridad. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The labeling initiative also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the supply chain.

The concept caught on: in ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In 1997, a process of convergence among &quot;LIs&quot; (&quot;Labeling Initiatives&quot;) led to the creation of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, an umbrella organization whose mission is to set fair trade standards, support, inspect, and certify disadvantaged producers, and harmonize the fair trade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. The certification mark is used in more than 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO&#x27;s certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine, footballs, etc.

With ethical labeling, consumers can take moral responsibility for their economic decisions and actions. This supports the notion of fair trade practices as &quot;moral economies&quot;. The presence of labeling gives consumers the feeling of &quot;doing the right thing&quot; with a simple purchase.

Labeling practices place the burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is burdensome and expensive. Northern consumers are able to make a simple choice while being spared these burdens and expenses.

=== Large companies as buyers ===
Large transnational companies have started to use fair trade commodities in their products. In April 2000, Starbucks began offering fair trade coffee in all of their stores. In 2005, the company promised to purchase ten million pounds of fair trade coffee over the next 18 months. This would account for a quarter of the fair trade coffee purchases in the United States and 3% of Starbucks&#x27; total coffee purchases. The company maintains that increasing its fair trade purchases would require an unprofitable reconstruction of the supply chain. Fair trade activists have made gains with other companies: Sara Lee Corporation in 2002 and Procter &amp; Gamble (the maker of Folgers) in 2003 agreed to begin selling a small amount of fair trade coffee. Nestlé, the world&#x27;s biggest coffee trader, began selling a blend of fair trade coffee in 2005. In 2006, The Hershey Company acquired Dagoba, an organic and fair trade chocolate brand.

Much contention surrounds the issue of fair trade products becoming a part of large companies. Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade–enough to appease consumers, but not enough to make a real difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from a company that is not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies&#x27; products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.

== Organizations promoting fair trade ==
Many organizations promote fair trade, including certifiers of products, certifiers of organizations, associations, retailers, education and advocacy groups, student groups, religious organizations and universities.

Most fair trade import organizations are members of, or certified by, one of several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote, and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations.

===Certifiers===
====Certifiers of products====
*Fairtrade International, created in 1997, is an association of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop fair trade standards, license buyers, label usage, and market the Fair trade Certification Mark in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for labeled Fair trade. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Fairtrade International, the nonprofit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea, and other crops.
* Fair Trade USA is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets standards, certifies, and labels products that promote sustainable livelihoods for farmers and workers and protect the environment. Founded in 1998, Fair Trade USA currently partners with over 1,000 brands, as well as 1.3 million farmers and workers across the globe.

* Additional certifiers include Ecocert (Fair for Life, Social and Fair Trade labels).

====Certifiers of organizations====
* World Fair Trade Organization (formerly the International Fair Trade Association) is a global association created in 1989 of fair trade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national and regional fair trade networks, and fair trade support organizations. In 2004 WFTO launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered fair trade organizations (as opposed to the FLO system, which labels products). The Network of European Worldshops became the European chapter of WFTO in 2008. 

===Associations of importers, retailers and wholesalers===
* The European Fair Trade Association (EFTA), created in 1990, is a network of European alternative trading organizations that import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. EFTA&#x27;s goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also publishes yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine countries.
* The Fair Trade Federation (FTF), created in 1994, is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers, and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members. Members self-certify adherence to defined fair trade principles for 100% of their purchasing/business. Those who sell products certifiable by Fairtrade International must be 100% certified by Fairtrade International to join FTF.

===Retailers===
* Global Goods Partners (GGP) is a fair-trade nonprofit organization founded in 2005 that provides support and U.S. market access to women-led cooperatives in the developing world.
==== Worldshops ====
Worldshops, or fair trade shops, are specialized retail outlets that offer and promote fair trade products. Worldshops also typically organize educational fair trade activities and play a role in trade justice and other . Worldshops are often not-for-profit organizations run by local volunteer networks. The movement emerged in Europe and a majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, but worldshops also exist in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

Worldshops aim to make trade as direct and fair with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a developing country and consumers in industrialized countries. Worldshops aim to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees substinence and positive social development. They often cut out intermediaries in the import chain. A web movement began in the 2000s to provide fair trade items at fair prices to consumers. One is &quot;Fair Trade a Day&quot; on which a different fair trade item is featured each day.

==== Alternative trading organizations ====

An alternative trading organization (ATO) is usually a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-driven business aligned with the fair trade movement that aims &quot;to contribute to the alleviation of poverty in developing regions of the world by establishing a system of trade that allows marginalized producers in developing regions to gain access to developed markets.&quot; ATOs have fair trade at the core of their mission and activities, using it as a development tool to support disadvantaged producers and to reduce poverty and combining their marketing with awareness-raising and campaigning.

ATOs are often based on political and religious groups, though their secular purpose precludes sectarian identification and evangelical activity.

According to EFTA, the defining characteristic of ATOs is equal partnership and respect–partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade &quot;humanizes&quot; the trade process–making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers become aware of the culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for , and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work. Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, Greenheart Shop, Equal Exchange, and SERRV International in the U.S. and Equal Exchange Trading, Traidcraft, Oxfam Trading, Twin Trading, and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.

===Education and Advocacy===
Fair World Project.

====Student groups====
Student groups have also been increasingly promoting fair trade products. Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with United Students for Fair Trade (USA), the Canadian Student Fair Trade Network (Canada), or Fair Trade Campaigns (USA), which also houses Fair Trade Universities and Fair Trade Schools.

===Religious organizations===
The involvement of church organizations has been and continues to be an integral part of the fair trade movement:
* Ten Thousand Villages is affiliated with the Mennonite Central Committee
* SERRV is partnered with Catholic Relief Services and Lutheran World Relief
* Village Markets is a Lutheran Fair Trade organization connecting mission sites around the world with churches in the United States
* Catholic Relief Services has their own Fair Trade mission in CRS Fair Trade

=== Universities ===
The concept of a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade university emerged from the United Kingdom, where the Fairtrade Foundation maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the requirements to be labeled such a university. In order to be considered a Fair Trade University, a university must establish a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented, school-wide, fair trade policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They must learn and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, they must promote fair trade not only within the school but throughout the wider community.

A Fair Trade University develops all aspects of fair trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, David Barnhill, endeavored to become the first Fair Trade University. This received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin, the university agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University endorsed the Earth Charter and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.

The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh also offers courses in different disciplines that implement fair trade learning. They offer a business course with a trip to Peru to visit coffee farmers, an environmental science class that discusses fair trade as a way for cleaner food systems, an English course that focuses on the Earth Charter and the application of fair trade principles, and several upper-level anthropology courses focused on fair trade.

In 2010, the University of California, San Diego became the second Fair Trade University in the United States. UC San Diego considered the efforts of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK, but wanted to be more detailed about how their declaration as a Fair Trade University would change the way on-campus franchises do business with the university. They required constant assessment and improvement. Being a Fair Trade University for UC San Diego is a promise between the university and the students about the continual effort by the university to increase the accessibility of fair trade-certified food and drinks and to encourage sustainability in other ways, such as buying from local, organic farmers and decreasing waste.

Fair Trade Universities have been successful because they are a &quot;feel good&quot; movement. Because the movement has an established history, it is not just a fad. It raises awareness about an issue and offers a solution. The solution is an easy one for college students to handle: paying about five cents more for a cup of coffee or tea.

===Fair Trade towns===
A Fair Trade town is a town (or other local geographical region) that complies with some Fair Trade criteria.

===Other===
In 1998, the four federations: Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), Network of European Worldshops and European Fair Trade Association (EFTA).joined together as FINE, an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems, and advocate fair trade politically.

== Product certification ==

===Fairtrade International===
Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a certification system that allows consumers to identify goods that meet certain standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body (Fairtrade International) and a certification body (FLO-CERT), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the Fair Trade Certified Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must be monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.

Fairtrade certification purports to guarantee not only fair prices, but also ethical purchasing principles. These principles include adherence to ILO agreements such as those banning child and slave labour, guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to unionise, adherence to the United Nations charter of human rights, a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection of the environment. The Fairtrade certification also attempts to promote long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop pre-financing, and greater transparency throughout the supply chain.

The Fairtrade certification system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea and wine. Companies offering products that meet Fairtrade standards may apply for licences to use one of the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.

To gain a licence to use the FAIRTRADE mark, businesses need to apply for products to be certified by submitting information about their supply chain. Then they can have individual products certified depending on how these are sourced. Coffee packers in developed countries pay a fee to the Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional per pound premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but on which is more common.

To become a &quot;certified fair trade producer&quot;, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In the fair trade debate there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers, and packers profiting by evading them.

=== Definition of &quot;producer&quot; ===
The fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International use the word &quot;producer&quot; in many different senses, often in the same specification document. Sometimes it refers to farmers, sometimes to the primary cooperatives they belong to, to the secondary cooperatives that the primary cooperatives belong to, or to the tertiary cooperatives that the secondary cooperatives may belong to but &quot;Producer [also] means any entity that has been certified under the Fairtrade International Generic Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations, Generic Fairtrade Standard for Hired Labour Situations, or Generic Fairtrade Standard for Contract Production.&quot; The word is used in all these meanings in key documents. In practice, when price and credit are discussed, &quot;producer&quot; means the exporting organization, &quot;For small producers&#x27; organizations, payment must be made directly to the certified small producers&#x27; organization&quot;. and &quot;In the case of a small producers&#x27; organization [e.g. for coffee], Fairtrade Minimum Prices are set at the level of the Producer Organization, not at the level of individual producers (members of the organization)&quot; which means that the &quot;producer&quot; here is halfway up the marketing chain between the farmer and the consumer. The part of the standards referring to cultivation, environment, pesticides, and child labour has the farmer as &quot;producer&quot;.
== System ==
A large number of fair trade and ethical marketing organizations employ a variety of marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. In 2018, nearly 700,000 metric tons of fair-trade bananas were sold worldwide, with the next largest fair-trade commodity being cocoa beans (260,000 tons) then coffee beans (207,000 tons). The biggest product in the market in terms of units was fair-trade flowers, with over 825 million units sold.

There remain many fair trade organizations that adhere more or less to the original objectives of fair trade and that market products through alternative channels where possible and through specialist fair trade shops, but they have a small proportion of the total market compared to Fairtrade International.

== Effect on growers ==
Fair trade benefits workers in developing countries. The nature of fair trade makes it a global phenomenon; therefore, there are diverse motives for group formation related to fair trade. The social transformation caused by the fair trade movement also varies around the world.

A study of coffee growers in Guatemala illustrates the effect of fair trade practices on growers. In this study, thirty-four farmers were interviewed. Of those thirty-four growers, twenty-two had an understanding of fair trade based on internationally recognized definitions, for example, describing fair trade in market and economical terms or knowing what the social premium is and how their cooperative has used it. Three growers explained a deep understanding of fair trade, showing a knowledge of both fair market principles and how fair trade affects them socially. Nine growers had erroneous or no knowledge of Fair Trade. The three growers who had a deeper knowledge of the social implications of fair trade all had responsibilities within their cooperatives. One was a manager, one was in charge of the wet mill, and one was his group&#x27;s treasurer. These farmers did not have in terms of years of education, age, or years of membership in the cooperative; their answers to the questions, &quot;Why did you join?&quot; differentiate them from other members and explain why they have such an extensive knowledge of fair trade. These farmers cited switching to organic farming, wanting to raise money for social projects, and more training offered as reasons for joining the cooperative, other than receiving a better price for their coffee.

Many farmers around the world are unaware of fair trade practices that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee is one of the most highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day. When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa Agraria Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, farmers responded that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives. Overall, the farmers studied were satisfied with the current fair trade system, but some of them, such as the Mazaronquiari group of the CAC, desire yet a higher price for their products in order to live a higher quality of life.

Some producers also profit from the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers feel like they have control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.

===Social premium ===
A component of fair trade is the extra money that buyers of fair trade goods pay to the producers or producer-groups, sometimes referred to as a &quot;social premium.&quot; The producers or producer-groups decide where and how to spend the social premium.. These premiums usually go towards socioeconomic development, wherever the producers or producer-groups see fit. Within producer-groups, the decisions about how the social premium will be spent are handled democratically, with transparency and .

Producers and producer-groups spend this social premium to support socioeconomic development in a variety of ways. One common way to spend the social premium of fair trade is to privately invest in public goods that infrastructure and the government are lacking in. These include environmental initiatives, public schools, and water projects. At some point, all producer-groups re-invest their social premium back into their farms and businesses. They buy capital, like trucks and machinery, and education for their members, like organic farming education. Thirty-eight percent of producer-groups spend the social premium in its entirety on themselves, but the rest invest in public goods, like paying for teachers&#x27; salaries, providing a community health care clinic, and improving infrastructure, such as bringing in electricity and bettering roads.

Farmers&#x27; organisations that use their social premium for public goods often finance educational scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee cooperative Coocafé has supported hundreds of children and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from their fair trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium can be used to build and furnish schools too.

== Psychology ==
Consumers of fair trade products usually make the intentional choice to purchase fair trade goods based on , moral norms, and social norms. 

University students have significantly increased their consumption of fair trade products over the last several decades. Women college students have a more favorable attitude than men toward buying fair trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products. 
Producers organize and strive for fair trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization or simply because they want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with organic farming than fair trade farming practices because organic farming is a visible way that these farmers are different from their neighbors and it influences the way they farm. They place importance on natural growing methods. Fair trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.

== World wide ==
Every year the sales of Fair Trade products grow close to 30% and in 2004 were worth over million. In the case of coffee, sales grow nearly 50% per year in certain countries. In 2002, 16,000 tons of Fairtrade coffee were purchased by consumers in 17 countries. &quot;Fair trade coffee is currently produced in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia&quot;. The 165 FLO associations in Latin America and Caribbean are located in 14 countries and together export over 85% of the world&#x27;s Fair Trade coffee. There is a North/South divide of fair trade products, with producers in the South and consumers in the North. Discrepancies in the perspectives of producers and consumers prompt disputes about how the purchasing power of consumers may or may not promote the development of southern countries. &quot;Purchasing patterns of fairtrade products have remained strong despite the global economic downturn. In 2008, global sales of fairtrade products exceeded billion.&quot;

=== Africa ===
Africa’s labor market is becoming an integral fragment of the global supply chain (GSC) and is expected to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). As the continent closes its infrastructure gap, it increases its export to the world. Africa&#x27;s exports, from places like South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, were valued at million . Between 2004 and 2006, Africa expanded the number of FLO-certified producer groups from 78 to 171, nearly half of which are in Kenya; following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa. The FLO products Africa is known for are tea, cocoa, flowers, and wine. In Africa smallholder cooperatives and plantations produce Fair Trade certified tea. Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce fair trade cocoa, such as Kuapa Kokoo in Ghana. West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast.

=== Latin America ===
Studies in the early 2000s showed that the income, education, and health of coffee producers involved with Fair Trade in Latin America improved in comparison to producers who were not participating. Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru, and Guatemala, having the biggest populations of coffee producers, use some of the for coffee production in Latin America and do so by taking part in Fair Trade.

Latin American countries are also large exporters of fair trade bananas. The Dominican Republic is the largest producer of fair trade bananas, followed by Mexico, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. Producers in the Dominican Republic set up associations rather than cooperatives so that individual farmers can each own their own land, but meet regularly.

Fundación Solidaridad was created in Chile to increase the earnings and social participation of handicraft producers. These goods are marketed locally in Chile and internationally. Fair trade handicraft and jewellery production has risen in recent years, aided by North American and European online retailers developing direct relationships to import and sell the products online. The sale of fair trade handicrafts online has aided the development of female artisans in Latin America.

=== Asia ===
The Asia Fair Trade Forum aims to increase the competitiveness of fair trade organizations in Asia in the global market. Garment factories in Asian countries including China, Burma and Bangladesh are regularly accused of human rights violations, including the use of child labour. These violations conflict with the principles outlined by fair trade certifiers. In India, Trade Alternative Reform Action (TARA) Projects, formed in the 1970s, worked to increase production capacity, quality standards, and entrance into markets for home-based craftsmen that were previously unattainable due to their lower caste identity. Fairtrade India was established in 2013 in Bangalore.

=== Australia ===
The Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand (FTAANZ) supports two systems of fair trade: The first is as the Australia and New Zealand member of FLO International, which unites Fairtrade producer and labelling initiatives across Europe, Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The second is the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), of more than 450 worldwide members, of which FTAANZ is one. Fairtrade (one word) refers to FLO-certified commodities and associated products. Fair trade (two words) encompasses the wider fair trade movement, including the Fairtrade commodities and other artisan craft products.

==Commodities ==
Fair trade commodities are import/export goods that are certified by a fair trade certification organization such as Fair Trade USA or World Fair Trade Organization. Such organizations are typically overseen by Fairtrade International. Fairtrade International sets international fair trade standards and supports fair trade producers and cooperatives. Sixty percent of the fair trade market consists of food products such as coffee, tea, cocoa, honey, and bananas. Non-food commodities include crafts, textiles, and flowers. Shima Baradaran of Brigham Young University suggests that fair trade techniques could child labor. Although fair trade represents only .01% of the food and beverage industry in the United States, it is growing rapidly.

=== Coffee ===
Coffee is the most well-established fair trade commodity. Most Fair Trade coffee is &quot;Coffea arabica,&quot; which is grown at high altitudes. Fair Trade markets emphasize the quality of coffee because they usually appeal to customers who are motivated by taste rather than price. The fair trade movement fixated on coffee first because it is a highly traded commodity for most producing countries, and almost half the world&#x27;s coffee is produced by smallholder farmers. At first fair trade coffee was sold at small scale; now multinationals like Starbucks and Nestlé use fair trade coffee. As of 2006, Starbucks was the world&#x27;s largest purchaser of fair trade coffee.

Internationally recognized Fair Trade coffee standards outlined by FLO are as follows: small producers are grouped in democratic cooperatives or groups; buyers and sellers establish long-term, stable relationships; buyers pay the producers at least the minimum Fair Trade price or, when the market price is higher, the market price; and, buyers pay a social premium of per pound of coffee to the producers. The current minimum Fair Trade price for high-grade, washed Arabica coffee is per pound; per pound if the coffee is organic.

The marketing system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming and developing countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing, and retailing firms used worldwide. Some independent brands operate a &quot;virtual company&quot;, paying importers, packers and distributors, and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons. In the producing country, fair trade is marketed only by fair trade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by fair trade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.

==== Locations ====
The largest sources of fair trade coffee are Uganda and Tanzania, followed by Latin American countries such as Guatemala and Costa Rica. As of 1999, major importers of fair trade coffee included Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is a North/South divide between fair trade consumers and producers. North American countries are not yet among the top importers of fair trade coffee.

==== Labour ====
Starbucks began to purchase more fair trade coffee in 2001 because of charges of labor rights violations in Central American plantations. Several competitors, including Nestlé, followed suit. Large corporations that sell non-fair trade coffee take 55% of what consumers pay for coffee while only 10% goes to the producers. Small growers dominate the production of coffee, especially in Latin American countries such as Peru. Coffee is the fairly traded commodity, and an increasing number of producers are small farmers that own their own land and work in cooperatives. The incomes of growers of fair trade coffee beans depend on the market value of coffee where it is consumed, so farmers of fair trade coffee do not necessarily live above the poverty line or get completely for their commodity.

Unsustainable farming practices can harm plantation owners and laborers. Unsustainable practices such as using and unshaded growing are risky. Small growers who put themselves at economic risk by not having could lose money and resources due to fluctuating coffee prices, pest problems, or policy shifts.

The effectiveness of Fairtrade is questionable; workers on Fairtrade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the Fairtrade system.

==== Sustainability ====
As coffee becomes one of the most important export crops in certain regions such as northern Latin America, nature and agriculture are transformed. Increased productivity requires technological innovations, and the coffee agroecosystem has been changing. In the nineteenth century in Latin America, coffee plantations began replacing sugarcane and subsistence crops. Coffee crops became more managed; they were put into rows and unshaded, meaning diversity of the forest was decreased and Coffea trees shortened. As plant and tree diversity decreased, so did animal diversity. Unshaded plantations allow a higher density of Coffea trees, are less protected from wind and lead to more soil erosion. Technified coffee plantations also use chemicals such as fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.

Fair trade certified commodities must adhere to sustainable agro-ecological practices, including reduction of chemical fertilizer use, prevention of erosion, and protection of forests. Coffee plantations are more likely to be fair trade certified if they use traditional farming practices with shading and without chemicals. This protects the biodiversity of the ecosystem and ensures that the land will be usable for farming in the future and not just for short-term planting. In the United States, 85% of fair trade certified coffee is also organic.

==== Consumer attitudes ====
Consumers typically have positive attitudes about products that are ethically made. These products may promise fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. Fair trade products meet standards like these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products such as fair trade commodities, consumers often are not willing to pay higher prices for fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers may say they are willing to pay a premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. When a sufficient number of consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies will be more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.

====Coffee companies====

The following coffee roasters and companies claim to offer fair trade coffee or some roasts that are fair trade certified:

* Anodyne Coffee Roasting Company 
* Breve Coffee Company 
* Cafedirect
* Counter Culture Coffee
* Equal Exchange
* GEPA
* Keurig
* Just Us!
* Peace Coffee
* Pura Vida Coffee
=== Cocoa ===
Many countries that export cocoa rely on it as their single export crop. In Africa in particular, governments tax cocoa as their main source of revenue. Cocoa is a permanent crop, which means that it occupies land for long periods of time and does not need to be replanted after each harvest.

==== Locations ====
Cocoa is farmed in the tropical regions of West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In Latin America, cocoa is produced in Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Much of the cocoa produced in Latin America is organic and regulated by an Internal control system. Bolivia has fair trade cooperatives that permit a fair share of money for cocoa producers. African cocoa-producing countries include Cameroon, Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire exports over a third of the world&#x27;s cocoa beans. Southeast Asia accounts for about 14% of the world&#x27;s cocoa production. Major cocoa-producing countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea.

==== Labour ====
Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system. Most cocoa comes from small family-run farms in West Africa. These farms have little market access and so rely on middlemen to bring their products to market. Sometimes middlemen are unfair to farmers. Farmers may join an Agricultural cooperative that pays farmers a fair price for their cocoa. One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the higher price paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. Much of this money goes to community projects such as water wells rather than to individual farmers. Nevertheless, cooperatives such as fair trade-endorsed Kuapa Kokoo in Ghana are often the only Licensed Buying Companies that will give farmers a fair price and not cheat them or rig sales. Farmers in cooperatives per bag of cocoa beans. These arrangements are not always assured and fair trade organizations can&#x27;t always buy all of the cocoa available to them from cooperatives.

==== Marketing ====
Marketing of fair trade cocoa to European consumers often portrays cocoa farmers as dependent on western purchases for their livelihood and well-being. Showing African cocoa producers in this way is problematic because it is reminiscent of the imperialistic view that Africans cannot live happily without the help of westerners. It portrays the balance of power as being in favor of the consumers rather than the producers.

Consumers often aren&#x27;t willing to pay the extra price for fair trade cocoa because they do not know what fair trade is. Activist groups can educate consumers about the unethical aspects of unfair trade and thereby promote demand for fairly traded commodities. Activism and ethical consumption not only promote fair trade but also act against powerful corporations such as Mars, Incorporated that refuse to acknowledge the use of forced child labor in the harvesting of their cocoa.

==== Sustainability ====
Smallholding farmers frequently lack access not only to markets but also to resources for sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and lack of knowledge about modern farming techniques. One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.

==== Cocoa companies ====
The following chocolate companies claim to use all or some fair trade cocoa in their chocolate. Certifying organizations, as of 2024, are listed in parentheses.

* Alter Eco (Ecocert, Fairtrade International)) 
* Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s (Fairtrade International)
* Cadbury
* Chocolove (Fair Trade USA)
* Divine Chocolate (Fairtrade International)
* Equal Exchange
* GEPA
* Green &amp; Black&#x27;s (Fairtrade International)
* Guittard Chocolate Company (Fair Trade USA)
* Theo Chocolate (Ecocert)
* Tony&#x27;s Chocolonely (Fairtrade International)
==== Harkin–Engel Protocol ====
The Harkin–Engel Protocol, also commonly known as the Cocoa Protocol, is an international agreement meant to end some of the world&#x27;s worst forms of child labor, as well as forced labor in the cocoa industry. It was first negotiated by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Eliot Engel after they watched a documentary that showed the cocoa industry&#x27;s widespread issue of child slavery and trafficking. The parties involved agreed to a six-article plan:

# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit &quot;significant resources&quot; to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.
# Memorandum of cooperation—By 1 May 2002, Establish a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Establish a monitor and compliance with the standards.
# Establish a joint foundation—By 1 July 2002, industry will form a foundation to oversee efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It will perform field projects and be a clearinghouse on best practices.
# Building toward credible standards—By 1 July 2005, the industry will develop and implement industry-wide standards of public certification that cocoa has been grown without any of the worst forms of child labor.

=== Textiles ===
Fair trade textiles are primarily made from fair trade cotton. By 2015, nearly 75,000 cotton farmers in developing countries had obtained fair trade certification. The minimum price that Fair trade pays allows cotton farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods. Fair trade textiles are frequently grouped with fair trade crafts and goods made by artisans in contrast to cocoa, coffee, sugar, tea, and honey, which are agricultural commodities.

==== Locations ====
India, Pakistan, and West Africa are the primary exporters of fair trade cotton, although many countries grow fair trade cotton. Production of Fairtrade cotton was initiated in 2004 in four countries in West and Central Africa (Mali, Senegal, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso). Textiles and clothing are exported from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

==== Labour ====
Labour is different for textile production than for agricultural commodities because textile production takes place in a factory, not on a farm. Children are a source of cheap labor, and child labor is prevalent in Pakistan, India, and Nepal. Fair trade cooperatives ensure fair and safe labor practices, and do not allow child labor. Fair trade textile producers are most often women in developing countries. They struggle to meet consumer tastes in North America and Europe. In Nepal, textiles were originally made for household and local use. In the 1990s, women began joining cooperatives and exporting their crafts for profit. Now handicrafts are Nepal&#x27;s largest export. It is often difficult for women to balance textile production, domestic responsibilities, and agricultural work. Cooperatives foster the growth of democratic communities in which women have a voice despite being historically in underprivileged positions. For fair trade textiles and other crafts to be successful in Western markets, World Fair Trade Organizations require a workforce of artisans in need of stable income, links from consumers to artisans, and a market for quality ethnic products.

Making cotton and textiles &quot;fair trade&quot; does not always benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade strengthened existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not do much for farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.

Textiles and garments are intricate and require one individual , in contrast to the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, and every other step in the process of textile production. Fair trade textiles are distinct from the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.

Forced or unfair labor in textile production is not limited to developing countries. Charges of use of sweatshop labor are endemic in the United States. Immigrant women work long hours and receive less than minimum wage. In the United States, there is more of a stigma against child labor than forced labor in general. Consumers in the United States are willing to suspend the importation of textiles made with child labor in other countries but do not expect American exports to be suspended by other countries, even when produced using forced labor.

====Clothing and textile companies====

The following companies use fair trade production and/or distribution techniques for clothing and textiles:

* American Apparel
* Association for Craft Producers
* Boll &amp; Branch
* BeGood Clothing
* Champa Craft
* Cherie Amie
* The Ethical Olive
* Maggie&#x27;s Organics
* MUD Jeans
* Patagonia
* Oliberté
=== Seafood ===
With increasing media scrutiny of the conditions of fishermen, particularly in Southeast Asia, the lack of transparency and traceability in the seafood industry prompted new fair trade efforts. In 2014, Fair Trade USA created its Capture Fisheries Program that led to the first instance of Fair Trade fish being sold globally in 2015. The program &quot;requires fishermen to source and trade according to standards that protect fundamental human rights, prevent forced and child labor, establish safe working conditions, regulate work hours and benefits, and enable responsible resource management.&quot;

===Flowers===
Fair trade flowers have been recognised as &quot;an important niche product&quot;, with Kenya noted as a significant location for their production. The launch of fair trade flower marketing in the UK, led by retailer Tesco, raised some certains as to whether the organisation of flower production in Kenya met the conditions needed for fair trade certification.
=== Luxury commodities ===

There have been efforts to introduce fair trade practices to the luxury goods industry, particularly for gold and diamonds.

==== Diamonds and sourcing ====

In parallel to efforts to commoditize diamonds, some industry players launched campaigns to introduce benefits to mining centers in the developing world. Rapaport Fair Trade was established with the goal &quot;to provide ethical education for jewelry suppliers, buyers, first time or seasoned diamond buyers, social activists, students, and anyone interested in jewelry, trends, and ethical luxury.&quot;

The company&#x27;s founder, Martin Rapaport, as well as Kimberley Process initiators Ian Smillie and Global Witness, are among several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among other programs to ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the Kimberley Process. Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers as well as the use of child labor. 

==== Gold ====
Fairtrade certified gold is used in manufacturing processes as well as for jewellery. The &quot;Fairtrade Standard for Gold and Associated Precious Metals for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining&quot; covers the requirements for gold products to identified as &quot;Fairtrade&quot;. Silver and platinum are also Fairtrade precious metals.

In February 2011, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Fairtrade Foundation became the first NGO to begin certifying gold under the fair trade rubric.

=== Pornography or sex industry ===
Fair trade also influences the porn industry. Feminist writers and academics advocate a pornography industry with mutual consent and no exploiting labor conditions for actors and actresses.

== Politics ==
=== European Union ===

In 1994, the European Commission prepared the &quot;Memo on alternative trade&quot; in which it declared its support for strengthening fair trade and its intention to establish an EC Working Group on Fair Trade. The same year, the European Parliament adopted the &quot;Resolution on promoting fairness and solidarity in North South trade&quot;, voicing its support for fair trade. In 1996, the Economic and Social Committee (EESC) adopted an &quot;Opinion on the European &#x27;Fair Trade&#x27; marking movement&quot;. A year later, a resolution adopted by the European Parliament called on the European Commission to support fair trade banana operators, and the European Commission published a survey on &quot;Attitudes of EU consumers to Fair Trade bananas&quot;, concluding that Fair Trade bananas would be commercially viable in several EU Member States.

In 1998, the European Parliament adopted the &quot;Resolution on Fair Trade&quot;, which was followed by a Commission in 1999 that adopted the &quot;Communication from the Commission to the Council on &#x27;Fair Trade&#x27;&quot;. In 2000, public institutions in Europe started purchasing Fairtrade Certified coffee and tea, and the Cotonou Agreement made specific reference to the promotion of Fair Trade in article 23(g) and in the Compendium. The European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/36/EC also suggested promoting Fair Trade. In 2001 and 2002, several other EU papers explicitly mentioned fair trade, most notably the 2001 Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility and the 2002 Communication on Trade and Development.

In 2004, the European Union adopted &quot;Agricultural Commodity Chains, Dependence and Poverty–A proposal for an EU Action Plan&quot;, with a specific reference to the fair trade movement, which has &quot;been setting the trend for a more socio-economically responsible trade.&quot; In 2005, in the European Commission communication &quot;Policy Coherence for Development–Accelerating progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals&quot;, fair trade is mentioned as &quot;a tool for poverty reduction and sustainable development&quot;.

On July 6, 2006, the European Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on fair trade, recognizing the benefits achieved by the fair trade movement, suggesting the development of an EU-wide policy on fair trade, defining criteria that need to be fulfilled under fair trade to protect it from abuse, and calling for greater support for fair trade. &quot;This resolution responds to the impressive growth of Fair Trade, showing the increasing interest of European consumers in responsible purchasing,&quot; said Green MEP Frithjof Schmidt during the plenary debate. Peter Mandelson, EU Commissioner for External Trade, responded that the resolution would be well received by the Commission: &quot;Fair Trade makes the consumers think and therefore it is even more valuable. We need to develop a coherent policy framework and this resolution will help us.&quot; In 2010 the EESC confirmed that &quot;the dynamic and market-responsive nature of ... consumer labels is encouraged by their voluntary nature&quot; whilst also recommending that &quot;resource and regulatory support is given to the development of the improved transparency, impact and credibility of such schemes and the capacity of producers to influence them and participate through certification&quot;.

=== France ===
In 2005, French National Assembly member Antoine Herth issued the report &quot;40 proposals to sustain the development of Fair Trade&quot;. The report was followed the same year by a law that would establish a commission to recognize fair trade Organisations. In parallel to the , also in 2006, the French chapter of ISO (AFNOR) adopted a reference document on Fair Trade after five years of discussion.

=== Italy ===
In 2006, Italian lawmakers debated how to introduce a law on fair trade in Parliament. A consultation process involving a wide range of stakeholders was launched in early October. A definition of fair trade was developed. However, its adoption is still pending as the efforts were stalled by the 2008 Italian political crisis.

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch province of Groningen was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier Douwe Egberts for requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, most notably the payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the province of Groningen prevailed. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: &quot;it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their purchasing policy to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution is made in the fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee&quot;.

== Criticism ==
While some studies claim fair trade is beneficial and efficient, other studies have been less favourable. Sometimes the criticism is intrinsic to fair trade, sometimes efficiency depends on the broader context such as the lack of government help or volatile prices in the global market.

One 2015 study concluded that producer benefits were close to zero because there was an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade was actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification. A study published by the &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot;, however, suggests that Fair Trade does achieve many of its intended goals, although on a comparatively modest scale relative to the size of national economies. A 2014 study of coffee and tea producers in Uganda and Ethiopia suggested that participation in fair trade organizations did not improve workers&#x27; conditions. Some research indicates that the implementation of certain fair trade standards can cause greater inequalities in some markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market. In the fair trade debate there are complaints of failure to enforce the fair trade standards, with producers, cooperatives, importers, and packers profiting by evading them.

=== Ethical basis===
Studies shows a significant number of consumers were content to pay higher prices for fair trade products, in the belief that this helps the poor. One ethical criticism of Fairtrade is that this premium over non-Fairtrade products does not reach the producers and is instead collected by businesses or by employees of co-operatives or is used for unnecessary expenses. Some research finds the implementation of certain fair trade standards causes greater inequalities in markets where these rigid rules are inappropriate for the specific market.

=== What happens with the money? ===

==== Little money may reach the developing countries ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much retailers charge for fair trade goods, so it is rarely possible to determine how much extra is charged or how much of that premium reaches the producers. In four cases it has been possible to find out. One British café chain was passing on less than one percent of the extra charged to the exporting cooperative; in Finland, Valkila, Haaparanta, and Niemi found that consumers paid much more for Fairtrade, and that only 11.5% reached the exporter. Kilian, Jones, Pratt, and Villalobos talk of U.S. Fairtrade coffee getting per pound extra at retail, of which the exporter receives only 2%. Mendoza and Bastiaensen calculated that in the UK only 1.6%–18% of the extra charged for one product line reached the farmer. These studies assume that the importers paid the full Fairtrade price, which is not necessarily the case.

==== Less money reaches farmers ====
The Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra money paid to the exporting cooperatives reaches the farmer. The cooperatives incur costs in reaching fair trade standards, and these are incurred on all production, even if only a small amount is sold at fair trade prices. The most successful cooperatives appear to spend a third of the extra price received on this: some less successful cooperatives spend more than they gain. While this appears to be agreed by proponents and critics of fair trade, there is a dearth of economic studies setting out the actual revenues and what the money was spent on. FLO figures are that 40% of the money reaching the developing world is spent on &quot;business and production&quot;, which would include these costs as well as costs incurred by any inefficiency and corruption in the cooperative or the marketing system. The rest is spent on social projects, rather than being passed on to farmers.

Differing anecdotes state farmers are paid more or less by traders than by fair trade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets, and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages that may or may not include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically average prices over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009) compares prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce fair trade. For instance, fair trade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.

==== Effects of low barriers to entry ====
A 2015 study concluded that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through fair trade. They used data from Central America to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and only a fraction of produce classified as fair trade is actually sold on fair trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.

=== Inefficient marketing system ===
One reason for high prices is that fair trade farmers have to sell through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt–certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt if they wish to retain fairtrade status. Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink Lindsey calls fairtrade a &quot;misguided attempt to make up for market failures&quot; that encourages market inefficiencies and overproduction.

=== Fair trade harms other farmers ===

==== Overproduction argument ====
Critics argue that fair trade harms non-Fairtrade farmers. Fair trade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on increasing yields and quality. Economists argue that if this is so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly inelastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics cite the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid a premium over the world market price in the 1980s, planting much coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The fair trade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-fair trade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees.

=== Other ethical issues ===

==== Secrecy ====
Under EU law (Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices) the criminal offense of unfair trading is committed if (a) &quot;it contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct&quot;, (b) &quot;it omits material information that the average consumer needs… and thereby causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise&quot;, or (c) &quot;fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice… [which] causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.&quot; Peter Griffiths (2011) points to false claims that fair trade producers get higher prices and to the almost universal failure to disclose the extra price charged for fair trade products, how much of this actually reaches the developing world, what this is spent on in the developing world, how much (if any) reaches farmers, and the harm that fair trade does to non-fair trade farmers. He also points to the failure to disclose when &quot;the primary commercial intent&quot; is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.

==== Unethical selling techniques ====
Economist Philip Booth says that the selling techniques used by some sellers and supporters of fair trade are bullying, misleading, and unethical, such as the use of boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they think ethically suspect. However, the opposite has been argued, that a more participatory and multi-stakeholder approach to auditing might improve the quality of the process.

Some people argue that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices. It may bring to light corporate vulnerabilities that activists can exploit. Or it may encourage ordinary people to get involved with broader projects of social change.

=== Failure to monitor standards ===
There are complaints that fair trade standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes making them work several months more for little return.

Enforcement of standards by Fairtrade was described as &quot;seriously weak&quot; by Christian Jacquiau. Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations, agreed that &quot;certain arguments carry some weight&quot;. There are many complaints of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage; some non-Fairtrade coffee is sold as Fairtrade &quot;the standards are not very strict in the case of seasonally hired labour in coffee production.&quot; &quot;[S]ome fair trade standards are not strictly enforced.&quot; In 2006, a &quot;Financial Times&quot; journalist found that ten out of ten mills visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported on &quot;evidence of at least one coffee association that received an organic, Fair Trade or other certifications despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&quot;

=== Trade justice and fair trade ===
Segments of the trade justice movement have criticized fair trade for focusing too much on individual small producer groups without advocating for trade policy changes that would have a larger effect on disadvantaged producers&#x27; lives. French author and RFI correspondent Jean-Pierre Boris championed this view in his 2005 book &quot;Commerce inéquitable&quot;.

=== Political objections ===
There have been political criticisms of fair trade from the left and the right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. Christian Jacquiau, in his book &quot;Les coulisses du commerce équitable&quot;, calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, multinational corporations, etc.) rather than establishing a new, fairer, fully autonomous (i.e., government monopoly) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect since most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms. The fair trade approach is rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice that Southern producers do not participate in setting. &quot;A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power in order to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth.&quot;

<text>The Duchy of Lorraine ( ; ), originally Upper Lorraine, was a duchy now included in the larger present-day region of Lorraine in northeastern France. Its capital was Nancy.

It was founded in 959 following the division of Lotharingia into two separate duchies: Upper and Lower Lorraine, the westernmost parts of the Holy Roman Empire. The Lower duchy was quickly dismantled, while Upper Lorraine came to be known as simply the Duchy of Lorraine. The Duchy of Lorraine was coveted and briefly occupied by the dukes of Burgundy and the kings of France, but was ruled by the dukes of the House of Lorraine after 1473.

In 1737, the duchy was given to Stanisław Leszczyński, the former king of Poland, who had lost his throne as a result of the War of the Polish Succession, with the understanding that it would fall to the French crown on his death. When Stanisław died on 23 February 1766, Lorraine was annexed by France and reorganized as the province of Lorraine and Barrois.

==History==
===Lotharingia===
Lorraine&#x27;s predecessor, Lotharingia, was an independent Carolingian kingdom under the rule of King Lothair II (855–869). Its territory had originally been a part of Middle Francia, created in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun, when the Carolingian empire was divided between the three sons of Louis the Pious. Middle Francia was allotted to Emperor Lothair I, therefore called &quot;Lotharii Regnum&quot;. On his death in 855, it was further divided into three parts, of which his son Lothair II took the northern one. His realm then comprised a larger territory stretching from the County of Burgundy in the south to the North Sea. In French, this area became known as &quot;Lorraine&quot;, while in German, it was eventually known as &quot;Lothringen&quot;. In the Alemannic language once spoken in Lorraine, the -ingen suffix signified a property; thus, in a figurative sense, &quot;Lotharingen&quot; can be translated as &quot;Land belonging to Lothair&quot;, or more simplified *Lothair&#x27;s realm*.

As Lothair II had died without heirs, his territory was divided by the 870 Treaty of Meerssen between East and West Francia and finally came under East Frankish rule as a whole by the 880 Treaty of Ribemont. After the East Frankish Carolingians became extinct with the death of Louis the Child in 911, Lotharingia once again attached itself to West Francia, but was conquered by the German king Henry the Fowler in 925. Stuck in the conflict with his rival Hugh the Great, in 942 King Louis IV of France renounced all claims to Lotharingia.

===Duchy of Upper Lorraine===
In 953, the German king Otto I had appointed his brother Bruno the Great Duke of Lotharingia. In 959, Bruno divided the duchy into Upper and Lower Lorraine; this division became permanent following his death in 965. The Upper Duchy was further &quot;up&quot; the river system, that is, it was inland and to the south. Upper Lorraine was first denominated as the Duchy of Mosellane, both in charters and narrative sources, and its duke was the &quot;dux Mosellanorum&quot;.

Lower Lorraine disintegrated into several smaller territories and only the title of a &quot;Duke of Lothier&quot; remained, held by Brabant. By the time Upper Lorraine came into the possession of René of Anjou, several territories had already split off, such as the County of Luxembourg, the Electorate of Trier, the County of Bar and the &quot;Three Bishoprics&quot; of Verdun, Metz and Toul.

The border between the Empire and the Kingdom of France remained relatively stable throughout the Middle Ages. In 1301, Count Henry III of Bar had to receive the western part of his lands (&quot;Barrois mouvant&quot;) as a fief by King Philip IV of France. In 1475, the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold campaigned for the Duchy of Lorraine, but was finally defeated and killed at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. In the 1552 Treaty of Chambord, a number of insurgent Protestant Imperial princes around Maurice, Elector of Saxony ceded the Three Bishoprics to King Henry II of France in turn for his support.

Due to the weakening of Imperial authority during the 1618–1648 Thirty Years&#x27; War, France was able to occupy the duchy in 1634 and retained it until 1661 when Charles IV was restored. In 1670, the French invaded again, forcing Charles into exile; his nephew and heir Charles V (1643–1690) spent his life in the service of the Imperial House of Habsburg. France returned the Duchy in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick ending the Nine Years&#x27; War and Charles&#x27; son Leopold (1679–1729), became duke and was known as &#x27;Leopold the Good;&#x27; in the 1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, parts of Lorraine, including the capital Nancy, were again occupied by France, but Leopold continued to reign at the Château de Lunéville.

In 1737, after the War of the Polish Succession, an agreement between France, the Habsburgs and the Lorraine House of Vaudémont assigned the Duchy to Stanisław Leszczyński, former king of Poland. He was also father-in-law to King Louis XV of France, and had recently lost out to a candidate backed by Russia and Austria in the War of the Polish Succession. The duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen, betrothed to the Emperor&#x27;s daughter Archduchess Maria Theresa, was compensated with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where the last Medici ruler had recently died without issue. France also promised to support Maria Theresa as heir to the Habsburg possessions under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Leszczyński received Lorraine with the understanding that it would fall to the French crown on his death. The &quot;title&quot; of Duke of Lorraine was given to Stanisław, but also retained by Francis Stephen, and it figures prominently in the titles of his successors (as a non-claimant family name), the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. When Stanisław died on 23 February 1766, Lorraine was annexed by France and reorganized as a province by the French government.


==Culture==
Two regional languages survive in the region.

Lorraine Franconian, known as &#x27; or &#x27; in French, is a West Central German dialect spoken by a minority in the northern part of the region. This is distinct from the neighbouring Alsatian language, although the two are often confused. Neither has any form of official recognition.

Lorrain is a Romance dialect spoken by a minority in the southern part of the region.

The duchy produced a number of important painters, including Claude Lorrain, Georges de La Tour and Jean LeClerc.

Like most of France&#x27;s regional languages (such as Breton, Franco-Provençal, Occitan, Alsatian, Catalan, Basque and Flemish), Lorrain and Lorraine Franconian were largely replaced by French with the advent of mandatory public schooling in the 19th and 20th centuries.

<text>A hallucination is a perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has the compelling sense of reality. They are distinguishable from several related phenomena, such as dreaming (REM sleep), which does not involve wakefulness; pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and mental imagery, which does not mimic real perception, and is under voluntary control. Hallucinations also differ from &quot;delusional perceptions&quot;, in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional significance.

Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive and chronoceptive. Hallucinations are referred to as multimodal if multiple sensory modalities occur.

A mild form of hallucination is known as a &quot;disturbance&quot;, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject. 55% of auditory hallucinations are malicious in content, for example, people talking about the subject, not speaking to them directly. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject. This can produce a feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.

Hypnagogic hallucinations and hypnopompic hallucinations are considered normal phenomena. Hypnagogic hallucinations can occur as one is falling asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations occur when one is waking up. Hallucinations can be associated with drug use (particularly deliriants), sleep deprivation, psychosis, neurological disorders, and delirium tremens. Many hallucinations happen also during sleep paralysis.

The word &quot;hallucination&quot; itself was introduced into the English language by the 17th-century physician Sir Thomas Browne in 1646 from the derivation of the Latin word &quot;alucinari&quot; meaning to wander in the mind. For Browne, hallucination means a sort of vision that is &quot;depraved and receive[s] its objects erroneously&quot;.
==Classification==
Hallucinations may be manifested in a variety of forms. Various forms of hallucinations affect different senses, sometimes occurring simultaneously, creating multiple sensory hallucinations for those experiencing them.

===Auditory===
Auditory hallucinations (also known as &quot;paracusia&quot;) are the perception of sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations can be divided into elementary and complex, along with verbal and nonverbal. These hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination, with auditory verbal hallucinations being more common than nonverbal. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify it as a hallucination.

Complex hallucinations are those of voices, music, or other sounds that may or may not be clear, may or may not be familiar, and may be friendly, aggressive, or among other possibilities. A hallucination of a single individual person of one or more talking voices is particularly associated with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and hold special significance in diagnosing these conditions.

In schizophrenia, voices are normally perceived coming from outside the person, but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head instead of behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms, especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations. However, many people who do not have a diagnosable mental illness may sometimes hear voices as well. One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, it is crucial to take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, they do not necessarily have a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as Wilson&#x27;s disease, various endocrine diseases, numerous metabolic disturbances, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and many others can present with psychosis.

Musical hallucinations are also relatively common in terms of complex auditory hallucinations and may be the result of a wide range of causes ranging from hearing-loss (such as in musical ear syndrome, the auditory version of Charles Bonnet syndrome), lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, arteriovenous malformation, stroke, lesion, abscess, or tumor.

The Hearing Voices Movement is a support and advocacy group for people who hallucinate voices, but do not otherwise show signs of mental illness or impairment.

High caffeine consumption has been linked to an increase in likelihood of one experiencing auditory hallucinations. A study conducted by the La Trobe University School of Psychological Sciences revealed that as few as five cups of coffee a day (approximately 500 mg of caffeine) could trigger the phenomenon.

===Visual===

A &quot;visual hallucination&quot; is &quot;the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists&quot;. A separate but related phenomenon is a &quot;visual illusion&quot;, which is a distortion of a real external stimulus. Visual hallucinations are classified as simple or complex:
* &quot;Simple visual hallucinations&quot; (SVH) are also referred to as non-formed visual hallucinations and elementary visual hallucinations. These terms refer to lights, colors, geometric shapes, and indiscrete objects. These can be further subdivided into phosphenes which are SVH without structure, and photopsias which are SVH with geometric structures.
* &quot;Complex visual hallucinations&quot; (CVH) are also referred to as formed visual hallucinations. CVHs are clear, lifelike images or scenes such as people, animals, objects, places, etc.

For example, one may report hallucinating a giraffe. A simple visual hallucination is an amorphous figure that may have a similar shape or color to a giraffe (&quot;looks like&quot; a giraffe), while a complex visual hallucination is a discrete, lifelike image that &quot;is&quot;, unmistakably, a giraffe.

===Command===

Command hallucinations are hallucinations in the form of commands; they appear to be from an external source, or can appear coming from the subject&#x27;s head. The contents of the hallucinations can range from the innocuous to commands to cause harm to the self or others. Command hallucinations are often associated with schizophrenia. People experiencing command hallucinations may or may not comply with the hallucinated commands, depending on the circumstances. Compliance is more common for non-violent commands.

Command hallucinations are sometimes used to defend a crime that has been committed, often homicides. In essence, it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do. Sometimes the commands are quite benign directives such as &quot;Stand up&quot; or &quot;Shut the door.&quot; Whether it is a command for something simple or something that is a threat, it is still considered a &quot;command hallucination.&quot; Some helpful questions that can assist one in determining if they may have this includes: &quot;What are the voices telling you to do?&quot;, &quot;When did your voices first start telling you to do things?&quot;, &quot;Do you recognize the person who is telling you to harm yourself (or others)?&quot;, &quot;Do you think you can resist doing what the voices are telling you to do?&quot;

===Olfactory===

Phantosmia (olfactory hallucinations), smelling an odor that is not actually there, and parosmia (olfactory illusions), inhaling a real odor but perceiving it as different scent than remembered, are distortions to the sense of smell (olfactory system), and in most cases, are not caused by anything serious and will usually go away on their own in time. It can result from a range of conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, dental problems, migraines, head injuries, seizures, strokes, or brain tumors. Environmental exposures can sometimes cause it as well, such as smoking, exposure to certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer. It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, intoxication, substance withdrawal, or psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). The perceived odors are usually unpleasant and commonly described as smelling burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten.
===Tactile===

Tactile hallucinations are the illusion of tactile sensory input, simulating various types of pressure to the skin or other organs. One subtype of tactile hallucination, formication, is the sensation of insects crawling underneath the skin and is frequently associated with prolonged cocaine use. However, formication may also be the result of normal hormonal changes such as menopause, or disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, high fevers, Lyme disease, skin cancer, and more.

=== Gustatory ===
This type of hallucination is the perception of taste without a stimulus. These hallucinations, which are typically strange or unpleasant, are relatively common among individuals who have certain types of focal epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy. The regions of the brain responsible for gustatory hallucination in this case are the insula and the superior bank of the sylvian fissure.

=== Sexual ===
Sexual hallucinations are the perception of erogenous or orgasmic stimuli. They may be unimodal or multimodal in nature and frequently involve sensation in the genital region, though it is not exclusive. Frequent examples of sexual hallucinations include the sensation of being penetrated, experiencing orgasm, feeling as if one is being touched in an erogenous zone, sensing stimulation in the genitals, feeling the fondling of one&#x27;s breasts or buttocks and tastes or smells related to sexual activity. Visualizations of sexual content and auditory voices making sexually explicit remarks may sometimes be included in this classification. While it features components of other classifications, sexual hallucinations are distinct due to the orgasmic component and unique presentation.

The regions of the brain responsible differ by the subsection of sexual hallucination. In orgasmic auras, the mesial temporal lobe, right amygdala and hippocampus are involved. In males, genital specific sensations are related to the postcentral gyrus and arousal and ejaculation are linked to stimulation in the posterior frontal lobe. In females, however, the hippocampus and amygdala are connected. Limited studies have been done to understand the mechanism of action behind sexual hallucinations in epilepsy, substance use, and post-traumatic stress disorder etiologies.

=== Somatic ===
Somatic hallucinations refer to an interoceptive sensory experience in the absence of stimulus. Somatic hallucinations can be broken down into further subcategories: general, algesic, kinesthetic, and cenesthopathic.

* Cenesthopathic- Effecting the cenesthetic sensory modality, cenesthopathic hallucinations are a pathological alteration in the sense of bodily existence, caused by aberrant bodily sensations. Most often, cenesthopathic hallucinations will refer to sensation in the visceral organs. Therefore, it is also known as visceral hallucinations. Manifestations are often subjective, hard to describe and unique to the sufferer. Common manifestations include pressure, burning, tickling, or tightening in various body systems. While these hallucinations can be experienced by a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorder, cenesthopathic schizophrenia is recognized by the ICD as a subtype of schizophrenia marked by primarily cenesthopathic hallucinations and other body image aberrations.
* Kinesthetic- Kinesthetic hallucinations, effecting the sensory modality of the same name, are the sensation of movement of the limbs or other body parts without actual movement.
* Algesic- Algesic hallucinations, effecting the algesic sensory modality, refers to a perceived perception of pain.
* General- General somatic hallucination refers to somatic hallucinations not otherwise categorized by the above subsections. Common examples include when an individual feels that their body is being mutilated, i.e. twisted, torn, or disemboweled. Other reported cases are invasion by animals in the person&#x27;s internal organs, such as snakes in the stomach or frogs in the rectum. The general feeling that one&#x27;s flesh is decomposing is also classified under this type of this hallucination.

=== Multimodal ===
A hallucination involving sensory modalities is called multimodal, analogous to unimodal hallucinations which have only one sensory modality. The multiple sensory modalities can occur at the same time (simultaneously) or with a delay (serial), be related or unrelated to each other, and be consistent with reality (congruent) or not (incongruent). For example, a person talking in a hallucination would be congruent with reality, but a cat talking would not be.

Multimodal hallucinations are correlated to poorer mental health outcomes, and are often experienced as feeling more real.

==Cause==

Hallucinations can be caused by a number of factors.

===Hypnagogic hallucination===

These hallucinations occur just before falling asleep and affect a high proportion of the population: in one survey 37% of the respondents experienced them twice a week. The hallucinations can last from seconds to minutes; all the while, the subject usually remains aware of the true nature of the images. These may be associated with narcolepsy. Hypnagogic hallucinations are sometimes associated with brainstem abnormalities, but this is rare.

===Peduncular hallucinosis===

Peduncular means pertaining to the peduncle, which is a neural tract running to and from the pons on the brain stem. These hallucinations usually occur in the evenings, but not during drowsiness, as in the case of hypnagogic hallucination. The subject is usually fully conscious and then can interact with the hallucinatory characters for extended periods of time. As in the case of hypnagogic hallucinations, insight into the nature of the images remains intact. The false images can occur in any part of the visual field, and are rarely .

===Delirium tremens===

One of the more enigmatic forms of visual hallucination is the highly variable, possibly polymodal delirium tremens. It is associated with withdrawal in alcohol use disorder. Individuals with delirium tremens may be agitated and confused, especially in the later stages of this disease. Insight is gradually reduced with the progression of this disorder. Sleep is disturbed and occurs for a shorter period of time, with rapid eye movement sleep.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Lewy body dementia===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is linked with Lewy body dementia for their similar hallucinatory symptoms. Presence hallucinations can be an early indicator of cognitive decline in Parkinson&#x27;s Disease. The symptoms strike during the evening in any part of the visual field, and are rarely . The segue into hallucination may begin with illusions where sensory perception is greatly distorted, but no novel sensory information is present. These typically last for several minutes, during which time the subject may be either conscious and normal or drowsy/inaccessible. Insight into these hallucinations is usually preserved and REM sleep is usually reduced. Parkinson&#x27;s disease is usually associated with a degraded substantia nigra pars compacta, but recent evidence suggests that PD affects a number of sites in the brain. Some places of noted degradation include the median raphe nuclei, the noradrenergic parts of the locus coeruleus, and the cholinergic neurons in the parabrachial area and pedunculopontine nuclei of the tegmentum.

===Migraine coma===
This type of hallucination is usually experienced during the recovery from a comatose state. The migraine coma can last for up to two days, and a state of depression is sometimes comorbid. The hallucinations occur during states of full consciousness, and insight into the hallucinatory nature of the images is preserved. It has been noted that ataxic lesions accompany the migraine coma.

==== Migraine attacks ====
Migraine attacks may result in visual hallucinations including auras and in rarer cases, auditory hallucinations.

===Charles Bonnet syndrome===
Charles Bonnet syndrome is the name given to visual hallucinations experienced by a partially or severely sight impaired person. The hallucinations can occur at any time and can distress people of any age, as they may not initially be aware that they are hallucinating. They may fear for their own mental health initially, which may delay them sharing with carers until they start to understand it themselves. The hallucinations can frighten and disconcert as to what is real and what is not. The hallucinations can sometimes be dispersed by eye movements, or by reasoned logic such as, &quot;I can see fire but there is no smoke and there is no heat from it&quot; or perhaps, &quot;We have an infestation of rats but they have pink ribbons with a bell tied on their necks.&quot; Over elapsed months and years, the hallucinations may become more or less frequent with changes in ability to see. The length of time that the sight impaired person can have these hallucinations varies according to the underlying speed of eye deterioration. A differential diagnosis are ophthalmopathic hallucinations.

===Focal epilepsy===
Visual hallucinations due to focal seizures differ depending on the region of the brain where the seizure occurs. For example, visual hallucinations during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the visual field, multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a few seconds to a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus, typically the temporal field. However, unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the contralateral side and move toward the ipsilateral side.

Temporal lobe seizures, on the other hand, can produce complex visual hallucinations of people, scenes, animals, and more as well as distortions of visual perception. Complex hallucinations may appear to be real or unreal, may or may not be distorted with respect to size, and may seem disturbing or affable, among other variables. One rare but notable type of hallucination is heautoscopy, a hallucination of a mirror image of one&#x27;s self. These &quot;other selves&quot; may be perfectly still or performing complex tasks, may be an image of a younger self or the present self, and tend to be briefly present. Complex hallucinations are a relatively uncommon finding in temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Rarely, they may occur during occipital focal seizures or in parietal lobe seizures.

Distortions in visual perception during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion (micropsia or macropsia), distorted perception of movement (where moving objects may appear to be moving very slowly or to be perfectly still), a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the dolly zoom effect, and other illusions. Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.

===Drug-induced hallucination===

Drug-induced hallucinations are caused by hallucinogens, dissociatives, and deliriants, including many drugs with anticholinergic actions and certain stimulants, which are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Some psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin can cause hallucinations that range in the spectrum of mild to intense.

Hallucinations, pseudohallucinations, or intensification of pareidolia, particularly auditory, are known side effects of opioids to different degrees—it may be associated with the absolute degree of agonism or antagonism of especially the kappa opioid receptor, sigma receptors, delta opioid receptor and the NMDA receptors or the overall receptor activation profile as synthetic opioids like those of the pentazocine, levorphanol, fentanyl, pethidine, methadone and some other families are more associated with this side effect than natural opioids like morphine and codeine and semi-synthetics like hydromorphone, amongst which there also appears to be a stronger correlation with the relative analgesic strength. Three opioids, Cyclazocine (a benzormorphan opioid/pentazocine relative) and two levorphanol-related morphinan opioids, Cyclorphan and Dextrorphan are classified as hallucinogens, and Dextromethorphan as a dissociative. These drugs also can induce sleep (relating to hypnagogic hallucinations) and especially the pethidines have atropine-like anticholinergic activity, which was possibly also a limiting factor in the use, the psychotomimetic side effects of potentiating morphine, oxycodone, and other opioids with scopolamine (respectively in the Twilight Sleep technique and the combination drug Skophedal, which was eukodal (oxycodone), scopolamine and ephedrine, called the &quot;wonder drug of the 1930s&quot; after its invention in Germany in 1928, but only rarely specially compounded today) (q.q.v.).

===Sensory deprivation hallucination===
Hallucinations can be caused by sensory deprivation when it occurs for prolonged periods of time, and almost always occurs in the modality being deprived (visual for blindfolded/darkness, auditory for muffled conditions, etc.)

===Experimentally-induced hallucinations===

Anomalous experiences, such as so-called benign hallucinations, may occur in a person in a state of good mental and physical health, even in the apparent absence of a transient trigger factor such as fatigue, intoxication or sensory deprivation.

The evidence for this statement has been accumulating for more than a century. Studies of benign hallucinatory experiences go back to 1886 and the early work of the Society for Psychical Research, which suggested approximately 10% of the population had experienced at least one hallucinatory episode in the course of their life. More recent studies have validated these findings; the precise incidence found varies with the nature of the episode and the criteria of &quot;hallucination&quot; adopted, but the basic finding is now well-supported.

===Non-celiac gluten sensitivity===
There is tentative evidence of a relationship with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the so-called &quot;gluten psychosis&quot;.

==Pathophysiology==

===Dopaminergic and serotonergic hallucinations===
It has been reported that in serotonergic hallucinations, the person maintains an awareness that they are hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic hallucinations.

===Neuroanatomy===

Hallucinations are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in primary and secondary sensory cortices. Reduced grey matter in regions of the superior temporal gyrus/middle temporal gyrus, including Broca&#x27;s area, is associated with auditory hallucinations as a trait, while acute hallucinations are associated with increased activity in the same regions along with the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and the right hemispheric homologue of Broca&#x27;s area in the inferior frontal gyrus. Grey and white matter abnormalities in visual regions are associated with hallucinations in diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, further supporting the notion of dysfunction in sensory regions underlying hallucinations.

One proposed model of hallucinations posits that over-activity in sensory regions, which is normally attributed to internal sources via feedforward networks to the inferior frontal gyrus, is interpreted as originating externally due to abnormal connectivity or functionality of the feedforward network. This is supported by cognitive studies of those with hallucinations, who have demonstrated abnormal attribution of self generated stimuli.

Disruptions in thalamocortical circuitry may underlie the observed top down and bottom up dysfunction. Thalamocortical circuits, composed of projections between thalamic and cortical neurons and adjacent interneurons, underlie certain electrophysical characteristics (gamma oscillations) that are associated with sensory processing. Cortical inputs to thalamic neurons enable attentional modulation of sensory neurons. Dysfunction in sensory afferents, and abnormal cortical input may result in pre-existing expectations modulating sensory experience, potentially resulting in the generation of hallucinations. Hallucinations are associated with less accurate sensory processing, and more intense stimuli with less interference are necessary for accurate processing and the appearance of gamma oscillations (called &quot;gamma synchrony&quot;). Hallucinations are also associated with the absence of reduction in P50 amplitude in response to the presentation of a second stimuli after an initial stimulus; this is thought to represent failure to gate sensory stimuli, and can be exacerbated by dopamine release agents.

Abnormal assignment of salience to stimuli may be one mechanism of hallucinations. Dysfunctional dopamine signaling may lead to abnormal top down regulation of sensory processing, allowing expectations to distort sensory input.

==Treatments==
There are few treatments for many types of hallucinations. However, for those hallucinations caused by mental disease, a psychologist or psychiatrist should be consulted, and treatment will be based on the observations of those doctors. Antipsychotic and atypical antipsychotic medication may also be utilized to treat the illness if the symptoms are severe and cause significant distress. For other causes of hallucinations there is no factual evidence to support any one treatment is scientifically tested and proven. However, abstaining from hallucinogenic drugs, stimulant drugs, managing stress levels, living healthily, and getting plenty of sleep can help reduce the prevalence of hallucinations. In all cases of hallucinations, medical attention should be sought out and informed of one&#x27;s specific symptoms. Meta-analyses show that cognitive behavioral therapy and metacognitive training can also reduce the severity of hallucinations. Furthermore, there are recovery movements all around the world that advocate for individuals with schizophrenia or voice-hearers (individuals that hear voices). The Hearing Voices Movement, starting in Europe, aims to utilize knowledge and experience of voice hearers combined with experts in disorders such as schizophrenia, such as psychiatrists.

==Epidemiology==
Prevalence of hallucinations varies depending on underlying medical conditions, which sensory modalities are affected, age and culture. auditory hallucinations are the most well studied and most common sensory modality of hallucinations, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 9.6%. Children and adolescents have been found to experience similar rates (12.7% and 12.4% respectively) which occur mostly during late childhood and adolescence. This is compared with adults and those over 60 (with rates of 5.8% and 4.8% respectively). For those with schizophrenia, the lifetime prevalence of hallucinations is 80% and the estimated prevalence of visual hallucinations is 27%, compared to 79% for auditory hallucinations. A 2019 study suggested 16.2% of adults with hearing impairment experience hallucinations, with prevalence rising to 24% in the most hearing impaired group.

A risk factor for multimodal hallucinations is prior experience of unimodal hallucinations. In 90% cases of psychosis, a visual hallucination occurs in combination with another sensory modality, most often being auditory or somatic. In schizophrenia, multimodal hallucinations are twice as common as unimodal ones.

A 2015 review of 55 publications from 1962 to 2014 found 16–28.6% of those experiencing hallucinations report at least some religious content in them, along with 20–60% reporting some religious content in delusions. There is some evidence for delusions being a risk factor for religious hallucinations, with and 61.7% of people having experienced any delusion and 75.9% of those having experienced a religious delusion found to also experience hallucinations.

<text>Damon Francis Knight (September 19, 1922 – April 15, 2002) was an American science fiction author, editor, and critic. He is the author of &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, a 1950 short story adapted for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. He was married to fellow writer Kate Wilhelm.

==Biography==
Knight was born in Baker City, Oregon, in 1922, and grew up in Hood River, Oregon. He entered science-fiction fandom at the age of eleven and published two issues of a fanzine titled &quot;Snide&quot;.

Knight&#x27;s first professional sale was a cartoon drawing to a science-fiction magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. His first story, &quot;The Itching Hour&quot;, appeared in the Summer 1940 number of &quot;Futuria Fantasia&quot;, edited and published by Ray Bradbury. &quot;Resilience&quot; followed in the February 1941 number of &quot;Stirring Science Stories&quot;, edited by Donald A. Wollheim. An editorial error made the latter story&#x27;s ending incomprehensible; it was reprinted in a 1978 magazine in four pages with a two-page introduction by Knight.

At the time of his first story sale he was living in New York and was a member of the Futurians. One of his short stories describes paranormal disruption of a science fiction fan group and contains cameo appearances of various Futurians and others under thinly-disguised names; for instance, non-Futurian SF writer H. Beam Piper is identified as &quot;H. Dreyne Fifer&quot;.

Knight&#x27;s forte was the short story; he is widely acknowledged as having been a master of the genre. To the general public he is best known as the author of &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, a 1950 short story adapted for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It won a 50-year Retro-Hugo in 2001 as the best short story of 1950. Knight was also a science fiction critic, a career which began when he wrote in 1945 that A. E. van Vogt &quot;is not a giant as often maintained. He&#x27;s only a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter.&quot; He ceased reviewing when &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; refused to publish his review of Judith Merril&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;. These reviews were later collected in &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot;.

Algis Budrys wrote that Knight and &quot;William Atheling Jr.&quot; (James Blish) had &quot;transformed the reviewer&#x27;s trade in the field&quot;, in Knight&#x27;s case &quot;without the guidance of his own prior example&quot;. The term &quot;idiot plot&quot;, a story that only functions because almost everyone in it is an idiot, became well known through Knight&#x27;s frequent use of it in his reviews, though he believed the term was probably invented by Blish. Knight&#x27;s only non-Retro-Hugo Award was for &quot;Best Reviewer&quot; in 1956.

Knight was the founder of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), cofounder of the National Fantasy Fan Federation, cofounder of the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop, and cofounder of the Clarion Writers Workshop. The SFWA officers and past presidents named Knight its 13th Grand Master in 1994 (presented 1995). After his death, the associated award was renamed the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award in his honor. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2003.

Until his death, Knight lived in Eugene, Oregon, with his second wife, author Kate Wilhelm. His papers are held in the University of Oregon Special Collections and University Archive.

<text>Penelope ( ; Ancient Greek: Πηνελόπεια, &quot;Pēnelópeia&quot;, or , &quot;Pēnelópē&quot;) is a character in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey.&quot; She was the queen of Ithaca and was the daughter of Spartan king Icarius and Asterodia. Penelope is known for her fidelity to her husband Odysseus, despite the attention of more than a hundred suitors during his absence. In one source, Penelope&#x27;s original name was Arnacia or Arnaea.

== Etymology ==
Glossed by Hesychius as &quot;some kind of bird&quot; (today arbitrarily identified with the Eurasian wigeon, to which Linnaeus gave the binomial &quot;Anas penelope&quot;), where () is a common Pre-Greek suffix for predatory animals; however, the semantic relation between the proper name and the gloss is not clear. In folk etymology, () is usually understood to combine the Greek word (), &quot;weft&quot;, and (), &quot;face&quot;, which is considered the most appropriate for a cunning weaver whose motivation is hard to decipher. Robert S. P. Beekes believed the name to be Pre-Greek and related to () or ().

== Role in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; ==

Penelope is married to the main character, the king of Ithaca, Odysseus (Ulysses in Roman mythology), and daughter of Icarius of Sparta and Periboea (or Polycaste). She only has one son with Odysseus, Telemachus, who was born just before Odysseus was called to fight in the Trojan War. She waits twenty years for Odysseus&#x27; return, during which time she devises various cunning strategies to delay marrying any of the 108 suitors (led by Antinous and including Agelaus, Amphinomus, Ctessippus, Demoptolemus, Elatus, Euryades, Eurymachus and Peisander).
On Odysseus&#x27;s return, disguised as an old beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised cunning tricks to delay the suitors, one of which is to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for Odysseus&#x27;s elderly father Laertes and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until Melantho, a slave, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.
Penelope&#x27;s efforts to delay remarriage is often seen as a symbol of marital fidelity to her husband, Odysseus. But because Athena wants her &quot;to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore&quot;, Penelope does eventually appear before the suitors Irene de Jong wrote

 As so often, it is Athena who takes the initiative in giving the story a new direction ... Usually the motives of mortal and god coincide, here they do not: Athena wants Penelope to fan the Suitors’ desire for her and (thereby) make her more esteemed by her husband and son; Penelope has no real motive ... she simply feels an unprecedented impulse to meet the men she so loathes ... adding that she might take this opportunity to talk to Telemachus (which she will indeed do).

It is important to consider the alternate perspective of Penelope entertaining, and even enjoying the attention of, her suitors. Italian philosophy historian Giula Sissa offers a unique perspective which supports this idea. The Odyssey allows room for Penelope’s identity free of being Ulysses’ wife. As she awaits his return, she makes a plan to deal with her suitors while also responding to her desires. Sissa discusses how Penelope gives her suitors the opportunity to demonstrate themselves as the best candidate for her attention. Sissa writes,

&quot;Penelope innovates. And she does so because she responds in the same register to the desires of the men who have been awaiting her verdict for three years. This is an erotic desire to which she reacts, first, with seductive wiles of messages and promises, and then by inviting them to demonstrate their excellence, not in terms of wealth and social prestige, but in terms of something extremely personal and physical. In order to please Penelope, they have to be on par with Ulysses in showing the might of their bodies.&quot;

She is ambivalent, variously asking Artemis to kill her and apparently considering marrying one of the suitors. When the disguised Odysseus returns, she announces in her long interview with him that whoever can string Odysseus&#x27;s rigid bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads may have her hand. &quot;For the plot of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, of course, her decision is the turning point, the move that makes possible the long-predicted triumph of the returning hero&quot;.

There is debate as to whether Penelope knows that it is Odysseus. Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass them all in any test of masculine skill, so she may have started the contest as an opportunity for him to reveal his identity. On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (except, perhaps, Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, she could just be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.

When the contest of the bow begins, none of the suitors are able to string the bow, except Odysseus who wins the contest. Having done so, he proceeds to slaughter the suitors – beginning with Antinous whom he finds drinking from his cup – with help from Telemachus, Athena and the slaves Eumaeus the swineherd and Philoetius the cowherd. Odysseus has now revealed himself in all his glory (with a little makeover by Athena); yet Penelope cannot believe that her husband has really returned – she fears that it is perhaps some god in disguise, as in the story of Alcmene – and tests him by ordering her slave Eurycleia to move the bed in their bridal-chamber. Odysseus protests that this cannot be done, since he made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a living olive tree. Penelope finally accepts that he truly is Odysseus, a moment that highlights their &quot;homophrosýnē&quot; (, &quot;like-mindedness&quot;). Homer implies that from then on Odysseus would live a long and happy life together with Penelope and Telemachus, wisely ruling his kingdom, and enjoying wide respect and much success.

== Role in other myths ==
Penelope also appears in the lost Greek epic &quot;Telegony&quot; that does not survive except in a summary, but that was attributed to Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene and written as a sequel to the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. According to this epic, Odysseus had a son called Telegonus with Circe when he was in her island. When Telegonus had grown to manhood, Circe sent him in search of Odysseus. Shipwrecked on Ithaca by a storm, Telegonus misidentified the island and, assailed by hunger, began plundering it. Odysseus and his oldest son, Telemachus, defended their city and, in the ensuing melée, Telegonus accidentally killed his father with a lance tipped with the venomous spine of a stingray. After discovering the identity of his father, Telegonus brought Telemachus and Penelope to Circe&#x27;s island. Here, Athena ordered the marriage of Telemachus to Telegonus&#x27; mother, the enchantress Circe, while Telegonus married the new widowed Penelope. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the other three immortal. According to Hyginus, Penelope and Telegonus had a son called Italus who, according to some accounts, gave his name to Italy. This legend inspired Sophocles lost tragedy &quot;Odysseus Acanthoplex&quot;.

In some early sources such as Pindar, Pan&#x27;s parents are Apollo and Penelope. Herodotus, Cicero, Apollodorus, and Hyginus all describe Hermes and Penelope as his parents. Pausanias records the story that Penelope had in fact been unfaithful to Odysseus, who banished her to Mantineia upon his return. In the 5th century AD Nonnus names Pan&#x27;s mother as Penelope of Mantineia in Arcadia. Other sources report that Penelope had slept with all 108 suitors in Odysseus&#x27; absence, and gave birth to Pan as a result. This myth reflects the folk etymology that equates Pan&#x27;s name () with the Greek word for &quot;all&quot; (). The &quot;Odyssey&quot; carefully suppresses this variant tradition.

== Iconography ==

Penelope is recognizable in Greek and Roman works, from Attic vase-paintings—the Penelope Painter is recognized by his representations of her—to Roman sculptures copying or improvising upon classical Greek models, by her seated pose, by her reflective gesture of leaning her cheek on her hand, and by her protectively crossed legs, reflecting her long chastity in Odysseus&#x27; absence, an unusual pose in any other figure.

== Latin tradition ==
Latin references to Penelope revolved around her sexual loyalty to the absent Odysseus. It suited the marital aspect of Roman society representing the tranquility of the worthy family. She is mentioned by various classical authors including Plautus, Propertius, Horace, Ovid, Martial and Statius. The use of Penelope in Latin texts provided a basis for her ongoing use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as a representation of a chaste wife. This was reinforced by her being named by Saint Jerome among pagan women famed for their chastity.

<text>In music theory, an interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds. An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.

In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale. Intervals between successive notes of a scale are also known as scale steps. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone. Intervals smaller than a semitone are called microtones. They can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales. Some of the very smallest ones are called commas, and describe small discrepancies, observed in some tuning systems, between enharmonically equivalent notes such as C and D. Intervals can be arbitrarily small, and even imperceptible to the human ear.

In physical terms, an interval is the ratio between two sonic frequencies. For example, any two notes an octave apart have a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that successive increments of pitch by the same interval result in an exponential increase of frequency, even though the human ear perceives this as a linear increase in pitch. For this reason, intervals are often measured in cents, a unit derived from the logarithm of the frequency ratio.

In Western music theory, the most common naming scheme for intervals describes two properties of the interval: the quality (perfect, major, minor, augmented, diminished) and number (unison, second, third, etc.). Examples include the minor third or perfect fifth. These names identify not only the difference in semitones between the upper and lower notes but also how the interval is spelled. The importance of spelling stems from the historical practice of differentiating the frequency ratios of enharmonic intervals such as G–G and G–A.

== Size ==
The size of an interval (also known as its width or height) can be represented using two alternative and equivalently valid methods, each appropriate to a different context: frequency ratios or cents.

=== Frequency ratios ===
The size of an interval between two notes may be measured by the ratio of their frequencies. When a musical instrument is tuned using a just intonation tuning system, the size of the main intervals can be expressed by small-integer ratios, such as 1:1 (unison), 2:1 (octave), 5:3 (major sixth), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 4:3 (perfect fourth), 5:4 (major third), 6:5 (minor third). Intervals with small-integer ratios are often called &quot;just intervals&quot;, or &quot;pure intervals&quot;.

Most commonly, however, musical instruments are nowadays tuned using a different tuning system, called 12-tone equal temperament. As a consequence, the size of most equal-tempered intervals cannot be expressed by small-integer ratios, although it is very close to the size of the corresponding just intervals. For instance, an equal-tempered fifth has a frequency ratio of 2:1, approximately equal to 1.498:1, or 2.997:2 (very close to 3:2). For a comparison between the size of intervals in different tuning systems, see .

=== Cents ===
The standard system for comparing interval sizes is with cents. The cent is a logarithmic unit of measurement. If frequency is expressed in a logarithmic scale, and along that scale the distance between a given frequency and its double (also called octave) is divided into 1200 equal parts, each of these parts is one cent. In twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET), a tuning system in which all semitones have the same size, the size of one semitone is exactly 100 cents. Hence, in 12-TET the cent can be also defined as one hundredth of a semitone.

Mathematically, the size in cents of the interval from frequency &quot;f&quot;1 to frequency &quot;f&quot;2 is

formula_1

== Main intervals ==
The table shows the most widely used conventional names for the intervals between the notes of a chromatic scale. A perfect unison (also known as perfect prime) is an interval formed by two identical notes. Its size is zero cents. A semitone is any interval between two adjacent notes in a chromatic scale, a whole tone is an interval spanning two semitones (for example, a major second), and a tritone is an interval spanning three tones, or six semitones (for example, an augmented fourth). Rarely, the term ditone is also used to indicate an interval spanning two whole tones (for example, a major third), or more strictly as a synonym of major third.

Intervals with different names may span the same number of semitones, and may even have the same width. For instance, the interval from D to F is a major third, while that from D to G is a diminished fourth. However, they both span 4 semitones. If the instrument is tuned so that the 12 notes of the chromatic scale are equally spaced (as in equal temperament), these intervals also have the same width. Namely, all semitones have a width of 100 cents, and all intervals spanning 4 semitones are 400 cents wide.

The names listed here cannot be determined by counting semitones alone. The rules to determine them are explained below. Other names, determined with different naming conventions, are listed in a separate section. Intervals smaller than one semitone (commas or microtones) and larger than one octave (compound intervals) are introduced below.

== Interval number and quality ==
In Western music theory, an interval is named according to its &quot;number&quot; (also called &quot;diatonic number, interval size&quot; or &quot;generic interval&quot;) and &quot;quality&quot;. For instance, &quot;major third&quot; (or M3) is an interval name, in which the term &quot;major&quot; (M) describes the quality of the interval, and &quot;third&quot; (3) indicates its number.

=== Number ===


The number of an interval is the number of letter names or staff positions (lines and spaces) it encompasses, including the positions of both notes forming the interval. For instance, the interval B—D is a third (denoted m3) because the notes from B to the D above it encompass three letter names (B, C, D) and occupy three consecutive staff positions, including the positions of B and D. The table and the figure above show intervals with numbers ranging from 1 (e.g., P1) to 8 (e.g., d8). Intervals with larger numbers are called compound intervals.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between staff positions and diatonic-scale degrees (the notes of diatonic scale).
This means that interval numbers can also be determined by counting diatonic scale degrees, rather than staff positions, provided that the two notes that form the interval are drawn from a diatonic scale. Namely, B—D is a third because in any diatonic scale that contains B and D, the sequence from B to D includes three notes. For instance, in the B-natural minor diatonic scale, the three notes are B–C–D. This is not true for all kinds of scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale, there are four notes from B to D: B–C–C–D. This is the reason interval numbers are also called &quot;diatonic numbers&quot;, and this convention is called &quot;diatonic numbering&quot;.

If one adds any accidentals to the notes that form an interval, by definition the notes do not change their staff positions. As a consequence, any interval has the same interval number as the corresponding natural interval, formed by the same notes without accidentals. For instance, the intervals B–D (spanning 4 semitones) and B–D (spanning 2 semitones) are thirds, like the corresponding natural interval B—D (3 semitones).

Notice that interval numbers represent an inclusive count of encompassed staff positions or note names, not the difference between the endpoints. In other words, one starts counting the lower pitch as one, not zero. For that reason, the interval E–E, a perfect unison, is also called a prime (meaning &quot;1&quot;), even though there is no difference between the endpoints. Continuing, the interval E–F is a second, but F is only one staff position, or diatonic-scale degree, above E. Similarly, E—G is a third, but G is only two staff positions above E, and so on. As a consequence, joining two intervals always yields an interval number one less than their sum. For instance, the intervals B—D and D—F are thirds, but joined together they form a fifth (B—F), not a sixth. Similarly, a stack of three thirds, such as B—D, D—F, and F—A, is a seventh (B-A), not a ninth.

This scheme applies to intervals up to an octave (12 semitones). For larger intervals, see below.

=== Quality ===
The name of any interval is further qualified using the terms perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (A), and diminished (d). This is called its &quot;interval quality&quot; (or &quot;modifier&quot;). It is possible to have doubly diminished and doubly augmented intervals, but these are quite rare, as they occur only in chromatic contexts. The combination of number (or generic interval) and quality (or modifier) is called the &quot;specific interval&quot;, &quot;diatonic interval&quot; (sometimes used only for intervals appearing in the diatonic scale), or simply &quot;interval&quot;.

The quality of a compound interval is the quality of the simple interval on which it is based. Some other qualifiers like &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;subminor&quot;, and &quot;supermajor&quot; are used for non-diatonic intervals.

==== Perfect ====

Perfect intervals are so-called because they were traditionally considered perfectly consonant,
although in Western classical music the perfect fourth was sometimes regarded as a less than perfect consonance, when its function was contrapuntal. Conversely, minor, major, augmented, or diminished intervals are typically considered less consonant, and were traditionally classified as mediocre consonances, imperfect consonances, or near-dissonances.

Within a diatonic scale all unisons (P1) and octaves (P8) are perfect. Most fourths and fifths are also perfect (P4 and P5), with five and seven semitones respectively. One occurrence of a fourth is augmented (A4) and one fifth is diminished (d5), both spanning six semitones. For instance, in an E-major scale, the A4 is between A and D, and the d5 is between D and A.

The inversion of a perfect interval is also perfect. Since the inversion does not change the pitch class of the two notes, it hardly affects their level of consonance (matching of their harmonics). Conversely, other kinds of intervals have the opposite quality with respect to their inversion. The inversion of a major interval is a minor interval, and the inversion of an augmented interval is a diminished interval.

==== Major and minor ====

As shown in the table, a diatonic scale defines seven intervals for each interval number, each starting from a different note (seven unisons, seven seconds, etc.). The intervals formed by the notes of a diatonic scale are called diatonic. Except for unisons and octaves, the diatonic intervals with a given interval number always occur in two sizes, which differ by one semitone. For example, six of the fifths span seven semitones. The other one spans six semitones. Four of the thirds span three semitones, the others four. If one of the two versions is a perfect interval, the other is called either diminished (i.e. narrowed by one semitone) or augmented (i.e. widened by one semitone). Otherwise, the larger version is called major, the smaller one minor. For instance, since a 7-semitone fifth is a perfect interval (P5), the 6-semitone fifth is called &quot;diminished fifth&quot; (d5). Conversely, since neither kind of third is perfect, the larger one is called &quot;major third&quot; (M3), the smaller one &quot;minor third&quot; (m3).

Within a diatonic scale, unisons and octaves are always qualified as perfect, fourths as either perfect or augmented, fifths as perfect or diminished, and all the other intervals (seconds, thirds, sixths, sevenths) as major or minor.

==== Augmented and diminished ====
Augmented intervals are wider by one semitone than perfect or major intervals, while having the same interval number (i.e., encompassing the same number of staff positions): they are wider by a chromatic semitone. Diminished intervals, on the other hand, are narrower by one semitone than perfect or minor intervals of the same interval number: they are narrower by a chromatic semitone. For instance, an augmented sixth such as E–C spans ten semitones, exceeding a major sixth (E—C) by one semitone, while a diminished sixth such as E–C spans seven semitones, falling short of a minor sixth (E–C) by one semitone.

The augmented fourth (A4) and the diminished fifth (d5) are the only augmented and diminished intervals that appear in diatonic scales (see table).

=== Example ===
Neither the number, nor the quality of an interval can be determined by counting semitones alone. As explained above, the number of staff positions must be taken into account as well.

For example, as shown in the table below, there are six semitones between C and F, C and G, and C and E, but
* C–F is a fourth, as it encompasses four staff positions (C, D, E, F), and it is augmented, as it exceeds a perfect fourth (such as C-F) by one semitone.
* C–G is a fifth, as it encompasses five staff positions (C, D, E, F, G), and it is diminished, as it falls short of a perfect fifth (such as C-G) by one semitone.
* C–E is a third, as it encompasses three staff positions (C, D, E), and it is doubly augmented, as it exceeds a major third (such as C-E) by two semitone.

== Shorthand notation ==
Intervals are often abbreviated with a P for perfect, m for minor, M for major, d for diminished, A for augmented, followed by the interval number. The indications M and P are often omitted. The octave is P8, and a unison is usually referred to simply as &quot;a unison&quot; but can be labeled P1. The tritone, an augmented fourth or diminished fifth is often TT. The interval qualities may be also abbreviated with perf, min, maj, dim, aug. Examples:
* m2 (or min2): minor second,
* M3 (or maj3): major third,
* A4 (or aug4): augmented fourth,
* d5 (or dim5): diminished fifth,
* P5 (or perf5): perfect fifth.

== Inversion ==

A simple interval (i.e., an interval smaller than or equal to an octave) may be inverted by raising the lower pitch an octave or lowering the upper pitch an octave. For example, the fourth from a lower C to a higher F may be inverted to make a fifth, from a lower F to a higher C.

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/4)
\new Staff «
 \clef treble \time 4/4
 \new Voice \relative c&#x27; {
 \stemUp c2 c&#x27; c, c&#x27; c, c&#x27; c, c&#x27;
 \new Voice \relative c&#x27; {
 \stemDown c2 c d d e e f f
 \addlyrics { &quot;P1&quot; -- &quot;P8&quot; &quot;M2&quot; -- &quot;m7&quot; &quot;M3&quot; -- &quot;m6&quot; &quot;P4&quot; -- &quot;P5&quot; }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

There are two rules to determine the number and quality of the inversion of any simple interval:
# The interval number and the number of its inversion always add up to nine (4 + 5 = 9, in the example just given).
# The inversion of a major interval is a minor interval, and vice versa; the inversion of a perfect interval is also perfect; the inversion of an augmented interval is a diminished interval, and vice versa; the inversion of a doubly augmented interval is a doubly diminished interval, and vice versa.
For example, the interval from C to the E above it is a minor third. By the two rules just given, the interval from E to the C above it must be a major sixth.

Since compound intervals are larger than an octave, &quot;the inversion of any compound interval is always the same as the inversion of the simple interval from which it is compounded&quot;.

For intervals identified by their ratio, the inversion is determined by reversing the ratio and multiplying the ratio by 2 until it is greater than 1. For example, the inversion of a 5:4 ratio is an 8:5 ratio.

For intervals identified by an integer number of semitones, the inversion is obtained by subtracting that number from 12.

Since an interval class is the lower number selected among the interval integer and its inversion, interval classes cannot be inverted.

== Classification ==
Intervals can be described, classified, or compared with each other according to various criteria.

=== Melodic and harmonic ===

An interval can be described as
* Vertical or harmonic if the two notes sound simultaneously
* Horizontal, linear, or melodic if they sound successively. Melodic intervals can be &quot;ascending&quot; (lower pitch precedes higher pitch) or &quot;descending&quot;.

=== Diatonic and chromatic ===

In general,

* A &quot;diatonic interval&quot; is an interval formed by two notes of a diatonic scale.
* A &quot;chromatic interval&quot; is a non-diatonic interval formed by two notes of a chromatic scale.

The table above depicts the 56 diatonic intervals formed by the notes of the C major scale (a diatonic scale). Notice that these intervals, as well as any other diatonic interval, can be also formed by the notes of a chromatic scale.

The distinction between diatonic and chromatic intervals is controversial, as it is based on the definition of diatonic scale, which is variable in the literature. For example, the interval B–E (a diminished fourth, occurring in the harmonic C-minor scale) is considered diatonic if the harmonic minor scales are considered diatonic as well. Otherwise, it is considered chromatic. For further details, see the main article.

By a commonly used definition of diatonic scale (which excludes the harmonic minor and melodic minor scales), all perfect, major and minor intervals are diatonic. Conversely, no augmented or diminished interval is diatonic, except for the augmented fourth and diminished fifth.

The distinction between diatonic and chromatic intervals may be also sensitive to context. The above-mentioned 56 intervals formed by the C-major scale are sometimes called &quot;diatonic to C major&quot;. All other intervals are called &quot;chromatic to C major&quot;. For instance, the perfect fifth A–E is chromatic to C major, because A and E are not contained in the C major scale. However, it is diatonic to others, such as the A major scale.

=== Consonant and dissonant ===

Consonance and dissonance are relative terms that refer to the stability, or state of repose, of particular musical effects. Dissonant intervals are those that cause tension and desire to be &quot;resolved&quot; to consonant intervals.

These terms are relative to the usage of different compositional styles.
* In 15th- and 16th-century usage, perfect fifths and octaves, and major and minor thirds and sixths were considered harmonically consonant, and all other intervals dissonant, including the perfect fourth, which by 1473 was described (by Johannes Tinctoris) as dissonant, except between the upper parts of a vertical sonority—for example, with a supporting third below (&quot;6-3 chords&quot;). In the common practice period, it makes more sense to speak of consonant and dissonant chords, and certain intervals previously considered dissonant (such as minor sevenths) became acceptable in certain contexts. However, 16th-century practice was still taught to beginning musicians throughout this period.
* Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) theorised that dissonance was caused by the presence of beats. Helmholtz further believed that the beating produced by the upper partials of harmonic sounds was the cause of dissonance for intervals too far apart to produce beating between the fundamentals. Helmholtz then designated that two harmonic tones that shared common low partials would be more consonant, as they produced less beats. Helmholtz disregarded partials above the seventh, as he believed that they were not audible enough to have significant effect. From this Helmholtz categorises the octave, perfect fifth, perfect fourth, major sixth, major third, and minor third as consonant, in decreasing value, and other intervals as dissonant.
* David Cope (1997) suggests the concept of interval strength, in which an interval&#x27;s strength, consonance, or stability is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger, or higher and weaker, position in the harmonic series. See also: Lipps–Meyer law and #Interval root

All of the above analyses refer to vertical (simultaneous) intervals.

=== Simple and compound ===
A simple interval is an interval spanning at most one octave (see Main intervals above). Intervals spanning more than one octave are called compound intervals, as they can be obtained by adding one or more octaves to a simple interval (see below for details).

=== Steps and skips ===

Linear (melodic) intervals may be described as &quot;steps&quot; or &quot;skips&quot;. A &quot;step&quot;, or &quot;conjunct motion&quot;,
is a linear interval between two consecutive notes of a scale. Any larger interval is called a &quot;skip&quot; (also called a &quot;leap&quot;), or &quot;disjunct motion&quot;. In the diatonic scale, a step is either a minor second (sometimes also called &quot;half step&quot;) or major second (sometimes also called &quot;whole step&quot;), with all intervals of a minor third or larger being skips.

For example, C to D (major second) is a step, whereas C to E (major third) is a skip.

More generally, a step is a smaller or narrower interval in a musical line, and a skip is a wider or larger interval, where the categorization of intervals into steps and skips is determined by the tuning system and the pitch space used.

Melodic motion in which the interval between any two consecutive pitches is no more than a step, or, less strictly, where skips are rare, is called &quot;stepwise&quot; or &quot;conjunct&quot; melodic motion, as opposed to &quot;skipwise&quot; or &quot;disjunct&quot; melodic motions, characterized by frequent skips.

=== Enharmonic intervals ===
Two intervals are considered &quot;enharmonic&quot;, or &quot;enharmonically equivalent&quot;, if they both contain the same pitches spelled in different ways; that is, if the notes in the two intervals are themselves enharmonically equivalent. Enharmonic intervals span the same number of semitones.

For example, the four intervals listed in the table below are all enharmonically equivalent, because the notes F and G indicate the same pitch, and the same is true for A and B. All these intervals span four semitones.

When played as isolated chords on a piano keyboard, these intervals are indistinguishable to the ear, because they are all played with the same two keys. However, in a musical context, the diatonic function of the notes these intervals incorporate is very different.

The discussion above assumes the use of the prevalent tuning system, 12-tone equal temperament (&quot;12-TET&quot;). But in other historic meantone temperaments, the pitches of pairs of notes such as F and G may not necessarily coincide. These two notes are enharmonic in 12-TET, but may not be so in another tuning system. In such cases, the intervals they form would also not be enharmonic. For example, in quarter-comma meantone, all four intervals shown in the example above would be different.

== Minute intervals ==
There are also a number of minute intervals not found in the chromatic scale or labeled with a diatonic function, which have names of their own. They may be described as microtones, and some of them can be also classified as commas, as they describe small discrepancies, observed in some tuning systems, between enharmonically equivalent notes. In the following list, the interval sizes in cents are approximate.
* A &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot; is the difference between twelve justly tuned perfect fifths and seven octaves. It is expressed by the frequency ratio 531441:524288 (23.5 cents).
* A &quot;syntonic comma&quot; is the difference between four justly tuned perfect fifths and two octaves plus a major third. It is expressed by the ratio 81:80 (21.5 cents).
* A &quot;septimal comma&quot; is 64:63 (27.3 cents), and is the difference between the Pythagorean or 3-limit &quot;7th&quot; and the &quot;harmonic 7th&quot;.
* A &quot;diesis&quot; is generally used to mean the difference between three justly tuned major thirds and one octave. It is expressed by the ratio 128:125 (41.1 cents). However, it has been used to mean other small intervals: see diesis for details.
* A &quot;diaschisma&quot; is the difference between three octaves and four justly tuned perfect fifths plus two justly tuned major thirds. It is expressed by the ratio 2048:2025 (19.6 cents).
* A &quot;schisma&quot; (also skhisma) is the difference between five octaves and eight justly tuned fifths plus one justly tuned major third. It is expressed by the ratio 32805:32768 (2.0 cents). It is also the difference between the Pythagorean and syntonic commas. (A schismic major third is a schisma different from a just major third, eight fifths down and five octaves up, F in C.)
* A &quot;kleisma&quot; is the difference between six minor thirds and one &quot;tritave&quot; or &quot;perfect twelfth&quot; (an octave plus a perfect fifth), with a frequency ratio of 15625:15552 (8.1 cents) ().
* A &quot;septimal kleisma&quot; is the amount that two major thirds of 5:4 and a septimal major third, or supermajor third, of 9:7 exceeds the octave. Ratio 225:224 (7.7 cents).
* A &quot;quarter tone&quot; is half the width of a semitone, which is half the width of a whole tone. It is equal to exactly 50 cents.

== Compound intervals ==
A compound interval is an interval spanning more than one octave. Conversely, intervals spanning at most one octave are called simple intervals (see Main intervals below).

In general, a compound interval may be defined by a sequence or &quot;stack&quot; of two or more simple intervals of any kind. For instance, a major tenth (two staff positions above one octave), also called &quot;compound major third&quot;, spans one octave plus one major third.

Any compound interval can be always decomposed into one or more octaves plus one simple interval. For instance, a major seventeenth can be decomposed into two octaves and one major third, and this is the reason why it is called a compound major third, even when it is built by adding up four fifths.

The diatonic number &quot;DN&quot;c of a compound interval formed from &quot;n&quot; simple intervals with diatonic numbers &quot;DN&quot;1, &quot;DN&quot;2, ..., &quot;DN&quot;n, is determined by:
:formula_2
which can also be written as:
:formula_3

The quality of a compound interval is determined by the quality of the simple interval on which it is based. For instance, a compound major third is a major tenth (1+(8−1)+(3−1) = 10), or a major seventeenth (1+(8−1)+(8−1)+(3−1) = 17), and a compound perfect fifth is a perfect twelfth (1+(8−1)+(5−1) = 12) or a perfect nineteenth (1+(8−1)+(8−1)+(5−1) = 19). Notice that two octaves are a fifteenth, not a sixteenth (1+(8−1)+(8−1) = 15). Similarly, three octaves are a twenty-second (1+3×(8−1) = 22), four octaves are a twenty-ninth (1+3×(8-1) = 29), and so on.

=== Main compound intervals ===
It is also worth mentioning here the major seventeenth (28 semitones)—an interval larger than two octaves that can be considered a multiple of a perfect fifth (7 semitones) as it can be decomposed into four perfect fifths (7 × 4 = 28 semitones), or two octaves plus a major third (12 + 12 + 4 = 28 semitones). Intervals larger than a major seventeenth seldom come up, most often being referred to by their compound names, for example &quot;two octaves plus a fifth&quot; rather than &quot;a 19th&quot;.

== Intervals in chords ==

Chords are sets of three or more notes. They are typically defined as the combination of intervals starting from a common note called the root of the chord. For instance a major triad is a chord containing three notes defined by the root and two intervals (major third and perfect fifth). Sometimes even a single interval (dyad) is considered a chord. Chords are classified based on the quality and number of the intervals that define them.

=== Chord qualities and interval qualities ===
The main chord qualities are major, minor, augmented, diminished, half-diminished, and dominant.
The symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for interval quality (see above). In addition, + or aug is used for augmented, ° or dim for diminished, for half diminished, and dom for dominant (the symbol − alone is not used for diminished).

=== Deducing component intervals from chord names and symbols ===
The main rules to decode chord &quot;names or symbols&quot; are summarized below. Further details are given at Rules to decode chord names and symbols.
# For 3-note chords (triads), major or minor always refer to the interval of the third above the root note, while augmented and diminished always refer to the interval of the fifth above root. The same is true for the corresponding symbols (e.g., Cm means Cm3, and C+ means C+5). Thus, the terms third and fifth and the corresponding symbols 3 and 5 are typically omitted. This rule can be generalized to all kinds of chords, provided the above-mentioned qualities appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the chord symbols Cm and Cm7, m refers to the interval m3, and 3 is omitted. When these qualities do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered interval qualities, rather than chord qualities. For instance, in CmM7 (minor major seventh chord), m is the chord quality and refers to the m3 interval, while M refers to the M7 interval. When the number of an extra interval is specified immediately after chord quality, the quality of that interval may coincide with chord quality (e.g., CM7 = CMM7). However, this is not always true (e.g., Cm6 = CmM6, C+7 = C+m7, CM11 = CMP11). See main article for further details.
# Without contrary information, a major third interval and a perfect fifth interval (major triad) are implied. For instance, a C chord is a C major triad, and the name C minor seventh (Cm7) implies a minor 3rd by rule 1, a perfect 5th by this rule, and a minor 7th by definition (see below). This rule has one exception (see next rule).
# When the fifth interval is diminished, the third must be minor. This rule overrides rule 2. For instance, Cdim7 implies a diminished 5th by rule 1, a minor 3rd by this rule, and a diminished 7th by definition (see below).
#Names and symbols that contain only a plain interval number (e.g., &quot;seventh chord&quot;) or the chord root and a number (e.g., &quot;C seventh&quot;, or C7) are interpreted as follows:
#*If the number is 2, 4, 6, etc., the chord is a major added tone chord (e.g., C6 = CM6 = Cadd6) and contains, together with the implied major triad, an extra major 2nd, perfect 4th, or major 6th (see names and symbols for added tone chords).
#*If the number is 7, 9, 11, 13, etc., the chord is dominant (e.g., C7 = Cdom7) and contains, together with the implied major triad, one or more of the following extra intervals: minor 7th, major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th (see names and symbols for seventh and extended chords).
#*If the number is 5, the chord (technically not a chord in the traditional sense, but a dyad) is a power chord. Only the root, a perfect fifth and usually an octave are played.

The table shows the intervals contained in some of the main chords (component intervals), and some of the symbols used to denote them. The interval qualities or numbers in boldface font can be deduced from chord name or symbol by applying rule 1. In symbol examples, C is used as chord root.

== Size of intervals used in different tuning systems ==

In this table, the interval widths used in four different tuning systems are compared. To facilitate comparison, just intervals as provided by 5-limit tuning (see symmetric scale n.1) are shown in bold font, and the values in cents are rounded to integers. Notice that in each of the non-equal tuning systems, by definition the width of &quot;each&quot; type of interval (including the semitone) changes depending on the note that starts the interval. This is the art of just intonation. In equal temperament, the intervals are never precisely in tune with each other. This is the price of using equidistant intervals in a 12-tone scale. For simplicity, for some types of interval the table shows only one value (the most often observed one).

In -comma meantone, by definition 11 perfect fifths have a size of approximately 697 cents (700 − &quot;ε&quot; cents, where &quot;ε&quot; ≈ 3.42 cents); since the average size of the 12 fifths must equal exactly 700 cents (as in equal temperament), the other one must have a size of about 738 cents (700 + 11&quot;ε&quot;, the wolf fifth or diminished sixth); 8 major thirds have size about 386 cents (400 − 4&quot;ε&quot;), 4 have size about 427 cents (400 + 8&quot;ε&quot;, actually diminished fourths), and their average size is 400 cents. In short, similar differences in width are observed for all interval types, except for unisons and octaves, and they are all multiples of ε (the difference between the -comma meantone fifth and the average fifth). A more detailed analysis is provided at -comma meantone Size of intervals. -comma meantone was designed to produce just major thirds, but only 8 of them are just (5:4, about 386 cents).

The Pythagorean tuning is characterized by smaller differences because they are multiples of a smaller &quot;ε&quot; (&quot;ε&quot; ≈ 1.96 cents, the difference between the Pythagorean fifth and the average fifth). Notice that here the fifth is wider than 700 cents, while in most meantone temperaments, including -comma meantone, it is tempered to a size smaller than 700. A more detailed analysis is provided at .

The 5-limit tuning system uses just tones and semitones as building blocks, rather than a stack of perfect fifths, and this leads to even more varied intervals throughout the scale (each kind of interval has three or four different sizes). A more detailed analysis is provided at . 5-limit tuning was designed to maximize the number of just intervals, but even in this system some intervals are not just (e.g., 3 fifths, 5 major thirds and 6 minor thirds are not just; also, 3 major and 3 minor thirds are wolf intervals).

The above-mentioned symmetric scale 1, defined in the 5-limit tuning system, is not the only method to obtain just intonation. It is possible to construct juster intervals or just intervals closer to the equal-tempered equivalents, but most of the ones listed above have been used historically in equivalent contexts. In particular, the asymmetric version of the 5-limit tuning scale provides a juster value for the minor seventh (9:5, rather than 16:9). Moreover, the tritone (augmented fourth or diminished fifth), could have other just ratios; for instance, 7:5 (about 583 cents) or 17:12 (about 603 cents) are possible alternatives for the augmented fourth (the latter is fairly common, as it is closer to the equal-tempered value of 600 cents). The 7:4 interval (about 969 cents), also known as the harmonic seventh, has been a contentious issue throughout the history of music theory; it is 31 cents flatter than an equal-tempered minor seventh. For further details about reference ratios, see .

In the diatonic system, every interval has one or more &quot;enharmonic equivalents&quot;, such as augmented second for minor third.

== Interval root ==

Although intervals are usually designated in relation to their lower note, David Cope and Hindemith both suggest the concept of interval root. To determine an interval&#x27;s root, one locates its nearest approximation in the harmonic series. The root of a perfect fourth, then, is its &quot;top&quot; note because it is an octave of the fundamental in the hypothetical harmonic series. The bottom note of every odd diatonically numbered intervals are the roots, as are the tops of all even numbered intervals. The root of a collection of intervals or a chord is thus determined by the interval root of its strongest interval.

As to its usefulness, Cope provides the example of the final tonic chord of some popular music being traditionally analyzable as a &quot;submediant six-five chord&quot; (added sixth chords by popular terminology), or a first inversion seventh chord (possibly the dominant of the mediant V/iii). According to the interval root of the strongest interval of the chord (in first inversion, CEGA), the perfect fifth (C–G), is the bottom C, the tonic.

== Interval cycles ==

Interval cycles, &quot;unfold [i.e., repeat] a single recurrent interval in a series that closes with a return to the initial pitch class&quot;, and are notated by George Perle using the letter &quot;C&quot;, for cycle, with an interval-class integer to distinguish the interval. Thus the diminished-seventh chord would be C3 and the augmented triad would be C4. A superscript may be added to distinguish between transpositions, using 0–11 to indicate the lowest pitch class in the cycle.

== Alternative interval naming conventions ==
As shown below, some of the above-mentioned intervals have alternative names, and some of them take a specific alternative name in Pythagorean tuning, five-limit tuning, or meantone temperament tuning systems such as quarter-comma meantone. All the intervals with prefix &quot;sesqui-&quot; are justly tuned, and their frequency ratio, shown in the table, is a superparticular number (or epimoric ratio). The same is true for the octave.

Typically, a comma is a diminished second, but this is not always true (for more details, see Alternative definitions of comma). For instance, in Pythagorean tuning the diminished second is a descending interval (524288:531441, or about −23.5 cents), and the Pythagorean comma is its opposite (531441:524288, or about 23.5 cents). 5-limit tuning defines four kinds of comma, three of which meet the definition of diminished second, and hence are listed in the table below. The fourth one, called syntonic comma (81:80) can neither be regarded as a diminished second, nor as its opposite. See Diminished seconds in 5-limit tuning for further details.

Additionally, some cultures around the world have their own names for intervals found in their music. For instance, 22 kinds of intervals, called shrutis, are canonically defined in Indian classical music.

===Latin nomenclature===
Up to the end of the 18th century, Latin was used as an official language throughout Europe for scientific and music textbooks. In music, many English terms are derived from Latin. For instance, semitone is from Latin &quot;&quot;.

The prefix semi- is typically used herein to mean &quot;shorter&quot;, rather than &quot;half&quot;. Namely, a semitonus, semiditonus, semidiatessaron, semidiapente, semihexachordum, semiheptachordum, or semidiapason, is shorter by one semitone than the corresponding whole interval. For instance, a semiditonus (3 semitones, or about 300 cents) is not half of a ditonus (4 semitones, or about 400 cents), but a ditonus shortened by one semitone. Moreover, in Pythagorean tuning (the most commonly used tuning system up to the 16th century), a semitritonus (d5) is smaller than a tritonus (A4) by one Pythagorean comma (about a quarter of a semitone).

== Non-diatonic intervals ==
Intervals in non-diatonic scales can be named using analogs of the diatonic interval names, by using a diatonic interval of similar size and distinguishing it by varying the quality, or by adding other modifiers. For example, the just interval 7/6 may be referred to as a &quot;subminor third&quot;, since it is ~267 cents wide, which is narrower than a minor third (300 cents in 12-TET, ~316 cents for the just interval 6/5), or as the &quot;septimal minor third&quot;, since it is a 7-limit interval. These names refer just to the individual interval&#x27;s size, and the interval number need not correspond to the number of scale degrees of a (heptatonic) scale. This naming is particularly common in just intonation and microtonal scales.

The most common of these extended qualities are a neutral interval, in between a minor and major interval; and subminor and supermajor intervals, respectively narrower than a minor or wider than a major interval. The exact size of such intervals depends on the tuning system, but they often vary from the diatonic interval sizes by about a quarter tone (50 cents, half a chromatic step). For example, the neutral second, the characteristic interval of Arabic music, in 24-TET is 150 cents, exactly halfway between a minor second and major second. Combined, these yield the progression &quot;diminished, subminor, minor, neutral, major, supermajor, augmented&quot; for seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths. This naming convention can be extended to unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves with &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;super&quot;, yielding the progression &quot;diminished, sub, perfect, super, augmented&quot;. This allows one to name all intervals in 24-TET or 31-TET, the latter of which was used by Adriaan Fokker. Various further extensions are used in Xenharmonic music.

== Pitch-class intervals ==
In post-tonal or atonal theory, originally developed for equal-tempered European classical music written using the twelve-tone technique or serialism, integer notation is often used, most prominently in musical set theory. In this system, intervals are named according to the number of half steps, from 0 to 11, the largest interval class being 6.

In atonal or musical set theory, there are numerous types of intervals, the first being the ordered pitch interval, the distance between two pitches upward or downward. For instance, the interval from C upward to G is 7, and the interval from G downward to C is −7. One can also measure the distance between two pitches without taking into account direction with the unordered pitch interval, somewhat similar to the interval of tonal theory.

The interval between pitch classes may be measured with ordered and unordered pitch-class intervals. The ordered one, also called directed interval, may be considered the measure upwards, which, since we are dealing with pitch classes, depends on whichever pitch is chosen as 0. For unordered pitch-class intervals, see interval class.

== Generic and specific intervals ==

In diatonic set theory, specific and generic intervals are distinguished. Specific intervals are the interval class or number of semitones between scale steps or collection members, and generic intervals are the number of diatonic scale steps (or staff positions) between notes of a collection or scale.

Notice that staff positions, when used to determine the conventional interval number (second, third, fourth, etc.), are counted including the position of the lower note of the interval, while generic interval numbers are counted excluding that position. Thus, generic interval numbers are smaller by 1, with respect to the conventional interval numbers.

=== Comparison ===
== Generalizations and non-pitch uses ==
The term &quot;interval&quot; can also be generalized to other music elements besides pitch. David Lewin&#x27;s &quot;Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations&quot; uses interval as a generic measure of distance between time points, timbres, or more abstract musical phenomena.

For example, an interval between two bell-like sounds, which have no pitch salience, is still perceptible. When two tones have similar acoustic spectra (sets of partials), the interval is just the distance of the shift of a tone spectrum along the frequency axis, so linking to pitches as reference points is not necessary. The same principle naturally applies to pitched tones (with similar harmonic spectra), which means that intervals can be perceived &quot;directly&quot; without pitch recognition. This explains in particular the predominance of interval hearing over absolute pitch hearing.

<text>In mathematics, a real interval is the set of all real numbers lying between two fixed endpoints with no &quot;gaps&quot;. Each endpoint is either a real number or positive or negative infinity, indicating the interval extends without a bound. A real interval can contain neither endpoint, either endpoint, or both endpoints, excluding any endpoint which is infinite.

For example, the set of real numbers consisting of , , and all numbers in between is an interval, denoted and called the unit interval; the set of all positive real numbers is an interval, denoted ; the set of all real numbers is an interval, denoted ; and any single real number is an interval, denoted .

Intervals are ubiquitous in mathematical analysis. For example, they occur implicitly in the epsilon-delta definition of continuity; the intermediate value theorem asserts that the image of an interval by a continuous function is an interval; integrals of real functions are defined over an interval; etc.

Interval arithmetic consists of computing with intervals instead of real numbers for providing a guaranteed enclosure of the result of a numerical computation, even in the presence of uncertainties of input data and rounding errors.

Intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary totally ordered set, such as integers or rational numbers. The notation of integer intervals is considered in the special section below.

==Definitions and terminology==
An &quot;interval&quot; is a subset of the real numbers that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the subset.

The &quot;endpoints&quot; of an interval are its supremum, and its infimum, if they exist as real numbers. If the infimum does not exist, one says often that the corresponding endpoint is formula_1 Similarly, if the supremum does not exist, one says that the corresponding endpoint is formula_2

Intervals are completely determined by their endpoints and whether each endpoint belong to the interval. This is a consequence of the least-upper-bound property of the real numbers. This characterization is used to specify intervals by mean of &quot;&quot;, which is described below.

An does not include any endpoint, and is indicated with parentheses. For example, formula_3 is the interval of all real numbers greater than and less than . (This interval can also be denoted by , see below). The open interval consists of real numbers greater than , i.e., positive real numbers. The open intervals are thus one of the forms
:formula_4 and formula_5 are real numbers such that formula_6 When formula_7 in the first case, the resulting interval is the empty set formula_8 which is a degenerate interval (see below). The open intervals are those intervals that are open sets for the usual topology on the real numbers.

A is an interval that includes all its endpoints and is denoted with square brackets. For example, means greater than or equal to and less than or equal to . Closed intervals have one of the following forms in which and are real numbers such that formula_9
:formula_10
The closed intervals are those intervals that are closed sets for the usual topology on the real numbers. The empty set and formula_11 are the only intervals that are both open and closed.

A &quot;&quot; has two endpoints and includes only one of them. It is said &quot;left-open&quot; or &quot;right-open&quot; depending on whether the excluded endpoint is on the left or on the right. These intervals are denoted by mixing notations for open and closed intervals. For example, means greater than and less than or equal to , while means greater than or equal to and less than . The half-open intervals have the form
:formula_12 and formula_13 are also closed sets in the real line. Intervals formula_14 and formula_15 are neither an open set nor a closed set. If one allows an endpoint in the closed side to be an infinity (such as ), the result will not be an interval, since it is not even a subset of the real numbers. Instead, the result can be seen as an interval in the extended real line, which occurs in measure theory, for example.

In summary, a set of the real numbers is an interval, if and only if it is an open interval, a closed interval, or a half-open interval.

A &quot;&quot; is any set consisting of a single real number (i.e., an interval of the form ). Some authors include the empty set in this definition. A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be &quot;proper&quot;, and has infinitely many elements.

An interval is said to be &quot;left-bounded&quot; or &quot;right-bounded&quot;, if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements. An interval is said to be &quot;bounded&quot;, if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be &quot;unbounded&quot; otherwise. Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be &quot;half-bounded&quot;. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends. Bounded intervals are also commonly known as &quot;finite intervals&quot;.

Bounded intervals are bounded sets, in the sense that their diameter (which is equal to the absolute difference between the endpoints) is finite. The diameter may be called the &quot;length&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;, &quot;range&quot;, or &quot;size&quot; of the interval. The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as , and the size of the empty interval may be defined as (or left undefined).

The &quot;centre&quot; (midpoint) of a bounded interval with endpoints and is , and its &quot;radius&quot; is the half-length . These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.

An interval is said to be &quot;left-open&quot; if and only if it contains no minimum (an element that is smaller than all other elements); &quot;right-open&quot; if it contains no maximum; and &quot;open&quot; if it contains neither. The interval , for example, is left-closed and right-open. The empty set and the set of all reals are both open and closed intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, is a closed interval that is right-open but not left-open. The open intervals are open sets of the real line in its standard topology, and form a base of the open sets.

An interval is said to be &quot;left-closed&quot; if it has a minimum element or is left-unbounded, &quot;right-closed&quot; if it has a maximum or is right unbounded; it is simply &quot;closed&quot; if it is both left-closed and right closed. So, the closed intervals coincide with the closed sets in that topology.

The &quot;interior&quot; of an interval is the largest open interval that is contained in ; it is also the set of points in which are not endpoints of . The &quot;closure&quot; of is the smallest closed interval that contains ; which is also the set augmented with its finite endpoints.

For any set of real numbers, the &quot;interval enclosure&quot; or &quot;interval span&quot; of is the unique interval that contains , and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains .

An interval is a &quot;subinterval&quot; of interval if is a subset of . An interval is a &quot;proper subinterval&quot; of if is a proper subset of .

However, there is conflicting terminology for the terms &quot;segment&quot; and &quot;interval&quot;, which have been employed in the literature in two essentially opposite ways, resulting in ambiguity when these terms are used. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Mathematics&quot; defines &quot;interval&quot; (without a qualifier) to exclude both endpoints (i.e., open interval) and &quot;segment&quot; to include both endpoints (i.e., closed interval), while Rudin&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&quot; calls sets of the form [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] &quot;intervals&quot; and sets of the form (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) &quot;segments&quot; throughout. These terms tend to appear in older works; modern texts increasingly favor the term &quot;interval&quot; (qualified by &quot;open&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, or &quot;half-open&quot;), regardless of whether endpoints are included.

==Notations for intervals==
The interval of numbers between and , including and , is often denoted . The two numbers are called the &quot;endpoints&quot; of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a decimal comma, a semicolon may be used as a separator to avoid ambiguity.

===Including or excluding endpoints===
To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in International standard ISO 31-11. Thus, in set builder notation,

:formula_16 The context affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval  = formula_11 is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.

===Integer intervals===
When and are integers, the notation ⟦&quot;a, b&quot;⟧, or or or just , is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all &quot;integers&quot; between and included. The notation is used in some programming languages; in Pascal, for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid indices of an array.

Another way to interpret integer intervals are as sets defined by enumeration, using ellipsis notation.

An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint. Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing  ,  , or . Alternate-bracket notations like or are rarely used for integer intervals.

== Properties ==
The intervals are precisely the connected subsets of formula_18 It follows that the image of an interval by any continuous function from formula_19 to formula_19 is also an interval. This is one formulation of the intermediate value theorem.

The intervals are also the convex subsets of formula_18 The interval enclosure of a subset formula_22 is also the convex hull of formula_23

The closure of an interval is the union of the interval and the set of its finite endpoints, and hence is also an interval. (The latter also follows from the fact that the closure of every connected subset of a topological space is a connected subset.) In other words, we have
:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval. The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other, for example formula_28

If formula_11 is viewed as a metric space, its open balls are the open bounded intervals , and its closed balls are the closed bounded intervals . In particular, the metric and order topologies in the real line coincide, which is the standard topology of the real line.

Any element  of an interval  defines a partition of  into three disjoint intervals 1, 2, 3: respectively, the elements of  that are less than , the singleton formula_30 and the elements that are greater than . The parts 1 and 3 are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors), if and only if is in the interior of . This is an interval version of the trichotomy principle.

==Dyadic intervals==

A &quot;dyadic interval&quot; is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are formula_31 and formula_32 where formula_33 and formula_34 are integers. Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.

Dyadic intervals have the following properties:

* The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.
* Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.
* Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.
* If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.

The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite binary tree.

Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including adaptive mesh refinement, multigrid methods and wavelet analysis. Another way to represent such a structure is p-adic analysis (for ).

== Generalizations ==

=== Balls ===

An open finite interval formula_35 is a 1-dimensional open ball with a center at formula_36 and a radius of formula_37 The closed finite interval formula_38 is the corresponding closed ball, and the interval&#x27;s two endpoints formula_39 form a 0-dimensional sphere. Generalized to formula_34-dimensional Euclidean space, a ball is the set of points whose distance from the center is less than the radius. In the 2-dimensional case, a ball is called a disk.

If a half-space is taken as a kind of degenerate ball (without a well-defined center or radius), a half-space can be taken as analogous to a half-bounded interval, with its boundary plane as the (degenerate) sphere corresponding to the finite endpoint.

=== Multi-dimensional intervals ===

A finite interval is (the interior of) a 1-dimensional hyperrectangle. Generalized to real coordinate space formula_41 an axis-aligned hyperrectangle (or box) is the Cartesian product of formula_34 finite intervals. For formula_43 this is a rectangle; for formula_44 this is a rectangular cuboid (also called a &quot;box&quot;).

Allowing for a mix of open, closed, and infinite endpoints, the Cartesian product of any formula_34 intervals, formula_46 is sometimes called an formula_34-dimensional interval.

A facet of such an interval formula_48 is the result of replacing any non-degenerate interval factor formula_49 by a degenerate interval consisting of a finite endpoint of formula_50 The faces of formula_48 comprise formula_48 itself and all faces of its facets. The corners of formula_48 are the faces that consist of a single point of formula_54

=== Convex polytopes ===

Any finite interval can be constructed as the intersection of half-bounded intervals (with an empty intersection taken to mean the whole real line), and the intersection of any number of half-bounded intervals is a (possibly empty) interval. Generalized to formula_34-dimensional affine space, an intersection of half-spaces (of arbitrary orientation) is (the interior of) a convex polytope, or in the 2-dimensional case a convex polygon.

=== Domains ===

An open interval is a connected open set of real numbers. Generalized to topological spaces in general, a non-empty connected open set is called a domain.

===Complex intervals===
Intervals of complex numbers can be defined as regions of the complex plane, either rectangular or circular.

=== Intervals in posets and preordered sets ===
==== Definitions ====
The concept of intervals can be defined in arbitrary partially ordered sets or more generally, in arbitrary preordered sets. For a preordered set formula_56 and two elements formula_57 one similarly defines the intervals
:formula_58
:formula_59
:formula_60
:formula_61
:formula_62
:formula_63
where formula_64 means formula_65 Actually, the intervals with single or no endpoints are the same as the intervals with two endpoints in the larger preordered set
:formula_66
:formula_67
defined by adding new smallest and greatest elements (even if there were ones), which are subsets of formula_23 In the case of formula_69 one may take formula_70 to be the extended real line.

==== Convex sets and convex components in order theory ====

A subset formula_71 of the preordered set formula_56 is (order-)convex if for every formula_73 and every formula_74 we have formula_75 Unlike in the case of the real line, a convex set of a preordered set need not be an interval. For example, in the totally ordered set formula_76 of rational numbers, the set
:formula_77
is convex, but not an interval of formula_78 since there is no square root of two in formula_79

Let formula_56 be a preordered set and let formula_81 The convex sets of formula_82 contained in formula_83 form a poset under inclusion. A maximal element of this poset is called a convex component of formula_84 By the Zorn lemma, any convex set of formula_82 contained in formula_83 is contained in some convex component of formula_87 but such components need not be unique. In a totally ordered set, such a component is always unique. That is, the convex components of a subset of a totally ordered set form a partition.

==== Properties ====
A generalization of the characterizations of the real intervals follows. For a non-empty subset formula_48 of a linear continuum formula_89 the following conditions are equivalent.
* The set formula_48 is an interval.
* The set formula_48 is order-convex.
* The set formula_48 is a connected subset when formula_93 is endowed with the order topology.

For a subset formula_94 of a lattice formula_95 the following conditions are equivalent.
* The set formula_94 is a sublattice and an (order-)convex set.
* There is an ideal formula_97 and a filter formula_98 such that formula_99

== Applications ==
=== In general topology ===
Every Tychonoff space is embeddable into a product space of the closed unit intervals formula_100 Actually, every Tychonoff space that has a base of cardinality formula_101 is embeddable into the product formula_102 of formula_101 copies of the intervals.

The concepts of convex sets and convex components are used in a proof that every totally ordered set endowed with the order topology is completely normal or moreover, monotonically normal.

==Topological algebra==
Intervals can be associated with points of the plane, and hence regions of intervals can be associated with regions of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair taken from the direct product formula_104 of real numbers with itself, where it is often assumed that . For purposes of mathematical structure, this restriction is discarded, and &quot;reversed intervals&quot; where are allowed. Then, the collection of all intervals can be identified with the topological ring formed by the direct sum of formula_11 with itself, where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise.

The direct sum algebra formula_106 has two ideals, { [&quot;x&quot;,0] : &quot;x&quot; ∈ R } and { [0,&quot;y&quot;] : &quot;y&quot; ∈ R }. The identity element of this algebra is the condensed interval . If interval is not in one of the ideals, then it has multiplicative inverse . Endowed with the usual topology, the algebra of intervals forms a topological ring. The group of units of this ring consists of four quadrants determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The identity component of this group is quadrant I.

Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its midpoint. In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of &quot;balanced intervals&quot; is used along with the axis of intervals that reduce to a point. Instead of the direct sum formula_107 the ring of intervals has been identified with the hyperbolic numbers by M. Warmus and D. H. Lehmer through the identification
:formula_108
where formula_109

This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a ring isomorphism, provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as polar decomposition.

<text>In mathematics, especially group theory, two elements formula_1 and formula_2 of a group are conjugate if there is an element formula_3 in the group such that formula_4 This is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are called conjugacy classes. In other words, each conjugacy class is closed under formula_5 for all elements formula_3 in the group.

Members of the same conjugacy class cannot be distinguished by using only the group structure, and therefore share many properties. The study of conjugacy classes of non-abelian groups is fundamental for the study of their structure. For an abelian group, each conjugacy class is a set containing one element (singleton set).

Functions that are constant for members of the same conjugacy class are called class functions.

==Definition==

Let formula_7 be a group. Two elements formula_8 are conjugate if there exists an element formula_9 such that formula_10 in which case formula_2 is called of formula_1 and formula_1 is called a conjugate of formula_14

In the case of the general linear group formula_15 of invertible matrices, the conjugacy relation is called matrix similarity.

It can be easily shown that conjugacy is an equivalence relation and therefore partitions formula_7 into equivalence classes. (This means that every element of the group belongs to precisely one conjugacy class, and the classes formula_17 and formula_18 are equal if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are conjugate, and disjoint otherwise.) The equivalence class that contains the element formula_21 is
formula_22
and is called the conjugacy class of formula_23 The of formula_7 is the number of distinct (nonequivalent) conjugacy classes. All elements belonging to the same conjugacy class have the same order.

Conjugacy classes may be referred to by describing them, or more briefly by abbreviations such as &quot;6A&quot;, meaning &quot;a certain conjugacy class with elements of order 6&quot;, and &quot;6B&quot; would be a different conjugacy class with elements of order 6; the conjugacy class 1A is the conjugacy class of the identity which has order 1. In some cases, conjugacy classes can be described in a uniform way; for example, in the symmetric group they can be described by cycle type.

==Examples==
The symmetric group formula_25 consisting of the 6 permutations of three elements, has three conjugacy classes:

# No change formula_26. The single member has order 1.
# Transposing two formula_27. The 3 members all have order 2.
# A cyclic permutation of all three formula_28. The 2 members both have order 3.

These three classes also correspond to the classification of the isometries of an equilateral triangle.
The symmetric group consisting of the 24 permutations of four elements, has five conjugacy classes, listed with their description, cycle type, member order, and members:

# No change. Cycle type = [14]. Order = 1. Members = { (1, 2, 3, 4) }. The single row containing this conjugacy class is shown as a row of black circles in the adjacent table. 
# Interchanging two (other two remain unchanged). Cycle type = [1221]. Order = 2. Members = { (1, 2, 4, 3), (1, 4, 3, 2), (1, 3, 2, 4), (4, 2, 3, 1), (3, 2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 3, 4) }). The 6 rows containing this conjugacy class are highlighted in green in the adjacent table.
# A cyclic permutation of three (other one remains unchanged). Cycle type = [1131]. Order = 3. Members = { (1, 3, 4, 2), (1, 4, 2, 3), (3, 2, 4, 1), (4, 2, 1, 3), (4, 1, 3, 2), (2, 4, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 1, 4) }). The 8 rows containing this conjugacy class are shown with normal print (no boldface or color highlighting) in the adjacent table.
# A cyclic permutation of all four. Cycle type = [41]. Order = 4. Members = { (2, 3, 4, 1), (2, 4, 1, 3), (3, 1, 4, 2), (3, 4, 2, 1), (4, 1, 2, 3), (4, 3, 1, 2) }). The 6 rows containing this conjugacy class are highlighted in orange in the adjacent table.
# Interchanging two, and also the other two. Cycle type = [22]. Order = 2. Members = { (2, 1, 4, 3), (4, 3, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1, 2) }). The 3 rows containing this conjugacy class are shown with boldface entries in the adjacent table.

The proper rotations of the cube, which can be characterized by permutations of the body diagonals, are also described by conjugation in formula_29

In general, the number of conjugacy classes in the symmetric group formula_30 is equal to the number of integer partitions of formula_31 This is because each conjugacy class corresponds to exactly one partition of formula_32 into cycles, up to permutation of the elements of formula_33

In general, the Euclidean group can be studied by conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space.

Example

Let G = formula_34

a = ( 2 3 )

x = ( 1 2 3 )

x−1 = ( 3 2 1 )

Then xax−1

= ( 1 2 3 ) ( 2 3 ) ( 3 2 1 ) = ( 3 1 )

= ( 3 1 ) is Conjugate of ( 2 3 )

==Properties==

* The identity element is always the only element in its class, that is formula_35
* If formula_7 is abelian then formula_37 for all formula_38, i.e. formula_39 for all formula_21 (and the converse is also true: if all conjugacy classes are singletons then formula_7 is abelian).
* If two elements formula_8 belong to the same conjugacy class (that is, if they are conjugate), then they have the same order. More generally, every statement about formula_1 can be translated into a statement about formula_44 because the map formula_45 is an automorphism of formula_7 called an inner automorphism. See the next property for an example.
* If formula_1 and formula_2 are conjugate, then so are their powers formula_49 and formula_50 (Proof: if formula_51 then formula_52) Thus taking th powers gives a map on conjugacy classes, and one may consider which conjugacy classes are in its preimage. For example, in the symmetric group, the square of an element of type (3)(2) (a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle) is an element of type (3), therefore one of the power-up classes of (3) is the class (3)(2) (where formula_1 is a power-up class of formula_49).
* An element formula_21 lies in the center formula_56 of formula_7 if and only if its conjugacy class has only one element, formula_1 itself. More generally, if formula_59 denotes the of formula_60 i.e., the subgroup consisting of all elements formula_3 such that formula_62 then the index formula_63 is equal to the number of elements in the conjugacy class of formula_1 (by the orbit-stabilizer theorem).
* Take formula_65 and let formula_66 be the distinct integers which appear as lengths of cycles in the cycle type of formula_67 (including 1-cycles). Let formula_68 be the number of cycles of length formula_69 in formula_67 for each formula_71 (so that formula_72). Then the number of conjugates of formula_67 is:formula_74

==Conjugacy as group action==

For any two elements formula_75 let
formula_76
This defines a group action of formula_7 on formula_78 The orbits of this action are the conjugacy classes, and the stabilizer of a given element is the element&#x27;s centralizer.

Similarly, we can define a group action of formula_7 on the set of all subsets of formula_80 by writing
formula_81
or on the set of the subgroups of formula_78

==Conjugacy class equation==

If formula_7 is a finite group, then for any group element formula_84 the elements in the conjugacy class of formula_1 are in one-to-one correspondence with cosets of the centralizer formula_86 This can be seen by observing that any two elements formula_2 and formula_88 belonging to the same coset (and hence, formula_89 for some formula_90 in the centralizer formula_59) give rise to the same element when conjugating formula_1: 
formula_93
That can also be seen from the orbit-stabilizer theorem, when considering the group as acting on itself through conjugation, so that orbits are conjugacy classes and stabilizer subgroups are centralizers. The converse holds as well.

Thus the number of elements in the conjugacy class of formula_1 is the index formula_95 of the centralizer formula_59 in formula_7; hence the size of each conjugacy class divides the order of the group.

Furthermore, if we choose a single representative element formula_98 from every conjugacy class, we infer from the disjointness of the conjugacy classes that 
formula_99 
where formula_100 is the centralizer of the element formula_101 Observing that each element of the center formula_56 forms a conjugacy class containing just itself gives rise to the class equation:
formula_103
where the sum is over a representative element from each conjugacy class that is not in the center.

Knowledge of the divisors of the group order formula_104 can often be used to gain information about the order of the center or of the conjugacy classes.

===Example===

Consider a finite formula_105-group formula_7 (that is, a group with order formula_107 where formula_105 is a prime number and formula_109). We are going to prove that .

Since the order of any conjugacy class of formula_7 must divide the order of formula_80 it follows that each conjugacy class formula_112 that is not in the center also has order some power of formula_113 where formula_114 But then the class equation requires that formula_115 From this we see that formula_105 must divide formula_117 so formula_118

In particular, when formula_119 then formula_7 is an abelian group since any non-trivial group element is of order formula_105 or formula_122 If some element formula_1 of formula_7 is of order formula_125 then formula_7 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order formula_125 hence abelian. On the other hand, if every non-trivial element in formula_7 is of order formula_129 hence by the conclusion above formula_130 then formula_131 or formula_122 We only need to consider the case when formula_133 then there is an element formula_2 of formula_7 which is not in the center of formula_78 Note that formula_137 includes formula_2 and the center which does not contain formula_2 but at least formula_105 elements. Hence the order of formula_137 is strictly larger than formula_129 therefore formula_143 therefore formula_2 is an element of the center of formula_80 a contradiction. Hence formula_7 is abelian and in fact isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups each of order formula_147

==Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets==

More generally, given any subset formula_148 (formula_149 not necessarily a subgroup), define a subset formula_150 to be conjugate to formula_149 if there exists some formula_9 such that formula_153 Let formula_154 be the set of all subsets formula_150 such that formula_156 is conjugate to formula_157

A frequently used theorem is that, given any subset formula_158 the index of formula_159 (the normalizer of formula_149) in formula_7 equals the cardinality of formula_154:
formula_163

This follows since, if formula_164 then formula_165 if and only if formula_166 in other words, if and only if formula_167 are in the same coset of formula_168

By using formula_169 this formula generalizes the one given earlier for the number of elements in a conjugacy class.

The above is particularly useful when talking about subgroups of formula_78 The subgroups can thus be divided into conjugacy classes, with two subgroups belonging to the same class if and only if they are conjugate.
Conjugate subgroups are isomorphic, but isomorphic subgroups need not be conjugate. For example, an abelian group may have two different subgroups which are isomorphic, but they are never conjugate.

==Geometric interpretation==

Conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of a path-connected topological space can be thought of as equivalence classes of free loops under free homotopy.

==Conjugacy class and irreducible representations in finite group==

In any finite group, the number of nonisomorphic irreducible representations over the complex numbers is precisely the number of conjugacy classes.

<text>Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

The term &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic had, however, been studied since the 1920s, as infinite-valued logic—notably by Łukasiewicz and Tarski.

Fuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. Fuzzy models or fuzzy sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.

Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence.

==Overview==
Classical logic only permits conclusions that are either true or false. However, there are also propositions with variable answers, which one might find when asking a group of people to identify a color. In such instances, the truth appears as the result of reasoning from inexact or partial knowledge in which the sampled answers are mapped on a spectrum.

Both degrees of truth and probabilities range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem identical at first, but fuzzy logic uses degrees of truth as a mathematical model of &quot;vagueness&quot;, while probability is a mathematical model of &quot;ignorance&quot;.

===Applying truth values===
A basic application might characterize various sub-ranges of a continuous variable. For instance, a temperature measurement for anti-lock brakes might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled. Fuzzy set theory provides a means for representing uncertainty.

===Linguistic variables===
In fuzzy logic applications, non-numeric values are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts.

A linguistic variable such as &quot;age&quot; may accept values such as &quot;young&quot; and its antonym &quot;old&quot;. Because natural languages do not always contain enough value terms to express a fuzzy value scale, it is common practice to modify linguistic values with adjectives or adverbs. For example, we can use the hedges &quot;rather&quot; and &quot;somewhat&quot; to construct the additional values &quot;rather old&quot; or &quot;somewhat young&quot;.

==Fuzzy systems==

=== Mamdani ===
The most well-known system is the Mamdani rule-based one. It uses the following rules:
# Fuzzify all input values into fuzzy membership functions.
# Execute all applicable rules in the rulebase to compute the fuzzy output functions.
# De-fuzzify the fuzzy output functions to get &quot;crisp&quot; output values.

====Fuzzification====

Fuzzification is the process of assigning the numerical input of a system to fuzzy sets with some degree of membership. This degree of membership may be anywhere within the interval [0,1]. If it is 0 then the value does not belong to the given fuzzy set, and if it is 1 then the value completely belongs within the fuzzy set. Any value between 0 and 1 represents the degree of uncertainty that the value belongs in the set. These fuzzy sets are typically described by words, and so by assigning the system input to fuzzy sets, we can reason with it in a linguistically natural manner.

For example, in the image below, the meanings of the expressions &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, and &quot;hot&quot; are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three &quot;truth values&quot;—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as &quot;not hot&quot;; i.e. this temperature has zero membership in the fuzzy set &quot;hot&quot;. The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as &quot;slightly warm&quot; and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) &quot;fairly cold&quot;. Therefore, this temperature has 0.2 membership in the fuzzy set &quot;warm&quot; and 0.8 membership in the fuzzy set &quot;cold&quot;. The degree of membership assigned for each fuzzy set is the result of fuzzification.

Fuzzy sets are often defined as triangle or trapezoid-shaped curves, as each value will have a slope where the value is increasing, a peak where the value is equal to 1 (which can have a length of 0 or greater) and a slope where the value is decreasing. They can also be defined using a sigmoid function. One common case is the standard logistic function defined as

: formula_1,

which has the following symmetry property

: formula_2

From this it follows that

formula_3

====Fuzzy logic operators====

Fuzzy logic works with membership values in a way that mimics Boolean logic. To this end, replacements for basic operators (&quot;gates&quot;) AND, OR, NOT must be available. There are several ways to this. A common replacement is called the &quot;s&quot;:

For TRUE/1 and FALSE/0, the fuzzy expressions produce the same result as the Boolean expressions.

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called &quot;hedges&quot; that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as &quot;very&quot;, or &quot;somewhat&quot;, which modify the meaning of a set using a mathematical formula.

However, an arbitrary choice table does not always define a fuzzy logic function. In the paper (Zaitsev, et al), a criterion has been formulated to recognize whether a given choice table defines a fuzzy logic function and a simple algorithm of fuzzy logic function synthesis has been proposed based on introduced concepts of constituents of minimum and maximum. A fuzzy logic function represents a disjunction of constituents of minimum, where a constituent of minimum is a conjunction of variables of the current area greater than or equal to the function value in this area (to the right of the function value in the inequality, including the function value).

Another set of AND/OR operators is based on multiplication, where
x AND y = x*y
NOT x = 1 - x

Hence, 
x OR y = NOT( AND( NOT(x), NOT(y) ) )
x OR y = NOT( AND(1-x, 1-y) )
x OR y = NOT( (1-x)*(1-y) )
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y)
x OR y = x+y-xy
Given any two of AND/OR/NOT, it is possible to derive the third. The generalization of AND is an instance of a t-norm.

==== IF-THEN rules ====

IF-THEN rules map input or computed truth values to desired output truth values. Example:

IF temperature IS very cold THEN fan_speed is stopped
IF temperature IS cold THEN fan_speed is slow
IF temperature IS warm THEN fan_speed is moderate
IF temperature IS hot THEN fan_speed is high
Given a certain temperature, the fuzzy variable &quot;hot&quot; has a certain truth value, which is copied to the &quot;high&quot; variable.

Should an output variable occur in several THEN parts, then the values from the respective IF parts are combined using the OR operator.

====Defuzzification====

The goal is to get a continuous variable from fuzzy truth values.

This would be easy if the output truth values were exactly those obtained from fuzzification of a given number.
Since, however, all output truth values are computed independently, in most cases they do not represent such a set of numbers.
One has then to decide for a number that matches best the &quot;intention&quot; encoded in the truth value.
For example, for several truth values of fan_speed, an actual speed must be found that best fits the computed truth values of the variables &#x27;slow&#x27;, &#x27;moderate&#x27; and so on.

There is no single algorithm for this purpose.

A common algorithm is
# For each truth value, cut the membership function at this value
# Combine the resulting curves using the OR operator
# Find the center-of-weight of the area under the curve
# The x position of this center is then the final output.

=== Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) ===
The TSK system is similar to Mamdani, but the defuzzification process is included in the execution of the fuzzy rules. These are also adapted, so that instead the consequent of the rule is represented through a polynomial function (usually constant or linear). An example of a rule with a constant output would be:
IF temperature IS very cold = 2
In this case, the output will be equal to the constant of the consequent (e.g. 2). In most scenarios we would have an entire rule base, with 2 or more rules. If this is the case, the output of the entire rule base will be the average of the consequent of each rule i (Yi), weighted according to the membership value of its antecedent (hi):

formula_4

An example of a rule with a linear output would be instead:
IF temperature IS very cold AND humidity IS high = 2 * temperature + 1 * humidity
In this case, the output of the rule will be the result of function in the consequent. The variables within the function represent the membership values after fuzzification, not the crisp values. Same as before, in case we have an entire rule base with 2 or more rules, the total output will be the weighted average between the output of each rule.

The main advantage of using TSK over Mamdani is that it is computationally efficient and works well within other algorithms, such as PID control and with optimization algorithms. It can also guarantee the continuity of the output surface. However, Mamdani is more intuitive and easier to work with by people. Hence, TSK is usually used within other complex methods, such as in adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems.

==Forming a consensus of inputs and fuzzy rules==

Since the fuzzy system output is a consensus of all of the inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate the degree to which a rule affects the output values. These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule. These rule weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.

==Applications==

Fuzzy logic is used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as &quot;if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train&#x27;s brake pressure&quot;; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system.

Many of the early successful applications of fuzzy logic were implemented in Japan. A first notable application was on the Sendai Subway 1000 series, in which fuzzy logic was able to improve the economy, comfort, and precision of the ride. It has also been used for handwriting recognition in Sony pocket computers, helicopter flight aids, subway system controls, improving automobile fuel efficiency, single-button washing machine controls, automatic power controls in vacuum cleaners, and early recognition of earthquakes through the Institute of Seismology Bureau of Meteorology, Japan.

=== Artificial intelligence ===

Neural networks based artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic are, when analyzed, the same thing—the underlying logic of neural networks is fuzzy. A neural network will take a variety of valued inputs, give them different weights in relation to each other, combine intermediate values a certain number of times, and arrive at a decision with a certain value. Nowhere in that process is there anything like the sequences of either-or decisions which characterize non-fuzzy mathematics, computer programming, and digital electronics. In the 1980s, researchers were divided about the most effective approach to machine learning: decision tree learning or neural networks. The former approach uses binary logic, matching the hardware on which it runs, but despite great efforts it did not result in intelligent systems. Neural networks, by contrast, did result in accurate models of complex situations and soon found their way onto a multitude of electronic devices. They can also now be implemented directly on analog microchips, as opposed to the previous pseudo-analog implementations on digital chips. The greater efficiency of these compensates for the intrinsic lesser accuracy of analog in various use cases.

=== Medical decision making===

Fuzzy logic is an important concept in medical decision making. Since medical and healthcare data can be subjective or fuzzy, applications in this domain have a great potential to benefit a lot by using fuzzy-logic-based approaches.

Fuzzy logic can be used in many different aspects within the medical decision making framework. Such aspects include in medical image analysis, biomedical signal analysis, segmentation of images or signals, and feature extraction / selection of images or signals.

The biggest question in this application area is how much useful information can be derived when using fuzzy logic. A major challenge is how to derive the required fuzzy data. This is even more challenging when one has to elicit such data from humans (usually, patients). As has been said How to elicit fuzzy data, and how to validate the accuracy of the data is still an ongoing effort, strongly related to the application of fuzzy logic. The problem of assessing the quality of fuzzy data is a difficult one. This is why fuzzy logic is a highly promising possibility within the medical decision making application area but still requires more research to achieve its full potential. 

==== Image-based computer-aided diagnosis ====
One of the common application areas of fuzzy logic is image-based computer-aided diagnosis in medicine. Computer-aided diagnosis is a computerized set of inter-related tools that can be used to aid physicians in their diagnostic decision-making.

=== Fuzzy databases ===
Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy relational databases. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in Maria Zemankova&#x27;s dissertation (1983). Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J. M. Medina, M. A. Vila et al.

Fuzzy querying languages have been defined, such as the SQLf by P. Bosc et al. and the FSQL by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels etc.

== Logical analysis ==
In mathematical logic, there are several formal systems of &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;, most of which are in the family of t-norm fuzzy logics.

=== Propositional fuzzy logics ===
The most important propositional fuzzy logics are:
* Monoidal t-norm-based propositional fuzzy logic MTL is an axiomatization of logic where conjunction is defined by a left continuous t-norm and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to MTL-algebras that are pre-linear commutative bounded integral residuated lattices.
* Basic propositional fuzzy logic BL is an extension of MTL logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous t-norm, and implication is also defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras.
* Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras.
* Gödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is the Gödel t-norm (that is, minimum). It has the axioms of BL plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras.
* Product fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is the product t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras.
* Fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka&#x27;s logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ syntax is also evaluated. This means that each formula has an evaluation. Axiomatization of EVŁ stems from Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic. A generalization of the classical Gödel completeness theorem is provable in EVŁ.

=== Predicate fuzzy logics ===
Similar to the way predicate logic is created from propositional logic, predicate fuzzy logics extend fuzzy systems by universal and existential quantifiers. The semantics of the universal quantifier in t-norm fuzzy logics is the infimum of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula, while the semantics of the existential quantifier is the supremum of the same.

===Decidability Issues===
The notions of a &quot;decidable subset&quot; and &quot;recursively enumerable subset&quot; are basic ones for classical mathematics and classical logic. Thus the question of a suitable extension of them to fuzzy set theory is a crucial one. The first proposal in such a direction was made by E. S. Santos by the notions of &quot;fuzzy Turing machine&quot;, &quot;Markov normal fuzzy algorithm&quot; and &quot;fuzzy program&quot; (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine. Then they proposed the following definitions. Denote by &quot;Ü&quot; the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset &quot;s&quot; : &quot;S&quot; formula_5 [0,1] of a set &quot;S&quot; is recursively enumerable if a recursive map &quot;h&quot; : &quot;S&quot;×N formula_5&quot;Ü&quot; exists such that, for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, the function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) is increasing with respect to &quot;n&quot; and &quot;s&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = lim &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;n&quot;).
We say that &quot;s&quot; is &quot;decidable&quot; if both &quot;s&quot; and its complement –&quot;s&quot; are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).
The proposed definitions are well related to fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).

Any &quot;axiomatizable&quot; fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the fuzzy set of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.

It is an open question to give support for a &quot;Church thesis&quot; for fuzzy mathematics, the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. In order to solve this, an extension of the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy Turing machine are necessary. Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of Gödel&#x27;s theorems to fuzzy logic.

==Compared to other logics==

=== Probability ===
Fuzzy logic and probability address different forms of uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can represent degrees of certain kinds of subjective belief, fuzzy set theory uses the concept of fuzzy set membership, i.e., how much an observation is within a vaguely defined set, and probability theory uses the concept of subjective probability, i.e., frequency of occurrence or likelihood of some event or condition . The concept of fuzzy sets was developed in the mid-twentieth century at Berkeley as a response to the lack of a probability theory for jointly modelling uncertainty and vagueness.

Bart Kosko claims in Fuzziness vs. Probability that probability theory is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as questions of degrees of belief in mutually-exclusive set membership in probability theory can be represented as certain cases of non-mutually-exclusive graded membership in fuzzy theory. In that context, he also derives Bayes&#x27; theorem from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. Lotfi A. Zadeh argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy probability and also generalized it to possibility theory.

More generally, fuzzy logic is one of many different extensions to classical logic intended to deal with issues of uncertainty outside of the scope of classical logic, the inapplicability of probability theory in many domains, and the paradoxes of Dempster–Shafer theory.

=== Ecorithms ===
Computational theorist Leslie Valiant uses the term &quot;ecorithms&quot; to describe how many less exact systems and techniques like fuzzy logic (and &quot;less robust&quot; logic) can be applied to learning algorithms. Valiant essentially redefines machine learning as evolutionary. In general use, ecorithms are algorithms that learn from their more complex environments (hence &quot;eco-&quot;) to generalize, approximate and simplify solution logic. Like fuzzy logic, they are methods used to overcome continuous variables or systems too complex to completely enumerate or understand discretely or exactly. Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and feed forward, basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.

===Gödel G∞ logic===
Another logical system where truth values are real numbers between 0 and 1 and where AND &amp; OR operators are replaced with MIN and MAX is Gödel&#x27;s G∞ logic. This logic has many similarities with fuzzy logic but defines negation differently and has an internal implication. Negation formula_7 and implication formula_8 are defined as follows:

: formula_9

which turns the resulting logical system into a model for intuitionistic logic, making it particularly well-behaved among all possible choices of logical systems with real numbers between 0 and 1 as truth values. In this case, implication may be interpreted as &quot;x is less true than y&quot; and negation as &quot;x is less true than 0&quot; or &quot;x is strictly false&quot;, and for any formula_10 and formula_11, we have that formula_12. In particular, in Gödel logic negation is no longer an involution and double negation maps any nonzero value to 1.

== Compensatory fuzzy logic ==

Compensatory fuzzy logic (CFL) is a branch of fuzzy logic with modified rules for conjunction and disjunction. When the truth value of one component of a conjunction or disjunction is increased or decreased, the other component is decreased or increased to compensate. This increase or decrease in truth value may be offset by the increase or decrease in another component. An offset may be blocked when certain thresholds are met. Proponents claim that CFL allows for better computational semantic behaviors and mimic natural language.

According to Jesús Cejas Montero (2011) The Compensatory fuzzy logic consists of four continuous operators: conjunction (c); disjunction (d); fuzzy strict order (or); and negation (n). The conjunction is the geometric mean and its dual as conjunctive and disjunctive operators.

== Markup language standardization ==

The IEEE 1855, the IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016, is about a specification language named Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) developed by the IEEE Standards Association. FML allows modelling a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. FML is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The designers of fuzzy systems with FML have a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. IEEE STANDARD 1855–2016 uses the W3C XML Schema definition language to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.

Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the result of their work in a form compatible with the Fuzzy Control Language (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of IEC 61131.

<doc id="49181" wikidata="Q155704" url="?curid=49181" title="588 Achilles">
<text>588 Achilles is a large Jupiter trojan asteroid of the Greek camp. Achilles was the first Jupiter trojan to be discovered, and was discovered by Max Wolf at the Heidelberg Observatory in 1906. Wolf named the minor planet after the legendary hero Achilles from Greek mythology. The dark D-type asteroid measures approximately in diameter which makes it one of the 10 largest Jupiter trojans. It has a rotation period of 7.3 hours and possibly a spherical shape.

== Discovery ==

Achilles was discovered on 22 February 1906, by the German astronomer Max Wolf at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southern Germany. It was the first discovery of a Jupiter trojan, although had been observed as two years previously. This body, however, remained unconfirmed as the observation period was not long enough to calculate an orbit. August Kopff, a colleague of Wolf at Heidelberg, then discovered 617 Patroclus eight months after Achilles, and, in early 1907, he discovered the largest of all Jupiter trojans, 624 Hektor.

== Orbit and classification ==
Achilles orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.4–6.0 AU in the Lagrangian point of the Sun–Jupiter System once every 11 years and 11 months (4,343 days; semi-major axis of 5.21 AU). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 10 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic.

Achilles is the first known example of the stable solution of the three-body problem worked out by French mathematician Joseph Lagrange in 1772, after whom the minor planet 1006 Lagrangea is named. After the discovery of other asteroids with similar orbital characteristics, which were also named after heroes from the Trojan War &quot;(see below)&quot;, the term &quot;Trojan asteroids&quot; or &quot;Jupiter trojans&quot; became commonly used. In addition, a rule was established that the point was the &quot;Greek camp&quot;, whereas the point was the &quot;Trojan camp&quot;, though not before each camp had acquired a &quot;spy&quot; (Hektor in the Greek camp and Patroclus in the Trojan camp).

== Physical characteristics ==


=== Spectral type ===
In the Tholen taxonomic scheme, Achilles is classified as a D-type asteroid with an unusual spectrum (DU). Its V–I color index of 0.94 is typical for most larger Jupiter trojans &quot;(see table below)&quot;.

=== Photometry ===

Achilles&#x27;s rotation period of 7.3 hours is somewhat shorter than that of most other large Jupiter trojans but close to that of 911 Agamemnon, 3451 Mentor and 3317 Paris, which are similar in size &quot;(see table below)&quot;. Its low brightness amplitude is indicative of a rather spherical shape. From July 2007 until September 2008, coordinated photometric observations were carried out by astronomers at Simeiz (Crimea), Rozhen (Bulgaria), Maidanak (Uzbekistan) and Kharkiv (Ukraine) observatories. Analysis of the obtained lightcurves determined a period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.02–0.11 magnitude (). Alternative period determinations by Cláudia Angeli (7.0 h), Robert Stephens (7.312 h), Stefano Mottola (7.32 h) and Vincenzo Zappalà (12 h) are mostly in good agreement ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the body&#x27;s surface has a very low albedo in the range of 0.0328 to 0.043, making its absolute magnitude of approximately 8.57 correspond to a diameter of 130.1 to 135.5 kilometers.

Achilles is the 6th largest Jupiter trojan according to IRAS and Akari, and the 4th largest based on NEOWISE data:
== Naming ==

This minor planet&#x27;s name was suggested by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa. It was named after Achilles, the legendary hero from Greek mythology and central figure in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; which tells the accounts of the Trojan War &quot;(also see 5700 Homerus and 6604 Ilias)&quot;. As an infant, Achilles was plunged in the River Styx by his mother Thetis &quot;(also see 17 Thetis)&quot;, thus rendering his body invulnerable excepting the heel by which he was held. He slew Hector (&quot;see also 624 Hektor&quot;), the greatest Trojan warrior. He was eventually killed by an arrow in the heel by Paris (&quot;see 3317 Paris&quot;).

<doc id="49184" wikidata="Q15975162" url="?curid=49184" title="How the Self Controls Its Brain">
<text>How the Self Controls Its Brain is a book by Sir John Eccles, proposing a theory of philosophical dualism, and offering a justification of how there can be mind-brain action without violating the principle of the conservation of energy. The model was developed jointly with the nuclear physicist Friedrich Beck in the period 1991–1992.

Eccles called the fundamental neural units of the cerebral cortex &quot;dendrons&quot;, which are cylindrical bundles of neurons arranged vertically in the six outer layers or laminae of the cortex, each cylinder being about 60 micrometres in diameter. Eccles proposed that each of the 40 million dendrons is linked with a mental unit, or &quot;psychon&quot;, representing a unitary conscious experience. In willed actions and thought, psychons act on dendrons and, for a moment, increase the probability of the firing of selected neurons through quantum tunneling effect in synaptic exocytosis, while in perception the reverse process takes place.

Previous mention of the &quot;psychon&quot;

The earliest prior use of the word &quot;psychon&quot; with a similar meaning of an &quot;element of consciousness&quot; is in the book &quot;Concerning Fluctuating and Inaudible Sounds&quot; by K. Dunlap in 1908.
The most popular prior use is in Robert Heinlein&#x27;s short story Gulf, wherein a character refers to the fastest speed of thought possible as &quot;one psychon per chronon&quot;.

<text>Trofim Denisovich Lysenko (; , ; 20 November 1976) was a Soviet agronomist and scientist. He was a proponent of Lamarckism, and rejected Mendelian genetics in favour of his own idiosyncratic, pseudoscientific ideas later termed Lysenkoism.

In 1940, Lysenko became director of the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and he used his political influence and power to suppress dissenting opinions and discredit, marginalize, and imprison his critics, elevating his anti-Mendelian theories to state-sanctioned doctrine.

Soviet scientists who refused to renounce genetics were dismissed from their posts and left destitute. Hundreds if not thousands of others were imprisoned. Several were sentenced to death as enemies of the state, including the botanist Nikolai Vavilov, whose sentence was commuted to prison. Lysenko&#x27;s ideas and practices contributed to the famines that killed millions of Soviet people; the adoption of his methods from 1958 in the People&#x27;s Republic of China had similarly calamitous results, contributing to the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 to 1961.

==Early life and study==
The son of Denis Nikanorovich and Oksana Fominichna Lysenko, Trofim Lysenko was born into a peasant family of Ukrainian ethnicity in the village of Karlovka, Poltava Governorate (present-day Poltava Oblast, Ukraine) on 29 September 1898. The family later welcomed two sons and a daughter.

Lysenko learned to read and write only at the age of 13. In 1913, after graduating from a two-year rural school, he entered the lower school of horticulture in Poltava. In 1917, he entered and in 1921 he graduated from the secondary school of horticulture in Uman (now the ).

Lysenko&#x27;s period of study in Uman coincided with the First World War and the Russian Civil War: the city was captured by Austro-Hungarian troops, then by the Central Ukrainian Rada. In February 1918, soviet power was proclaimed in Uman, after which until 1920 the city periodically passed into the hands of the red and white armies.

In 1922, Lysenko entered the Kiev Agricultural Institute (now the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine). During his studies, he worked at the Belotserkovsk experimental station as a garden plant breeder. In 1923, he published his first scientific works: &quot;Techniques and methods of tomato selection at the Belotserkovskaya selection station&quot; and &quot;Grafting of sugar beets.&quot; Lysenko graduated from the institute with a degree in agronomy in 1925.

==Academic career==
===Work in Azerbaijan===
In October 1925, Lysenko was sent to Azerbaijan, to a breeding station in the city of Ganja. The Ganja breeding station was part of the staff of the All-Union Institute of Applied Botany and New Crops (now the Institute of Plant Industry), created in 1925, which was headed by Nikolai Vavilov. The director of the station at that time was Nikolai Derevitsky, a specialist in mathematical statistics in agronomy. Derevitsky set Lysenko the task of introducing legume crops (lupine, clover, peavine, vetch) into Azerbaijan, which could solve the problem of starvation of livestock in early spring, as well as increasing soil fertility when plowing these crops in the spring. Vavilov had done experiments on converting winter wheat into spring wheat. It was Vavilov who initially supported Lysenko and encouraged him in his work. In the article, &quot;Pravda&quot; correspondent Vitaly Fedorovich described his first impression of the meeting with Lysenko:
Lysenko had a difficult time trying to grow various crops (such as peas and wheat) through the harsh winters. However, when he announced success, he was praised in the Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; for his claims to have discovered a method to fertilize fields without using fertilizers or minerals, and to have shown that a winter crop of peas could be grown in Azerbaijan, &quot;turning the barren fields of the Transcaucasus green in winter, so that cattle will not perish from poor feeding, and the peasant Turk will live through the winter without trembling for tomorrow.&quot;

Soon, Lysenko married one of the interns who trained under him, Alexandra Baskova. During the same period, breeder , a future academic and supporter of Lysenko, began working with Lysenko.
Lysenko worked with different wheat crops to try to convert them to grow in different seasons. Another area Lysenko found himself interested in was the effect of heat on plant growth. He believed that every plant needed a determinate amount of heat throughout its lifetime. He attempted to correlate the time and the amount of heat required by a particular plant to go through various phases of development. To get his data he looked at the amount of growth, how many days went by, and the temperature on those days, instead of measuring any actual heat. In trying to determine the effects, he was making mistakes in statistical analysis of data. He was confronted by Nikolai Maximov, who was an expert on thermal plant development. Lysenko did not take well to this or any criticism. After this encounter, Lysenko boldly claimed that mathematics had no place in biology.

His experimental research in improved crop yields earned him the support of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, especially following the famine and loss of productivity resulting from crop failures and forced collectivization in several regions of the Soviet Union in the early 1930s.

Lysenko considered how he might use his work to convert winter wheat into spring wheat. In 1927, Lysenko embarked on the research that would lead to his 1928 paper on vernalization, which drew wide attention because of its potential practical implications for Soviet agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter-wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Lysenko coined the term &quot;Jarovization&quot; (яровизация) to describe this chilling process, which he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals. (Because spring cereals are called &quot;Jarovoe&quot; in Russian – from &quot;jarovój&quot;, an archaic adjective meaning spring, especially in relation to crops). However, this method had already been known by farmers since the 1800s, and had been discussed in detail by Gustav Gassner in 1918. Lysenko himself translated Jarovization as &quot;vernalization&quot; (from the Latin &quot;vernum&quot; meaning Spring). Lysenko&#x27;s claims for increased yields were based on plantings over a few hectares, and he believed that the vernalized transformation could be inherited, that the offspring of a vernalized plant would themselves possess the capabilities of the generation that preceded itthat it too would be able to withstand harsh winters or imperfect weather conditions.

===Work in Odessa===
In October 1929, Lysenko was invited by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Ukraine to Odessa, to the newly formed (later the All-Union Breeding and Genetics Institute, or VSGI) where he headed the laboratory for vernalization of plants. People&#x27;s Commissar of Agriculture of the Ukrainian SSR Alexander Schlichter reacted to Lysenko&#x27;s ideas with enthusiasm and actively supported him. On 17 April 1936, he was appointed director of the VSGI.

In September 1931, the All-Ukrainian Breeding Conference adopted a resolution on a report by Lysenko, in which he noted the theoretical and practical significance of his work on vernalization. In October of the same year, a similar resolution was adopted by the All-Union Conference on Combating Drought. In 1933, he began experiments on summer planting potatoes in the south. In 1934, he was elected a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. In the same year, Ivan Michurin, speaking about the results of his scientific activities in his book &quot;Results of Sixty Years of Work&quot;, mentioned Lysenko’s activities in studying the photoperiodism of field cereals. On 30 December 1935, Lysenko was awarded the Order of Lenin and elected a full member of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

===After Odessa and first confrontation with geneticists===
In August 1936, at a visiting session of the grain section of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Omsk, Lysenko made a report &quot;On intravarietal crossing of self-pollinating plants,&quot; in which he entered into a discussion with Vavilov and other geneticists. In this discussion, Lysenko denied both the general theoretical views of his opponents and their practical implementation in breeding work. In particular, Lysenko denied the method of inbreeding field crops.

The discussion continued on 23 December 1936 at the 4th session of the All-Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, where Lysenko made a report &quot;On two directions in genetics&quot; (published in the collection &quot;Agrobiology&quot; by Lysenko). Lysenko, together with Isaak Prezent, referred to the opinion of Charles Darwin and Kliment Timiryazev on the issue of degeneration of self-pollinating plants and the usefulness of intra-varietal cross-pollination of plants.

In the spring of 1937, the journal &quot;Yarovizatsiya&quot;, founded and edited by Lysenko, published a speech by the head of the agricultural department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, Yakov Yakovlev (No. 2), where Vavilov&#x27;s theory of homological series of plant variability and the chromosomal theory of heredity were sharply criticized. The scientific discussion on genetics in the Soviet Union was transformed into a political struggle against &quot;the enemies of the people.&quot; Issue 3 of &quot;Yarovizatsiya&quot; published an article by Prezent, in which he accused geneticists of the classical school of supporting the Trotskyist-Bukharinist opposition, and an article by that accused Vavilov of being a reactionary saboteur. The 7th International Genetic Congress in Moscow in 1937 was canceled and instead took place in 1939 in Edinburgh.

On 11 January 1938, the newspaper &quot;Sotszemledeliye&quot; published an article titled “Improve the Academy of Agricultural Sciences: Ruthlessly uproot enemies and their rumps from scientific institutions,” where Vavilov, Mikhail Zavadovsky, and were indicated as accomplices of the enemies of the people.

In 1938, Lysenko became president of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. At the beginning of 1939, &quot;Yarovizatsiya&quot; published an article by Prezent &quot;On pseudoscientific theories and genetics&quot;, in which Prezent compared the works of Vavilov with those of the anti-Marxist philosopher Eugen Dühring. In the same year, the journal &quot;Pod znamenem marksizma&quot; held a discussion on genetics. At the conclusion of this discussion, its organizer, philosopher Mark Mitin, sharply criticized the activities of Vavilov.

In 1939, According to official data, by changing the agricultural technology of millet, Lysenko increased the yield of millet from 2-3 to 15 centners per hectare. On 13 December 1942, at a session of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lysenko argued that &quot;in 1940, millet on millions of hectares had already become the highest-yielding grain crop&quot; and called for &quot;a turn towards millet.&quot; Lysenko proposed a system of spring cultivation for grain, which made it possible to clear the soil of weeds before sowing, and then sow with vernalized seeds.

In mid-1940, by Lysenko&#x27;s order, NKVD employee S. N. Shundenko was appointed deputy director of the All-Union Research Institute of Plant Industry, despite the categorical protest of Vavilov, who wrote denunciations of the institute&#x27;s workers. In August 1940, Vavilov was arrested; following this, Vavilov&#x27;s employees and friends, Georgii Karpechenko, Grigory Levitsky, , and , were arrested and died in custody.

=== Tree planting ===
As part of Stalin&#x27;s Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature, Lysenko was involved in advising tree planting. He suggested that planting of trees need to be done in &quot;nests&quot;. He claimed that when trees were planted at high densities their survival improved because they fought together against weeds and pooled their energy to benefit one shoot while sacrificing others in the nest. To encourage oak seedlings to fight collectively he had a central hole and found holes around them.

===World War II===
During World War II, Lysenko, along with many biologists, was evacuated to Omsk, where he continued to work on agricultural technology for grain crops and potatoes. From 1942, Lysenko was a member of the Extraordinary State Commission for the Establishment and Investigation of the Atrocities of the German Fascist Invaders.

On 22 March 1943, Lysenko received the Stalin Prize of the first degree &quot;for the scientific development and introduction into agriculture of a method of planting potatoes with the tops of food tubers.&quot; On 3 June 1943, at a ceremonial meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kliment Timiryazev, Lysenko made a report: &quot;K. A. Timiryazev and the tasks of our agrobiology.&quot; In 1943, the first edition of Lysenko&#x27;s collection was published, titled &quot;Agrobiology: Work on genetics, breeding and seed production&quot;.

On 10 June 1945, Lysenko was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor with the Order of Lenin, &quot;for outstanding services in the development of agricultural science and increasing the productivity of agricultural crops, especially potatoes and millet.&quot; On 10 September 1945, Lysenko was awarded the Order of Lenin &quot;for the successful completion of the government&#x27;s task in difficult war conditions to provide the front and the country’s population with food, and industry with agricultural raw materials.&quot;

===Post-war===
In 1946, Lysenko wrote an article titled &quot;Genetics&quot; for the 3rd edition of the Agricultural Encyclopedia. The article extensive quoted and criticized Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s article &quot;Heredity,&quot; published in the United States in 1945 in the American Encyclopedia, and describes features of &quot;Michurinist genetics.&quot; The article was included in the &quot;Agrobiology&quot; collection. A similar article was published in the second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

====August 1948 session of VASKhNIL====

On 10 April 1948, Yuri Zhdanov, who considered the complaints of scientists against Lysenko, made a report at the Polytechnic Museum at a seminar of regional party committee lecturers on the topic &quot;Controversial issues of modern Darwinism.&quot; Lysenko himself listened to the Zhdanov&#x27;s critical speech over a loudspeaker in another room, since he was denied a ticket to the report.

From 31 July to 7 August 1948, a Session of the All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences (VASKhNIL) took place, at which most of the speakers supported Lysenko’s biological views and pointed to the &quot;practical successes&quot; of specialists of the &quot;Michurinist movement.&quot;

At the session, Lysenko presented erroneous views on genetics (denial of Mendel&#x27;s law of segregation, denial of immutable &quot;genes&quot;), as well as politicized statements addressed to opponents (for example, Morgan&#x27;s genetics was credited with justifying racism, eugenics, and serving the interests of the militaristic bourgeois class).

==Politics==
During the early and mid twentieth century the Soviet Union went through war and revolution. Political oppression caused tension within the state but also promoted the flourishing of science: this was possible due to the flow of resources and demand for results. Lysenko aimed to manipulate various plants such as wheat and peas to increase their production, quality, and quantity, while impressing political officials with his success in motivating peasants to return to farming.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s collectivist reforms forced the confiscation of agricultural landholdings from peasant farmers and heavily damaged the country&#x27;s overall food production, and the dispossessed peasant farmers posed new problems for the regime. Many had abandoned the farms altogether; many more waged resistance to collectivization by poor work quality and pilfering. The dislocated and disenchanted peasant farmers were a major political concern to the USSR&#x27;s leadership. Lysenko became prominent during this period by advocating radical but unproven agricultural methods, and also promising that the new methods provided wider opportunities for year-round work in agriculture. He proved himself very useful to the Soviet leadership by reengaging peasants to return to work, helping to secure from them a personal stake in the overall success of the Soviet revolutionary experiment.
Lysenko&#x27;s success at encouraging farmers to return to working their lands impressed Stalin, who also approved of Lysenko&#x27;s peasant background, as Stalin claimed to stand with the proletariat. By the late 1920s, the USSR&#x27;s leaders had given their support to Lysenko. This support was a consequence, in part, of policies put in place by the Communist Party to rapidly promote members of the proletariat into leadership positions in agriculture, science and industry. Party officials were looking for promising candidates with backgrounds similar to Lysenko&#x27;s: born of a peasant family, lacking formal academic training or affiliations to the academic community. Due to his close partnership with Stalin, Lysenko acquired an influence over genetics in the Soviet Union during the early and mid-20th century. Lysenko eventually became the director of Genetics for the Academy of Sciences in 1940, which gave him even more control over genetics. He remained in the position for more than two decades, throughout the reigns of Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev, until he was relieved of his duties in 1965.

Outside the Soviet Union, scientists spoke critically: British biologist S. C. Harland lamented that Lysenko was &quot;completely ignorant of the elementary principles of genetics and plant physiology&quot; (Bertram Wolfe, 2017). Criticism from foreigners did not sit well with Lysenko, who loathed Western &quot;bourgeois&quot; scientists and denounced them as tools of imperialist oppressors. He especially detested the American-born practice of studying fruit flies, the workhorse of modern genetics. He called such geneticists &quot;fly lovers and people haters&quot;.

==Repression of biologists==
In the spring of 1937, shortly after Stalin&#x27;s report at the March plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks &quot;On the shortcomings of party work and measures to eliminate Trotskyists and other double-dealers,&quot; Lysenko and his supporters, including Isaak Prezent and Alexander Kohl, began their campaign against geneticists, accusing them of colluding with the anti-Stalinist opposition and reactionary sabotage.

During the 1930s and &#x27;40s, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences (VASKhNIL) served as a floor for debate between Lysenkoists and geneticists. On 7 August 1948, at the end of a week-long session organized by Lysenko and approved by Stalin, the VASKhNIL announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as &quot;the only correct theory.&quot; Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Prezent accused the geneticists, whom Lysenko and supporters termed &quot;Weismannists-Mendelists-Morganists&quot;, of ideological unreliability. At the 1948 VASKhNIL session, Prezent said:
Several geneticists who refused to denounce the theory were executed (including Izrail Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. One prominent critic of Lysenko, the famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943. Before the 1930s, the Soviet Union had arguably the best genetics community. According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; writer Sam Kean, &quot;Lysenko gutted it, and by some accounts, set Russian biology and agronomy back a half-century&quot;. Lysenko&#x27;s work was eventually recognized as fraudulent by some, &quot;but not before he had wrecked the lives of many and destroyed the reputation of Russian biology&quot; according to scientist Peter Gluckman.

==Consequences of Lysenko&#x27;s views==
Lysenko forced farmers to plant seeds very close together since, according to his &quot;law of the life of species&quot;, plants from the same &quot;class&quot; never compete with one another. Lysenko played an active role in the famines that killed millions of Soviet people and his practices prolonged and exacerbated the food shortages. The People&#x27;s Republic of China under Mao Zedong adopted his methods starting in 1958, with calamitous results, contributing to the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 to 1962, in which some 15–55 million people died.

==After Stalin==
In 1955, an attempt was made to disempower Lysenko, with a letter signed by more than three hundred scientists, the so-called &quot;Letter of three hundred&quot;, which was sent to Nikita Khrushchev. It led to Lysenko resigning temporarily but he returned to power through Khruschev&#x27;s efforts. Though Lysenko remained at his post in the Institute of Genetics until 1965, his influence on Soviet agricultural practice had declined after the death of Stalin in 1953. Lysenko retained his position, with the support of the new leader Nikita Khrushchev. However, mainstream scientists re-emerged and found new willingness within Soviet government leadership to tolerate criticism of Lysenko, the first opportunity since the late 1920s. In 1962, three of the most prominent Soviet physicists, Yakov Zeldovich, Vitaly Ginzburg, and Pyotr Kapitsa, presented a case against Lysenko, proclaiming his work as pseudoscience. They also denounced Lysenko&#x27;s application of political power to silence opposition and eliminate his opponents within the scientific community. These denunciations occurred during a period of structural upheaval in Soviet government, during which the major institutions were purged of the strictly ideological and political machinations which had controlled the work of the Soviet Union&#x27;s scientific community for several decades under Stalin.

In 1964, physicist Andrei Sakharov spoke out against Lysenko in the General Assembly of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR:

The Soviet press was soon filled with anti-Lysenkoite articles and appeals for the restoration of scientific methods to all fields of biology and agricultural science. In 1965, Lysenko was removed from his post as director of the Institute of Genetics at the Academy of Sciences and restricted to an experimental farm in Moscow&#x27;s Lenin Hills (the Institute itself was soon dissolved). After Khrushchev&#x27;s dismissal in 1964, the president of the Academy of Sciences declared that Lysenko&#x27;s immunity to criticism had officially ended. An expert commission was sent to investigate records kept at Lysenko&#x27;s experimental farm. His secretive methods and ideas were revealed. A few months later, a devastating critique of Lysenko was made public. Consequently, Lysenko was immediately disgraced in the Soviet Union.
After Lysenko&#x27;s monopoly on biology and agronomy had ended, it took many years for these sciences to recover in Russia. Lysenko died in Moscow in 1976, and was ultimately interred in the Kuntsevo Cemetery, although the Soviet government refused to announce Lysenko&#x27;s death for two days after the event and gave his passing only a small note in &quot;Izvestia&quot;.

==Lysenko&#x27;s theories==

Lysenko rejected Mendelian genetic inheritance theory in favour of his own logic, which he termed &quot;Michurinist genetics&quot;. He believed Gregor Mendel&#x27;s theory to be too reactionary or idealist. Lysenko&#x27;s ideas were a mixture of his own, those of Russian agronomist Ivan Michurin, and of other Soviet scientists. Through this mixture of ideas, Lysenko founded the &quot;Michurinist doctrine&quot;. The core ideas are that body cells (the soma) determine the quality of an organism&#x27;s offspring; every part of the body contributes to the germ cells, in the manner of Darwin&#x27;s theory of pangenesis, though Lysenko denied any such connection.

These ideas were not directly derived from established biological theories such as Mendelian genetics, Lamarckism or Darwinism. He shaped his genetic concepts to support the simple practical purpose of breeding and improving crops. His ideas were also shaped to disprove other claims made by his fellow geneticists. His ideas and genetic claims later began to be termed &quot;Lysenkoism&quot;. He claimed that his ideas were not associated with Lamarckism, but there are similarities between the two ideas, such as a belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Some of Lysenko&#x27;s ideas can also seem to be vitalistic. He claimed that plants are self-sacrificing—they do not die due to a lack of sunlight or moisture but so that healthy ones may live and when they die they deposit themselves over the growing roots to help the new generation survive.

Lysenko believed that in one generation of a hybridized crop, the desired individual could be selected, mated again and continue to produce the same desired product, not worrying about separation/segregation in future breeds. For that to work, he had to assume that after a lifetime of developing (acquiring) the best set of traits to survive, those were passed down to the next generation. That assumption disregarded the potential for variation or mutation.

Lysenko did not believe in genes and only spoke about them to say that they did not exist. He instead believed that any body, once alive, obtained heredity. That meant that the entirety of the body was able to pass on the hereditary information of that organism, and was not entirely dependent on a special element such as DNA or genes. That puzzled biologists at that time because it went against established notions of heredity and inheritance. It also contradicted the Mendelian principles that most biologists had been using to base their ideas on. Most scientists believed that Lysenko&#x27;s ideas were not credible, because they did not truly explain the mechanisms of inheritance. Biologists now consider that his beliefs are pseudo-scientific, with little relationship to genetics.

Lysenko argued that there is not only competition, but also mutual assistance among individuals within a species, and that mutual assistance also exists between different species.

According to Lysenko,
Another of Lysenko&#x27;s theories was that obtaining more milk from cows did not depend on their genetics but on how they were treated. The better they were handled and taken care of, the more milk would be obtained; Lysenko and his followers were well known for taking very good care of their livestock. Lysenko claimed that the cuckoo was born when young birds such as warblers were fed hairy caterpillars by the parent (rather than host) birds; this claim failed to recognise that the cuckoos he described were brood parasites. Lysenkoites believed that fertilization was not random, but that there was specific selection of the best mate. For reasons like these, Lysenkoism can be viewed as pseudo-scientific.

After World War II ended, Lysenko took an interest in the works of Olga Lepeshinskaya, an older feldsher and biologist, who claimed to be able to create cells from egg yolk and non-cellular matter. Lepeshinskaya recognized common ground between her ideas and Lysenko&#x27;s. By combining both of their ideas it was possible to proclaim that cells could grow from non-cellular material and that the predicted ratios of Mendelian genetics and meiosis were incorrect, thus undermining the basis of modern cytology, as well as genetics.

===&quot;The influence of the thermal factor on the duration of plant development phases&quot;===
In Ganja, Lysenko began work on studying the growing season of agricultural plants (cotton, wheat, rye, oats, and barley). For two years, Lysenko experimented with the timing of sowing grain, cotton and other plants, sowing plants at intervals of 10 days. Based on the results of these studies, in 1928, he published a large work, &quot;The influence of the thermal factor on the duration of plant development phases.&quot; Of the 169 pages of the work, 110 contained tables with primary data. The mathematical processing of the data was carried out by Nikolai Derevitsky and I. Yu. Staroselsky.

In this work, Lysenko came to the conclusion that each phase of plants (&quot;the following phases were recorded: sowing-watering, germination, tillering, booting, heading, flowering, wax ripeness and harvesting time&quot;) begins its development &quot;at a strictly defined intensity of thermal energy, that is, at a certain, always constant degree Celsius, and requires a certain amount of degree days.&quot; Carrying out mathematical processing of the initial data using the least squares method, Lysenko determined the values of the constants A and B - &quot;the starting point at which processes begin&quot; and &quot;the sum of degrees required to complete the phase.&quot;

In 1927, the main provisions of this work were reported by Lysenko at the &quot;congress convened by the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Agriculture of the Azerbaijan SSR at the Ganja station,&quot; and then, in December 1928, at the All-Union Meeting of Sugar Trust in Kiev. In this book, Lysenko thrice cited the work of , dedicated to the same issues.

===Vernalization===

The issue of the effect of low temperatures on plant development was touched upon by such famous physiologists as Georg Klebs and Gustav Gassner. For example, Gassner, based on his experiments, established that if sprouted seeds of winter crops are exposed to low temperatures, then the plants grown from them during spring sowing will split.

Working at the Ganja breeding station, Lysenko was also able to accelerate the development of plants. Based on his experiments, he developed a technique for germinating seeds before sowing at low positive temperatures, which he termed vernalization.

This technique was supported by a number of prominent scientists in the early 1930s. For example, Nikolai Vavilov saw the main advantage of vernalization in the possible simplification of breeding work, as well as in the ability to control the length of the growing season of plants. In addition, he believed that vernalization could help preserve winter crops from freezing during harsh winters. Vavilov wrote:
The main reason Vavilov initially supported Lysenko&#x27;s work on vernalization was his interest in the potential use of vernalization as a means of synchronizing the flowering of various plant species in the Institute of Plant Industry collection, since Vavilov&#x27;s team had encountered problems in cross-species experiments that required such synchronization. Vavilov, however, eventually stopped supporting the use of vernalization because the method did not produce the expected results.

Crops with vernalized seeds increased on USSR farms every year. In particular, in 1935, experimental vernalized crops of spring grain were carried out by more than 40,000 collective and state farms on an area of 2.1 million hectares; in 1937, 8.9 million hectares.

However, the mass introduction of vernalization into USSR agriculture ended in failure. Critics of vernalization explained this failure, among other things, by the lack of experimental data on varieties and regions of the Soviet Union. To collect data, questionnaires were sent to collective and state farms. The questionnaire method made it possible to fabricate data, suppress negative results, and was convenient for promoting vernalization. The data obtained by Lysenko and his supporters was published mainly in the journal &quot;Byulleten yarovizatsii&quot;, published under the editorship of Lysenko, or in the Soviet press. However, these publications were not published in any independent scientific journals.

The agricultural method of vernalization has been criticized by experts for reasons such as the possibility of damage to seeds during the process of soaking, germination and sowing, the labor intensity of this operation, and the greater vulnerability of vernalized plants to smut. Critics of vernalization in the 1930s included , S. Levitsky (Poland), , and .

Vernalization of grain crops during World War II (spring of 1942-1945) and the post-war period did not receive widespread industrial use. &quot;Pravda&quot;, in an editorial dated 14 December 1958, argued that after the massive introduction of technology on Soviet farms, which made it possible to sow in a shorter time, vernalization of seeds &quot;was not always necessary.&quot; However, vernalization, according to the newspaper, continued to produce &quot;remarkable results&quot; in the cultivation of millet and potatoes.

===Theory of stage development of plants===
To substantiate his developments in the field of plant growing, Lysenko put forward a theory of staged development of plants. The essence of the theory was that higher plants must go through several stages during their lives before producing seeds. To move to the next stage, certain specific conditions are required.

In 1935, Lysenko wrote:
Based on this theory, Lysenko proposed vernalization of winter and spring grains, potatoes and other crops.

The provisions of Lysenko&#x27;s theory on the staged development of plants, according to critics, were to some extent consistent with the level of knowledge of the 1930s, but not all of them were confirmed experimentally. The shortcomings of the theory of stage development were pointed out by Mikhail Chailakhyan among others. In particular, critics argued that even without preliminary vernalization, various plant varieties have a photoperiodic reaction and are delayed in development when the length of daylight hours is reduced.

===Summer potato planting===
In the southern regions of the Soviet Union, vegetatively propagated potatoes gradually produced increasingly smaller tubers, which, in addition, were subject to severe rotting. To combat this, Lysenko proposed summer planting of potatoes, arguing that the &quot;deterioration of the breed&quot; of potatoes can be stopped by planting them not in warm, but in cool soil, at the end of summer.

On 11 January 1941, in a lecture given at the Polytechnic Museum, Lysenko stated:
However, as with vernalization, data was collected using questionnaires, making the results easy to falsify, and any scientific data obtained was never published. When summer planting did not produce any positive results, Lysenko suggested burying the harvested potatoes in trenches, spreading a layer of soil over a layer of potatoes, arguing that this would reduce losses from rotting tubers. However, burying tubers in trenches led to huge crop losses, as the rotting of the tubers only intensified.

Lysenko ignored the real reason for the degeneration of potato plantings - potato viruses (a particularly large role in the degeneration is played by the potato leafroll virus - PLRV, potato virus X - PVX, and potato virus Y - PVY), replacing it with abstract ideas about the &quot;deterioration of the potato breed&quot;. Ignoring the role of viruses in the degeneration of potato plantings and the subsequent ban on research into plant viruses led to a significant delay in the development of methods for detecting plant viruses in the Soviet Union, the spread of viruses not only in the south, but also in other regions of the Soviet Union, and, as a result, to a sharp drop in potato yields.

===Sowing over stover===
Soviet literature of the 1940s-50s and Lysenko&#x27;s supporters credit him with a number of achievements, including the idea of sowing over stover to protect winter crops from frost.

In 1943, Lysenko stated:
Sowing over stover, despite the advantages of the method (snow retention and better temperature conditions for wintering plant seeds in Siberian conditions), was criticized for clogging fields with weeds, since this excludes conventional agricultural technology - surface plowing, which provokes the germination of weeds, and subsequent spring plowing. In the absence of herbicides at that time, this led to clogging of fields.

, in a letter to Stalin dated 2 February 1948, noted the low grain yield in stubble crops:
Citing negative examples of stover crops, Tsitsin explained positive examples by the fact that &quot;in the harsh conditions of Siberia, there are occasionally exceptionally favorable years.&quot; In general, he considered work on stover unpromising, considering instead that work to increase the winter hardiness of grains with wheatgrass-wheat hybrids, distant hybridization with wild plants, and the use of fallows and semi-cultivated fallows were more justified.

===Inheritance of acquired traits===

Fundamental disagreements between Mendelian geneticists and Lysenko concerned the possibility of inheritance of traits that arise during the individual development of organisms, for example, under the influence of environmental factors or during grafting (vegetative hybridization). The idea that such characteristics cannot be inherited is associated with a distorted understanding of the principle formulated by August Weismann, according to which somatic cells cannot transmit information to germ cells. In fact, Weismann admitted the possibility of environmental influence on the substance of heredity.

Lysenko himself, at the August 1948 VASKhNIL session, argued the following regarding the inheritance of acquired characteristics:

==Legacy==
In the Soviet Union, streets named after Lysenko existed in several cities, such as Krasnoturyinsk.

Arkady and Boris Strugatsky cited Lysenko as the inspiration for the character of from their 1965 satirical science fantasy novel &quot;Monday Begins on Saturday&quot;:
Lysenko’s ideas have been attracting a renewed following in contemporary Russia, linked to a strain of Russian nationalism that views “Western” ideas and mainstream science with suspicion.

<doc id="49186" wikidata="Q80450" url="?curid=49186" title="Pope Anacletus">
<text>Pope Anacletus (died ), also known as Cletus, was the bishop of Rome, following Peter and Linus. Anacletus served between and his death, . Cletus was a Roman who, during his tenure as pope, ordained a number of priests and is traditionally credited with setting up about twenty-five parishes in Rome. Although the precise dates of his pontificate are uncertain, he &quot;...died a martyr, perhaps about 91&quot;. Cletus is mentioned in the Roman Canon of the mass; his feast day is April 26.

==Name and etymology==
The name &quot;Cletus&quot; () means &quot;one who has been called&quot;, and &quot;Anacletus&quot; () means &quot;one who has been called back&quot;. Also &quot;Anencletus&quot; () means &quot;unimpeachable&quot; or &quot;blameless&quot;.

The Roman Martyrology mentions the pope as &quot;Cletus&quot;. The &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; gives both forms as alternatives. Eusebius, Irenaeus, Augustine of Hippo and Optatus all suggest that both names refer to the same individual, while the Liberian Catalogue counts Cletus and Anacletus as separate popes.

==Papacy==
As with many of the early popes, little is known of Anacletus&#x27; pontificate. Earlier historical records are inconsistent in their usage of the names Cletus, Anacletus, and Anencletus and in the placement of these names in the order of succession. Generally, the order used by Irenaeus is used today, wherein Cletus and Anacletus refer to the same person, who succeeded Linus and preceded Clement. Traditionally, it was accepted that he reigned for twelve years, though the dates of that reign are questionable. The 2012 &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; states, &quot;For the first two centuries, the dates of the start and the end of the pontificate are uncertain&quot;, before placing Anacletus&#x27; pontificate from AD 80 to AD 92. These are the years given by Eusebius and Jerome. However, AD 76 to AD 88 are also frequently cited.

According to tradition, Pope Anacletus divided Rome into twenty-five parishes. One of the few surviving records concerning his papacy mentions him as having ordained an uncertain number of priests.

Pope Anacletus was martyred, ending his pontificate. A tomb ascribed to Anacletus is located near St Peter&#x27;s tomb in the Vatican Necropolis field P, underneath St Peters Basilica. This tomb is located with tombs ascribed to Linus, Evaristus, Telesphorus, Hyginus, Pius I, Anicetus, and Victor I. Little epigraphic evidence exists to support the ascription of these tombs to the early popes. His name (as Cletus) is included in the Roman Canon of the Mass.

==Veneration==

The Tridentine calendar reserved 26 April as the feast day of Saint Cletus, who the church honoured jointly with Pope Marcellinus, and 13 July for solely Saint Anacletus. In 1960, Pope John XXIII, while keeping the 26 April feast, which mentions the saint under the name given to him in the Canon of the Mass, removed 13 July as a feast day for Saint Anacletus. The 14 February 1961 Instruction of the Congregation for Rites on the application to local calendars of Pope John XXIII&#x27;s motu proprio &quot;Rubricarum instructum&quot; of 25 July 1960, decreed that &quot;the feast of &#x27;Saint Anacletus&#x27;, on whatever ground and in whatever grade it is celebrated, is transferred to 26 April, under its right name, &#x27;Saint Cletus&#x27;&quot;. Priests who celebrate Mass according to the General Roman Calendar of 1954 keep the July 13th feastday; but the feast has been removed from the General Roman Calendar since 1960, and as such is not kept even in the 1962 Missal. Although the day of his death is unknown, Saint Cletus continues to be listed in the Roman Martyrology among the saints of 26 April.

==Literature==
In the Divine Comedy, Dante mentions him as being placed in the &quot;Heaven of the Fixed Stars&quot; (Paradiso 27.41).

<text>George Westinghouse Jr. (October 6, 1846 – March 12, 1914) was a prolific American inventor, engineer, and entrepreneurial industrialist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is best known for his creation of the railway air brake and for being a pioneer in the development and use of alternating current (AC) electrical power distribution. During his career, he received 362 patents for his inventions and established 61 companies, many of which still exist today.

His invention of a train braking system using compressed air revolutionized the railroad industry around the world. He founded the Westinghouse Air Brake Company in 1869. He and his engineers also developed track-switching and signaling systems, which lead to the founding of the company Union Switch &amp; Signal in 1881. 

In the early 1880s, he developed inventions for the safe production, transmission, and use of natural gas. This sparked the creation of a whole new energy industry.

During this same period, Westinghouse recognized the potential of using alternating current (AC) for electric power distribution. In 1886, he founded the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Westinghouse&#x27;s electric business directly competed with Thomas Edison&#x27;s, who was promoting direct current (DC) electricity. Westinghouse Electric won the contract to showcase its AC system to illuminate the &quot;White City&quot; at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The company went on to install the world&#x27;s first large-scale, AC power generation plant at Niagara Falls, New York, which opened in August 1895. 

Ironically, among many other honors, Westinghouse received the 1911 Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers &quot;for meritorious achievement in connection with the development of the alternating current system&quot;.

==Early years==
George Westinghouse was born in 1846 in the village of Central Bridge, New York (see George Westinghouse Jr. Birthplace and Boyhood Home), the son of Emeline (Vedder) and George Westinghouse Sr., a farmer and machine shop owner. The Westinghouse ancestors came from Westphalia in Germany, moving first to England and eventually emigrating to the US. The family name had been anglicized from Wistinghausen.

From his youth, Westinghouse displayed a talent for machinery and business. He was encouraged by his father and was assigned tasks in the Westinghouse Company workshop. The company produced farm equipment such as the Westinghouse Farm Engine.

At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, the then 14-year-old attempted to run away from home to enlist, but was stopped by his father. In June 1863 his parents allowed him to enlist, first in the 12th Regiment of the New York National Guard and then in the 16th Regiment of the New York Cavalry. He earned a promotion to the rank of corporal before being honorably discharged in November 1863. A month later he joined the Union Navy. He served as an Acting Third Assistant Engineer on the gunboat and then on the ship through the end of the war. These ships were used to blockade Southern port cities. After his discharge in August 1865, Westinghouse returned to his family and enrolled at Union College in Schenectady, but he quickly lost interest and dropped out during his first term.

He further developed his skills in his father&#x27;s company shop. Westinghouse was just 19 when he received his first patent for a rotary steam engine. At age 21, he invented a car replacer, a device used to guide derailed railroad cars back onto the tracks, and a reversible &quot;frog&quot;, a rail junction piece used to switch trains between different tracks. In 1868, Westinghouse moved with his wife to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to access better and less expensive steel for the manufacture of his railroad frogs, and there he began to develop his recently invented railroad air brake concept.

== Railroad air brakes and signaling/switching systems ==

During his travels, Westinghouse had witnessed the aftermath of a collision where engineers on two trains, approaching each other on the same track, had seen each other but were unable to stop their trains in time due to the existing brake systems. At that time, brakemen had to run along catwalks on the top of the cars, manually applying the brakes. Coordinating that process was tricky and dangerous. It also meant trains could not exceed ten cars in length, and thousands of brakemen died or were maimed each year.

In 1869, at age 23, Westinghouse first publicly demonstrated his revolutionary new railroad braking system in Pittsburgh. It stopped trains using a compressed air system. His first braking system used an air compressor and an air reservoir in the locomotive, with a single compressed air pipe running the length of the train and with flexible connections between cars. That line controlled the brakes, allowing the engineer to apply and release the brakes simultaneously on all cars. A charter for what would eventually become the Westinghouse Air Brake Company was filed in July of that year. 

Although the system was successful, as demonstrated when it prevented a serious mishap in front of assembled witnesses, it was hardly fail-safe. Any rupture or disconnection in the air line left the train without brakes. Over the next two years, Westinghouse and his engineers addressed the problem by inverting the process, designing valves so that constant pressure in the lines kept the brakes disengaged. An air reservoir was also placed on each car. With the improved design, any interruption or break in the line automatically caused the train to stop.

During the next decade, building on his earliest inventions, Westinghouse expanded his interest to railway signaling and track-switching systems. Previously, signaling relied on oil lamps and track switching was performed manually. Westinghouse&#x27;s designs changed all that. In 1882, Westinghouse founded the Union Switch and Signal Company to manufacture, market, install, and maintain these innovative control systems, which were eventually adopted by railroads around the world.

== Natural gas ==

By 1883, Westinghouse had become interested in natural gas. Gas had recently been discovered in nearby Murrysville, Pennsylvania, and it attracted a lot of attention, in part because of a spectacular flaming blowout of the Haymaker Well in 1878. After visiting the well and recognizing its commercial potential, he undertook drilling for gas on his estate Solitude (today&#x27;s Westinghouse Park) in Pittsburgh.


Early in the morning of May 21, 1884, the drilling crew struck a pocket of gas at a depth of 1500 feet, and the resulting blast of dirt and water blew the top off the derrick. It took Westinghouse a week to devise a method to cap the flow of gas. He was encouraged to develop a system to deliver gas to heat and light area homes and businesses. Eventually, several natural gas derricks towered above his estate&#x27;s Victorian-era gardens. In modern times there is no above-ground trace left of these derricks.

That year, Westinghouse acquired a dormant utility charter for &quot;The Philadelphia Company&quot;, and over the next three years, he developed devices and secured more than 30 patents for this technology. He used the Philadelphia Company to develop gas wells and to promote gas usage both for commercial and residential purposes. By 1886, the Philadelphia Company owned 58 wells and 184 miles of distribution piping in the Pittsburgh area, and by 1887, it served over 12,000 private homes and 582 industrial customers throughout the state.

In 1889, as his involvement with the generation and distribution of electricity was surging, Westinghouse resigned as president of the Philadelphia Company, but he remained on its board. Growth in the natural gas business slowed in the 1890s, hindered by supply problems and ongoing safety concerns related to gas distribution in homes and businesses. However, the Philadelphia Company continued to grow, spawning enterprises such as Equitable Gas and Duquesne Light.

==Electric power distribution==
In the early 1880s, Westinghouse&#x27;s interest in railroad switching and natural gas distribution led him to become involved in the then-new field of electrical power distribution. Electric lighting of streets using arc lighting was already a growing business with many companies building systems powered by either locally generated direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). At the same time, Thomas Edison was launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb.

In 1884, Westinghouse began developing his own DC domestic lighting system and hired physicist William Stanley to help work on it. In 1885, Westinghouse became aware of the concept of an electrical transformer introduced by Frenchman Lucien Gaulard and Englishman John Gibbs. Guido Pantaleoni, an Italian engineer in his employ, alerted Westinghouse to their already-patented transformer and a deployed system capable of transmitting electricity for many miles near London, Turin, and Rome. They had found that AC electricity could be &quot;stepped up&quot; in voltage by a transformer for transmission and then &quot;stepped down&quot; by another transformer for lower voltage consumer use. This innovation made it possible for large, centralized power plants to generate electricity and supply it over long distances to both cities and places with more dispersed populations. This was a huge advantage over the low voltage DC systems being marketed by Edison’s electric utility, which limited generating stations to a transmission range of about a mile due to losses cause by the low voltages and high currents used. Westinghouse recognized AC&#x27;s potential to achieve greater economies of scale as a way to create a truly competitive electrical system, instead of simply piecing together a barely competitive DC lighting system just different enough to get around Edison’s patents.

In 1885 Westinghouse imported several Gaulard–Gibbs transformers and a Siemens AC generator, to begin experimenting with AC networks in Pittsburgh. Stanley, assisted by engineers Albert Schmid and Oliver B. Shallenberger, dramatically improved the Gaulard–Gibbs transformer design, creating the first practical and manufacturable transformer. In 1886, with Westinghouse&#x27;s backing, Stanley installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The demonstration lighting system was driven by a hydroelectric generator that produced 500 volts AC, which was then stepped down to 100 volts to light incandescent bulbs in homes and businesses. That same year, Westinghouse founded the &quot;Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company&quot;; in 1889 he renamed it the &quot;Westinghouse Electric Corporation&quot;.

===War of the currents===

The Westinghouse company installed thirty more AC-lighting systems within a year, and by the end of 1887 it had 68 alternating current power stations compared to 121 DC-based stations Edison had installed over seven years. This competition with Edison led, in the late 1880s, to what became known as the &quot;war of currents&quot;. Thomas Edison and his company joined and promoted a spreading public perception that the high voltages used in AC distribution were unsafe and deadly. Edison even suggested that a Westinghouse AC generator should be used in the State of New York&#x27;s new electric chair.

Westinghouse also had to deal with another AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, which had constructed 22 power stations by the end of 1887 and by 1889 it had acquired another competitor, the Brush Electric Company. Thomson-Houston was expanding its business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as agreements over lighting company territory, paying royalties to use the Stanley transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use its Sawyer–Man incandescent bulb patent.

In 1890, the Edison company, in collusion with Thomson-Houston, arranged for the first electric chair to be powered with a Westinghouse AC generator. Westinghouse tried to block this move by hiring the best lawyer of the day to (unsuccessfully) defend William Kemmler, the first man scheduled to die in the chair. 

The War of Currents ended in 1892 when financier J. P. Morgan forced Edison General Electric to switch to AC power and then pushed Edison out of the company he had founded. Edison General Electric company was merged with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, a conglomerate controlled by the board of Thomson-Houston.

===Development and competition===
During this period, Westinghouse continued to pour money and engineering resources into the goal of building a completely integrated AC system — obtaining the Sawyer–Man lamp by buying Consolidated Electric Light, and developing components such as an induction meter, and obtaining the rights to inventor Nikola Tesla&#x27;s brushless AC induction motor along with patents for a new type of electric power distribution, polyphase alternating current. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patented element for his system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant that the development of Tesla&#x27;s motor had to be put on hold for a while.

In 1891, Westinghouse&#x27;s company was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lead lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked to them like his excessive spending on the acquisition of other companies, research, and patents.

Also in 1891, Westinghouse built a hydroelectric AC power plant, the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant near Ophir, Colorado which supplied AC power to the Gold King Mine 3.5 miles away. This was the first successful demonstration of long-distance transmission of industrial-grade alternating current power and utilized two 100 hp Westinghouse alternators, one working as a generator producing 3,000-volt, 133-Hertz, single-phase AC, and the other used as an AC motor.

In May 1892, Westinghouse Electric won the bid to power and illuminate the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current, substantially underbidding General Electric to get the contract. To meet the contract&#x27;s demands, he had to quickly develop a new type of incandescent lightbulb based on the Sawyer–Man patent he had obtained, ensuring it did not infringe on the Edison patent design.

By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress in developing an efficient version of Tesla&#x27;s induction motor. In that work he was aided by his sister and fellow Westinghouse engineer Bertha Lamme Feicht. Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete polyphase AC system as the &quot;Tesla Polyphase System&quot;, announcing Tesla&#x27;s patents gave them patent priority over other AC systems and stating their intention to sue any patent infringers.

This World&#x27;s Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the American public. 

Westinghouse&#x27;s demonstration of their ability to build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition was instrumental in the company getting the contract for building a two-phase AC generating system, the Adams Power Plant, at Niagara Falls, NY, in 1895. The company was subcontracted to build ten 5,000 horsepower (3,700 kW) 25 Hz AC generators at this plant. Westinghouse&#x27;s Niagara Power Station No. 1, as it was then called, remained in operation in the Niagara transformer house until the plant closed in 1961.

At the same time, a contract to build the three-phase AC distribution system the project needed was awarded to General Electric. The early to mid-1890s saw General Electric, backed by financier J. P. Morgan, engaged in costly takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. The competition was so costly that in 1896 a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies. The agreement stayed in effect until 1911.

Following the success of the first Niagara Falls plant, the Rankine Generating Station, also known as The Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station, the Canadians contracted with Westinghouse for eleven 25 Hertz generators of the same Tesla-inspired design, rated for a total generating capacity of 100 MW. That facility opened in 1905 in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

==Other Westinghouse projects: steam engines, maritime propulsion, and shock absorbers==

Despite continuing success in his other businesses, Westinghouse&#x27;s main interest shifted to electric power. At the outset, the available generating sources were hydro turbines where falling water was available, and reciprocating steam engines where it was not. Westinghouse felt that existing reciprocating steam engines were clumsy and inefficient, and he wanted to develop rotating engines that would be more elegant. His first patent had been a rotary steam engine, but it proved impractical at the time.

In 1884, the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons began experimenting with steam turbines, starting with a 10-horsepower (7.5 kW) turbine. In 1895, Westinghouse bought rights to the Parsons turbine, and his engineers improved its technology and increased its scale. In 1898, Westinghouse demonstrated a 300-kilowatt generating unit, replacing reciprocating engines in his air-brake factory. The next year, he installed a 1.5-MW 1200 rpm unit for the Hartford Electric Light Company.

Westinghouse also developed steam turbines for maritime propulsion. The basic problem was that large turbines ran most efficiently at around 3000 rpm, while an efficient propeller operated only at about 100 rpm. This required reduction gearing, but designing reduction gearing that could operate at both high rpm and at high power was difficult since any slight misalignment would shake the powertrain to pieces. Westinghouse and his engineers invented an automatic self-alignment system that finally made turbine power practical for large vessels.

In 1889, Westinghouse purchased several mining claims in the Patagonia Mountains of southeastern Arizona and formed the Duquesne Mining &amp; Reduction Company. He hoped to invent a better way to mine and extract copper from &quot;lean&quot; ores that were not particularly rich in the metal. Success is this venture would have helped him compete in the electrical businesses that used much copper. He was unsuccessful in this project: no new copper reduction process was found and the mine was not profitable. He had founded the town of Duquesne to use as his company headquarters; it is now a ghost town. Duquesne grew to over 1,000 residents and the mine reached its peak production in the mid-1910s.

Westinghouse also began to work on heat pumps that could provide heating and cooling. When Westinghouse claimed he was after a perpetual motion machine, the British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), one of his many correspondents, told him that such a machine would violate the laws of thermodynamics. Westinghouse replied that might be the case, but it made no difference. If he couldn&#x27;t build a perpetual motion machine, he would still have a heat pump system that he could patent and sell. 

After the broader introduction of the automobile, Westinghouse invented a compressed air shock absorber for their suspension systems. The shock absorber was among the last of the 362 patents he received, and it was awarded posthumously, two years after his death.

==Labor relations==

Westinghouse was the first industrial employer in the United States to give workers a five-and-a half day work week, starting in June 1881. Saturdays were made half holidays to promote community involvement and personal development. Westinghouse had observed the practice while visiting England. 

The planned community of Wilmerding, Pennsylvania was home to many Westinghouse employees, and it was also the headquarters of several companies, particularly Westinghouse Air Brake. Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing was located a mile further down the Turtle Creek valley east of Pittsburgh. The worker houses were outfitted with running water, electricity, gas, and often space for small gardens. Homeownership was facilitated through periodic salary deductions. There was a pension and an insurance system. Factories were well-lit, ventilated, and were outfitted with medical facilities and personnel for treating injuries. All these accommodations, at Westinghouse&#x27;s expense, were considered highly innovative at the time, especially in contrast to the conditions endured by workers in the nearby steel mills.

Westinghouse was broadly admired by his workers. Privately, they referred to him as &quot;the Old Man&quot;. An indication of his progressive attitude was that when Westinghouse engineers invented things, they were allowed to keep their names on the patents, though assigning rights to use them to the company. Westinghouse viewed this as part of the dignity of man and part of his intellectual property. Westinghouse, unlike Edison, did not put his name on all company patents as co-inventor.

Westinghouse was not in favor of labor unionization. He did not reject workers who belonged to a union, but he did not like collective bargaining arrangements where his workers might strike for issues not related to conditions at his own factories. There was only one strike at any Westinghouse company while he was in charge. It was a 1903 action at Westinghouse Machine Company, which was rushing to illuminate the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Westinghouse responded by immediately hiring replacements for those employees who walked out. Despite that action, American labor and union organizer Samuel Gompers is reputed to have said &quot;If all business leaders and moguls treated their employees as well as George Westinghouse, there’d be no need for any labor unions&quot;.
A series of short movies showing conditions in and around Westinghouse factories was made in 1904 and exhibited at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair.

==Personal life, later life, and death==



In 1867, Westinghouse met Marguerite Erskine Walker on a train, and they married in August of that year. They were married for 47 years, and had one son, George Westinghouse III, who in turn had six children. 

From 1871, George and Marguerite Westinghouse maintained a large home in Pittsburgh called Solitude, building up from an existing house on land purchased by George in 1871. They were part of a social class of very rich local industrialists and money managers including neighbors and associates Henry Clay Frick, Henry J. Heinz, William Thaw, Andrew Mellon, and Richard Beatty Mellon, and the brothers Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Carnegie. Their guests included Nicola Tesla, Lord Kelvin, and congressman (and future president) William McKinley. 

By 1893, they had constructed Erskine Park in Lenox, Massachusetts, which they used as a summer home, in part as a respite from the gritty industrial environment of Pittsburgh. It was named for the family of Marguerite&#x27;s grandparents.

In 1898, the Westinghouses leased and then in 1901 purchased the Blaine House mansion in Washington D.C. Marguerite Westinghouse was reputed to host frequent and lavish entertainments there. In 1918, his former Pittsburgh home, Solitude, was razed and the land given to the City of Pittsburgh to establish Westinghouse Park. The house in Erskine Park was sold by the family in 1917 and subsequently demolished. 

In 1894, the Grand Army of the Republic, a fraternal organization of Union Civil War veterans, held a week-long convention in Pittsburgh. George Westinghouse, being a veteran himself, hosted an evening of dinner and entertainment for more than 5,000 attendees at the newly constructed, but not yet active main buildings of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh. He took on the expenses of the necessary building preparations and all the expenses of transporting people to and from the site by rail.

Pride in his achievements with the airbrake is reflected in the comment published in 1904: &quot;If some day they say of me that with the airbrake I contributed something to civilization, something to the safety of human life, it will be sufficient.&quot; 

George Westinghouse remained a captain of American industry until 1907 when the financial panic of 1907 led to his resignation from control of the Westinghouse Electric company. By 1911, he was no longer active in business, and his health was in decline. Westinghouse died on March 12, 1914, in New York City at age 67. He was initially interred in Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY then removed on December 14, 1915. As a Civil War veteran, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, along with his wife Marguerite, who survived him by three months. She had also been initially interred in Woodlawn but removed and reinterred at the same time as George.

==Honors and awards==

George Westinghouse was deeply appreciated by his colleagues and employees. For example, Nicola Tesla, with whom he developed the AC polyphase system of electric power distribution spoke of him in 1938 as follows: &quot;George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on this globe who could take my alternating-current system under the circumstances then existing and win the battle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneer of imposing stature, one of the world&#x27;s true noblemen, of whom America may well be proud and to whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude.&quot;

<text>Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used for treating viral infections. Most antivirals target specific viruses, while a broad-spectrum antiviral is effective against a wide range of viruses. Antiviral drugs are a class of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also termed antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs, or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies. Most antivirals are considered relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infections. They should be distinguished from virucides, which are not medication but deactivate or destroy virus particles, either inside or outside the body. Natural virucides are produced by some plants such as eucalyptus and Australian tea trees.

==Medical uses==
Most of the antiviral drugs now available are designed to help deal with HIV, herpes viruses, the hepatitis B and C viruses, and influenza A and B viruses.

Viruses use the host&#x27;s cells to replicate and this makes it difficult to find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism&#x27;s cells. Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and antiviral drugs is due to viral variation.

The emergence of antivirals is the product of a greatly expanded knowledge of the genetic and molecular function of organisms, allowing biomedical researchers to understand the structure and function of viruses, major advances in the techniques for finding new drugs, and the pressure placed on the medical profession to deal with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

The first experimental antivirals were developed in the 1960s, mostly to deal with herpes viruses, and were found using traditional trial-and-error drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals that seemed to have an effect were selected for closer study.

This was a very time-consuming, hit-or-miss procedure, and in the absence of a good knowledge of how the target virus worked, it was not efficient in discovering effective antivirals which had few side effects. Only in the 1980s, when the full genetic sequences of viruses began to be unraveled, did researchers begin to learn how viruses worked in detail, and exactly what chemicals were needed to thwart their reproductive cycle.

==Antiviral drug design==
===Antiviral targeting===
The general idea behind modern antiviral drug design is to identify viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These &quot;targets&quot; should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to reduce the likelihood of side effects and toxicity. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not by the patient, that is common across strains, and see what can be done to interfere with its operation.

Once targets are identified, candidate drugs can be selected, either from drugs already known to have appropriate effects or by actually designing the candidate at the molecular level with a computer-aided design program.

The target proteins can be manufactured in the lab for testing with candidate treatments by inserting the gene that synthesizes the target protein into bacteria or other kinds of cells. The cells are then cultured for mass production of the protein, which can then be exposed to various treatment candidates and evaluated with &quot;rapid screening&quot; technologies.

===Approaches by virus life cycle stage===
Viruses consist of a genome and sometimes a few enzymes stored in a capsule made of protein (called a capsid), and sometimes covered with a lipid layer (sometimes called an &#x27;envelope&#x27;). Viruses cannot reproduce on their own and instead propagate by subjugating a host cell to produce copies of themselves, thus producing the next generation.

Researchers working on such &quot;rational drug design&quot; strategies for developing antivirals have tried to attack viruses at every stage of their life cycles. Some species of mushrooms have been found to contain multiple antiviral chemicals with similar synergistic effects.
Compounds isolated from fruiting bodies and filtrates of various mushrooms have broad-spectrum antiviral activities, but successful production and availability of such compounds as frontline antiviral is a long way away.

Viral life cycles vary in their precise details depending on the type of virus, but they all share a general pattern:
# Attachment to a host cell.
# Release of viral genes and possibly enzymes into the host cell.
# Replication of viral components using host-cell machinery.
# Assembly of viral components into complete viral particles.
# Release of viral particles to infect new host cells.

====Before cell entry====
One antiviral strategy is to interfere with the ability of a virus to infiltrate a target cell. The virus must go through a sequence of steps to do this, beginning with binding to a specific &quot;receptor&quot; molecule on the surface of the host cell and ending with the virus &quot;uncoating&quot; inside the cell and releasing its contents. Viruses that have a lipid envelope must also fuse their envelope with the target cell, or with a vesicle that transports them into the cell before they can uncoat.

This stage of viral replication can be inhibited in two ways:
# Using agents which mimic the virus-associated protein (VAP) and bind to the cellular receptors. This may include VAP anti-idiotypic antibodies, natural ligands of the receptor, and anti-receptor antibodies.
# Using agents which mimic the cellular receptor and bind to the VAP. This includes anti-VAP antibodies, receptor anti-idiotypic antibodies, extraneous receptor and synthetic receptor mimics.

This strategy of designing drugs can be very expensive, and since the process of generating anti-idiotypic antibodies is partly trial and error, it can be a relatively slow process until an adequate molecule is produced.

=====Entry inhibitor=====

A very early stage of viral infection is viral entry, when the virus attaches to and enters the host cell. A number of &quot;entry-inhibiting&quot; or &quot;entry-blocking&quot; drugs are being developed to fight HIV. HIV most heavily targets a specific type of lymphocyte known as &quot;helper T cells&quot;, and identifies these target cells through T-cell surface receptors designated &quot;CD4&quot; and &quot;CCR5&quot;. Attempts to interfere with the binding of HIV with the CD4 receptor have failed to stop HIV from infecting helper T cells, but research continues on trying to interfere with the binding of HIV to the CCR5 receptor in hopes that it will be more effective.

HIV infects a cell through fusion with the cell membrane, which requires two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing depending on the cell type). Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in preventing entry of the virus into a cell. At least one of these entry inhibitors—a biomimetic peptide called Enfuvirtide, or the brand name Fuzeon—has received FDA approval and has been in use for some time. Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.

One possible advantage of the therapeutic approach of blocking viral entry (as opposed to the currently dominant approach of viral enzyme inhibition) is that it may prove more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to this therapy than for the virus to mutate or evolve its enzymatic protocols.

=====Uncoating inhibitors=====
Inhibitors of uncoating have also been investigated.

Amantadine and rimantadine have been introduced to combat influenza. These agents act on penetration and uncoating.

Pleconaril works against rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, by blocking a pocket on the surface of the virus that controls the uncoating process. This pocket is similar in most strains of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which can cause diarrhea, meningitis, conjunctivitis, and encephalitis.

Some scientists are making the case that a vaccine against rhinoviruses, the predominant cause of the common cold, is achievable.
Vaccines that combine dozens of varieties of rhinovirus at once are effective in stimulating antiviral antibodies in mice and monkeys, researchers reported in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in 2016.

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold; other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses can cause them too. Rhinoviruses also exacerbate asthma attacks. Although rhinoviruses come in many varieties, they do not drift to the same degree that influenza viruses do. A mixture of 50 inactivated rhinovirus types should be able to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against all of them to some degree.

====During viral synthesis====
A second approach is to target the processes that synthesize virus components after a virus invades a cell.

=====Reverse transcription=====
One way of doing this is to develop nucleotide or nucleoside analogues that look like the building blocks of RNA or DNA, but deactivate the enzymes that synthesize the RNA or DNA once the analogue is incorporated. This approach is more commonly associated with the inhibition of reverse transcriptase (RNA to DNA) than with &quot;normal&quot; transcriptase (DNA to RNA).

The first successful antiviral, aciclovir, is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, zidovudine (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.

An improved knowledge of the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase as part of its replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.

Another target being considered for HIV antivirals include RNase H—which is a component of reverse transcriptase that splits the synthesized DNA from the original viral RNA.

=====Integrase=====
Another target is integrase, which integrate the synthesized DNA into the host cell genome. Examples of integrase inhibitors include raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir.

=====Transcription=====
Once a virus genome becomes operational in a host cell, it then generates messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Production of mRNA is initiated by proteins known as transcription factors. Several antivirals are now being designed to block attachment of transcription factors to viral DNA.

=====Translation/antisense=====
Genomics has not only helped find targets for many antivirals, it has provided the basis for an entirely new type of drug, based on &quot;antisense&quot; molecules. These are segments of DNA or RNA that are designed as complementary molecule to critical sections of viral genomes, and the binding of these antisense segments to these target sections blocks the operation of those genomes. A phosphorothioate antisense drug named fomivirsen has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by cytomegalovirus, and other antisense antivirals are in development. An antisense structural type that has proven especially valuable in research is morpholino antisense.

Morpholino oligos have been used to experimentally suppress many viral types:
* caliciviruses
* flaviviruses (including West Nile virus)
* dengue
* HCV
* coronaviruses

=====Translation/ribozymes=====
Yet another antiviral technique inspired by genomics is a set of drugs based on ribozymes, which are enzymes that will cut apart viral RNA or DNA at selected sites. In their natural course, ribozymes are used as part of the viral manufacturing sequence, but these synthetic ribozymes are designed to cut RNA and DNA at sites that will disable them.

A ribozyme antiviral to deal with hepatitis C has been suggested, and ribozyme antivirals are being developed to deal with HIV. An interesting variation of this idea is the use of genetically modified cells that can produce custom-tailored ribozymes. This is part of a broader effort to create genetically modified cells that can be injected into a host to attack pathogens by generating specialized proteins that block viral replication at various phases of the viral life cycle.

=====Protein processing and targeting=====
Interference with post translational modifications or with targeting of viral proteins in the cell is also possible.

====Protease inhibitors====
Some viruses include an enzyme known as a protease that cuts viral protein chains apart so they can be assembled into their final configuration. HIV includes a protease, and so considerable research has been performed to find &quot;protease inhibitors&quot; to attack HIV at that phase of its life cycle. Protease inhibitors became available in the 1990s and have proven effective, though they can have unusual side effects, for example causing fat to build up in unusual places. Improved protease inhibitors are now in development.

Protease inhibitors have also been seen in nature. A protease inhibitor was isolated from the shiitake mushroom (&quot;Lentinus edodes&quot;). The presence of this may explain the Shiitake mushrooms&#x27; noted antiviral activity &quot;in vitro&quot;.

=====Long dsRNA helix targeting=====
Most viruses produce long dsRNA helices during transcription and replication. In contrast, uninfected mammalian cells generally produce dsRNA helices of fewer than 24 base pairs during transcription. DRACO (double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer) is a group of experimental antiviral drugs initially developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In cell culture, DRACO was reported to have broad-spectrum efficacy against many infectious viruses, including dengue flavivirus, Amapari and Tacaribe arenavirus, Guama bunyavirus, H1N1 influenza and rhinovirus, and was additionally found effective against influenza &quot;in vivo&quot; in weanling mice. It was reported to induce rapid apoptosis selectively in virus-infected mammalian cells, while leaving uninfected cells unharmed. DRACO effects cell death via one of the last steps in the apoptosis pathway in which complexes containing intracellular apoptosis signalling molecules simultaneously bind multiple procaspases. The procaspases transactivate via cleavage, activate additional caspases in the cascade, and cleave a variety of cellular proteins, thereby killing the cell.

====Assembly====
Rifampicin acts at the assembly phase.

====Release phase====
The final stage in the life cycle of a virus is the release of completed viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.

===Immune system stimulation===

Rather than attacking viruses directly, a second category of tactics for fighting viruses involves encouraging the body&#x27;s immune system to attack them. Some antivirals of this sort do not focus on a specific pathogen, instead stimulating the immune system to attack a range of pathogens.

One of the best-known of this class of drugs are interferons, which inhibit viral synthesis in infected cells. One form of human interferon named &quot;interferon alpha&quot; is well-established as part of the standard treatment for hepatitis B and C, and other interferons are also being investigated as treatments for various diseases.

A more specific approach is to synthesize antibodies, protein molecules that can bind to a pathogen and mark it for attack by other elements of the immune system. Once researchers identify a particular target on the pathogen, they can synthesize quantities of identical &quot;monoclonal&quot; antibodies to link up that target. A monoclonal drug is now being sold to help fight respiratory syncytial virus in babies, and antibodies purified from infected individuals are also used as a treatment for hepatitis B.

== Antiviral drug resistance ==
Antiviral resistance can be defined by a decreased susceptibility to a drug caused by changes in viral genotypes. In cases of antiviral resistance, drugs have either diminished or no effectiveness against their target virus. The issue inevitably remains a major obstacle to antiviral therapy as it has developed to almost all specific and effective antimicrobials, including antiviral agents.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inclusively recommends anyone six months and older to get a yearly vaccination to protect them from influenza A viruses (H1N1) and (H3N2) and up to two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccination). Comprehensive protection starts by ensuring vaccinations are current and complete. However, vaccines are preventative and are not generally used once a patient has been infected with a virus. Additionally, the availability of these vaccines can be limited based on financial or locational reasons which can prevent the effectiveness of herd immunity, making effective antivirals a necessity.

The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), and peramivir (Rapivab). Influenza antiviral resistance often results from changes occurring in neuraminidase and hemagglutinin proteins on the viral surface. Currently, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the most frequently prescribed antivirals because they are effective against both influenza A and B. However, antiviral resistance is known to develop if mutations to the neuraminidase proteins prevent NAI binding. This was seen in the H257Y mutation, which was responsible for oseltamivir resistance to H1N1 strains in 2009. The inability of NA inhibitors to bind to the virus allowed this strain of virus with the resistance mutation to spread due to natural selection. Furthermore, a study published in 2009 in &quot;Nature Biotechnology&quot; emphasized the urgent need for augmentation of oseltamivir stockpiles with additional antiviral drugs including zanamivir. This finding was based on a performance evaluation of these drugs supposing the 2009 H1N1 &#x27;Swine Flu&#x27; neuraminidase (NA) were to acquire the oseltamivir-resistance (His274Tyr) mutation, which is currently widespread in seasonal H1N1 strains.

=== Origin of antiviral resistance ===
The genetic makeup of viruses is constantly changing, which can cause a virus to become resistant to currently available treatments. Viruses can become resistant through spontaneous or intermittent mechanisms throughout the course of an antiviral treatment. Immunocompromised patients, more often than immunocompetent patients, hospitalized with pneumonia are at the highest risk of developing oseltamivir resistance during treatment. Subsequent to exposure to someone else with the flu, those who received oseltamivir for &quot;post-exposure prophylaxis&quot; are also at higher risk of resistance.

The mechanisms for antiviral resistance development depend on the type of virus in question. RNA viruses such as hepatitis C and influenza A have high error rates during genome replication because RNA polymerases lack proofreading activity. RNA viruses also have small genome sizes that are typically less than 30 kb, which allow them to sustain a high frequency of mutations. DNA viruses, such as HPV and herpesvirus, hijack host cell replication machinery, which gives them proofreading capabilities during replication. DNA viruses are therefore less error prone, are generally less diverse, and are more slowly evolving than RNA viruses. In both cases, the likelihood of mutations is exacerbated by the speed with which viruses reproduce, which provides more opportunities for mutations to occur in successive replications. Billions of viruses are produced every day during the course of an infection, with each replication giving another chance for mutations that encode for resistance to occur.

Multiple strains of one virus can be present in the body at one time, and some of these strains may contain mutations that cause antiviral resistance. This effect, called the quasispecies model, results in immense variation in any given sample of virus, and gives the opportunity for natural selection to favor viral strains with the highest fitness every time the virus is spread to a new host. Recombination, the joining of two different viral variants, and reassortment, the swapping of viral gene segments among viruses in the same cell, also play a role in resistance, especially in influenza.

Antiviral resistance has been reported in antivirals for herpes, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and influenza, but antiviral resistance is a possibility for all viruses. Mechanisms of antiviral resistance vary between virus types.

=== Detection of antiviral resistance ===
National and international surveillance is performed by the CDC to determine effectiveness of the current FDA-approved antiviral flu drugs. Public health officials use this information to make current recommendations about the use of flu antiviral medications. WHO further recommends in-depth epidemiological investigations to control potential transmission of the resistant virus and prevent future progression. As novel treatments and detection techniques to antiviral resistance are enhanced so can the establishment of strategies to combat the inevitable emergence of antiviral resistance.

=== Treatment options for antiviral resistant pathogens ===
If a virus is not fully wiped out during a regimen of antivirals, treatment creates a bottleneck in the viral population that selects for resistance, and there is a chance that a resistant strain may repopulate the host. Viral treatment mechanisms must therefore account for the selection of resistant viruses.

The most commonly used method for treating resistant viruses is combination therapy, which uses multiple antivirals in one treatment regimen. This is thought to decrease the likelihood that one mutation could cause antiviral resistance, as the antivirals in the cocktail target different stages of the viral life cycle. This is frequently used in retroviruses like HIV, but a number of studies have demonstrated its effectiveness against influenza A, as well. Viruses can also be screened for resistance to drugs before treatment is started. This minimizes exposure to unnecessary antivirals and ensures that an effective medication is being used. This may improve patient outcomes and could help detect new resistance mutations during routine scanning for known mutants. However, this has not been consistently implemented in treatment facilities at this time.
==Direct-acting antivirals==
The term Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has long been associated with the combination of antiviral drugs used to treat hepatitis C infections. These are the more effective than older treatments such as ribavirin (partially indirectly acting) and interferon (indirect acting). The DAA drugs against hepatitis C are taken orally, as tablets, for 8 to 12 weeks. The treatment depends on the type or types (genotypes) of hepatitis C virus that are causing the infection. Both during and at the end of treatment, blood tests are used to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and subsequent cure.

The DAA combination drugs used include:
* Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir)
* Epclusa (sofosbuvir and velpatasvir)
* Vosevi (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir)
* Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir)
* Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir)

The United States Food and Drug Administration approved DAAs on the basis of a surrogate endpoint called sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is achieved in a patient when hepatitis C virus RNA remains undetectable 12–24 weeks after treatment ends. Whether through DAAs or older interferon-based regimens, SVR is associated with improved health outcomes and significantly decreased mortality. For those who already have advanced liver disease (including hepatocellular carcinoma), however, the benefits of achieving SVR may be less pronounced, though still substantial.

Despite its historical roots in hepatitis C research, the term &quot;direct-acting antivirals&quot; is becoming more broadly used to also include other anti-viral drugs with a direct viral target such as aciclovir (against herpes simplex virus), letermovir (against cytomegalovirus), or AZT (against human immunodeficiency virus). In this context it serves to distinguish these drugs from those with an indirect mechanism of action such as immune modulators like interferon alfa. This difference is of particular relevance for potential drug resistance mutation development.

==Public policy==
===Use and distribution===
Guidelines regarding viral diagnoses and treatments change frequently and limit quality care. Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low. Provider knowledge of antiviral therapies can improve patient care, especially in geriatric medicine. Furthermore, in local health departments (LHDs) with access to antivirals, guidelines may be unclear, causing delays in treatment. With time-sensitive therapies, delays could lead to lack of treatment.
Overall, national guidelines, regarding infection control and management, standardize care and improve healthcare worker and patient safety. Guidelines, such as those provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2009 flu pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus, recommend, among other things, antiviral treatment regimens, clinical assessment algorithms for coordination of care, and antiviral chemoprophylaxis guidelines for exposed persons. Roles of pharmacists and pharmacies have also expanded to meet the needs of public during public health emergencies.

===Stockpiling===

Public Health Emergency Preparedness initiatives are managed by the CDC via the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Funds aim to support communities in preparing for public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. Also managed by the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) consists of bulk quantities of medicines and supplies for use during such emergencies. Antiviral stockpiles prepare for shortages of antiviral medications in cases of public health emergencies. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009–2010, guidelines for SNS use by local health departments was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning. For example, local health departments that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance on the use of the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.

<text>Reductionism is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations between phenomena which can be described in terms of simpler or more fundamental phenomena. It is also described as an intellectual and philosophical position that interprets a complex system as the sum of its parts.

== Definitions ==
&quot;The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot; suggests that reductionism is &quot;one of the most used and abused terms in the philosophical lexicon&quot; and suggests a three-part division:
# Ontological reductionism: a belief that the whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts.
# Methodological reductionism: the scientific attempt to provide an explanation in terms of ever-smaller entities.
# Theory reductionism: the suggestion that a newer theory does not replace or absorb an older one, but reduces it to more basic terms. Theory reduction itself is divisible into three parts: translation, derivation, and explanation.

Reductionism can be applied to any phenomenon, including objects, problems, explanations, theories, and meanings.

For the sciences, application of methodological reductionism attempts explanation of entire systems in terms of their individual, constituent parts and their interactions. For example, the temperature of a gas is reduced to nothing beyond the average kinetic energy of its molecules in motion. Thomas Nagel and others speak of &#x27;psychophysical reductionism&#x27; (the attempted reduction of psychological phenomena to physics and chemistry), and &#x27;physico-chemical reductionism&#x27; (the attempted reduction of biology to physics and chemistry). In a very simplified and sometimes contested form, reductionism is said to imply that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts.

However, a more nuanced opinion is that a system is composed entirely of its parts, but the system will have features that none of the parts have (which, in essence is the basis of emergentism). &quot;The point of mechanistic explanations is usually showing how the higher level features arise from the parts.&quot;

Other definitions are used by other authors. For example, what John Polkinghorne terms &#x27;conceptual&#x27; or &#x27;epistemological&#x27; reductionism is the definition provided by Simon Blackburn and by Jaegwon Kim: that form of reductionism which concerns a program of replacing the facts or entities involved in one type of discourse with other facts or entities from another type, thereby providing a relationship between them. Richard Jones distinguishes ontological and epistemological reductionism, arguing that many ontological and epistemological reductionists affirm the need for different concepts for different degrees of complexity while affirming a reduction of theories.

The idea of reductionism can be expressed by &quot;levels&quot; of explanation, with higher levels reducible if need be to lower levels. This use of levels of understanding in part expresses our human limitations in remembering detail. However, &quot;most philosophers would insist that our role in conceptualizing reality [our need for a hierarchy of &quot;levels&quot; of understanding] does not change the fact that different levels of organization in reality do have different &#x27;properties&#x27;.&quot;

Reductionism does not preclude the existence of what might be termed emergent phenomena, but it does imply the ability to understand those phenomena completely in terms of the processes from which they are composed. This reductionist understanding is very different from ontological or strong emergentism, which intends that what emerges in &quot;emergence&quot; is more than the sum of the processes from which it emerges, respectively either in the ontological sense or in the epistemological sense. 

=== Ontological reductionism ===
Richard Jones divides ontological reductionism into two: the reductionism of substances (e.g., the reduction of mind to matter) and the reduction of the number of structures operating in nature (e.g., the reduction of one physical force to another). This permits scientists and philosophers to affirm the former while being anti-reductionists regarding the latter.

Nancey Murphy has claimed that there are two species of ontological reductionism: one that claims that wholes are nothing more than their parts; and atomist reductionism, claiming that wholes are not &quot;really real&quot;. She admits that the phrase &quot;really real&quot; is apparently senseless but she has tried to explicate the supposed difference between the two.

Ontological reductionism denies the idea of ontological emergence, and claims that emergence is an epistemological phenomenon that only exists through analysis or description of a system, and does not exist fundamentally.

In some scientific disciplines, ontological reductionism takes two forms: token-identity theory and type-identity theory. In this case, &quot;token&quot; refers to a biological process. 

Token ontological reductionism is the idea that every item that exists is a sum item. For perceivable items, it affirms that every perceivable item is a sum of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Token ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is generally accepted.

Type ontological reductionism is the idea that every type of item is a sum type of item, and that every perceivable type of item is a sum of types of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Type ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is often rejected.

Michael Ruse has criticized ontological reductionism as an improper argument against vitalism.

=== Methodological reductionism ===
In a biological context, methodological reductionism means attempting to explain all biological phenomena in terms of their underlying biochemical and molecular processes.

=== In religion ===
Anthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer employed some religious reductionist arguments.

=== Theory reductionism ===
Theory reduction is the process by which a more general theory absorbs a special theory. It can be further divided into translation, derivation, and explanation. For example, both Kepler&#x27;s laws of the motion of the planets and Galileo&#x27;s theories of motion formulated for terrestrial objects are reducible to Newtonian theories of mechanics because all the explanatory power of the former are contained within the latter. Furthermore, the reduction is considered beneficial because Newtonian mechanics is a more general theory—that is, it explains more events than Galileo&#x27;s or Kepler&#x27;s. Besides scientific theories, theory reduction more generally can be the process by which one explanation subsumes another.

=== In mathematics ===
In mathematics, reductionism can be interpreted as the philosophy that all mathematics can (or ought to) be based on a common foundation, which for modern mathematics is usually axiomatic set theory. Ernst Zermelo was one of the major advocates of such an opinion; he also developed much of axiomatic set theory. It has been argued that the generally accepted method of justifying mathematical axioms by their usefulness in common practice can potentially weaken Zermelo&#x27;s reductionist claim.

Jouko Väänänen has argued for second-order logic as a foundation for mathematics instead of set theory, whereas others have argued for category theory as a foundation for certain aspects of mathematics.

The incompleteness theorems of Kurt Gödel, published in 1931, caused doubt about the attainability of an axiomatic foundation for all of mathematics. Any such foundation would have to include axioms powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (a subset of all mathematics). Yet Gödel proved that, for any &quot;consistent&quot; recursively enumerable axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers, there are (model-theoretically) &quot;true&quot; propositions about the natural numbers that cannot be proved from the axioms. Such propositions are known as formally undecidable propositions. For example, the continuum hypothesis is undecidable in the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory as shown by Cohen.

=== In science ===
Reductionist thinking and methods form the basis for many of the well-developed topics of modern science, including much of physics, chemistry and molecular biology. Classical mechanics in particular is seen as a reductionist framework. For instance, we understand the solar system in terms of its components (the sun and the planets) and their interactions. Statistical mechanics can be considered as a reconciliation of macroscopic thermodynamic laws with the reductionist method of explaining macroscopic properties in terms of microscopic components, although it has been argued that reduction in physics &#x27;never goes all the way in practice&#x27;.

=== In computer science ===
The role of reduction in computer science can be thought as a precise and unambiguous mathematical formalization of the philosophical idea of &quot;theory reductionism&quot;. In a general sense, a problem (or set) is said to be reducible to another problem (or set), if there is a computable/feasible method to translate the questions of the former into the latter, so that, if one knows how to computably/feasibly solve the latter problem, then one can computably/feasibly solve the former. Thus, the latter can only be at least as &quot;hard&quot; to solve as the former.

Reduction in theoretical computer science is pervasive in both: the mathematical abstract foundations of computation; and in real-world performance or capability analysis of algorithms. More specifically, reduction is a foundational and central concept, not only in the realm of mathematical logic and abstract computation in computability (or recursive) theory, where it assumes the form of e.g. Turing reduction, but also in the realm of real-world computation in time (or space) complexity analysis of algorithms, where it assumes the form of e.g. polynomial-time reduction. Further, in the even more practical domain of software development, reduction can be seen as the inverse of composition and the conceptual process a programmer applies to a problem in order to produce an alogrithm which solves the problem using a composition of existing algorithms (encoded as subroutines, or subclasses).

== Criticism ==
=== Free will ===

Philosophers of the Enlightenment worked to insulate human free will from reductionism. Descartes separated the material world of mechanical necessity from the world of mental free will. German philosophers introduced the concept of the &quot;noumenal&quot; realm that is not governed by the deterministic laws of &quot;phenomenal&quot; nature, where every event is completely determined by chains of causality. The most influential formulation was by Immanuel Kant, who distinguished between the causal deterministic framework the mind imposes on the world—the phenomenal realm—and the world as it exists for itself, the noumenal realm, which, as he believed, included free will. To insulate theology from reductionism, 19th century post-Enlightenment German theologians, especially Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschl, used the Romantic method of basing religion on the human spirit, so that it is a person&#x27;s feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.

=== Causation ===
Most common philosophical understandings of causation involve reducing it to some collection of non-causal facts. Opponents of these reductionist views have given arguments that the non-causal facts in question are insufficient to determine the causal facts.

Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s metaphysics opposed reductionism. He refers to this as the &quot;fallacy of the misplaced concreteness&quot;. His scheme was to frame a rational, general understanding of phenomena, derived from our reality.

=== In science ===
An alternative term for ontological reductionism is &quot;fragmentalism&quot;, often used in a pejorative sense. In cognitive psychology, George Kelly developed &quot;constructive alternativism&quot; as a form of personal construct psychology and an alternative to what he considered &quot;accumulative fragmentalism&quot;. For this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful mental models of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent &quot;nuggets of truth&quot;. Others argue that inappropriate use of reductionism limits our understanding of complex systems. In particular, ecologist Robert Ulanowicz says that science must develop techniques to study ways in which larger scales of organization influence smaller ones, and also ways in which feedback loops create structure at a given level, independently of details at a lower level of organization. He advocates and uses information theory as a framework to study propensities in natural systems. The limits of the application of reductionism are claimed to be especially evident at levels of organization with greater complexity, including living cells, neural networks (biology), ecosystems, society, and other systems formed from assemblies of large numbers of diverse components linked by multiple feedback loops.
