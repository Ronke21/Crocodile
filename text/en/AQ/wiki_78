<doc id="113020" wikidata="Q696377" url="?curid=113020" title="Revolutionary Girl Utena">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series created by Be-Papas, a production group formed by director Kunihiko Ikuhara and composed of himself, Chiho Saito, Shinya Hasegawa, Yōji Enokido and Yūichirō Oguro. The series was produced by J.C.Staff and originally aired on TV Tokyo from April to December 1997. &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; follows Utena Tenjou, a teenaged girl who is drawn into a sword dueling tournament to win the hand of Anthy Himemiya, a mysterious girl known as the &quot;Rose Bride&quot; who possesses the &quot;power to revolutionize the world&quot;.

Ikuhara was a director on the television anime adaptation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; at Toei Animation in the 1990s; after growing frustrated by the lack of creative control in directing an adapted work, he departed the company in 1996 to create an original series. While he initially conceived of &quot;Utena&quot; as a mainstream  (girls&#x27; anime and manga) series aimed at capitalizing on the commercial success of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, the direction of the series shifted dramatically during production towards an avant-garde and surrealist tone. The series has been described as a deconstruction and subversion of fairy tales and the magical girl genre of manga, making heavy use of allegory and symbolism to comment on themes of gender, sexuality, and coming-of-age. Its visual and narrative style is characterized by a sense of theatrical presentation and staging, drawing inspiration from the all-female Japanese theater troupe the Takarazuka Revue, as well as the experimental theater of Shūji Terayama, whose frequent collaborator J. A. Seazer created the songs featured in the series.

&quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; has been the subject of both domestic and international critical acclaim, and has received many accolades. It has been praised for its treatment of LGBT themes and subject material, and has influenced subsequent animated works. A manga adaptation of &quot;Utena&quot; written and illustrated by Saito was developed contemporaneously with the anime series, and was serialized in the manga magazine &quot;Ciao&quot; beginning in 1996. In 1999, Be-Papas produced the film &quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot; as a follow-up to the television anime series. The series has had several iterations of physical release, including a remaster overseen by Ikuhara in 2008. In North America, &quot;Utena&quot; was initially distributed by Central Park Media starting in 1998; the license for the series has been held by Crunchyroll since its 2023 acquisition of Right Stuf and its subsidiary Nozomi Entertainment, which acquired the license for &quot;Utena&quot; in 2010.

==Plot==

&quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; is divided into three story arcs: the &quot;Student Council Saga&quot; (episodes 1–12), the &quot;Black Rose Saga&quot; (episodes 13–24), and the &quot;Apocalypse Saga&quot; (episodes 25–39).

As a child, Utena Tenjou was given a rose-engraved signet ring by a traveling prince, who promised her that they would one day meet again. Inspired by the encounter, Utena vowed to one day &quot;become a prince&quot; herself. Years later, a teenaged Utena is a student at Ohtori Academy, an exclusive boarding school. She finds herself drawn into a sword dueling tournament with the school&#x27;s Student Council, whose members wear signet rings identical to her own. The duelists compete to win the hand of Anthy Himemiya, a mysterious student known as the &quot;Rose Bride&quot; who is said to possess the &quot;power to revolutionize the world&quot;. Utena emerges victorious in her first duel; obliged to defend her position as the Rose Bride&#x27;s fiancée, she remains in the tournament to protect Anthy from those who seek the power of the Rose Bride for themselves.

After dueling and achieving victory over the council, Utena is confronted by Souji Mikage, a student prodigy who uses his powers of persuasion and knowledge of psychology to manipulate others into becoming duelists. Mikage aims to kill Anthy to install Mamiya Chida, a terminally ill boy, as the Rose Bride. Utena defeats each of Mikage&#x27;s duelists, and ultimately Mikage himself. Following his defeat, Mikage vanishes from Ohtori Academy, and the denizens of the school seemingly forget that he ever existed. It transpires that Akio Ohtori, the school&#x27;s chairman and Anthy&#x27;s brother, was using Mikage as part of a plot to obtain the &quot;power of eternity&quot;. Mamiya was in truth a disguised Anthy, who assisted Akio in his manipulation of Mikage.

Akio appears before each of the Student Council members, and takes them to a place he refers to as &quot;the end of the world&quot;. Following their encounters with Akio, each of the Council members face Utena in rematches. Utena defeats the Council members once more, and is called to the dueling arena to meet the prince from her past. She discovers that the prince was Akio, and that he intends to use her and Anthy to gain the power of eternity for himself. Utena duels Akio to free Anthy from his influence; Anthy, complicit in her brother&#x27;s scheme, intervenes and stabs Utena through the back. Akio attempts and fails to open the sealed gate that holds the power; a gravely injured Utena pries the gate open, where she discovers Anthy inside. Utena reaches out to her, and they briefly join hands as the dueling arena crumbles around them.

Utena vanishes from Ohtori Academy, and all save for Akio and Anthy begin to forget her existence. Akio comments that Utena failed to bring about a revolution, and that he intends to begin a new attempt to attain the power of eternity; Anthy responds that Utena has merely left Ohtori Academy, and that she intends to do the same. Anthy solemnly vows to find Utena, and departs from Akio and the school.

==Characters==
The majority of the characters in &quot;Utena&quot; are school-aged adolescents whose character arcs focus on their psychological and moral growth into adulthood, in the tradition of a &quot;bildungsroman&quot; or coming-of-age story. Series writer Yōji Enokido identified characters who reckon with the transition from youth to maturity by attempting to regress and &quot;take back what they can&#x27;t ever return&quot; as a major theme for the series, and director Kunihiko Ikuhara stated that he developed the cast of &quot;Utena&quot; using the self-described rule to &quot;never give a character only one personality&quot;.

The character designs for the series were created by Chiho Saito based on direction from Ikuhara, which were then adapted for use in the television anime series by Shinya Hasegawa. Hasegawa stated that he was attracted to &quot;Utena&quot; as a project because of Saito&#x27;s art style, distinguished by characters with slender bodies, long limbs, pointed chins, and large eyes, as well as by a stylized focus on the dramatized body movement of characters. He commented that Saito&#x27;s style deviated from the &quot;anime-like&quot; art that was popular in manga of the era, and thus presented a compelling challenge to adapt into anime.

The title character of the series is Utena Tenjou, a middle school-aged girl who seeks to emulate the noble disposition of the prince she encountered in her youth. She is courageous, forthright, and kind, if somewhat naïve and impulsive. Utena is distinguished by her tomboyish demeanor and manner of dress, particularly her insistence on wearing a boys&#x27; school uniform. Ikuhara has characterized Utena as embodying the traits of both a romance heroine and a romanticist hero, describing her in this regard as someone &quot;who has at the same time both the romance of a girl and the romance of a boy.&quot; Utena is voiced by Tomoko Kawakami in Japanese; the magazine &quot;Animage&quot; noted the role as playing against type for the actress, having made a career voicing &quot;boisterous -type characters&quot;. She secured the role in part because she did not read the character description before auditioning and thus spoke naturally, contrasting other actresses who put on a masculine voice. Kawakami stated that she wished to communicate Utena&#x27;s &quot;friendly, good nature and how admirable she is to everyone, while not overdoing the boyishness&quot; in her performance.

After Utena is drawn into the dueling tournament with the school&#x27;s Student Council – president Touga Kiryuu, his sister Nanami Kiryuu, vice president Kyouichi Saionji, fencing team captain Juri Arisugawa, and boy genius Miki Kaoru – she is introduced to Anthy Himemiya, the mysterious &quot;Rose Bride&quot; at the center of the duels. As the Rose Bride, Anthy is submissive to the personality and disposition of whomever is the current champion of the tournament, and possesses seemingly no free will or independent identity of her own. Though at first glance Anthy resembles a stereotypical damsel in distress defined by her passivity and demureness, as the series progresses, she is revealed to occupy a central role in controlling the duels and the school itself with her brother Akio Ohtori. In early development, Ikuhara conceived of Utena and Anthy as a single character: a girl &quot;who wants to be a prince, but at the same time also wanted to remain a princess&quot;. He ultimately split the character in two, Anthy becoming &quot;another Utena&quot; who by contrast wishes to &quot;remain a princess&quot;. Ikuhara stated that he consciously crafted the plot and visuals of &quot;Utena&quot; to create a strong impression on the viewer that the series would climax with Utena saving Anthy, but the lingering question of &quot;but what does she save Anthy &quot;from&quot;?&quot; becomes, per Ikuhara, the &quot;central issue&quot; of the series.

==Development==
===Context===

Kunihiko Ikuhara was a director at Toei Animation on the television anime series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in the 1990s, co-directing its second season with Junichi Sato, and serving as the sole director of its third season, fourth season, and the animated film &quot;Sailor Moon R: The Movie&quot;. Frustrated by the lack of creative control in producing a series adapted from an existing work, Ikuhara departed Toei in 1996 to create an original series. To this end, Ikuhara assembled Be-Papas, a group of creative professionals from the anime and manga industry. Its membership consisted of Ikuhara, manga artist Chiho Saito, animator and character designer Shinya Hasegawa, scriptwriter Yōji Enokido, and planner Yūichirō Oguro.

Several of the members of Be-Papas had previously worked together: Hasegawa and Enokido had previously worked with Ikuhara on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, where Enokido wrote many of the episodes featuring Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune; Hasegawa and Enokido had also both worked on the anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Saito was an established manga artist who had not previously worked with the members of Be-Papas, or in anime; Ikuhara decided to base the visuals of the series on her artwork and recruited her to Be-Papas after seeing an illustration from her manga series &quot;Magnolia Waltz&quot; on the cover of a magazine.

===Planning===

Initially, Ikuhara envisioned &quot;Utena&quot; as a mainstream  (girls&#x27; anime and manga) series aimed at capitalizing on the commercial success of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;; Saito characterized the earliest discussions on &quot;Utena&quot; as focused on creating a series &quot;that people will like and [will] be profitable&quot;. The earliest concepts for &quot;Utena&quot; deviated significantly from what became the final series: an initial pitch to project financers was titled &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena Kiss&quot;, and focused on a group of female warriors called the &quot;Neo Elegansar&quot; who battled &quot;the end of the world&quot;. Per Oguro, a basic series concept of &quot;a romantic action show starring a pretty girl who wears boys&#x27; clothes&quot; that had a &quot;Takarazuka style&quot; was eventually settled on. A school setting was also determined in this early concept phase, though other concepts such as the duels and the &quot;Rose Bride&quot; would not be formulated until later in development.

Although the concept for &quot;Utena&quot; originated from Ikuhara, the series as a whole was developed collectively by Be-Papas. The group entered a six-month planning period after Saito joined Be-Papas, which focused on fleshing out the story and setting, as well as determining how Saito&#x27;s visual style could best be imported into anime. Saito also began to contemporaneously write and illustrate a manga adaptation of &quot;Utena&quot; while contributing to the development of the anime series.

&quot;Utena&quot; draws inspiration from several sources – &quot;Animage&quot; described the series as &quot;influenced by [Ikuhara&#x27;s] idiosyncrasies&quot; – including the Takarazuka Revue, the artwork of Jun&#x27;ichi Nakahara, Hermann Hesse&#x27;s novel &quot;Demian&quot;, and the experimental theater of Shūji Terayama. Saito cited the manga series and the 1973 film adaptation of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as among the influences that informed her contributions to &quot;Utena&quot;. Ikuhara has stated that although he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be able to avoid it being said&quot; that &quot;Utena&quot; was influenced by &quot;Princess Knight&quot; and &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; – two manga series famous for their cross-dressing, sword-fighting heroines – throughout the development of &quot;Utena&quot;, he was possessed of an &quot;immense fear&quot; that the series would be seen merely as a parody of those works. Saito stated that she was hired to join the otherwise all-male Be-Papas in part because they were concerned that without a female perspective they would create a parody of manga, which was not their intention.

===Production===

Shortly after Saito&#x27;s manga adaptation of &quot;Utena&quot; began serialization in 1996, negotiations for the broadcast of the &quot;Utena&quot; television anime were settled, and production began. Be-Papas served as the primary production staff for &quot;Utena&quot;, with animation production completed by the animation studio J.C.Staff.

Ikuhara&#x27;s ambitions for &quot;Utena&quot; shifted dramatically after the series commenced production. Believing that the series required &quot;a unique individuality&quot; if it was to find an audience, he abandoned his previous goal of a mass-market hit in favor of more non-commercial aspirations. To this end, he began to incorporate a variety of avant-garde elements into the series, such as theatrical-inspired layouts, a recurring shadow play segment that allegorically comments on the events of each episode, and the experimental choral music of composer J. A. Seazer.

Enokido characterized the production of &quot;Utena&quot; as marked by &quot;an agreeable sense of tension&quot; between the members of Be-Papas. As the direction of the series shifted away from its original commercial focus, production became what Oguro described as a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; between Saito and Ikuhara, as Saito advocated for the original romantic concept for the series over Ikuhara&#x27;s new, more esoteric vision. Ikuhara and Saito particularly quarreled over whether the series should depict the relationship between Utena and Anthy as a romance, and at one point during production did not speak to each other for a period of three months. Saito was initially opposed, not out of an ideological opposition to depicting a same-sex romance, but because she believed the mainstream audience the series was ostensibly attempting to court would respond poorly to anything other than a male-female romance. Ikuhara would conceal the extent to which he intended to present Utena and Anthy&#x27;s relationship as a romance from Saito throughout production; Saito ultimately expressed support for how the series presented the relationship between the characters.

Key individuals involved in the production of &quot;Utena&quot; beyond the membership of Be-Papas included Shingo Kaneko and Tōru Takahashi, who served under Ikuhara as assistant directors. Kaneko described incorporating a &quot;cinematic sensibility&quot; for &quot;Utena&quot; that actively incorporated twists and tricks; Takahashi was initially recruited to the project as an animator by Hasegawa, as they were attending the same vocational school, but was made a director after he expressed his aspiration to do so to Ikuhara. Hiroshi Nagahama was the conceptual designer for the series, designing the dueling area and the Ohtori Academy school buildings. Nagahama compared the design process for &quot;Utena&quot; to creating a stage set, with a focus only on what is seen by the audience. Background art was created by , based on initial designs by Nagahama, and Mamoru Hosoda and Takuya Igarashi were among the storyboard artists for the series.

===Style===

&quot;Utena&quot; is characterized by a high degree of stylization that integrates surrealist and expressionist elements to communicate mood and convey allegorical meaning. Enokido described a sense of &quot;theatrical staging and presentation&quot; as one of the core elements of &quot;Utena&quot;, while Ikuhara has stated that he wanted from the early stages of development for the series to be &quot;operatic&quot;. The series makes use of multiple stylistic flourishes, including the marking of character introductions and other significant plot moments with a decorative black frame anchored by spinning roses, which staff on the series referred to as an &quot;attention mark&quot;. Certain recurring segments such as Utena&#x27;s entry to the dueling arena make use of long segments of animation and music that are identical (or nearly identical) from episode to episode, as analogous to the recurring transformation scenes from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. The duels are themselves heavily stylized, in a manner that scholar and critic Susan J. Napier notes is reminiscent of the ritualized performance style of Noh theater.

Narratively, the series has been described by critics as a deconstruction of fairy tale narratives and a subversion of the magical girl genre of manga. Napier notes how the series uses the narrative and visual aesthetics of these categories, such as princes, castles, romance, beautiful boys, and beautiful girls, to &quot;critique the illusions they offer&quot;. Ikuhara has described directing certain early episodes of the series such as &quot;On the Night of the Ball&quot; specifically to be &quot;uncomfortably stereotypical[ly] &quot; to &quot;strongly impress upon the audience that this was a &#x27; manga anime and establish the tropes that the series intended to subvert. In discussing his aspirations for &quot;Utena&quot; in regards to manga, Ikuhara stated that he wished to create the series as a , an &quot;anime that rounded up all the manga into one&quot; and which expressed all of the broader themes of the genre in a single work.

==Releases==
&quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; was originally broadcast weekly on TV Tokyo from April 2 to December 24, 1997. The series consists of two seasons, respectively composed of episodes 1 to 24 and episodes 25 to 39, and was originally produced on 16 mm film. The series has had several iterations of physical releases in Japan, including a VHS and LaserDisc release beginning in 1997, and a DVD release beginning in 1999. A remastering of the series overseen by Ikuhara was published as two boxed DVD sets released in 2008 and 2009, and as two boxed Blu-Ray sets released in 2013. A limited edition boxed set collecting the entire series on Blu-Ray was released in 2017 in commemoration of the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.

In North America, licensing for &quot;Utena&quot; was overseen by Enoki Films USA; the company produced a proof of concept for potential distributors that localized &quot;Utena&quot; for Western audiences, giving the characters English names and re-titling the series &quot;Ursula&#x27;s Kiss&quot;. North American distribution rights were first acquired by Central Park Media, which released both English dubbed and subtitled editions of the series that preserved the original series title and character names. Central Park released the first thirteen episodes of the series on VHS beginning in 1998; due to licensing issues, the company did not release the series in full until its DVD release beginning in 2002. Central Park&#x27;s licenses were liquidated after the company declared bankruptcy in 2009, and the North American license to &quot;Utena&quot; was acquired by Right Stuf under its Nozomi Entertainment label in 2010. The company released the series on DVD in 2011, the remastered edition of the series on Blu-Ray in 2017, and its own 20th anniversary series boxed set in 2018. Right Stuf and its subsidiaries were acquired by Crunchyroll in 2023.

Outside of North America, &quot;Utena&quot; is licensed by Anime Limited in the United Kingdom and Hanabee in Australia. International broadcast and streaming rights for &quot;Utena&quot; have alternately been acquired by a variety of channels and streaming services, including FUNimation Channel in 2007, Anime Network in 2009, Neon Alley in 2013, Funimation in 2020, and Crunchyroll in 2021.

==Related media==
===Manga===
Contemporaneous with the development of the anime series, Chiho Saito wrote and illustrated a manga adaptation of &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, which was serialized in the manga magazine &quot;Ciao&quot; beginning in 1996. Saito also published a one-shot in &quot;Ciao&quot; titled &quot;The Rose Seal&quot; which depicts Utena before to her transfer to Ohtori Academy, as well as a manga adaptation of the film &quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot; in &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic Special&quot;. An English-language translation of the manga has been published by Viz Media, which also serialized the &quot;Utena&quot; manga in its manga magazine &quot;Animerica Extra&quot;.

Unlike the majority of manga series that are adapted either into or from an anime, the plots of the &quot;Utena&quot; manga and anime deviate significantly from each other. These differences in plot, such as the manga&#x27;s increased focus on the relationship between Utena and Touga, were in part a function of the fact that Saito began to write and illustrate the manga before the anime series went into production. She attempted to incorporate as much material as possible from the scripts Enokido had completed, but was frequently required to use her own judgement in rendering aspects of the story that the anime would ultimately depict in an entirely different manner. &quot;Animerica&quot; described the production of the manga adaptation as &quot;one that got its inspiration largely through [Saito&#x27;s] own confusion about what exactly she was supposed to show, and Ikuhara&#x27;s own vague answers to her questions.&quot; Saito changed editors five times during the manga&#x27;s year-and-a-half long serialization as a result of the confusion around its production.

A sequel to the &quot;Utena&quot; manga series, &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution&quot;, was announced in 2017 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series. Written and illustrated by Saito, the three-chapter series depicts the lives of the primary cast following their departure from Ohtori Academy, and was serialized in the manga magazine &quot;Flowers&quot; from July 2017 to March 2018.

===Soundtrack and music===

Shinkichi Mitsumune scored &quot;Utena&quot;, and the songs in the series are Mitsumune&#x27;s rearrangements of songs by composer J. A. Seazer. Each episode typically features two songs that play as incidental music: &quot;&quot; ( &quot;Absolute Destiny Apocalypse&quot;), which appears as a recurring theme as Utena enters the dueling arena, and a song unique to each episode that plays during the duel itself. The duel songs function similarly to a Greek chorus, commenting on the motivations of the duelists through allegorical lyrics that feature references to religious, scientific, and arcane subjects. The songs are performed by a choir; Ikuhara and Mitsumune participate on some choruses.

Seazer originally produced the songs featured in the series as part of his experimental theater company ( &#x27;Experimental Laboratory of Theatre: Universal Gravitation&#x27;). Ikuhara was significantly influenced by Seazer and , an experimental theater company established by dramatist Shūji Terayama where Seazer served as co-director and composer; following Terayama&#x27;s death, Seazer founded as its successor. Ikuhara had long sought to work with Seazer, describing the experience as &quot;fulfill[ing] the dream I had from my teenage years&quot;, but noted that the financers for &quot;Utena&quot; were strongly opposed to using Seazer&#x27;s music, owing to its highly avant-garde style. Seazer agreed to participate in &quot;Utena&quot; in part because he was a fan of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;.

The series&#x27; theme song is &quot;Rondo-Revolution&quot;, written and performed by Masami Okui, and composed and arranged by Toshiro Yabuki. Ikuhara told Okui to &quot;think of this as a song that will play during the story&#x27;s last scene&quot; when writing &quot;Rondo-Revolution&quot;, though at the time he had not yet decided what the last scene would be beyond a vague concept of two people parting from each other. Ikuhara sent several key phrases to Okui use as lyrics, including &quot;sunlit garden&quot;, &quot;revolutionize&quot;, &quot;lose everything&quot;, &quot;strip down to nothing at all&quot;, and &quot;change the world&quot;. The series uses two ending themes: episodes 1 to 24 use &quot;Truth&quot;, performed by with lyrics by Shoko Fujibayashi; episodes 25 to 38 use &quot;Virtual Star Embryology&quot;, performed by Maki Kamiya with lyrics by Seazer. The final episode uses a scat version of &quot;Rondo-Revolution&quot; performed by Okui as its ending theme.

===Film===

Shortly after the conclusion of the &quot;Utena&quot; anime television series, Be-Papas announced plans to release a feature film follow-up to the series. The film, titled &quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot;, was released in theaters in Japan on August 14, 1999. The film occupies an ambiguous place in the broader &quot;Utena&quot; canon, and has been alternately interpreted as a stand-alone adaptation that exists in its own continuity, and as a sequel that is contiguous with the events of the anime series.

===Stage musicals===
Several musical adaptations of &quot;Utena&quot; have been produced, beginning with &quot;Comedie Musicale Utena: La Fillette Révolutionnaire&quot; in December 1997. The musical was directed by Yūji Mitsuya, staged at the Hakuhinkan Theater in Tokyo, and featured an all-female Takarazuka-inspired cast. This was followed by &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena Hell Rebirth Apocalypse: Advent of the Nirvanic Beauty&quot; in 1999 by director Ei Takatori, and &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena: Choros Imaginary Living Body&quot; in 2000, which starred AKB48 member Mayu Watari as Utena.

A series of 2.5D musical adaptations were announced in 2017 as part of a commemoration project to mark the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; anime. The first musical, &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena: Bud of the White Rose&quot;, was staged in 2018 and adapts the Student Council Saga from the original anime. A sequel adapting the Black Rose Saga, &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena: Blooming Rose of Deepest Black&quot;, was staged in 2019, with the cast and director of &quot;Bud of the White Rose&quot; reprising their roles.

Ikuhara has discussed the early stage adaptations of &quot;Utena&quot; in ambivalent terms, stating that &quot;it looks extremely cheesy&quot; when the theatrical visuals of &quot;Utena&quot; are rendered as literal theater. He served as a supervisor on the 2018 and 2019 musicals, noting that he had previously refused multiple offers to adapt &quot;Utena&quot; into a 2.5D musical, but relented after a producer convinced him that it would be a good way to introduce the series to a younger generation.

===Other media===
Two light novels written by Ichirō Ōkouchi with illustrations by Chiho Saito, titled and , were published by Shogakukan in 1997 and 1998, respectively. A video game, , was developed and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1998. A visual novel with dating sim elements, the game tells an original story about the player character (voiced by Kaoru Fujino), a transfer student at Ohtori Academy. The voice cast of the anime series reprise their roles for the game.

==Themes and analysis==
===Gender===
Utena&#x27;s desire to &quot;become a prince&quot; does not refer to a literal desire to become royalty or change her gender, but rather to her desire to exhibit qualities of courage, compassion, and strength that represent an ideal of princeliness. &quot;Being a prince&quot; thus constitutes a body of ideas connoting a sense of heroic agency, rather than a reflection of Utena&#x27;s gender identity or presentation. The series contrasts the notion of the &quot;prince&quot; to that of the &quot;princess&quot;, represented by the passive, helpless, and objectified Anthy.

Although the simple juxtaposition of prince and princess archetypes could suggest that &quot;Utena&quot; is a straightforward &quot;feminist fairy tale&quot;, Napier argues that the series &quot;is not simply a work of female empowerment&quot;. Napier and other critics argue that &quot;Utena&quot; uses the prince/princess dichotomy to examine how gender roles restrict the development of both women and men, how the victims of this system come to enforce these restrictions on other victims, and ultimately suggests that being a &quot;prince&quot; is as limiting as being a &quot;princess&quot;, as both originate from the same restrictive system. This expression reaches its apex at the climax of the series, when Utena loses her final duel against Akio; though Utena ostensibly fails in her princely attempt to &quot;save&quot; Anthy, her actions cause Anthy to &quot;question the rules governing her own performance as princess&quot;, and provokes her departure from Ohtori to a world where &quot;the categories of prince and princess have been deconstructed and do not matter&quot;.

In considering depictions of gender in &quot;Utena&quot;, critic Mari Kotani cites the character of Utena as an example of a ( &#x27;battling beauty&#x27;), a character archetype originated by psychologist and critic Tamaki Saitō. Kotani argues that Utena is a as her character design &quot;satisfies the lustful eyes of the male voyeur who reads manga for eroticized images of girls&quot;, but that any efforts to objectify Utena are complicated by her crossdressing and role as an active protagonist. She argues that the success of &quot;Utena&quot; lies in its blending of elements of (through its focus on combat) and (through its focus on romance) vis-à-vis the character of Utena, and how this blending &quot;deftly exposes the structure of sexuality implicit in manga for girls&quot;.

===Coming-of-age===

Adolescence and its attendant struggles of personal growth and development are a common theme in Ikuhara&#x27;s works, with a frequent focus on teenaged characters who seek personal change yet are bound to their pasts in ways they are not consciously aware of. This focus on the transition from adolescence implicates &quot;Utena&quot; in the &quot;bildungsroman&quot; genre; the Student Council&#x27;s repeated mantra in which they entreat each other to &quot;crack the world&#x27;s shell&quot; is a modified passage from Hermann Hesse&#x27;s 1919 novel &quot;Demian&quot;, a major work of the &quot;bildungsroman&quot; genre. Typically, characters in Ikuhara&#x27;s works seek a MacGuffin-like device that purports to solve their struggles by accelerating the process of change; in &quot;Utena&quot;, this is represented as the &quot;end of the world&quot;. The device is ultimately revealed to be either unreal or lacking the power that is ascribed to it, but serves to symbolically represent how the characters are constrained by broader systems of power and coercion.

The actual meaning of the &quot;end of the world&quot; is never strictly defined by the series itself, though Ikuhara has discussed the concept in terms of adolescent psychology, connoting the sense of despair one feels upon reaching adulthood and becoming aware of social realities that disillusion an idealized child-like conception of the world. The &quot;end of the world&quot; is contrasted against the &quot;power to revolutionize the world&quot; and the &quot;power of eternity&quot;, also defined only in vague terms within the series, though Ikuhara has described &quot;revolution&quot; in the context of the series as connoting &quot;the power to imagine the future&quot;, and &quot;eternity&quot; as &quot;the power to create an enjoyable future&quot;. Enokido has noted how each of the characters in &quot;Utena&quot; seek their own version of &quot;eternity&quot;, which he describes as representing the &quot;desire to vicariously re-experience times past&quot;, but which ultimately symbolizes the danger of humans being &quot;ruled by sentimentality&quot;.

===Sexuality===
&quot;Utena&quot; depicts multiple gay and lesbian couplings, all of which are treated as legitimate and normal within the world of the series itself. Ikuhara has stated that he wished for the series to have &quot;a sense of diversity&quot; in this regard, and that the series&#x27; normalized depiction of same-sex couples serves to reinforce the core series message of freedom of the self. The series&#x27; depiction of sexuality has been considered in relation to its subversion of fairy tale and magical girl tropes, as the trials Utena faces often occur in the context of efforts to pressure her into the &quot;heroic heterosexuality and monogamy&quot; typical of those genres.

Napier argues that although &quot;Utena&quot;″s depiction of same-sex couplings can be interpreted as indicating that &quot;homoerotic relationships can be part of liberation&quot;, the relationship between Utena and Anthy can also be interpreted as a metaphor for &quot;the need for integration of two sides of the self&quot;. Utena&#x27;s chivalrous desire to &quot;save&quot; Anthy gives her a blinkered perspective that is only resolved through an archetypically feminine understanding of and empathy for Anthy&#x27;s situation; Anthy&#x27;s regressive domesticity is ameliorated after she gains &quot;a dose of masculine assertiveness&quot;. Napier notes that while Akio&#x27;s relationship with Anthy is clearly toxic, the series depicts Utena&#x27;s overt effort to &quot;save&quot; Anthy as itself cloying and overwhelming, and that it is only when Anthy makes the choice herself to leave Ohtori Academy that she begins on the path to develop &quot;a more integrated personality&quot;.

==Reception and influence==
&quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot; has been the subject of both domestic and international praise, and has received many accolades. In 1997, the series won the Animation Kobe award in the &quot;Best Television&quot; category. In 2017, Japanese broadcaster NHK conducted a national poll to determine the one hundred greatest anime in commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of the medium, in which &quot;Utena&quot; placed 30th. &quot;Utena&quot; was listed as one of the ten &quot;best anime ever&quot; by &quot;Anime Insider&quot; and ranked fourth on &quot;Paste&quot;″s list of the best anime of all time. &quot;Anime News Network&quot;″s ranking of the 100 greatest anime films of all time placed &quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot; in eighth; in his review, writer Mike Toole called the television series &quot;the most important anime of the 1990s&quot;.

The series has received particular praise for its treatment of LGBT themes and subject material; reflecting on the series in this regard in 2020, Ikuhara stated that there &quot;are a lot of anime that deal superficially with female-female or male-male relationships, but I think the sense of freedom and of diversity that &quot;Utena&quot; had is one of the reasons that it has such a big fan base even now.&quot; Critics and creators have cited &quot;Utena&quot;&#x27;s influence on subsequent animated works, including &quot;Revue Starlight&quot;, &quot;Princess Tutu&quot;, &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, and &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;. The series has also been credited with prompting a revival in popularity for the music of J. A. Seazer.

Anime and manga scholar Susan J. Napier notes that Japanese critics frequently compared &quot;Utena&quot; to the 1996 anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, given their similar focus on themes of coming-of-age and apocalypse; &quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot; is sometimes referred to by fans as &quot;The End of Utena&quot;, referencing the 1997 film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;. Although Napier considers that &quot;Evangelion&quot; depicts a &quot;pathological apocalypse&quot; where the stakes are the entire world, she characterizes &quot;Utena&quot; as a &quot;baroque apocalypse, one of adolescent emotion where everything is larger than life, identity is at its most problematic, and life itself is lived in the extremes.&quot; Critic Mari Kotani notes the common comparison of &quot;Utena&quot; to &quot;Evangelion&quot;, but states that she regards &quot;Utena&quot; as more directly comparable to early manga, specifically citing the works of Jun&#x27;ichi Nakahara and Macoto Takahashi published in the magazine &quot;&quot;.

<text>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or violation is typically either reported to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.

IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and [[host-based intrusion detection system]]s (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach. The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as exploitation attempts) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of &quot;good&quot; traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system (IPS). Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic.

== Comparison with firewalls ==
Although they both relate to network security, an IDS differs from a firewall in that a conventional network firewall (distinct from a next-generation firewall) uses a static set of rules to permit or deny network connections. It implicitly prevents intrusions, assuming an appropriate set of rules have been defined. Essentially, firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS describes a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system. This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying heuristics and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators. A system that terminates connections is called an intrusion prevention system, and performs access control like an application layer firewall.

== Intrusion detection category ==
IDS can be classified by where detection takes place (network or host) or the detection method that is employed (signature or anomaly-based).

=== Analyzed activity ===

====Network intrusion detection systems====
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network. It performs an analysis of passing traffic on the entire subnet, and matches the traffic that is passed on the subnets to the library of known attacks. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behavior is sensed, the alert can be sent to the administrator. NIDS function to safeguard every device and the entire network from unauthorized access.

An example of an NIDS would be installing it on the subnet where firewalls are located in order to see if someone is trying to break into the firewall. Ideally one would scan all inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that would impair the overall speed of the network. OPNET and NetSim are commonly used tools for simulating network intrusion detection systems. NID Systems are also capable of comparing signatures for similar packets to link and drop harmful detected packets which have a signature matching the records in the NIDS. When we classify the design of the NIDS according to the system interactivity property, there are two types: on-line and off-line NIDS, often referred to as inline and tap mode, respectively. On-line NIDS deals with the network in real time. It analyses the Ethernet packets and applies some rules, to decide if it is an attack or not. Off-line NIDS deals with stored data and passes it through some processes to decide if it is an attack or not.

NIDS can be also combined with other technologies to increase detection and prediction rates. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based IDS are capable of analyzing huge volumes of data due to the hidden layers and non-linear modeling, however this process requires time due its complex structure. This allows IDS to more efficiently recognize intrusion patterns. Neural networks assist IDS in predicting attacks by learning from mistakes; ANN based IDS help develop an early warning system, based on two layers. The first layer accepts single values, while the second layer takes the first&#x27;s layers output as input; the cycle repeats and allows the system to automatically recognize new unforeseen patterns in the network. This system can average 99.9% detection and classification rate, based on research results of 24 network attacks, divided in four categories: DOS, Probe, Remote-to-Local, and user-to-root.

====Host intrusion detection systems====

Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or administrator if suspicious activity is detected. It takes a snapshot of existing system files and matches it to the previous snapshot. If the critical system files were modified or deleted, an alert is sent to the administrator to investigate. An example of HIDS usage can be seen on mission critical machines, which are not expected to change their configurations.

=== Detection method ===

====Signature-based====
Signature-based IDS is the detection of attacks by looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware. This terminology originates from anti-virus software, which refers to these detected patterns as signatures. Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks, it is difficult to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.
In signature-based IDS, the signatures are released by a vendor for all its products. On-time updating of the IDS with the signature is a key aspect.

====Anomaly-based====
Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems were primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks, in part due to the rapid development of malware. The basic approach is to use machine learning to create a model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this model. Since these models can be trained according to the applications and hardware configurations, machine learning based method has a better generalized property in comparison to traditional signature-based IDS. Although this approach enables the detection of previously unknown attacks, it may suffer from false positives: previously unknown legitimate activity may also be classified as malicious. Most of the existing IDSs suffer from the time-consuming during detection process that degrades the performance of IDSs. Efficient feature selection algorithm makes the classification process used in detection more reliable.

New types of what could be called anomaly-based intrusion detection systems are being viewed by Gartner as User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) (an evolution of the user behavior analytics category) and network traffic analysis (NTA). In particular, NTA deals with malicious insiders as well as targeted external attacks that have compromised a user machine or account. Gartner has noted that some organizations have opted for NTA over more traditional IDS.

== Intrusion prevention ==

Some systems may attempt to stop an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts. In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPS have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.

IDPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IDPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g. reconfiguring a firewall) or changing the attack&#x27;s content.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it..

Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent or block intrusions that are detected. IPS can take such actions as sending an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking traffic from the offending IP address. An IPS also can correct errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues, and clean up unwanted transport and network layer options.

=== Classification ===
Intrusion prevention systems can be classified into four different types:

# Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS): monitors the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity.
# Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS): monitor a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols.
# Network behavior analysis (NBA): examines network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware and policy violations.
# Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS): an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host.

=== Detection methods ===
The majority of intrusion prevention systems utilize one of three detection methods: signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis.

# Signature-based detection: Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the Network and compares with pre-configured and pre-determined attack patterns known as signatures. While it is the simplest and most effective method, it fails to detect unknown attacks and variants of known attacks.
# Statistical anomaly-based detection: An IDS which is anomaly-based will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The baseline will identify what is &quot;normal&quot; for that network – what sort of bandwidth is generally used and what protocols are used. It may however, raise a False Positive alarm for legitimate use of bandwidth if the baselines are not intelligently configured. Ensemble models that use Matthews correlation co-efficient to identify unauthorized network traffic have obtained 99.73% accuracy.
# Stateful protocol analysis detection: This method identifies deviations of protocol states by comparing observed events with &quot;pre-determined profiles of generally accepted definitions of benign activity&quot;. While it is capable of knowing and tracing the protocol states, it requires significant resources.

== Placement ==
The correct placement of intrusion detection systems is critical and varies depending on the network. The most common placement is behind the firewall, on the edge of a network. This practice provides the IDS with high visibility of traffic entering your network and will not receive any traffic between users on the network. The edge of the network is the point in which a network connects to the extranet. Another practice that can be accomplished if more resources are available is a strategy where a technician will place their first IDS at the point of highest visibility and depending on resource availability will place another at the next highest point, continuing that process until all points of the network are covered.

If an IDS is placed beyond a network&#x27;s firewall, its main purpose would be to defend against noise from the internet but, more importantly, defend against common attacks, such as port scans and network mapper. An IDS in this position would monitor layers 4 through 7 of the OSI model and would be signature-based. This is a very useful practice, because rather than showing actual breaches into the network that made it through the firewall, attempted breaches will be shown which reduces the amount of false positives. The IDS in this position also assists in decreasing the amount of time it takes to discover successful attacks against a network.

Sometimes an IDS with more advanced features will be integrated with a firewall in order to be able to intercept sophisticated attacks entering the network. Examples of advanced features would include multiple security contexts in the routing level and bridging mode. All of this in turn potentially reduces cost and operational complexity.

Another option for IDS placement is within the actual network. These will reveal attacks or suspicious activity within the network. Ignoring the security within a network can cause many problems, it will either allow users to bring about security risks or allow an attacker who has already broken into the network to roam around freely. Intense intranet security makes it difficult for even those hackers within the network to maneuver around and escalate their privileges.

== Limitations ==
* Noise can severely limit an intrusion detection system&#x27;s effectiveness. Bad packets generated from software bugs, corrupt DNS data, and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high false-alarm rate.
* It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the number of false-alarms. Number of real attacks is often so far below the number of false-alarms that the real attacks are often missed and ignored.
* Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated. A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats. Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to newer strategies.
* For signature-based IDS, there will be lag between a new threat discovery and its signature being applied to the IDS. During this lag time, the IDS will be unable to identify the threat.
* It cannot compensate for weak identification and authentication mechanisms or for weaknesses in network protocols. When an attacker gains access due to weak authentication mechanisms then IDS cannot prevent the adversary from any malpractice.
* Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices. Therefore, the encrypted packet can allow an intrusion to the network that is undiscovered until more significant network intrusions have occurred.
* Intrusion detection software provides information based on the network address that is associated with the IP packet that is sent into the network. This is beneficial if the network address contained in the IP packet is accurate. However, the address that is contained in the IP packet could be faked or scrambled.
* Due to the nature of NIDS systems, and the need for them to analyse protocols as they are captured, NIDS systems can be susceptible to the same protocol-based attacks to which network hosts may be vulnerable. Invalid data and TCP/IP stack attacks may cause a NIDS to crash.
*The security measures on cloud computing do not consider the variation of user&#x27;s privacy needs. They provide the same security mechanism for all users no matter if users are companies or an individual person.

== Evasion techniques ==

There are a number of techniques which attackers are using, the following are considered &#x27;simple&#x27; measures which can be taken to evade IDS:
* Fragmentation: by sending fragmented packets, the attacker will be under the radar and can easily bypass the detection system&#x27;s ability to detect the attack signature.
* Avoiding defaults: The TCP port utilised by a protocol does not always provide an indication to the protocol which is being transported. For example, an IDS may expect to detect a trojan on port 12345. If an attacker had reconfigured it to use a different port, the IDS may not be able to detect the presence of the trojan.
* Coordinated, low-bandwidth attacks: coordinating a scan among numerous attackers (or agents) and allocating different ports or hosts to different attackers makes it difficult for the IDS to correlate the captured packets and deduce that a network scan is in progress.
* Address spoofing/proxying: attackers can increase the difficulty of the Security Administrators ability to determine the source of the attack by using poorly secured or incorrectly configured proxy servers to bounce an attack. If the source is spoofed and bounced by a server, it makes it very difficult for IDS to detect the origin of the attack.
* Pattern change evasion: IDS generally rely on &#x27;pattern matching&#x27; to detect an attack. By changing the data used in the attack slightly, it may be possible to evade detection. For example, an (IMAP) server may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow, and an IDS is able to detect the attack signature of 10 common attack tools. By modifying the payload sent by the tool, so that it does not resemble the data that the IDS expects, it may be possible to evade detection.

== Development ==
The earliest preliminary IDS concept was delineated in 1980 by James Anderson at the National Security Agency and consisted of a set of tools intended to help administrators review audit trails. User access logs, file access logs, and system event logs are examples of audit trails.

Fred Cohen noted in 1987 that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case, and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grow with the amount of usage.

Dorothy E. Denning, assisted by Peter G. Neumann, published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today. Her model used statistics for anomaly detection, and resulted in an early IDS at SRI International named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on Sun workstations and could consider both user and network level data. IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based Expert System to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems. The author of &quot;IDES: An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders&quot;, Teresa F. Lunt, proposed adding an artificial neural network as a third component. She said all three components could then report to a resolver. SRI followed IDES in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).

The Multics intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and Lisp, was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann. Haystack was also developed in that year using statistics to reduce audit trails.

In 1986 the National Security Agency started an IDS research transfer program under Rebecca Bace. Bace later published the seminal text on the subject, &quot;Intrusion Detection&quot;, in 2000.

Wisdom &amp; Sense (W&amp;S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. W&amp;S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.

In 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in Common Lisp on a VAX 3500 computer. The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation. The Information Security Officer&#x27;s Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system. ComputerWatch at AT&amp;T Bell Labs used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.

Then, in 1991, researchers at the University of California, Davis created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system. The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory&#x27;s Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt. NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.

The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced Bro in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from libpcap data. Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.

APE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed Snort one month later. Snort has since become the world&#x27;s largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users. It can monitor both local systems, and remote capture points using the TZSP protocol.

The Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used tcpdump to build profiles of rules for classifications. In 2003, Yongguang Zhang and Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.

In 2015, Viegas and his colleagues proposed an anomaly-based intrusion detection engine, aiming System-on-Chip (SoC) for applications in Internet of Things (IoT), for instance. The proposal applies machine learning for anomaly detection, providing energy-efficiency to a Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers implementation in an Atom CPU and its hardware-friendly implementation in a FPGA. In the literature, this was the first work that implement each classifier equivalently in software and hardware and measures its energy consumption on both. Additionally, it was the first time that was measured the energy consumption for extracting each features used to make the network packet classification, implemented in software and hardware.

<doc id="113023" wikidata="Q467681" url="?curid=113023" title="Oh My Goddess!">
<text>, or Ah! My Goddess! in some releases, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kōsuke Fujishima. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from September 1988 to April 2014, with its chapters collected in 48 volumes. The series follows college sophomore Keiichi Morisato and the goddess Belldandy who moves in with him in a Buddhist temple; after Belldandy&#x27;s sisters Urd and Skuld move in with them, they encounter gods, demons and other supernatural entities as Keiichi develops his relationship with Belldandy. The manga series has been licensed for English-language release by Dark Horse Comics.

The series was adapted into an original video animation produced by Anime International Company (AIC), and an anime series which aired from 2005 to 2006. Additionally, AIC has developed two OVAs and a film, and OLM, Inc. has also developed an anime series as well. Companies have developed thousands of types of merchandise, such as video games, and a light novel. The OVA was licensed by AnimEigo, while the film was licensed by Geneon Entertainment, and the various TV series were licensed at various points by Media Blasters, ADV Films and Funimation.

As of June 2020, the manga had over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series. In 2009, &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; won the 33rd Kodansha Manga Award for the general category.

==Story==
===Plot===

Keiichi Morisato is a college sophomore who accidentally calls the Goddess Help Line. The goddess Belldandy materializes and tells him that her agency has received a system request from him and has been sent to grant him a single wish. Believing that a practical joke is being played on him, he wishes that she will stay with him forever, and his wish is granted.

Since he is unable to live with Belldandy in his male-only dorms, they are forced to look for alternative housing, eventually seeking shelter in an old Buddhist temple. They are allowed to stay there indefinitely after the young monk living there leaves on a pilgrimage to India upon being impressed by Belldandy&#x27;s intrinsic goodness. Keiichi&#x27;s life with Belldandy becomes even more hectic when her elder sister Urd and her younger sister Skuld move in as well. A series of adventures ensue as his relationship with Belldandy develops.

===Setting===
The &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; universe is fashioned loosely around Celtic/Norse Mythology; various names and concepts are recycled for humor. Three worlds exist in the Universe of Oh My Goddess: Heaven (Valhalla), Hell (Niflheim), and Earth. Heaven is the realm of the All Mighty and goddesses, Hell is the realm of Hild and demons, and Earth is the realm of humans. Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system, named Yggdrasil.

Each goddess is assigned Class, Category, and Restrictions. Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic. First Class goddesses are held to a stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie. There are also three categories: Administration, Commercial (Field), and Special Duty. Limited and Unlimited restrictions indicates boundaries on permitted actions. Goddesses may be penalized for dereliction of duty and may have their license suspended for a time. A goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked. Belldandy is a Goddess First Class, Second Category, Unlimited License. Urd and Skuld are Goddesses Second Class, First Category, Limited License. Goddesses also wear power limiters, usually in the form of jewelry.

The goddesses&#x27; purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them. Toward that end, Heaven has created the Goddess Technical Helpline (also called Goddess Relief Agency), designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth, especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune. A competing institution named the &quot;Earth Assistance Center&quot;, also is staffed by goddesses. In most scenarios, a goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish. The wish must be approved by the system, after which a contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the Yggdrasil system as a file. The wish contract file is protected by a passcode known to the Goddess. As demons work toward the opposite end, the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance. Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and to prevent bloodshed between them, each god is linked to a demon by a life contract, thus if one of them is killed, the other perishes as well, with their memories of the contract erased to ensure no one knows who is paired with whom.

Demons have similar class and license restrictions, and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels. A seal exists between the demon world and Earth, named the Gate to the Netherworld. It was &quot;created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods.&quot; As such, demons require a catalyst to manifest on Earth. The demons possess a system similar to Yggdrasil, named Nidhogg. Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away. The demons also operate in a fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes, but often at a price.

A goddess does not have an angel automatically, but receives one in egg form. When her power matures, the egg hatches into an angel, becoming a lifetime companion. The angel always obeys the goddess, being a reflection of the goddess&#x27; inner self.

Other creatures that exist in the Earth plane are a multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life. These include the spirits of Money, Wind, Engine and such. More specific entities include Earth spirits, which are guardians over a specific area of land. Morgan le Fay, a villain from the movie, is probably a high ranking Earth spirit (or a being from another dimension, but that is less likely because her tragic love story with a human must have happened on Earth) who demonstrates great strength fighting Belldandy and Urd, even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level.

==Production==
Before starting work on &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;, Kōsuke Fujishima created the manga &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest!&quot;. Miyuki Kobayakawa, one of the principal characters of &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest!&quot;, was featured as a goddess character in a four-panel gag strip in the manga. While the exact relationship between this initial goddess character and the &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; series is unclear, there are suggestions that &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; can be viewed as a spin-off series. Irrespective of the origin, the concept of a goddess &quot;as a job&quot; interested Fujishima, leading to the first appearance of the &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; series in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; in September 1988.

===Title discrepancy===
Translating the original Japanese title of proved to be problematic. Fred Patten, in writing the preface to the collection &quot;Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews&quot;, stated that fans were still debating whether &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; or &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; should be used at the time of writing, approximately 15 years after the first &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; manga was published. When the United States anime import company AnimEigo obtained the original video animation (OVA) rights, they titled the series &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;. This approach was also followed by Toren Smith and Dark Horse Comics when translating the manga, released in concert with the OVA series in 1994. Smith has since stated that he saw the title as a play on &quot;Oh my god!&quot;, and felt that there was no problem when translating it. Smith confirmed that his interpretation of the author&#x27;s intent was correct by consulting with Fujishima. Nevertheless, Kodansha&#x27;s bilingual release of the manga used &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;, as did Pioneer&#x27;s North American release of the film, and Media Blasters&#x27;s 2005 DVD release of the TV series.

Fujishima stated in Animerica that &quot;Oh&quot; was closer to his intent, but acknowledged that the title should be rendered so as to make sense within the country that it is published, and specifically stated that films may warrant different titles than other works. He did, however, state that he would prefer to see consistency between the titles of the manga and those of the animations.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Kōsuke Fujishima, &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; started in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; in September 1988, and finished after a 25-year run on April 25, 2014. Kodansha collected its 308 individual chapters in forty-eight volumes, released from August 23, 1989, to July 23, 2014. The final volume of the manga was also released in Japan as a limited edition box set containing a special edition of volume 48, a mini book of all the &quot;Adventures of Mini-Goddess&quot; comics that appeared in the first volumes of the manga, a drama CD featuring the anime voice actors, and a selection of high quality prints of past volume covers, and the final volume cover.

A spin-off manga series, titled , written by Uhei Aoki and illustrated by Kumichi Yoshizuki, focused on Keiichi and Belldandy&#x27;s lives during a recession, was serialized in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from January 25, 2019, to October 25, 2021. Kodansha published the first &quot;tankōbon&quot; volume on September 20, 2019. The fifth and final volume was released on January 21, 2022.

====English release====
In North America, the series was licensed for English release by Dark Horse Comics and first published in a left-to-right format. The company initially published the first 112 chapters individually from August 1, 1994, to September 1, 2004. They also serialized individual chapters in their defunct manga anthology, &quot;Super Manga Blast!&quot;, from March 29, 2000, to April 25, 2001.

The first three volumes were initially published in a single abridged volume, titled &quot;1-555-GODDESS&quot;, on November 1, 1996. After this release, the following collected volumes contained the regular unabridged chapters (although with different amount of chapters from their respective Japanese volumes, so that each volume better followed story arcs), starting from volume 4, released on October 15, 1997; the first three volumes were later re-released as unabridged volumes between June 5 and October 7, 2002. The 19th and last volume of this edition, numbered &quot;19/20&quot;, which ended on the same chapter as the Japanese volume 20 (129th chapter), was released on January 19, 2005.

From volume 21, released on July 6, 2005, Dark Horse Comics published the volumes following the Japanese right-to-left chapter layout and using a new translation; the first twenty volumes were republished in this format from December 7, 2005, to February 22, 2012. The 48th and last volume was released on October 20, 2015.

In July 2014, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would release a fifteen-volume omnibus edition. The first volume was released on July 29, 2015. As of March 27, 2024, seven volumes have been released.

===Light novel===
The first novel of the series, &quot;Oh My Goddess! First End&quot;, was written by Urd&#x27;s voice actress, Yumi Tōma, with the illustrations done by Fujishima and Hidenori Matsubara, the animation director for several of the series&#x27; animated adaptations. The story follows the manga, taking place three years after Belldandy and Keiichi first meet. The novel was first published in Japan on July 20, 2006 by Kodansha; it was then licensed in English by Dark Horse and released in North America on December 12, 2007.

===Anime===
====Original video animation====

In 1993, Anime International Company, KSS, Tokyo Broadcasting System and Kodansha teamed up to produce a five-episode original video animation (OVA) series based on the manga series. Directed by Hiroaki Gōda and distributed by Pony Canyon, the first episode was released on February 21, 1993, and the final was released on May 17, 1994.

The screenplay was written by Kunihiko Kondo and Nahoko Hasegawa, and the music was provided by Takeshi Yasuda. The character designer was Hidenori Matsubara.

The OVA was licensed for release in North America by AnimEigo, who released all five episodes in individual VHS volumes in both English-language and subtitled Japanese-language editions between June 29, 1994 and August 31, 1994. AnimEigo had released all five episodes on Laserdisc on two laserdiscs in Japanese language with English subtitles and on three laserdiscs in Japanese language with English subtitles on one side and English language on the other side by November 1996. They later released all five episodes across two DVD volumes in 2001, then re-released the episodes in a single &quot;Remastered Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; set in 2006. AnimEigo&#x27;s license expired at the end of February 2010.

In March 2010, TBS announced they were producing a brand new 7-minute OVA for release only with a repackaged and redesigned boxed set for the first season. The first OVA was bundled with the 42nd volume of the manga, released on February 23, 2011. A second OVA was bundled with the 43rd volume, released on September 22, 2011. A third OVA was bundled with the 46th volume, released on August 23, 2013.

====Film====

A film, titled , premiered in Japan in 2000. It saw the return of the main cast, along with several popular characters from the manga who had not appeared in any of the previous anime. It is distributed in Japan by Shochiku and in North America and United Kingdom by Geneon Entertainment in 2001. The plot does not seem to follow any of the existing canon, but uses plot devices from several different story arcs from the manga, mostly the &quot;Lord Of Terror&quot; arc.

====TV series====
=====&quot;The Adventures of Mini-Goddess&quot;=====

A 48 episode TV series called and featuring shrunken versions of Urd, Belldandy, and Skuld in a comedic super deformed style was produced by Oriental Light and Magic and aired on WOWOW from April 6, 1998 through March 29, 1999 as a part of the omnibus show Anime Complex. It is distributed in Japan by Pony Canyon and in North America by Geneon Entertainment. This series departs the most from the original manga storyline, and has almost no continuity with the previous series. The series revolves around the three goddesses and their rat companion Gan-chan, following their adventures in their temple home. The goddesses remain constantly in miniaturized form, for apparent freedom of space and in order to properly interact with Gan-chan.

=====&quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot;=====

&quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; saw another TV iteration under the name &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; in 2005. The episodes, which followed the manga closely, were directed by Hiroaki Gōda, animated by Anime International Company, and produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS). The season began in Japan, on TBS, on January 6, 2005, and ended on July 7, 2005. Bandai Visual released the episodes in Japan between April and November 2005, as eight DVD compilations each containing three episodes. The two original video animations (OVAs), which had not been broadcast, were released on a special DVD on December 23, 2005. The series was licensed for a Region 1 release by Media Blasters. Six DVD compilations, containing all twenty-six episodes, were released between September 2005 and July 2006. Each DVD contained four episodes, excluding the first two, which contained five each. A premium complete season box set was released on November 7, 2006; the regular set followed on November 27, 2007. MVM Films distributed the series in the United Kingdom, with the individual volumes released between February and December 2007 in six similar DVD compilations. The box set followed in July 2008. Media Blasters confirmed on Facebook that the license to &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; has been expired, leaving the series out-of-print, but these episodes are still available on Hulu despite the license expiration.

The success of the first season inspired a second season titled &quot;Ah! My Goddess: Everyone Has Wings&quot;, released as &quot;Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy&quot; in North America. Also directed by Hiroaki Gōda, animated by Anime International Company, and produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System, the series covered the adventures of Keiichi and Belldandy in the aftermath of the Lord of Terror fiasco. It premiered on TBS on April 6, 2006 and concluded on September 14, 2006, picking up the story from where the series left off in season one. Season two concluded with episode 22, although the Japanese and North American DVD releases include episodes 23 and 24. It was released to DVD in Japan between July 2006 and February 2007 by Bandai Visual. Media Blasters, who released the first season, passed up on this season and it was licensed to ADV Films instead. ADV Films released the season on six DVD compilations, each containing four episodes, between May 2007 and March 2008. The rights were then transferred to Funimation, who released a box set on November 25, 2008.

In 2007, &quot;Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings&quot;, a two-episode special to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original publication of &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;, was released. It was directed by Hiroaki Gōda, animated by Anime International Company, and produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System. The episodes aired on December 9, 2007 and Bandai Visual released the episodes on a single DVD in Japan on February 22, 2008.

===Soundtracks===

The Japanese voice actors of the series are also professional singers. Either in the form of Goddess Family Club or an original soundtrack, the series has led to over a dozen albums.

===Video games===

An adventure game titled &quot;Aa! Megami-sama!&quot; for the NEC PC-9801 was released in 1993 by Banpresto. An enhanced port was later released in 1997 for the PC-FX which added voice and other improvements.

A Dreamcast quiz game titled &quot;Quiz: Ah! My Goddess - Stay With Fighting Wings&quot; was released in August 1998 for the Sega Dreamcast. Player plays as Keiichi Morisato answering to questions posed by characters from the anime/manga such as Belldandy, Skuld, Urd, Lind and Peorth.

In February 2007 an &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; game developed by Marvelous Interactive was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2. The game was only released in Japan and was released in 2 editions, the limited edition (also known as the &quot;Holy Box&quot; edition) and the regular DVD edition.

==Reception==
As of June 2020, the manga had over 25 million copies in circulation.
In 2009, &quot;Oh My Goddess&quot; won the 33rd Kodansha Manga Award in the general category. Volume 41 of the manga was the tenth best-selling manga in Japan upon its release that week according to the Oricon Japanese Comic Rankings charts. The film ranked #28 on &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Anime&quot; Magazine on their &quot;Top 50 Anime released in North America&quot;. In the American Anime Awards from 2007, the anime series was a nominee in the category Best Comedy Anime, but lost to &quot;FLCL&quot;.

<doc id="113028" wikidata="Q182056" url="?curid=113028" title="Inuyasha">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from November 1996 to June 2008, with its chapters collected in 56 volumes. The series begins with Kagome Higurashi, a fifteen-year-old middle school girl from modern-day Tokyo who is transported to the Sengoku period after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half-dog demon, half-human Inuyasha. After the sacred Shikon Jewel re-emerges from deep inside Kagome&#x27;s body, she inadvertently shatters it into dozens of fragments that scatter across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome set out to recover Jewel&#x27;s fragments, and through their quest, they are joined by the lecherous monk Miroku, the demon slayer Sango, and the fox demon Shippō. Together, they journey to restore the Shikon Jewel before it falls into the hands of the evil half-demon Naraku.

In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; deals with a darker and more serious subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily display the violent content while still retaining some comedic elements. The manga was adapted into two anime television series by Sunrise. The first series ran for 167 episodes on Yomiuri Television and Nippon Television from October 2000 to September 2004. The second series, &quot;Inuyasha: The Final Act&quot;, is a direct sequel that adapts the remainder of the manga. It ran for 26 episodes from October 2009 to March 2010. Four feature films and an original video animation (OVA) have also been released. Other merchandise includes video games and a light novel. An anime original sequel spin-off television series, titled &quot;Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon&quot;, aired for two seasons from October 2020 to March 2022.

Viz Media licensed the manga, the two anime series, and movies for North America. Both &quot;Inuyasha&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha: The Final Act&quot; aired in the United States on Adult Swim (and later on its revived Toonami block) from 2002 to 2015.

By September 2020, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; had 50 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 2002, the manga won the 47th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category.

== Plot ==
In 1496 Japan, humans and demons () battle over the , which is said to grant any wish. Kikyo, the priestess who keeps the Shikon Jewel, is in love with the half-demon Inuyasha. However, they fall into a deceitful trap and betray each other. Inuyasha steals the Shikon Jewel, but the dying Kikyo pins Inuyasha to a tree with a sacred arrow. Per Kikyo&#x27;s will, her body is cremated along with the Shikon Jewel, which disappeared from the era.

Five hundred years later, Kagome Higurashi lives on the grounds of her family&#x27;s Shinto shrine, with her mother, grandfather and younger brother. On her fifteenth birthday, Kagome is dragged into the enshrined by a centipede demon and sent back in time to the Sengoku period in 1546. The Shikon Jewel manifests from within the body of Kagome, who is Kikyo&#x27;s reincarnation, and she desperately frees Inuyasha from the tree to kill the centipede demon. When Inuyasha threatens her, Kikyo&#x27;s sister Kaede subdues him with a magical bead necklace to keep him under control. Later, Kagome inadvertently shatters the Shikon Jewel into many shards with an arrow, and they scatter across Japan and into the possession of various demons and humans.

Inuyasha obtains his father&#x27;s sword Tessaiga, which places him at odds with his older half-brother Sesshomaru, the wielder of Tenseiga. Inuyasha aids Kagome in collecting the shards and dealing with the threats they come across. On their journey, the presence of Naraku, a spider half-demon who was responsible for manipulating Inuyasha and Kikyo, comes to light. While pursuing Naraku, Inuyasha and Kagome recruit the young fox demon Shippō, the perverted monk Miroku (whose hand was cursed by Naraku), and the demon slayer Sango and her two-tailed demon cat Kirara. Sango&#x27;s clan was killed when they were tricked by Naraku, and her younger brother Kohaku fell under his control. Over time, Inuyasha enhances Tessaiga into stronger forms while defeating his enemies. His team is loosely allied with Sesshomaru, whom Naraku attempted to manipulate, the resurrected Kikyo who plans to purify the Shikon Jewel if all shards are collected, and Kōga, the leader of a wolf demon tribe who seeks to avenge his comrades whom Naraku killed. As Inuyasha and his friends journey together, he and Kagome begin to fall in love with one another, which is complicated by Inuyasha&#x27;s lingering feelings for Kikyo.

Desperately hunted by his enemies, Naraku temporarily removes his heart and wounds Kikyo. Kohaku, having been previously killed but later revived by Naraku and kept alive and under his control by a Shikon Jewel shard, eventually regains his free will and memories, and attempts to escape Naraku&#x27;s group. During that time, Sesshomaru settles his feud with Inuyasha to enable his brother to perfect Tessaiga to its optimal abilities. Kikyo sacrifices herself to give life to Kohaku, and Naraku collects all the shards to restore the Shikon Jewel. As he is slain by Inuyasha and his allies, Naraku reveals his true desire for Kikyo, despite his hatred towards her, and he uses his wish to trap himself and Kagome inside the Shikon Jewel before dying. Revealed to be sentient, the Shikon Jewel intends for Kagome to make a selfish wish so that she and Naraku will be trapped in an eternal conflict, thus prolonging the Jewel&#x27;s existence. However, with Inuyasha by her side, Kagome wishes for the Shikon Jewel to disappear forever, allowing her to return to her time with the well sealed, and she and Inuyasha lose contact for three years.

In that time, the Sengoku period changes drastically: Sango and Miroku marry and have three children together, Kohaku continues his role as a demon slayer, and Shippō trains to make his demon magic stronger. Back in the present, Kagome graduates from high school, and manages to get the Bone Eater&#x27;s Well in her backyard to work again. She returns to the Sengoku period, where she reunites with Inuyasha, marries him, and continues to train with Kaede and become a topmost-level priestess.

== Development ==
Takahashi wrote &quot;Inuyasha&quot; after finishing &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. In contrast to her previous comedic works such as &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1978–1987), &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; (1980–1987), and &quot;One Pound Gospel&quot; (1987–2006), Takahashi wanted to create a darker storyline that was thematically closer to her &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; stories. To portray violent themes softly, the story was set in the Sengoku period, when wars were common. Takahashi did no notable research on the designs of samurai or castles because she considered such topics common knowledge. By June 2001, a clear ending to the series had not been established because Takahashi still was unsure about how to end the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. Furthermore, Takahashi said that she did not have an ending to previous manga she wrote during the beginning, having figured them out as their serialization progressed.

The play&#x27;s script followed the general plot line of the original manga, with a few minor changes to save time. A second run of the play ran from January through February 2001 at the Akasaka ACT Theater in Tokyo.

In February 2017, it was announced that a stage play adaptation of &quot;Inuyasha&quot; would be performed at Tennozu Galaxy Theater in Tokyo from April 6–15 of the same year, featuring Yutaka Kyan from Golden Bomber as Inuyasha and Nogizaka46&#x27;s Yumi Wakatsuki as Kagome.

== Reception ==
=== Manga ===
&quot;Inuyasha&quot; was one of the Manga Division&#x27;s Jury Recommended Works at the fifth and 12th installments of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2001 and 2008, respectively. In 2002, the manga won the 47th Shogakukan Manga Award in the category. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; ranked 28th.

By February 2010, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; had over 45 million copies in circulation. By September 2020, the manga had over 50 million copies in circulation. Individual volumes from &quot;Inuyasha&quot; have been popular in Japan, taking high places in rankings listing sales. In North America, the manga volumes have appeared various times in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Diamond Comic Distributors top selling lists. Moreover, in 2005 &quot;Inuyasha&quot; was one of the most researched series according to Lycos.

Reviewing volume two for Ex.org, Eri Izawa wrote that &quot;Inuyasha&quot; combines many of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s best elements; &quot;fast-paced action, interesting characters, deep doses of imaginative fantasy, a bit of horror, and those famous touches of Takahashi humor.&quot; She also praised the &quot;undeniably intelligent and observant&quot; Kagome as refreshing. Izawa described the faults of the series as subtle and minor; feeling that the action sometimes seems to drag a little and that some of the characters are too familiar to those from Takahashi&#x27;s previous works. Rebecca Bundy began her review of volume 23 of &quot;Inuyasha&quot; for &quot;Anime News Network&quot; by claiming; &quot;Twenty three volumes in and this series still packs a serious punch.&quot; She called its balance of action, conversation, and &quot;reflection&quot; perfect, and noted it had plenty of character development for the main cast, sans Koga. Bundy&#x27;s sole complaint was that she felt the character designs had changed a modest amount since the beginning of the series. Even though they had not read &quot;Inuyasha&quot; since around volume six, Manga Life&#x27;s Penny Kenny said they were able to jump right in with volume 52 thanks in part to the sense of familiarity provided by Takahashi &quot;riffing on the same themes.&quot; Kenny stated that Takahashi&#x27;s genius lies in her &quot;endless improvisations on the standard elements&quot; by adding new enemies and monsters she forces the heroes to up their game and grow as individuals. The reviewer described the art as having little background detail, with Takahashi instead focusing on the characters and their actions. Kenny also noted that, like all of the manga artist&#x27;s works, the drama is heightened by levity, with each character having their own style of humor.

=== Anime ===
The &quot;Inuyasha&quot; anime was ranked twenty by TV Asahi of the 100 best anime series in 2006 based on an online survey in Japan. In ICv2&#x27;s Anime Awards from both 2004 and 2005, the series was the winner in the category of Property of the Year. In the Anime Grand Prix polls by &quot;Animage&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; has appeared various times in the category of Best Anime, taking third place in 2003. In the American Anime Awards from 2007, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; was a nominee in the categories of Best Cast, Best Long Series, and Best Anime Feature, but lost to &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;, respectively. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw &quot;Inuyasha&quot; named Takahashi&#x27;s best animated work. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru were voted first and third place respectively in her characters category.

The English DVDs from the series had sold over one million copies between March 2003 and November 2004, with the first film&#x27;s DVD topping the Nielsen VideoScan anime bestseller list for three weeks. By 2016, Viz Media had sold more than &quot;Inuyasha&quot; home video units. Mania Entertainment listed the series in an article ranking anime series that required a reboot, criticizing the series&#x27; repetitiveness.

<text>Total depravity (also called radical corruption or pervasive depravity) is a Protestant theological doctrine derived from the concept of original sin. It teaches that, as a consequence of the Fall, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin as a result of their fallen nature and, apart from the efficacious (irresistible) or prevenient (enabling) grace of God, is completely unable to choose by themselves to follow God, refrain from evil, or accept the gift of salvation as it is offered.

The doctrine is advocated to various degrees by many Protestant denominations, including Lutheranism and all Calvinist churches. Arminian denominations, such as Methodists, believe and teach total depravity, but with distinct differences, the most important of which is the distinction between irresistible grace and prevenient grace.

== History ==
Contrary to all prior early church fathers, Augustine of Hippo argued that, since the Fall, all humanity is in a self-imposed bondage to sin. All people are inescapably predisposed to evil prior to making any actual choice, and are unable to refrain from sin. Free will is not taken away in the sense of the ability to choose between alternatives, but people are unable to make these choices in service to God rather than self. Thomas Aquinas also taught that people are not able to avoid sin after the Fall, and that this entailed a loss of original righteousness or sinlessness, as well as concupiscence or selfish desire. Duns Scotus, however, modified this interpretation, and only believed that sin entailed a lack of original righteousness. During the Protestant Reformation, the Reformers took Scotus&#x27;s position to be the Catholic position and argued that it made sin only a defect or privation of righteousness rather than an inclination toward evil. Martin Luther, John Calvin and other Reformers used the term &quot;total depravity&quot; to articulate what they claimed to be the Augustinian view that sin corrupts the entire human nature. This did not, however, mean the loss of the &quot;imago Dei&quot; (image of God). The only theologian who argued that the &quot;imago Dei&quot; itself was taken away and that the very substance of fallen humanity was sin was Matthias Flacius Illyricus, and this view was repudiated in the Formula of Concord.

John Calvin used terms like &quot;total depravity&quot; to mean that, despite the ability of people to outwardly uphold the law, there remained an inward distortion which makes all human actions displeasing to God, whether or not they are outwardly good or bad. Even after regeneration, every human action is mixed with evil. Later Calvinist theologians were agreed on this, but the language of the Canons of Dort as well as the 17th century Reformed theologians which followed it did not repeat the language of &quot;total depravity&quot;, and arguably offer a more moderate view on the state of fallen humanity than Calvin.
=== In Arminianism ===
Arminianism also accepts a doctrine of total depravity, although not identical to the Calvinist position. Total depravity was affirmed by the Five articles of Remonstrance, by Jacobus Arminius himself, and by John Wesley, who strongly identified with Arminius through publication of his periodical &quot;The Arminian&quot; and also advocated a strong doctrine of inability. &quot;The Methodist Quarterly Review&quot; states that:

Some Reformed theologians have mistakenly used the term &quot;Arminianism&quot; to include some who hold the Semipelagian doctrine of limited depravity, which allows for an &quot;island of righteousness&quot; in human hearts that is uncorrupted by sin and able to accept God&#x27;s offer of salvation without a special dispensation of grace. Although Arminius and Wesley both vehemently rejected this view, it has sometimes inaccurately been lumped together with theirs (particularly by Calvinists) because of other similarities between their respective systems such as conditional election, unlimited atonement, and prevenient grace. In particular, prevenient grace is viewed by some as giving humans back the freedom to follow God in one way or another.

== Theology ==
Reformed and Lutheran theologians have never considered humans to be absent of goodness or unable to do good outwardly as a result of the fall. People retain the &quot;imago Dei&quot;, though it has been distorted.

Total depravity is the fallen state of human beings as a result of original sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are, as a result of the fall, not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and reject his rule. Even religion and philanthropy are wicked to God because they originate from a selfish human desire and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in Reformed theology, if God is to save anyone, he must predestine, elect, regenerate and call individuals to salvation since fallen humanity does not want to, and is indeed incapable of, choosing him. However, in Arminian theology prevenient grace (or &quot;enabling grace&quot;) does reach through total depravity to enable people to respond to the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ.

Total depravity does not mean that people have lost part of their humanity or are ontologically deteriorated. Just as Adam and Eve were created with the ability not to sin, people retain that essential ability either to sin or not to sin, even though some properties of their humanity are corrupted. It also does not mean that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through humanity.

The total reach of sin taught with the doctrine of total depravity highlights people&#x27;s dire need for God. No part of the person is not in need of grace, and all people are in need of grace, no matter how outwardly pious.

It is important to understand the scope of the &quot;total depravity&quot; of humanity in order to understand the Calvinist–Arminian debate. As noted, both views embrace total depravity; it is a question of the action which they believe God must take to reach humanity in its fallen and depraved state. May God grant to humanity the grace to respond to His offer of salvation, so that all may believe (as Arminius taught)? Or must God&#x27;s grace be irresistible in order to reach humanity (as Calvin taught), so that it is impossible for anyone to be saved unless God first extends to them His irresistible grace? Stated in this manner, there is no substantial difference in total depravity as embraced by Calvinists and Arminians; both agree that humanity is in a state of depravity which prevents them from responding to God. Rather, the two groups have a different belief in the grace which God extended to humanity in response to total depravity. Calvin taught Irresistible Grace; Arminius taught Prevenient Grace.

==Roman Catholic and Orthodox perspectives==
The Roman Catholic Church maintains that a person cannot, &quot;be justified before God by his own works, ... without the grace of God through Jesus Christ&quot;, thereby rejecting Pelagianism in accordance with the writings of Augustine and the Second Council of Orange (529). However, even strictly Augustinian Catholics disagree with the Protestant doctrine of total depravity. Referring to Scripture and the Church Fathers, Catholicism views human free will as deriving from God&#x27;s image because humans are created in God&#x27;s image. Accordingly, the Council of Trent, at its sixth session (January 1547), condemned as heresy any doctrine asserting &quot;since Adam&#x27;s sin, the free will of man is lost and extinguished&quot;. Anyhow the concept of radical depravity is sortway stressed in some Catholic theological currents like Jansenism and Molinism.
The Eastern Orthodox Church embraces the &quot;semi-Augustinian&quot; position of John Cassian and also defends Augustine of Hippo relating to this doctrine. Seraphim Rose, for example, contends that Augustine never denied the free will of every human, thus he never taught total depravity. Archbishop Chrysostomos has likewise asserted that Augustine&#x27;s teaching might have been used and distorted in Western Christianity to produce innovative theologizing, and it is not Augustine&#x27;s fault.

<doc id="113032" wikidata="Q103659" url="?curid=113032" title="Skåne County">
<text>Skåne County ( ), sometimes referred to as Scania County in English, is the southernmost county, or , of Sweden, mostly corresponding to the traditional province of Scania. It borders the counties of Halland, Kronoberg and Blekinge and connects to Capital Region, Denmark by the Öresund Bridge across the Øresund strait. The seat of residence for the Skåne Governor is the city of Malmö. The headquarters of Skåne Regional Council are located in both Kristianstad and Malmö.

The present county was created in 1997 when Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County were merged; it covers around 3% of Sweden&#x27;s total area, while its population of 1.3 million comprises 13% of Sweden&#x27;s total population. Prince Oscar is Duke of Skåne.

==Endonym and exonym==
When the new county was established in 1997, it was named &quot;Skåne län&quot; as its borders coincide with those of the province Skåne. In English, the county as well as the province are sometimes known as &quot;Scania&quot;, but the name Skåne is more frequently used, e.g. by the county administrative board.

== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms for Skåne County is the same as for the province of Skåne, only with the tinctures reversed and the crown, beak and tongue of the griffin in the same color. When the arms are shown with a royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of (royal) government authority. Blazon: &quot;Gules, a Griffin&#x27;s head erased Or, crowned and armed the same.&quot;

== Provinces ==
Skåne County is the administrative equivalent of the province of Skåne, but it also includes an insignificant part of the province of Halland.

== Administration ==
Skåne County is administered by Region Skåne, one of the 20 county councils of Sweden. Its main responsibilities are for the public healthcare system and public transport. In addition, it has for a trial period assumed certain tasks from the County Administrative Board. The two former administrative county councils of the province of Skåne shown on the map, Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County, which were established in 1719, were merged in 1997, forming the present county with boundaries that are almost identical to the boundaries of the province.

The seat of residence for the Governor (&quot;landshövding&quot;) is the city of Malmö. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor. See List of Skåne Governors.

=== County council ===
Region Skåne is an evolved County Council, which was established in 1999 when the County Councils of the former counties were amalgamated.

Its county or regional assembly is the region&#x27;s highest political body, and its members are elected by the electorate, as opposed to the county administrative board, that guards the national interests in the county under the chairmanship of the county governor (&quot;landshövding&quot; in Swedish).

== Municipalities ==

Skåne County contains 33 municipalities (), the largest by population being Malmö Municipality (340,000 inhabitants), Helsingborg Municipality (145,000), Lund Municipality (123,000 inhabitants) and Kristianstad Municipality (85,000 inhabitants). The municipalities have municipal governments, similar to city commissions, and are further divided into parishes. The parish division is traditionally used by the Church of Sweden, but also serves as a divisioning measure for Swedish census and elections.

==Elections==

===Riksdag===
The table details all Riksdag elections held in the area currently constituting Skåne County since the unicameral era began in 1970. Although both were rounded to 49.3 under one decimal, the leftist bloc had 49.33 to 49.25% for the centre-right bloc in the 1970 election.

===Regional===
The county is divided into four parliamentary constituencies or electoral districts, electing 47 of the 349 members of the Riksdag. Each district is made up of one or more municipalities.

In the 2018 general election, the Sweden Democrats performed particularly well in Skåne County, getting the highest number of votes in 21 out of the county&#x27;s 33 municipalities.

Overall representation in the Riksdag during the 2018–2022 mandate period was as follows:

==Localities in order of size==
The ten most populous localities of Skåne County in 2020 were:

The ten largest municipalities of the county by total area are:
== Demographics ==
=== Foreign background ===

SCB have collected statistics on backgrounds of residents since 2002. These tables consist of all who have two foreign-born parents or are born abroad themselves. The chart lists election years and the last year on record alone.

== Transport ==

The motorway built between Malmö and Lund in 1953 was the first motorway in Sweden. With the opening of the Öresund Bridge between Malmö and Copenhagen (the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe) in 2000, the Swedish motorways were linked with European route E20 in Denmark, and the two countries&#x27; railway systems were physically connected. Before the bridge was built there were train ferries operated between Helsingborg and Helsingør. There are also train ferries to and from Germany and Poland.

Skåne has three major public airports, Malmö Airport, Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport and Kristianstad Airport. One of the oldest airports in the world still in use is located in Skåne, namely Ljungbyhed Airport, in operation since 1910. Starting in 1926, the Swedish Air Force used the airport for flight training, and up until the military school was moved to the nearby Ängelholm F10 Wing in 1997, the airport was extremely busy. In the late 1980s, it was Sweden&#x27;s busiest airport, with a record high of more than 1,400 take-offs and landings per day.

The major ports of Skåne are Trelleborg, Ystad, Åhus, Copenhagen Malmö Port, Landskrona Harbour and Helsingborg Harbour. Ferry connections across the Baltic Sea operate from several smaller ports as well.

<doc id="113040" wikidata="Q844877" url="?curid=113040" title="Whole-tone scale">
<text>In music, a whole-tone scale is a scale in which each note is separated from its neighbors by the interval of a whole tone. In twelve-tone equal temperament, there are only two complementary whole-tone scales, both six-note or &quot;hexatonic&quot; scales. A single whole-tone scale can also be thought of as a &quot;six-tone equal temperament&quot;.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 6/4
 c4 d e fis gis ais c
&lt;/score&gt;

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 6/4
 b4 des es f g a b
&lt;/score&gt;

The whole-tone scale has no leading tone and because all tones are the same distance apart, &quot;no single tone stands out, [and] the scale creates a blurred, indistinct effect&quot;. This effect is especially emphasised by the fact that triads built on such scale tones are all augmented triads. Indeed, all six tones of a whole-tone scale can be played simply with two augmented triads whose roots are a major second apart. Since they are symmetrical, whole-tone scales do not give a strong impression of the tonic or tonality.

The composer Olivier Messiaen called the whole-tone scale his first mode of limited transposition. The composer and music theorist George Perle calls the whole-tone scale interval cycle 2, or C2. Since there are only two possible whole-tone-scale positions (that is, the whole-tone scale can be transposed only once), it is either C20 or C21. For this reason, the whole-tone scale is also maximally even and may be considered a generated collection.

Due to this symmetry, the hexachord consisting of the whole-tone scale is not distinct under inversion or more than one transposition. Thus many composers have used one of the &quot;almost whole-tone&quot; hexachords, whose &quot;individual structural differences can be seen to result only from a difference in the &#x27;location&#x27;, or placement, of a semitone within the otherwise whole-tone series.&quot; Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s mystic chord is a primary example, being a whole-tone scale with one note raised a semitone; this alteration allows for a greater variety of resources through transposition.

==Classical music==
In 1662, Johann Rudolf Ahle wrote a melody to the lyrics of Franz Joachim Burmeister&#x27;s &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (It is enough), beginning it with four notes of the whole-tone scale on the four syllables. Johann Sebastian Bach chose the chorale to end his cantata &quot;O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort&quot;, BWV 60, set for four parts. The first four measures are shown below.

Mozart also used the scale in his &quot;Musical Joke&quot;, for strings and horns.

In the 19th century, Russian composers went further with melodic and harmonic possibilities of the scale, often to depict the ominous; examples include the endings of the overtures to Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; and Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, and the Commander&#x27;s theme in Dargomyzhsky&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;. Further examples can be found in the works of Rimsky-Korsakov: the sea king&#x27;s music in &quot;Sadko&quot; and also in &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. Shown below is the opening theme to &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, which is &quot;simply a descending whole-tone scale with diatonic trimmings.&quot; Notes in the whole-tone scale are highlighted.

(For some short piano pieces written completely in whole-tone scale, see Nos. 1, 6, and 7 from V.A. Rebikov&#x27;s &quot;Празднество&quot; (&quot;Une fête&quot;), Op. 38, from 1907.)

H. C. Colles names as the &quot;childhood of the whole-tone scale&quot; the music of Berlioz and Schubert in France and Austria and then Russians Glinka and Dargomyzhsky. Claude Debussy, who had been influenced by Russians, along with other impressionist composes made extensive use of whole-tone scales. &quot;Voiles&quot;, the second piece in Debussy&#x27;s first book of &quot;Préludes&quot;, is almost entirely within one whole-tone scale. The opening measures are shown below.

Janáček&#x27;s use of the scale in the bracing opening to the second movement of his &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; is, to quote William W. Austin, &quot;utterly different&quot;. Austin writes, &quot;Janáček’s free chromaticism never loses touch with a diatonic scale for long. Though the whole-tone scale is prominent in much of his music after 1905 when he encountered Debussy, it serves simply to fit the motifs over augmented chords. The same motifs return from the whole-tone to the diatonic scale without emphasizing the contrast.&quot; The first measures of the second movement of &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; are shown below.

Giacomo Puccini used whole-tone scales as well as pentatonic scales in his 1904 opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; to imitate east Asian music styles.

The first of Alban Berg&#x27;s Seven Early Songs opens with a whole-tone passage both in the orchestral accompaniment and in the vocal line that enters a bar later. Berg also quotes the Bach chorale setting referred to above in his Violin Concerto. The last four notes of the 12-tone row Berg used are B, C, E and F, which, together with the first note, G, comprise five of the six notes of the scale.)

Béla Bartók also uses whole-tone scales in his fifth string quartet. Ferruccio Busoni used the whole-tone scale in the right hand part of the &quot;Preludietto, Fughetta ed Esercizio&quot; of his &quot;An die Jugend&quot;, and Franz Liszt had used the technique as early as 1831, in the &quot;Grande Fantaisie sur La clochette&quot;.

==Jazz==
Some early instances of the use of the scale in jazz writing can be found in Bix Beiderbecke&#x27;s &quot;In a Mist&quot; (1928) and Don Redman’s &quot;Chant of the Weed&quot; (1931). In 1958, Gil Evans recorded an arrangement that gives striking coloration to the &quot;abrupt whole-tone lines&quot; of Redman&#x27;s original. Wayne Shorter&#x27;s composition &quot;JuJu&quot; (1965), features heavy use of the whole-tone scale, and John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;One Down, One Up&quot; (1965), is built on two augmented chords arranged in the same simple structure as his earlier tune &quot;Impressions&quot;.

However, these are only the most overt examples of the use of this scale in jazz. A vast number of jazz tunes, including many standards, use augmented chords and their corresponding scales as well, usually to create tension in turnarounds or as a substitute for a dominant seventh chord. For instance a G7 augmented 5th dominant chord in which G altered scale tones would work before resolving to C7, a tritone substitution chord such as D9 or D711 is often used in which D/G whole-tone scale tones will work, the sharpened 11th degree being a G and the flattened 7th being a C, the enharmonic equivalent of B, the major third in the G dominant chord.

Art Tatum and Thelonious Monk are two pianists who used the whole-tone scale extensively and creatively. Monk&#x27;s &quot;Four in One&quot; (1948) and &quot;Trinkle-Tinkle&quot; (1952) are fine examples of this.

A prominent example of the whole-tone scale that made its way into pop music are bars two and four of the opening of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;.

==Non-Western music==
The raga &quot;Sahera&quot; in Hindustani classical music uses the same intervals as the whole-tone scale. Ustad Mehdi Hassan has performed this rāga. &quot;Gopriya&quot; is the corresponding Carnatic rāgam.

If the name &quot;whole tone&quot; used in a broader sense to allow intervals somewhat larger or smaller than 200 cents, then equal divisions of the octave into 5 or 7 steps (240 cents or 171 cents each, respectively) may also be referred to as whole-tone scales. Both are quite common in non-Western music.

<doc id="113045" wikidata="Q937641" url="?curid=113045" title="Maggot Brain">
<text>Maggot Brain is the third studio album by the American funk rock band Funkadelic, released by Westbound Records in July 1971. It was produced by bandleader George Clinton and recorded at United Sound Systems in Detroit during late 1970 and early 1971. The album was the final LP recorded by the original Funkadelic lineup; after its release, founding members Tawl Ross (guitar), Billy Nelson (bass), and Tiki Fulwood (drums) left the band for various reasons.

The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Top 20. It features a ten-minute title track, largely consisting of an improvised solo by guitarist Eddie Hazel. In 2009, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 17th best album of the 1970s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; the 136th greatest album of all time in its updated list.

==Music and lyrics==
The album opens with a spoken word monologue by Funkadelic bandleader George Clinton, which refers to &quot;the maggots in the mind of the universe&quot;. According to legend, the opening title track was recorded in one take when Clinton, under the influence of LSD, told lead guitarist Eddie Hazel to play as if he had just learned his mother was dead; Clinton instructed him &quot;to picture that day, what he would feel, how he would make sense of his life, how he would take a measure of everything that was inside him and let it out through his guitar&quot;. Though several other musicians performed on the track, Clinton de-emphasized them in the final mix so that the focus would be on Hazel. Hazel utilized fuzz and wah effects, inspired by his idol Jimi Hendrix, on the track; Clinton subsequently added delay and other effects during the mixing process, saying: &quot;I Echoplexed it back on itself three or four times. That gave the whole thing an eerie feel, both in the playing and in the sound effects.&quot; Critics have described the solo as &quot;lengthy, mind-melting&quot; and &quot;an emotional apocalypse of sound.&quot;

The subsequent five tracks have been described as &quot;sour harmony-group meditations heavy with bass, keyboard and class consciousness,&quot; with the band exploring a &quot;psychedelic/funk fusion.&quot; &quot;Can You Get to That&quot; features Isaac Hayes&#x27; backing vocal group Hot Buttered Soul, and contains elements of folk blues and gospel music. &quot;You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks&quot; explores interracial love and features electronically distorted drums. &quot;Super Stupid&quot; was described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as a &quot;tale of a dumbass junkie set to a tune Black Sabbath would have been proud of.&quot; The nine-minute closing track &quot;Wars of Armageddon&quot; has been described as a &quot;freak-out&quot; jam, and makes use of &quot;paranoid, psychedelic sound effects and crowd sounds.&quot; Popular music scholar Yuval Taylor described it as &quot;a burning hot prefiguring&quot; of the music that Miles Davis would perform on his 1975 live album &quot;Agharta&quot;.

==Release==
===Title and packaging===
Reportedly, &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; was the nickname of Hazel. Other sources say the title is a reference to band leader George Clinton finding his brother Robert&#x27;s &quot;decomposed dead body, skull cracked, in an apartment in Newark, New Jersey.&quot;

The cover artwork depicts a screaming black woman&#x27;s head coming out of the earth; it was photographed by Joel Brodsky and features model Barbara Cheeseborough. The album&#x27;s liner notes are a polemic on fear provided by the Process Church of the Final Judgment. According to author Rickey Vincent, the organization&#x27;s alleged association with the Manson Family, along with the album&#x27;s foreboding themes and striking artwork, lent Funkadelic the image of a &quot;death-worshipping black rock band.&quot;

=== Commercial performance and aftermath ===
Westbound Records released &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; in July 1971. It peaked at number 108 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album charts, but did not reach the UK Albums Chart.

After the album was released, Funkadelic effectively disbanded. Drummer Tiki Fulwood was fired due to drug use; guitarist Tawl Ross reportedly had a traumatic drug experience after getting into an &quot;acid eating contest, then snorting some raw speed, before completely flipping out&quot;, and did not perform with the group again; and bassist Billy Nelson quit over a money dispute with Clinton. Subsequently, only Clinton, Hazel, and keyboardist Bernie Worrell remained from the original Funkadelic lineup.

A 2005 reissue included three bonus tracks, among them an alternate mix of &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; featuring more of the full band.

== Reception ==
===Initial reviews===
Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in September 1971, Vince Aletti negatively described &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; as &quot;a shattered, desolate landscape with few pleasures,&quot; competently performed but &quot;limited.&quot; He was particularly critical of the record&#x27;s second side, panning it as &quot;dead-end stuff&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau offered qualified praise, calling the title-track &quot;druggy, time-warped super-schlock&quot; and describing &quot;Can You Get to That&quot; as featuring &quot;a rhythm so pronounced and eccentric it could make Berry Gordy twitch to death&quot;; he added that &quot;the funk pervades the rest of the album, but not to the detriment of other peculiarities.&quot;

===Retrospective===

Writing years later for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Taylor called the album &quot;one of the loudest, darkest, most intense records ever made&quot;, and stated that the group &quot;captured the odor of the age, the stench of death and corruption, the weary exhalation of America at its lowest.&quot; Dominque Leone of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;an explosive record, bursting at the seams with exactly the kind of larger than life sound a band called Funkadelic should have made.&quot; Dave Segal, from the same publication, revered it as &quot;a monument of psychedelic funk&quot; and &quot;a defining document of Black rock music in the early &#x27;70s&quot;. Additionally, he called its two bookending tracks &quot;the most evocative expressions of birth and annihilation ever put on record&quot; and suggested that the &quot;soulful funk-rock&quot; tracks in between represent the &quot;hott[est] five-song streak in the Clinton canon&quot;. &quot;The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History&quot; (2006) claimed that &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; and Funkadelic&#x27;s previous two albums &quot;created a whole new kind of psychedelic rock with a dance groove&quot;. Music historian Bob Gulla hailed it as an &quot;iconoclastic funk-rock&quot; record, featuring the best guitar playing of Hazel&#x27;s career. Author Matthew Grant describes the album as marking where &quot;the band really hit their stride.

In a retrospective review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Christgau described the title track as &quot;indelible&quot; and &quot;Wars of Armageddon&quot; as &quot;Funkadelic&#x27;s most incendiary freak-out ever&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot; named it the second best album by the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, and called it &quot;one of the most cathartic R&amp;B albums ever made.&quot; John Bush of AllMusic stated that the group &quot;hit its stride with [the] acid-rock extravaganza.&quot; &quot;Happy Mag&quot; named the album among the five best P-Funk releases, describing it as &quot;an absolute freakout of psychedelic funk sounds&quot;, but also &quot;perhaps Clinton’s most lyrically sparse album&quot;. Fender called the album &quot;an eruption of psychedelic agit-funk that blended the increasingly bleak American story—urban decay, prime time body counts from an ongoing slog through Vietnam, and front page assassinations—with the sounds of Hendrix, Motown, James Brown, Cream, Sly Stone, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Geoffrey Himes names it an exemplary release of progressive soul.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; #486 on its list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, with the magazine raising its rank in 2012 to #479, calling it &quot;the heaviest rock album the P-Funk ever created&quot;. In the 2020 reboot of the list, the album&#x27;s rank increased again to #136. It was also listed in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Influence ==
&quot;Maggot Brain&quot; was also influential to subsequent artists. Vernon Reid of the band Living Colour called the album &quot;a magnum opus of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; Michael Melchiondo (Dean Ween) of Ween has said: &quot;When I heard &#x27;Maggot Brain,&#x27; it was like, [...] there&#x27;s this whole other thing, and it&#x27;s even better, and there&#x27;s more of it. And I can go see it live, and there&#x27;s nine guitar players that are this good. So that was the hugest, hugest deal.&quot; Melchiondo paid tribute to Eddie Hazel on the track &quot;A Tear for Eddie&quot; from Ween&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;. The Mars Volta&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Amputechture&quot; album features a &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;-inspired guitar solo on the song &quot;Vicarious Atonement&quot;. Jazz musician Angel Bat Dawid also drew influence from Funkadelic and &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;. 

The alternative rock band Sleigh Bells sampled &quot;Can You Get To That?&quot; in their hit song &quot;Rill Rill&quot; from their 2010 album &quot;Treats&quot;. Rapper Esham, a pioneer of horrorcore, sampled &quot;You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks&quot; and &quot;Super Stupid&quot; on his 1990 song &quot;Red Rum&quot; from his album &quot;Boomin&#x27; Words from Hell&quot;. Rapper Redman pays tribute to the &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; cover art in the art for his 1994 album &quot;Dare Iz a Darkside&quot;, which contains a song called &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot; featuring Erick Sermon and Keith Murray, which takes its name from the Funkadelic album of the same name. Childish Gambino&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;&quot;Awaken, My Love!&quot;&quot; drew influence from &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, as did D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Black Messiah&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;captured American unrest through the studio murk of Sly Stone, the fervor of Funkadelic and the off-kilter grooves somewhere between J Dilla and Captain Beefheart.&quot; &quot;

&quot;Super Stupid&quot; was the only cover song recorded by the alternative metal band Audioslave, who were influenced by Funkadelic and included the cover as a live bonus track on their 2005 album &quot;Out of Exile&quot;. André 3000 of the hip hop group Outkast said of &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, &quot;That album blew my mind. It made me want to learn to play guitar, and its huge range of styles — funk, bluegrass, country, opera — helped build our sound.&quot; The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, citing its &quot;loose&quot; creative direction as an influence on his own music.

<text>Luc Ferrari (5 February 1929 – 22 August 2005) was a French composer of Italian heritage and a pioneer in musique concrète and electroacoustic music. He was a founding member of RTF&#x27;s Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRMC), working alongside composers such as Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry.

==Biography==
Ferrari was born in Paris, and was trained in music at a very young age. He studied the piano under Alfred Cortot, musical analysis under Olivier Messiaen, and composition under Arthur Honegger. His first works were freely atonal. A case of tuberculosis in his youth interrupted his career as a pianist. From then on he mostly concentrated on musical composition. During this illness he had the opportunity to become acquainted with the radio receiver, and with pioneers such as Schönberg, Berg, and Webern.

In 1954, Ferrari went to the United States to meet Edgard Varèse, whose &quot;Déserts&quot; he had heard on the radio, and had impressed him. This seems to have had a great effect on him, with the tape part in &quot;Déserts&quot; serving as inspiration for Ferrari to use magnetic tape in his own music. In 1958 he co-founded the Groupe de Recherches Musicales with Pierre Schaeffer and François-Bernard Mâche. He taught in institutions around the world, and worked for film, theatre and radio. By the early 1960, Ferrari had begun work on his Hétérozygote, a piece for magnetic tape which uses ambient environmental sounds to suggest a dramatic narrative. The use of ambient recordings was to become a distinctive part of Ferrari&#x27;s musical language.

Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Presque rien No. 1 &#x27;Le Lever du jour au bord de la mer&quot; (1970) is regarded as a classic of its kind. In it, Ferrari takes a day-long recording of environmental sounds at a Yugoslavian beach and, through editing, makes a piece that lasts just twenty-one minutes. It has been seen as an affirmation of John Cage&#x27;s idea that music is always going on all around us, and if only we were to stop to listen to it, we would realise this. Ferrari continued to write purely instrumental music as well as his tape pieces. He also made a number of documentary films on contemporary composers in rehearsal, including Olivier Messiaen and Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Ferrari died in Arezzo, Italy on 22 August 2005, at age 76.

<text>Marshall Space Flight Center (officially the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center; MSFC), located in Redstone Arsenal, Alabama (Huntsville postal address), is the U.S. government&#x27;s civilian rocketry and spacecraft propulsion research center. As the largest NASA center, MSFC&#x27;s first mission was developing the Saturn launch vehicles for the Apollo program. Marshall has been the lead center for the Space Shuttle main propulsion and external tank; payloads and related crew training; International Space Station (ISS) design and assembly; computers, networks, and information management; and the Space Launch System. Located on the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, MSFC is named in honor of General of the Army George C. Marshall.

The center contains the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC), also known as the International Space Station Payload Operations Center. This facility supports ISS launch, payload, and experiment activities at the Kennedy Space Center. The HOSC also monitors rocket launches from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station when a Marshall Center payload is on board.

==History==
MSFC has been NASA&#x27;s lead center for the development of rocket propulsion systems and technologies. During the 1960s, the activities were largely devoted to the Apollo Program, with the Saturn family of launch vehicles designed and tested at MSFC. MSFC also had a major role in post-Apollo activities, including Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and Spacelab and other experimental activities which made use of the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay.

===Groundwork===
After the May 1945 end of World War II in Germany, the US initiated Operation Paperclip to collect a number of scientists and engineers who had been at the center of Nazi Germany&#x27;s advanced military technologies. In August 1945, 127 missile specialists led by Wernher von Braun signed work contracts with the United States Army Ordnance Corps. Most of them had worked on the V-2 missile development under von Braun at Peenemünde. The missile specialists were sent to Fort Bliss, Texas, joining the Army&#x27;s newly formed Research and Development Division Sub-office (Rocket).

For the next five years, von Braun and the German scientists and engineers were primarily engaged in adapting and improving the V-2 missile for U.S. applications. Testing was conducted at nearby White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico. von Braun was allowed to use a WAC Corporal rocket as a second stage for a V-2; the combination, called Bumper, reached a record-breaking altitude.

During World War II, the production and storage of ordnance shells was conducted by three arsenals nearby to Huntsville, Alabama. After the war, these were closed, and the three areas were combined to form Redstone Arsenal. In 1949, the Secretary of the Army approved the transfer of the rocket research and development activities from Fort Bliss to the new center at Redstone Arsenal. Beginning in April 1950, about 1,000 persons were involved in the transfer, including von Braun&#x27;s group. At this time, R&amp;D responsibility for guided missiles was added, and studies began on a medium-range guided missile that eventually became the PGM-11 Redstone.

Over the next decade, missile development at Redstone Arsenal greatly expanded. However, von Braun kept space firmly in his mind, and published a widely read article on this subject. In mid-1952, the Germans were hired as regular civil service employees, with most becoming U.S. citizens in 1954-55. Von Braun was appointed Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division.

In September 1954, von Braun proposed using the Redstone as the main booster of a multi-stage rocket for launching artificial satellites. A year later, a study for Project Orbiter was completed, detailing plans and schedules for a series of scientific satellites. However, the Army&#x27;s official role in the U.S. space satellite program was delayed after higher authorities elected to use the Vanguard rocket then being developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).

In February 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) was established. One of the primary programs was a , single-stage missile that was started the previous year; intended for both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, this was designated the PGM-19 Jupiter. Guidance component testing for this Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) began in March 1956 on a modified Redstone missile dubbed Jupiter A while re-entry vehicle testing began in September 1956 on a Redstone with spin-stabilized upper stages. This ABMA developed Jupiter-C was composed of a Redstone rocket first stage and two upper stages for RV tests or three upper stages for Explorer satellite launches. ABMA had originally planned the 20 September 1956 flight as a satellite launch but, by direct intervention of Eisenhower, was limited to the use of 2 upper stages for an RV test flight traveling downrange and attaining an altitude of . While the Jupiter-C capability was such that it could have placed the fourth stage in orbit, that mission had been assigned to the NRL. Later Jupiter-C flights would be used to launch satellites. The first Jupiter IRBM flight took place from Cape Canaveral in March 1957 with the first successful flight to full range on 31 May. Jupiter was eventually taken over by the U.S. Air Force.

The Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth orbiting satellite, on October 4, 1957. This was followed on November 3 with the second satellite, Sputnik 2. The United States attempted a satellite launch on December 6 using the NRL&#x27;s Vanguard rocket, but it barely struggled off the ground, then fell back and exploded. On January 31, 1958, after finally receiving permission to proceed, von Braun and the ABMA space development team used a Jupiter C in a Juno I configuration (addition of a fourth stage) to successfully place Explorer 1, the first US satellite, into orbit around the Earth.

Effective at the end of March 1958, the U.S. Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), encompassing the ABMA and its newly operational space programs. In August, AOMC and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, a Department of Defense organization) jointly initiated a program managed by ABMA to develop a large space booster of approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust using a cluster of available rocket engines. In early 1959, this vehicle was designated Saturn.

On April 2, President Dwight D. Eisenhower recommended to Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities. On July 29, the President signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, forming the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA incorporated the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Ames Research Center, Langley Research Center, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. Despite the existence of an official space agency, the Army continued with far-reaching space programs. In June 1959, a secret study on Project Horizon was completed by ABMA, detailing plans for using the Saturn booster in establishing a crewed Army outpost on the Moon. Project Horizon was rejected, and the Saturn program was transferred to NASA.

Project Mercury was officially named on 26 November 1958. With a future goal of crewed flight, monkeys Able and Miss Baker were the first living creatures recovered from outer space on May 28, 1959. They had been carried in the nose cone on a Jupiter missile to an altitude of and a distance of , successfully withstanding 38 times the normal pull of gravity. On October 21, 1959, President Eisenhower approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA.

=== Redstone Army Arsenal becomes the Marshall Space Flight Center ===

On July 1, 1960 the Marshall Space Flight Center, or the MSFC, was created out of the old Redstone Arsenal. The Center was then also placed under the jurisdiction of the recently created NASA, and Wernher von Braun was appointed as the Center&#x27;s first NASA Director. Eberhart Rees, who was a former associate of von Braun from Germany, was also appointed as von Braun&#x27;s Deputy for Research and Development. 

At the time of the creation of the MSFC, 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and of land were transferred from AOMC/ABMA to the new MSFC. The official opening date of the MSFC had been July 1, 1960, but its dedication ceremony took place two months later on September 8. At the dedication ceremony President Eisenhower gave a speech. The MSFC was named in honor of General George C. Marshall.

The administrative activities in MSFC were led by persons with backgrounds in traditional U.S. Government functions, but all of the technical heads were individuals who had assisted von Braun in the many successes at the MSFC&#x27;S predecessor, the ABMA, where von Braun had been the Technical Director. The initial technical leaders of the new MSFC had all been former colleagues of von Braun starting back in Germany before World War II. These technical department and/ or division heads were as follows:

*Director – Wernher von Braun
*Deputy Director for R&amp;D – Eberhard F. M. Rees
*Reliability Office – H. August Schulze
*Future Projects Office – Heinz-Hermann Koelle
*Light &amp; Medium Vehicles Office – Hans Hueter
*Saturn Systems Office – O. Hermann Lange
*Technical Program Coordination Office – George N. Constan
*Weapons Systems Office – Werner G. Tiller
*Launch Operations Directorate – Kurt H. Debus
*Aeroballistics Division – Ernst G. Geissler. Included the Future Project Branch until that was dissolved in the mid 1960s.
*Computation Division – Helmut Hölzer
*Fabrication &amp; Assembly Engineering Division – Hans H. Maus
*Guidance &amp; Control Division – Walter Häussermann
*Quality Division – Dieter E. Grau
*Research Projects Division – Ernst Stuhlinger
*Structures &amp; Mechanics Division – William A. Mrazek
*Test Division – Karl L. Heimburg
With the exception of Koelle, all of the technical department and/ or division heads had come to the United States under Operation Paperclip after working together at Peenemünde. Von Braun knew well the capabilities of these individuals and had great confidence in them. In the following decade of developing hardware and technical operations that established new levels of complexity, there was never a single failure of their booster designs during crewed flight.

The initial main project at MSFC was the final preparation of a Redstone rocket for Project Mercury to lift a space capsule carrying the first American into space. Originally scheduled to take place in October 1960, this was postponed several time and on May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard made America&#x27;s first sub-orbital spaceflight.

By 1965, MSFC had about 7,500 government employees. In addition, most of the prime contractors for launch vehicles and related major items (including North American Aviation, Chrysler, Boeing, Douglas Aircraft, Rocketdyne, and IBM) collectively had approximately a similar number of employees working in MSFC facilities.

Several support contracting firms were also involved in the programs; the largest of these was Brown Engineering Company (BECO, later Teledyne Brown Engineering), the first high-technology firm in Huntsville and by this time having some 3,500 employees. In the Saturn-Apollo activities, BECO/TBE provided about 20-million man-hours of support. Milton K. Cummings was the BECO president, Joseph C. Moquin the executive vice president, William A. Girdini led the engineering design and test work, and Raymond C. Watson, Jr., directed the research and advanced systems activities. Cummings Research Park, the second largest park of this type in the US, was named for Cummings in 1973.

====Saturn launch vehicles====
On May 25, 1961, just 20 days after Shepard&#x27;s flight, President John F. Kennedy committed the US to a lunar landing by the end of the decade. The primary mission of MSFC under the Apollo program was developing the heavy-lift Saturn family rockets. This required the development and qualification of three new liquid-fueled rocket engines, the J-2, F-1, and H-1. Additionally, the existing RL10 was improved for use on the Saturn S-IV stage. Leland F. Belew managed the Engine Development Office. The F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle liquid-fueled rocket engine ever used in service; each produced 1.5-million-pounds thrust. Originally started by the U.S. Air Force, responsibility for the development was taken over by ABMA in 1959, and the first test firings at MSFC were in December 1963.

The original vehicle, designated Saturn I, consisted of two propulsion stages and an instrument unit; it was first tested in flight on October 27, 1961. The first stage (S-I) had a cluster of eight H-1 engines, giving approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust total. The four outboard engines were gimbaled to allow vehicle steering. The second stage (SIV) had six gimbaled LR10A-3 engines, producing a combined 90-thousand-pounds thrust. Ten Saturn Is were used in flight-testing of Apollo boilerplate units. Five of the test flights also carried important auxiliary scientific experiments.

The Saturn IB (alternatively known as the Uprated Saturn I) also had two propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IB) also had eight H-1 engines with four gimballed, but the stage had eight fixed fins of equal size fitted to the sides to provide aerodynamic stability. The second stage (S-IVB) had a single J-2 engine that gave a more powerful 230-thousand-pounds thrust. The J-2 was gimbaled and could also be restarted during flight. The vehicle was first flight-tested on February 26, 1966. Fourteen Saturn 1Bs (or partial vehicles) were built, with five used in uncrewed testing and five others used in crewed missions, the last on July 15, 1975.

The Saturn V, an expendable human-rated heavy-lift vehicle, was the most vital element in the Apollo Program. Designed under the direction of Arthur Rudolph, the Saturn V holds the record as the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status from a combined height, weight, and payload standpoint. The Saturn V consisted of three propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IC), had five F-1 engines, giving a combined total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust. The S-II second stage had five J-2 engines with a total of 1.0-million-pounds thrust. The third stage (S-IVB) had a single gimballed J-2 engine with 200-thousand-pounds thrust. As previously noted, the J-2 engine could be restarted in flight. The basic configuration for this heavy-lift vehicle was selected in early 1963, and the name Saturn V was applied at that time (configurations that might have led to Saturn II, III, and IV were discarded).

While the three propulsion stages were the &quot;muscle&quot; of the Saturn V, the Instrument Unit (IU) was the &quot;brains.&quot; The IU was on a 260-inch (6.6-m) diameter, 36-inch (91-cm) high, ring that was held between the third propulsion stage and the LM. It contained the basic guidance system components – a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics – as well as radar, telemetry, and other units. Basically the same IU configuration was used on the Saturn I and IB. With IBM as the prime contractor, the IU was the only full Saturn component manufactured in Huntsville.

The first Saturn V test flight was made on November 9, 1967. On July 16, 1969, as its crowning achievement in the Apollo space program, a Saturn V vehicle lifted the Apollo 11 spacecraft and three astronauts on their journey to the Moon. Other Apollo launches continued through December 6, 1972. The last Saturn V flight was on May 14, 1973, in the Skylab Program (described later). A total of 15 Saturn Vs were built; 13 functioned flawlessly, and the other two remain unused.

====Fabrication and test facilities====
Wernher von Braun believed that the personnel designing the space vehicles should have direct, hands-on participation in the building and testing of the hardware. For this, MSFC had facilities where prototypes of every type of Saturn vehicle were fabricated. Large, special-purpose computers were used in the checkout procedures. Static test stands had been constructed at ABMA for the Redstone and Jupiter rockets. In 1961, the Jupiter stand was modified to test Saturn 1 and 1B stages. A number of other test stands followed, the largest being the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand completed in 1964. At in height, the entire Saturn V could be accommodated. Also completed in 1964, the S1C Static Test Stand was for live firing of the five F-1 engines of the first stage. Delivering a total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust, the tests produced earthquake-like rumbles throughout the Huntsville area and could be heard as far as away.

As the Saturn activities progressed, external facilities and factories were needed. In 1961, The Michoud Rocket Factory near New Orleans, Louisiana, was selected as the Saturn V rocket manufacturing site. A isolated area in Hancock County, Mississippi was selected to conduct Saturn tests. Known as the Mississippi Test Facility (later renamed the John C. Stennis Space Center), this was primarily to test the vehicles built at the rocket factory.

====Early scientific and engineering research====
From the start, MSFC has had strong research projects in science and engineering. Two of the early activities, Highwater and Pegasus, were performed on a non-interference basis while testing the Saturn I vehicle.

In Project Highwater, a dummy Saturn I second stage was filled with of water as ballast. After burnout of the first stage, explosive charges released the water into the upper atmosphere. The project answered questions about the diffusion of liquid propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude. Highwater experiments were carried out in April and November 1962.

Under the Pegasus Satellite Program, the Saturn I second stage was instrumented to study the frequency and penetration depth of micrometeoroids. Two large panels were folded into the empty stage and unfolded in orbit, presenting 2,300 ft2 (210-m2) of instrumented surface. Three Pegasus satellites were launched during 1965, with each one staying in orbit from 3 to 13 years.

=====Lunar exploration=====

There were six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon: Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Apollo 13 had been intended as a landing, but only circled the Moon and returned to Earth after an oxygen tank ruptured and crippled power in the CSM. Except for Apollo 11, all of the missions carried an Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), composed of equipment for seven scientific experiments plus a central remote control station with a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). Scientists from MSFC were among the co-investigators.

The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), popularly known as the &quot;Moon Buggy,&quot; was developed at MSFC to provide transportation for exploring a limited amount of the Moon&#x27;s surface. Not intended in the original planning, by 1969 it became clear that an LRV would be needed to maximize the scientific returns. An LRV was carried on the last three missions, allowing an area similar in size to Manhattan Island to be explored. Outbound they carried an ALSEP to be set up; on the return trip, they carried more than 200 pounds of lunar rock and soil samples. Saverio &quot;Sonny&quot; Morea was the LRV project manager at MSFC.

=====Skylab and ATM=====

The Apollo Applications Program (AAP) involved science-based crewed space missions using surplus Apollo equipment. The lack of interest by Congress resulted in most of the proposed activities being abandoned, but an orbital workshop remained of interest. In December 1965, MSFC was authorized to begin the Orbital Workshop as a formal project. At a meeting at MSFC on August 19, 1966, George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, pinned down the final concept for the major elements. MSFC was assigned responsibility for the development of the orbiting space station hardware as well as overall systems engineering and integration.

For testing and mission simulation, a -diameter water-filled tank, the Neutral Buoyancy Facility, was opened at MSFC in March 1968. Engineers and astronauts used this underwater facility to simulate the weightlessness (or zero-g) environment of space. This was particularly used in training astronauts in activities in zero-g work, especially spacewalks.

The Orbital Workshop was built into the propellant tanks of a Saturn V third stage, being fully refitted on the ground. It was renamed Skylab in February 1970. Two were built – one for flight and the other for testing and mission simulation in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility. Leland F Belew served for eight years as the overall Skylab program director.

Another AAP project that survived was a solar observatory, originally intended to be a deployable attachment to the Apollo spacecraft. Called the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), the project was assigned to MSFC in 1966. As the Orbital Workshop matured into the Skylab, the ATM was added as an appendage, but the two activities were kept as independent development projects. Rein Ise was the ATM project manager at MSFC. The ATM included eight major instruments for observations of the Sun at wavelengths from extreme ultraviolet to infrared. The data was mainly collected on special photographic film; during the Skylab missions, the film had to be changed out by astronauts in spacewalks.

On May 14, 1973, the 77-ton (70,000-kg) Skylab was launched into a 235-nautical-mile (435-km) orbit by the last flown Saturn V. Saturn IB vehicles with their CSMs were used to launch three-person crews to dock with Skylab. Severe damage was sustained during Skylab launch and deployment, resulting in the loss of the station&#x27;s micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. This loss was partially corrected by the first crew, launched May 25; they stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed with the launch dates of July 28 and November 16, with mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. Skylab, including the ATM, logged about 2,000 hours on some 300 scientific and medical experiments. The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on February 8, 1974.

=====Apollo–Soyuz Test Program=====
The Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) was the last flight of a Saturn IB. On 15 July 1975, a three-person crew was launched on a six-day mission to dock with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. The primary purpose was to provide engineering experience for future joint space flights, but both spacecraft also had scientific experiments. This was the last crewed U.S. space mission until April 1981.

====Post-Apollo science====
The High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO) Program involved three missions of large spacecraft in low Earth orbit. Each spacecraft was about in length, massed between , and carried some of experiments for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray investigations. The project provided insights into celestial objects by studying their high-energy radiation from space. Scientists from across the US served as principal investigators.

The HEAO spacecraft concept originated in the late 1960s, but funding did not become available for some time. Using Atlas-Centaur launch vehicles, three highly successful missions were flown: HEAO 1 in August 1977, HEAO 2 (also called the Einstein Observatory) in November 1978, and HEAO 3 in September 1979. Fred A. Speer was the HEAO project manager for MSFC.

Other MSFC-managed space science projects in the 1970s included the Laser Geodynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and Gravity Probe A. In LAGEOS, laser beams from 35 ground stations are reflected by 422 prismatic mirrors on the satellite to track movements in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The measurement accuracy is a few centimeters and it tracks the movement of tectonic plates with comparable accuracy. Conceived and built at MSFC, the LAGEOS was launched by a Delta rocket in May 1976.

Gravity Probe A, also called the Redshift Experiment, used an extremely precise hydrogen maser clock to confirm part of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. The probe was launched in June 1976, by a Scout rocket, and remained in space for near two hours, as intended.

====Space Shuttle development====

On January 5, 1972, President Richard M. Nixon announced plans to develop the Space Shuttle, a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) containing the crew and payload, two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), and the External Tank (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV&#x27;s main engines. MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV&#x27;s three main engines, and the ET. MSFC was also responsible for the integration of Spacelab, a versatile laboratory developed by the European Space Agency and carried in the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay on some flights.

The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975. Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC. The first &quot;Enterprise&quot; OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), was in February 1977; this was followed by free landings in August and October. In March 1978, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC. Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch. The first spaceworthy Space Shuttle, &quot;Columbia&quot;, was completed and placed at the KSC for checking and launch preparation. On April 12, 1981, the &quot;Columbia&quot; made the first orbital test flight.

====Directors, 1960s and 1970s====

*Dr. Wernher von Braun - July 1960 – January 1970
*Dr. Eberhard Rees - March 1970 – January 1973
*Dr. Rocco Petrone - January 1973 – March 1974
*Dr. William R. Lucas - June 1974 – July 1986
===1980s and 1990s – early Shuttle era===
The Space Shuttle was the most complex spacecraft ever built. From the start of the Shuttle program in 1972, the management and development of Space Shuttle propulsion was a major activity at MSFC. Alex A. McCool, Jr. was the first manager of MSFC&#x27;s Space Shuttle Projects Office.

Throughout 1980, engineers at MSFC participated in tests related to plans to launch the first Space Shuttle. During these early tests and prior to each later Shuttle launch, personnel in the Huntsville Operations Support Center monitored consoles to evaluate and help solve any problems at the Florida launch that might involve Shuttle propulsion.

On April 12, 1981, &quot;Columbia&quot; made the first orbital test flight with a crew of two astronauts. This was designated STS-1 (Space Transportation System-1) and verified the combined performance of the entire system. STS-1 was followed by STS-2 on November 12, demonstrating safe re-launch of &quot;Columbia&quot;. During 1982, STS-3 and STS-4 were completed. STS-5, launched November 11, was the first operational mission; carrying four astronauts, two commercial satellite were deployed. In all three of these flights, on-board experiments were carried and conducted on pallets in the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay.

Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; was launched on mission STS-51-L on 28 January 1986, resulting in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster one minute and thirteen seconds into the flight. Subsequent analysis of the high-speed tracking films and telemetry signals showed that a leak occurred in a joint on one of the solid rocket boosters (SRBs). The escaping flame impinged on the surface of the external tank (ET), resulting in the destruction of the vehicle and loss of the crew. The basic cause of the disaster was determined to be an O-ring failure in the right SRB; cold weather was a contributing factor. A redesign and extensive testing of the SRBs was conducted. There were no Space Shuttle missions in the remainder of 1986 or in 1987. Flights resumed in September 1988 with STS-26.

====Shuttle missions and payloads====
The Space Shuttles carried a wide variety of payloads, from scientific research equipment to highly classified military satellites. The flights were assigned a Space Transportation System (STS) number, in general sequenced by the planned launch date. The list of space shuttle missions shows all flights, their missions, and other information.

MSFC managed the adaptation of the Inertial Upper Stage. This solid rocket was first flown in May 1989, propelling the &quot;Magellan&quot; planetary spacecraft from Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot; on a 15-month loop around the Sun and eventually into orbit around Venus for four years of radar surface-mapping.

Many Shuttle flights carried equipment for performing on-board research. Such equipment was accommodated in two forms: on pallets or other arrangements in the Shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay (most often in addition to hardware for the primary mission). The integration of these experimental payloads was the responsibility of MSFC.

Pallet experiments were of a variety of types and complexity, including fluid physics, materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and commercial space processing. For some missions, an aluminum bridge fitting across the cargo bay was used. This could carry 12 standard canisters holding isolated experiments, particularly those under the Getaway Special (GAS) program. GAS flights were made available at low cost to colleges, universities, US companies, individuals, foreign governments, and others.

On some flights, a variety of pallet experiments constituted the full payload, with examples including Astronomy Laboratory-1 (ASTRO-1) and Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS 1).

====Spacelab====
In addition to the pallet experiments flown on the Space Shuttle, many other experiments were performed onboard Spacelab. This was a reusable laboratory consisting of multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier, and other related hardware. Under a program overseen by MSFC, ten Europeans nations jointly designed, built, and financed the first Spacelab through the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO. In addition, Japan funded a Spacelab for STS-47, a dedicated mission.

Over a 15-year period, Spacelab components flew on 22 shuttle missions, the last in April 1998. Examples of Spacelab missions follow:

*Spacelab 1 was flown on STS-9, launched November 28, 1983. A Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; flight, this was the first with six astronauts, including two Payload Specialists from the ESRO. There were 73 experiments carried out in astronomy and physics, atmospheric physics, Earth observations, life sciences, materials sciences, and space plasma physics.
*U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1 (USML-1) was launched in June 1992 on STS-50, the first Extended Duration Orbiter. During 14 days, 31 microgravity experiments were completed in round-the-clock operations. USML-2 was launched in October 1995 on STS-73 with an MSFC scientist, Frederick W. Leslie, as an on-board Payload Specialist.

In early 1990, MSFC&#x27;s Spacelab Mission Operations Control Center was formed to control all Spacelab missions, replacing the Payload Operations Control Center formerly situated at the JSC from which previous Spacelab missions were operated.

====International Space Station====
NASA began planning to build a space station in 1984, named &quot;Freedom&quot; in 1988. By the early 1990s, planning for four different stations were underway: the American &quot;Freedom&quot;, the Soviet/Russian &quot;Mir-2&quot;, the European &quot;Columbus&quot;, and the Japanese &quot;Kibō&quot;. In November 1993, plans for &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Mir-2&quot;, and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is composed of modules assembled in orbit, starting with the Russian module &quot;Zarya&quot; in November 1998. This was followed in December by the first U.S. module, &quot;Unity&quot; also called Node 1, built by Boeing in facilities at MSFC.

ISS assembly continued throughout the next decade, with continuously occupancy since February 7, 2001. Since 1998, 18 major U.S. components on the ISS have been assembled in space. In October 2007, &quot;Harmony&quot; or Node 2, was attached to &quot;Destiny&quot;; also managed by MSFC, this gave connection hubs for European and Japanese modules as well as additional living space, allowing the ISS crew to increase to six. The 18th and final major U.S. and Boeing-built element, the Starboard 6 Truss Segment, was delivered to the ISS in February 2009. With this, the full set of solar arrays could be activated, increasing the power available for science projects to 30 kW. That marked the completion of the United States Orbital Segment (USOS) of the station. On 5 March 2010, Boeing officially turned over the USOS to NASA.

====Hubble Space Telescope====
In 1962, the first Orbiting Solar Observatory was launched, followed by the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially Lyman Spitzer – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.

MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center (GFC) was to develop the scientific instruments and ground-control center. The project scientist was C. Robert O’Dell, then chairman of the Astronomy Department at the University of Chicago. The telescope assembly was designed as a Cassegrain reflector with hyperbolic mirror polished to be diffraction limited; the primary mirror had a diameter of . The mirrors were developed by the optics firm Perkin-Elmer. MSFC could not test the performance of the mirror assembly until the telescope was launched and placed in service.

The LST was named the Hubble Space Telescope in 1983, the original launch date. There were many problems, delays, and cost increases in the program, and the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster delayed the availability of the launch vehicle. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in April 1990, but gave flawed images due to a flawed primary mirror that had spherical aberration. The defect was found when the telescope was in orbit. Fortunately, the Hubble telescope had been designed to allow in-space maintenance, and in December 1993, mission STS-61 carried astronauts to the Hubble to make corrections and change some components. A second repair mission, STS-82, was made in February 1997, and a third, STS-103, in December 1999. Another servicing mission (STS-109) was flown on 1 March 2002. For these repair missions, the astronauts practiced the work in MSFC&#x27;s Neutral Buoyancy Facility, simulating the weightless environment of space.

Based on the success of earlier maintenance missions, NASA decided to have a fifth service mission to Hubble; this was STS-125 flown on May 11, 2009. The maintenance and addition of equipment resulted in Hubble performance considerably better than planned at its origin. It is now expected that the Hubble will remain operational until its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), is available in 2018.

====Chandra X-Ray Observatory====
Even before HEAO-2 (the Einstein Observatory) was launched in 1978, MSFC began preliminary studies for a larger X-ray telescope. To support this effort, in 1976 an X-Ray Test Facility, the only one of its size, was constructed at MSFC for verification testing and calibration of X-ray mirrors, telescope systems, and instruments. With the success of HEAO-2, MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of what was then known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) partners with MSFC, providing the science and operational management.

Work on the AXAF continued through the 1980s. A major review was held in 1992, resulting in many changes; four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. The planned circular orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one-third of the way to the Moon at its farthest point; this eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair using the Space Shuttle, but it placed the spacecraft above the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts for most of its orbit.

AXAF was renamed Chandra X-ray Observatory in 1998. It was launched July 23, 1999, by the Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (STS-93). An Inertial Upper Stage booster adapted by MSFC was used to transport &quot;Chandra&quot; to its high orbit Weighing about , this was the heaviest payload ever launched by a Shuttle. Operationally managed by the SAO, ‘’Chandra’’ has been returning excellent data since being activated. It initially had an expected life of five years, but this has now been extended to 15 years or longer.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory, originating at MSFC, was launched on July 3, 1999, and is operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. With an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond (2.4 μrad), it has a thousand times better resolution than the first orbiting X-ray telescopes. Its highly elliptical orbit allows continuous observations up to 85 percent of its 65-hour orbital period. With its ability to make X-ray images of star clusters, supernova remnants, galactic eruptions, and collisions between clusters of galaxies - in its first decade of operation it has transformed astronomer&#x27;s view of the high-energy universe.

====Compton Gamma Ray Observatory====
The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) was another of NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories. The CGRO was launched April 5, 1991, on Shuttle flight STS-37. At , it was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time. CGRO was 14 years in development by NASA; TRW was the builder. Gamma radiation is the highest energy-level of electromagnetic radiation, having energies above 100 keV and frequencies above 10 exahertz (1019 Hz). Gamma radiation is produced by sub-atomic particle interactions, including those in some astrophysical processes. The continuous flow of cosmic rays bombarding space objects, such as the Moon, generate this radiation. Gamma rays also result in bursts from nuclear reactions. The CGRO was designed to image continuous radiation and to detect bursts.

MSFC was responsible for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, (BATSE). This triggered on sudden changes in gamma count-rates lasting 0.1 to 100 s; it was also capable of detecting less impulsive sources by measuring their modulation using the Earth occultation technique. In nine years of operation, BATSE triggered about 8000 events, of which some 2700 were strong bursts that were analyzed to have come from distant galaxies.

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the CGRO was not designed for on-orbit repair and refurbishment. Thus, after one of its gyroscopes failed, NASA decided that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random. On June 4, 2000, it was intentionally de-orbited, with the debris that did not burn up falling harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. At MSFC, Gerald J. Fishman is the principal investigator of a project to continue examination of data from BATSE and other gamma-ray projects. The 2011 Shaw Prize was shared by Fishman and Italian Enrico Costa for their gamma-ray research.

===2000s and 2010s - late Shuttle and successors===
MSFC is NASA&#x27;s designated developer and integrator of launch systems. The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory serves as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Marshall has the engineering capabilities to take space vehicles from initial concept to sustained service. For manufacturing, the world&#x27;s largest-known welding machine of its type was installed at MSFC in 2008; it is capable of building major, defect-free components for human-rated space vehicles.

In early March 2011, NASA Headquarters announced that MSFC will lead the efforts on a new heavy-lift rocket that, like the Saturn V of the lunar exploration program of the late 1960s, will carry large, human-rated payloads beyond low-Earth orbit. MSFC has the program office for the Space Launch System.

==== Orbital Space Plane ====
The initial plans for the Space Station envisaged a small, low-cost Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) that would provide emergency evacuation capability. The 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster led planners to consider a more capable spacecraft. The Orbital Space Plane (OSP) development got underway in 2001, with an early version then expected to enter service by 2010. In 2004, the knowledge gained on the OSP was transferred to Johnson Space Center (JSC) for use in the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle of the Constellation program. No operational OSP was ever built.

====&quot;Columbia&quot; disaster and Shuttle retirement====
MSFC had responsibility for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s rocket propulsion elements, including the External Tank. On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster was caused by a piece of insulation that broke off the external tank during launch and damaged the thermal protection on the Orbiter&#x27;s left wing.

MSFC was responsible for the external tank, but few or no changes to the tank were made; rather, NASA decided that it was inevitable that some insulation might be lost during launch and thus required that an inspection of the orbiter&#x27;s critical elements be made prior to reentry on future flights.

NASA retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, which left the US dependent upon the Russian &quot;Soyuz&quot; spacecraft for crewed space missions for the next nine years until Demo-2 in 2020.

====Constellation Program====
Between 2004 and early 2010, the Constellation Program was a major NASA activity. MSFC was responsible for the propulsion of the proposed Ares I and Ares V heavy-lift vehicles.

Starting in 2006, the MSFC Exploration Launch Projects Office began work on the Ares projects. On October 28, 2009, an Ares I-X test rocket lifted off from the newly modified Launch Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for a two-minute powered flight; then continued for four additional minutes traveling down range.

====Deep-space astronomy====
The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, initially called the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), is an international, multi-agency space observatory used to study the cosmos. It was launched June 11, 2008, has a design life of 5 years and a goal of 10 years. The primary instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), which is sensitive in the photon energy range of 0.1 to greater than 300 GeV and can view about 20% of the sky at any given moment. The LAT is complemented by the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) which can detect burst of X-rays and gamma rays in the 8-keV to 3-MeV energy range, overlapping with the LAT. The GBM is a collaborative effort between the U.S. National Space Science and Technology Center and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany. MSFC manages the GBM, and Charles A. Meegan of MSFC is the Principal Investigator. Many new discoveries have been made in the initial period of operation. For example, on May 10, 2009, a burst was detected that, by its propagation characteristics, is believed to negate some approaches to a new theory of gravity.

The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), with Gerald J. Fishman of MSFC serving as Principal Investigator, is an ongoing examination of the many years of data from gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and other transient gamma-ray phenomena. The 2011 Shaw Prize, often called &quot;Asia&#x27;s Nobel Prize,&quot; was shared by Fishman and Italian astronomer Enrico Costa for their gamma-ray research.

==Present and future – 2010s onward==
Marshall Space Flight Center has capabilities and projects supporting NASA&#x27;s mission in three key areas: lifting from Earth (Space Vehicles), living and working in space (International Space Station), and understanding our world and beyond (Advanced Scientific Research).

===International Space Station===
The International Space Station is a partnership of the United States, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies. The station has continuously had human occupants since November 2, 2000. Orbiting 16 times daily at an average altitude of about , it passes over some 90 percent of the world&#x27;s surface. It has a mass over , and a crew of six conducts research and prepares the way for future explorations.

It is planned that the International Space Station will be operated at least through the end of 2030. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011, crewed NASA missions to the ISS were supported by Russian Soyuz spacecraft until 2020 when NASA’s Commercial Crew Program became operational with regular launches of SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft atop SpaceX Falcon 9 reusable rockets https://spacenews.com/nasa-and-spacex-finalize-extension-of-commercial-crew-contract/. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner Commercial Crew spacecraft will join upon completion of NASA’s mandated test protocols https://www.space.com/41360-how-boeing-starliner-commercial-spacecraft-works.html. 

MSFC has supported activities in the U.S. Laboratory (&quot;Destiny&quot;) and elsewhere on the International Space Station through the Payload Operations Center (POC). The research activities include experiments on topics ranging from human physiology to physical science. Operating around the clock, scientists, engineers, and flight controllers in the POC link Earth-bound researchers throughout the world with their experiments and astronauts aboard the ISS. , this has included the coordination of more than 1,100 experiments conducted by 41 space-station crew members involved in over 6,000 hours of science research.

===Advanced scientific research===
Hundreds of experiments have been conducted aboard the International Space Station. The deep-space images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory are made possible in part by the people and facilities at Marshall. The MSFC was not only responsible for the design, development, and construction of these telescopes, but it is also now home to the only facility in the world for testing large telescope mirrors in a space-simulated environment. Work is well underway on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will have the largest primary mirror ever assembled in space. In the future, the facility will likely be used for another successor, the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (AT-LAST).

The National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) is a joint research venture between NASA and the seven research universities of the State of Alabama. The primary purpose of NSSTC is to foster collaboration in research between government, academia, and industry. It consists of seven research centers: Advanced Optics, Biotechnology, Global Hydrology &amp; Climate, Information Technology, Material Science, Propulsion, and Space Science. Each center is managed by either MSFC, the host NASA facility, or the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the host university.

====Solar System research====
Teams at MSFC manage NASA&#x27;s programs for exploring the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and other bodies throughout the Solar System. These have included Gravity Probe B, an experiment to test two predictions of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity, and Solar-B, an international mission to study the solar magnetic field and origins of the solar wind, a phenomenon that affects radio transmission on the Earth. The MSFC Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program Office manages projects and directs studies on lunar robotic activities across NASA.

====Climate and weather research====
MSFC also develops systems for monitoring the Earth&#x27;s climate and weather patterns. At the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC), researchers combine data from Earth systems with satellite data to monitor biodiversity conservation and climate change, providing information that improves agriculture, urban planning, and water-resource management.

====Microsatellites====
On November 19, 2010, MSFC entered the new field of microsatellites with the successful launch of FASTSAT (Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite). Part of a joint DoD/NASA payload, it was launched by a Minotaur IV rocket from the Kodiak Launch Complex on Kodiak Island, Alaska. FASTSAT is a platform carrying multiple small payloads to low-Earth orbit, creating opportunities to conduct low-cost scientific and technology research on an autonomous satellite in space. FASTSAT, weighing just under , serves as a full scientific laboratory containing all the resources needed to carry out scientific and technology research operations. It was developed at the MSFC in partnership with the Von Braun Center for Science &amp; Innovation and Dynetics, Inc., both of Huntsville, Alabama. Mark Boudreaux is the project manager for MSFC.

There are six experiments on the FASTSAT bus, including NanoSail-D2, which is itself a nanosatellite – the first satellite launched from another satellite. It was deployed satisfactorily on January 21, 2011.

<text>Cornelis de Houtman (2 April 1565 – 11 September 1599) was a Dutch merchant seaman who commanded the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies. Although the voyage was difficult and yielded only a modest profit, Houtman showed that the Portuguese monopoly on the spice trade was vulnerable. A flurry of Dutch trading voyages followed, eventually leading to the displacement of the Portuguese and the establishment of a Dutch monopoly on spice trading in the East Indies.

==Early life==
Cornelis de Houtman was born in 1565 in Gouda, South Holland. His father, Pieter de Houtman, was a brewer. Cornelis had a younger brother, Frederick de Houtman, born in 1571 and two sisters.

In 1592, Houtman&#x27;s wealthy cousin, Reynier Pauw, and several other prosperous merchants in Amsterdam formed a company, &quot;Compagnie van Verre&quot;, to finance a Dutch trading expedition to the East Indies. Their initial inspiration had been the publication of a series of maps that appeared to show the route to the East Indies. These charts were provided by noted Dutch cartographer, Petrus Plancius, who indicated he had obtained them from Spain&#x27;s royal cosmographer, Bartolomeo de Lasso.

That same year, Pauw sent Houtman to Lisbon along with his brother Frederick. It is unclear whether Houtman had legitimate business in Portugal or went primarily as a commercial spy to gather information about Portuguese spice trade in the East Indies. While they were gone, another Dutch merchant, Jan Huygen van Linschoten, returned to Amsterdam after spending almost nine years in Goa. He brought back extensive information about the region including crucial details on navigation and the spice trade.

== The voyage ==
The merchants determined that Bantam provided the best opportunity to buy spices. On 2 April 1595, four ships left Amsterdam: the , , , and the .
The voyage was beset with trouble from the beginning. Scurvy broke out after only a few weeks, due to insufficient provisions. At Madagascar, where a brief stop was planned, seventy-one people had to be buried. The 71 of the 248 sailors had died, most of scurvy. The Madagascan bay where they were anchored is now known as the Dutch cemetery. After the death of one of the skippers, quarrels broke out among the captains and traders, one was imprisoned on board and locked up in his cabin. In June 1596, the ships finally arrived at Banten, a northwestern port at Java. Jan Huyghen van Linschoten had told them not to pass through the Malacca Strait, which was controlled by the Portuguese, but through Sunda Strait.

De Houtman was introduced to the Sultan of Banten, who promptly entered into an optimistic treaty with the Dutch, writing &quot;We are well content to have a permanent league of alliance and friendship with His Highness the Prince Maurice of Nassau, of the Netherlands and with you, gentlemen.&quot; The local Portuguese traders became very suspicious when De Houtman did not buy any black pepper, and wanted to wait on the next harvest. Unfortunately, De Houtman was undiplomatic and insulting to the sultan, and was turned away for &quot;rude behaviour&quot;, without being able to buy spices at all.

The ships then sailed east to Madura, but were attacked by pirates on the way. In Madura, they were received peacefully, but De Houtman ordered his men to brutally attack and rape the civilian population in revenge for the unrelated earlier piracy.

The ships then sailed for Bali, and met with the island&#x27;s king. They managed to obtain a few pots of peppercorns on 26 February 1597. Two of the crewmembers stayed on the island. At Bawean one of the ships, the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was purposely set on fire, and the crew divided over the other three ships. When the sailors had enough of the exhausting voyage, it was decided not to go to the Moluccas and return to Holland. That evening another one of the skippers died. De Houtman was accused of poisoning him.

Portuguese ships prevented them from taking on water and supplies at Saint Helena. Out of the 249 men crew, only 87 returned, too weak to moor their ships themselves.

== Death ==
Though the trip was a humanitarian disaster and financially probably just broke even, it was a symbolic victory. It may be regarded as the start of the Dutch colonisation of Indonesia. Within five years, 65 more Dutch ships had sailed east to trade. Soon, the Dutch would fully take over the spice trade in and around the Indian Ocean.

On his second trip to the East in 1599, for a different company, De Houtman and his troops arrived in Aceh. The Sultan accepted him peacefully until de Houtman insulted him. He had already clashed with the Banten Sultanate in northwest Java before his arrival in Aceh, and, feeling arrogant, escalated the situation by challenging the Sultan. This led to his defeat at the hands of the first woman admiral in modern world, Admiral Keumalahayati, and her Inong Balee Army.

<text>In psychology, temperament broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes.

Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality. Temperament traits (such as neuroticism, sociability, impulsivity, etc.) are distinct patterns in behavior throughout a lifetime, but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.

==Definition==

Temperament has been defined as &quot;the constellation of inborn traits that determine a child&#x27;s unique behavioral style and the way he or she experiences and reacts to the world.&quot;

===Classification schemes===
Many classification schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus. The Latin word &quot;temperamentum&quot; means &#x27;mixture&#x27;.

===Temperament vs personality===
Some commentators see temperament as one factor underlying personality.

== Main models ==

===Four temperaments model===
Historically, in the second century AD, the physician Galen described four classical temperaments (melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguine and choleric), corresponding to the four humors or bodily fluids. This historical concept was explored by philosophers, psychologists, psychiatrists and psycho-physiologists from very early times of psychological science, with theories proposed by Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze, Ivan Pavlov, Carl Jung, Gerardus Heymans among others. In more recent history, Rudolf Steiner had emphasized the importance of the four classical temperaments in elementary education, the time when he believed the influence of temperament on the personality to be at its strongest. Neither Galen nor Steiner are generally applied to the contemporary study of temperament in the approaches of modern medicine or contemporary psychology.

===Rusalov-Trofimova neurophysiological model of temperament===

This model based on the longest tradition of neurophysiological experiments started within the investigations of types and properties of nervous systems by Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s school. This experimental tradition started on studies with animals in 1910–20s but expanded its methodology to humans since 1930s and especially since 1960s, including EEG, caffeine tests, evoked potentials, behavioral tasks and other psychophysiological methods.

The latest version of this model is based on the &quot;Activity-specific approach in temperament research, on Alexander Luria&#x27;s research in clinical neurophysiology and on the neurochemical model Functional Ensemble of Temperament. At the present time the model is associated with the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire and has 12 scales:

====Endurance-related scales====
* Motor-physical Endurance: the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical activity using well-defined behavioral elements
* Social-verbal Endurance (sociability): the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged social-verbal activities using well-defined behavioral elements.
* Mental Endurance, or Attention: the ability to stay focused on selected features of objects with suppression of behavioral reactivity to other features.

====Scales related to speed of integration of behavior====
* Motor-physical Tempo: speed of integration of an action in physical manipulations with objects with well-defined scripts of actions
* Plasticity: the ability to adapt quickly to changes in situations, to change the program of action, and to shift between different tasks
* Social-verbal Tempo: the preferred speed of speech and ability to understand fast speech on well-known topics, reading and sorting of known verbal material

====Scales related to type of orientation of behavior====
* Sensation Seeking (SS): behavioral orientation to well-defined and existing sensational objects and events, underestimation of outcomes of risky behavior.
* Empathy: behavioral orientation to the emotional states/needs of others (ranging from empathic deafness in autism and schizophrenia disorders to social dependency).
* Sensitivity to Probabilities: the drive to gather information about uniqueness, frequency and values of objects/events, to differentiate their specific features, to project these features in future actions.

====Emotionality scales====
* Satisfaction (Self-Confidence): A disposition to be satisfied with current state of events, a sense of security, confidence in the future. In spite of the optimism about outcomes of his or her activities, the respondent might be negligent in details.
* Impulsivity: Initiation of actions based on immediate emotional reactivity rather than by planning or rational reasoning.
* Neuroticism: A tendency to avoid novelty, unpredictable situations and uncertainty. Preference of well-known settings and people over unknown ones and a need for approval and feedback from people around.

===Kagan&#x27;s research===

Jerome Kagan and his colleagues have concentrated empirical research on a temperamental category termed &quot;reactivity.&quot; Four-month-old infants who became &quot;motorically aroused and distressed&quot; to presentations of novel stimuli were termed &quot;highly reactive&quot;. Those who remained &quot;motorically relaxed and did not cry or fret to the same set of unfamiliar events&quot; were termed &quot;low reactive&quot;. These high and low reactive infants were tested again at 14 and 21 months &quot;in a variety of unfamiliar laboratory situations.&quot; Highly reactive infants were predominantly characterized by a profile of high fear to unfamiliar events, which Kagan termed inhibited. Contrastingly, low reactive children were minimally fearful to novel situations, and were characterized by an uninhibited profile (Kagan). However, when observed again at age 4.5, only a modest proportion of children maintained their expected profile due to mediating factors such as intervening family experiences. Those who remained highly inhibited or uninhibited after age 4.5 were at higher risk for developing anxiety and conduct disorders, respectively.

Kagan also used two additional classifications, one for infants who were inactive but cried frequently (distressed) and one for those who showed vigorous activity but little crying (aroused). Followed to age 14–17 years, these groups of children showed differing outcomes, including some differences in central nervous system activity. Teenagers who had been classed as high reactives when they were babies were more likely to be &quot;subdued in unfamiliar situations, to report a dour mood and anxiety over the future, [and] to be more religious.&quot;

===Thomas and Chess&#x27;s nine temperament characteristics===

Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess, Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn began the classic New York Longitudinal study in the early 1950s regarding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968). The study focused on how temperamental qualities influence adjustment throughout life. Chess, Thomas et al. rated young infants on nine temperament characteristics, each of which, by itself, or with connection to another, affects how well a child fits in at school, with their friends, and at home. Behaviors for each one of these traits are on a continuum. If a child leans towards the high or low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The specific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of sleeping and eating patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of emotion, mood, distractibility, persistence and attention span, and sensory sensitivity. Redundancies between the categories have been found and a reduced list is normally used by psychologists today.

Research by Thomas and Chess used the following nine temperament traits in children based on a classification scheme developed by Dr. Herbert Birch: Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that many babies could be categorized into one of three groups: &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;difficult&quot;, and &quot;slow-to-warm-up&quot; (Thomas &amp; Chess 1977). Not all children can be placed in one of these groups. Approximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the 65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern, and 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its own strength and weakness and one is not superior to another.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn showed that &quot;easy&quot; babies readily adapt to new experiences, generally display positive moods and emotions and also have normal eating and sleeping patterns. &quot;Difficult&quot; babies tend to be very emotional, irritable and fussy, and cry a lot. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping patterns. &quot;Slow-to-warm-up&quot; babies have a low activity level, and tend to withdraw from new situations and people. They are slow to adapt to new experiences, but accept them after repeated exposure.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that these broad patterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable through childhood. These traits are also found in children across all cultures.

Thomas and Chess also studied temperament and environment. One sample consisted of white middle-class families with high educational status and the other was of Puerto Rican working-class families. They found several differences. Among those were:

* Parents of middle class children were more likely to report behavior problems before the age of nine and the children had sleep problems. This may be because children start preschool between the ages of three and four. Puerto Rican children under the age of five showed rare signs of sleep problems, however, sleep problems became more common at the age of six.
* Middle-class parents also placed great stress on the child&#x27;s early development, believing that problems in early ages were indicative of later problems in psychological development, whereas Puerto Rican parents felt their children would outgrow any problems.
* At the age of nine, the report of new problems dropped for middle class children but they rose in Puerto Rican children, possibly due to the demands of school.

Observed traits:

* Activity: refers to the child&#x27;s physical energy. Is the child constantly moving, or does the child have a relaxing approach? A high-energy child may have difficulty sitting still in class, whereas a child with low energy can tolerate a very structured environment. The former may use gross motor skills like running and jumping more frequently. Conversely, a child with a lower activity level may rely more on fine motor skills, such as drawing and putting puzzles together. This trait can also refer to mental activity, such as deep thinking or reading—activities which become more significant as the person matures.
* Regularity: also known as &quot;rhythmicity&quot;, refers to the level of predictability in a child&#x27;s biological functions, such as waking, becoming tired, hunger, and bowel movements. Does the child have a routine in eating and sleeping habits, or are these events more random? For example, a child with a high regularity rating may want to eat at 2 p.m. every day, whereas a child lower on the regularity scale may eat at sporadic times throughout the day.
* Initial reaction: also known as &quot;approach or withdrawal&quot;. This refers to how the child responds (whether positively or negatively) to new people or environments. Does the child approach people or things in the environment without hesitation, or does the child shy away? A bold child tends to approach things quickly, as if without thinking, whereas a cautious child typically prefers to watch for a while before engaging in new experiences.
* Adaptability: refers to how long it takes the child to adjust to change over time (as opposed to an initial reaction). Does the child adjust to the changes in their environment easily, or is the child resistant? A child who adjusts easily may be quick to settle into a new routine, whereas a resistant child may take a long time to adjust to the situation.
*Intensity: refers to the energy level of a positive or negative response. Does the child react intensely to a situation, or does the child respond in a calm and quiet manner? A more intense child may jump up and down screaming with excitement, whereas a mild-mannered child may smile or show no emotion.
* Mood: refers to the child&#x27;s general tendency towards a happy or unhappy demeanor. All children have a variety of emotions and reactions, such as cheerful and stormy, happy and unhappy. Yet each child biologically tends to have a generally positive or negative outlook. A baby who frequently smiles and coos could be considered a cheerful baby, whereas a baby who frequently cries or fusses might be considered a stormy baby.
*Distractibility: refers to the child&#x27;s tendency to be sidetracked by other things going on around them. Does the child get easily distracted by what is happening in the environment, or can the child concentrate despite the interruptions? An easily distracted child is engaged by external events and has difficulty returning to the task at hand, whereas a rarely distracted child stays focused and completes the task at hand.
*Persistence and attention span: refer to the child&#x27;s length of time on a task and ability to stay with the task through frustrations—whether the child stays with an activity for a long period of time or loses interest quickly.
*Sensitivity: refers to how easily a child is disturbed by changes in the environment. This is also called sensory threshold or threshold of responsiveness. Is the child bothered by external stimuli like noises, textures, or lights, or does the child seem to ignore them? A sensitive child may lose focus when a door slams, whereas a child less sensitive to external noises will be able to maintain focus.

===Mary K. Rothbart&#x27;s three dimensions of temperament===
Mary K. Rothbart views temperament as the individual personality differences in infants and young children that are present prior to the development of higher cognitive and social aspects of personality. Rothbart further defines temperament as individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation that manifest in the domains of emotion, activity and attention. Moving away from classifying infants into categories, Mary Rothbart identified three underlying dimensions of temperament. Using factor analysis on data from 3- to 12-month-old children, three broad factors emerged and were labeled surgency/extraversion, negative affect, and effortful control.

====Surgency/extraversion====
Surgency/extraversion includes positive anticipation, impulsivity, increased levels of activity and a desire for sensation seeking. This factor reflects the degree to which a child is generally happy, active, and enjoys vocalizing and seeking stimulation. Increased levels of smiling and laughter are observed in babies high in surgency/extraversion. 10- to 11-year-olds with higher levels of surgency/extraversion are more likely to develop externalizing problems like acting out; however, they are less likely to develop internalizing problems such as shyness and low self-esteem.

====Negative affect====
Negative affect includes fear, frustration, sadness, discomfort, and anger. This factor reflects the degree to which a child is shy and not easily calmed. Anger and frustration is seen as early as 2 to 3 months of age. Anger and frustration, together, predict externalizing and internalizing difficulties. Anger, alone, is later related to externalizing problems, while fear is associated with internalizing difficulties. Fear as evidenced by behavioral inhibition is seen as early as 7–10 months of age, and later predicts children&#x27;s fearfulness and lower levels of aggression.

====Effortful control====
Effortful control includes the focusing and shifting of attention, inhibitory control, perceptual sensitivity, and a low threshold for pleasure. This factor reflects the degree to which a child can focus attention, is not easily distracted, can restrain a dominant response in order to execute a non-dominant response, and employ planning. When high in effortful control, six- to seven-year-olds tend to be more empathetic and lower in aggressiveness. Higher levels of effortful control at age seven also predict lower externalizing problems at age 11 years. Children high on negative affect show decreased internalizing and externalizing problems when they are also high on effortful control. Rothbart suggests that effortful control is dependent on the development of executive attention skills in the early years. In turn, executive attention skills allows greater self-control over reactive tendencies. Effortful control shows stability from infancy into the school years and also predicts conscience.

===Others===

Solomon Diamond described temperaments based upon characteristics found in the animal world: fearfulness, aggressiveness, affiliativeness, and impulsiveness. His work has been carried forward by Arnold Buss and Robert Plomin, who developed two measures of temperament: The Colorado Child Temperament Inventory, which includes aspects of Thomas and Chess&#x27;s schema, and the EAS Survey for Children.

H. Hill Goldsmith and Joseph Campos used emotional characteristics to define temperament, originally analyzing five emotional qualities: motor activity, anger, fearfulness, pleasure/joy, and interest/persistence, but later expanding to include other emotions. They developed several measures of temperament: Lab-TAB and TBAQ.

Other temperament systems include those based upon theories of adult temperament (e.g. Gray and Martin&#x27;s Temperament Assessment Battery for Children), or adult personality (e.g.the Big Five personality traits).

==Causal and correlating factors==
===Biological basis for temperament===
Scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality have examined the relationship between temperament and neurotransmitter systems and character (defined in this context as developmental aspects of personality). Temperament is hypothesized to be associated with biological factors, but these have proven to be complex and diverse, and biological correlations have proven hard to confirm.

===Temperament vs. psychiatric disorders ===

Several psychiatrists and differential psychologists have suggested that temperament and mental illness represent varying degrees along the same continuum of neurotransmitter imbalances in neurophysiological systems of behavioral regulation.

In fact, the original four types of temperament (choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic and sanguine) suggested by Hippocrates and Galen resemble mild forms of types of psychiatric disorders described in modern classifications. Moreover, Hippocrates-Galen hypothesis of chemical imbalances as factors of consistent individual differences has also been validated by research in neurochemistry and psychopharmacology, though modern studies attribute this to different compounds. Many studies have examined the relationships between temperament traits (such as impulsivity, sensation seeking, neuroticism, endurance, plasticity, sociability or extraversion) and various neurotransmitter and hormonal systems (i.e., the very same systems implicated in mental disorders).

Even though temperament and psychiatric disorders can be presented as, correspondingly, weak and strong imbalances within the same regulatory systems, it is incorrect to say that temperament is a weak degree of these disorders. Temperament might be a disposition to develop a mental disorder, but it should not be treated as a guaranteed marker for disorders.

===Family life===

====Influences====
Most experts agree that temperament has a genetic and biological basis, although environmental factors and maturation modify the ways a child&#x27;s personality is expressed. The term &quot;goodness of fit&quot; refers to the match or mismatch between temperament and other personal characteristics and the specific features of the environment. Differences of temperament or behavior styles between individuals are important in family life. They affect the interactions among family members. While some children can adapt quickly and easily to family routines and get along with siblings, others who are more active or intense may have a difficult time adjusting. The interactions between these children and their parents or siblings are among a number of factors that can lead to stress and friction within the family.

The temperament mix between parents and children also affects family life. For example, a slow-paced parent may be irritated by a highly active child; or if both parent and child are highly active and intense, conflict could result. This knowledge can help parents figure out how temperaments affect family relationships. What may appear to be a behavioral problem may actually be a mismatch between the parent&#x27;s temperament and their child&#x27;s. By taking a closer look at the nine traits that Thomas and Chess revealed from their study, parents can gain a better understanding of their child&#x27;s temperament and their own. Parents may also notice that situational factors cause a child&#x27;s temperament to seem problematic; for example, a child with low rhythmicity can cause difficulties for a family with a highly scheduled life, and a child with a high activity level may be difficult to cope with if the family lives in a crowded apartment upstairs from sensitive neighbors.

Parents can encourage new behaviors in their children, and with enough support a &quot;slow-to-warm-up&quot; child can become less shy, or a &quot;difficult&quot; baby can become easier to handle. More recently infants and children with temperament issues have been called &quot;spirited&quot; to avoid negative connotations of &quot;&quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;slow to warm up&quot;&quot;. Numerous books have been written advising parents how to raise their spirited youngsters.

====Understanding for improvement====
Understanding a child&#x27;s temperament can help reframe how parents interpret children&#x27;s behavior and the way parents think about the reasons for behaviors. By parents having access to this knowledge now helps them to guide their child in ways that respect the child&#x27;s individual differences. By understanding children&#x27;s temperaments and our own helps adults to work with them rather than try to change them. It is an opportunity to anticipate and understand a child&#x27;s reaction. It is also important to know that temperament does not excuse a child&#x27;s unacceptable behavior, but it does provide direction to how parents can respond to it. Making small and reasonable accommodations to routines can reduce tension. For example, a child who is slow-paced in the mornings may need an extra half-hour to get ready. Knowing who or what may affect the child&#x27;s behavior can help to alleviate potential problems. Although children obtain their temperament behaviors innately, a large part that helps determine a child&#x27;s ability to develop and act in certain ways is determined by the parents. When a parent takes the time to identify and more importantly respond to the temperaments they are faced with in a positive way it will help them guide their child in trying to figure out the world.

Recognizing the child&#x27;s temperament and helping them to understand how it impacts his/her life as well as others is important. It is just as important for parents to recognize their own temperaments. Recognizing each individual&#x27;s temperament, will help to prevent and manage problems that may arise from the differences among family members.

Temperament continues into adulthood, and later studies by Chess and Thomas have shown that these characteristics continue to influence behavior and adjustment throughout the life-span.

In addition to the initial clinical studies, academic psychologists have developed an interest in the field and researchers such as Bates, Buss &amp; Plomin, Kagan, Rusalov, Cloninger, Trofimova and Rothbart have generated large bodies of research in the areas of personality, neuroscience, and behavioral genetics.

==Determination of temperament type==
Temperament is determined through specific behavioral profiles, usually focusing on those that are both easily measurable and testable early in childhood. Commonly tested factors include traits related to energetic capacities (named as &quot;Activity&quot;, &quot;Endurance&quot;, &quot;Extraversion&quot;), traits related to emotionality (such as irritability, frequency of smiling), and approach or avoidance of unfamiliar events. There is generally a low correlation between descriptions by teachers and behavioral observations by scientists of features used in determining temperament.

<text>Sean Patrick Astin (né Duke; born February 25, 1971) is an American actor. His acting roles include Mikey Walsh in &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985), Billy Tepper in &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; (1991), Daniel Ruettiger in &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), Samwise Gamgee in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–2003), Doug Whitmore in &quot;50 First Dates&quot; (2004), Bill in &quot;Click&quot; (2006), Lynn McGill in the fifth season of &quot;24&quot; (2006), Oso in &quot;Special Agent Oso&quot; (2009–2012), Raphael in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2012–2017), Bob Newby in the second season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Things&quot; (2017), and Ed in &quot;No Good Nick&quot; (2019).

Astin&#x27;s acting awards include a Screen Actors Guild Award and two Young Artist Awards. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1994 for the short film &quot;Kangaroo Court&quot;. He is the son of actress Patty Duke and was adopted in 1972 by her then-husband, actor John Astin.

== Early life ==
Astin was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 25, 1971, the son of actress Patty Duke (1946–2016) and Michael Tell (born 1951). At the time, it was incorrectly reported that entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr. was his biological father. Tell is a writer, music promoter, and publisher of the newspaper &quot;The Las Vegas Israelite&quot;. When Duke became pregnant, she was unsure whether Arnaz, Tell, or actor John Astin was the father, and Tell offered to marry her as a way out of the scandal. The marriage lasted only 13 days in 1970, ending before Astin was born.

In 1972, Duke married John Astin. When the wedding guests were invited to speak, 18-month-old Astin looked at John and cried, &quot;Daddy!&quot;, to which the Episcopal priest performing the ceremony remarked, &quot;Well, that about does it!&quot; John subsequently adopted Sean. In 1973, Duke gave birth to Astin&#x27;s brother Mackenzie Astin, who also became an actor. Duke and John Astin divorced in 1985. Duke married Mike Pearce in 1986, and they adopted a son, Kevin, in 1989. When Astin was 14, Duke told him that Arnaz was his biological father. Almost a decade later, in 1994, Astin met Tell&#x27;s niece, who suggested that Astin get a paternity test. Tell was found to be his actual biological father. Astin developed close relationships with all three, saying: &quot;Desi Arnaz Jr. loves me, and I love him.&quot; Astin considers John his father, as John raised him. Astin is also close to his stepfather, Mike Pearce, saying, &quot;I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to. John, Desi, Mike, or Papa Mike ... my four dads.&quot;

Astin is of German and Irish ancestry through his mother, and Jewish ancestry through his biological father. Astin attended Catholic school and later became a Protestant.

Astin attended the Crossroads High School for the Arts and undertook master classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory in Los Angeles. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from UCLA with a B.A. in History and English (American literature and culture). An alumnus of Los Angeles Valley College, Astin served on the school&#x27;s board of directors of the Patrons Association and the Arts Council.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===

Astin&#x27;s first acting role was in a 1981 television film titled &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Hit Me, Mom&quot;, in which he played an 8-year-old child with an abusive mother (portrayed by his real-life mother Patty Duke). Astin made his film debut at the age of 13 as Mikey in &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985).

After &quot;The Goonies&quot;, Astin appeared in several more films, including the Disney television film &quot;The B.R.A.T. Patrol&quot;, opposite Nia Long, Tim Thomerson, and Brian Keith; &quot;Like Father Like Son&quot; (1987); &quot;White Water Summer&quot; with Kevin Bacon (1987), &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989); the World War II film &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; (1990); &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; (1991); &quot;Encino Man&quot; (1992); and the college football biopic &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), about the life-changing struggles and rewards of the titular character, Daniel Ruettiger.

In 1994, Astin directed and co-produced (with his wife, Christine Astin) the short film &quot;Kangaroo Court&quot;, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short Film. Astin continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, including the Showtime science fiction film &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; (1995), the Gulf War film &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), and the Warren Beatty political satire &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998).

=== &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===
In the early 2000s, Astin played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, consisting of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003). Many awards were bestowed upon the trilogy, particularly its final installment, which earned eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Astin received seven award nominations for his own performance, and won five, including the Saturn Award, the Sierra Award, the Seattle Film Critics Award, and the Utah Film Critics Award (all for Best Supporting Actor), and the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male or Female in an Effects Film. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; cast as an ensemble received awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, the Screen Actors Guild, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, and received a Gold Derby Award. Throughout the filming process, Astin became close friends with several cast members, particularly Elijah Wood. Astin&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, is in the closing scene of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, playing his onscreen daughter, Elanor.

While working on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Astin persuaded a number of fellow cast and crew members, including director Peter Jackson, to assist him in making his second short film, &quot;The Long and Short of It&quot;. The film, which takes place on a street in Wellington, New Zealand, premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and can be found on the DVD for &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, along with a &quot;making of&quot; video.

In 2004, Astin released &quot;There and Back Again&quot; (), a memoir (co-written with Joe Layden) of his film career with emphasis on his experiences during production of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The title is derived from the title of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as well as the fictional book written by Bilbo Baggins in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== After &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

Since &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Astin has continued to work in film and television. His film roles have included the Adam Sandler comedies &quot;50 First Dates&quot; and &quot;Click&quot;. Astin played the role of Malibu High School principal Mike Matthews in the film &quot;Smile&quot;.

In television, Astin guest-starred as Lynn McGill in ten episodes of the fifth season of the Fox drama &quot;24&quot;. He also appeared in the made-for-TV films &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and in episodes of &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; (in which he parodied his 1993 film &quot;Rudy&quot; with co-stars Charles S. Dutton and Chelcie Ross), and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, among other shows. Astin directed a 2003 episode of the TV series &quot;Angel&quot;, titled &quot;Soulless&quot;. He played the enigmatic Mr. Smith on the second season of the Showtime series &quot;Jeremiah&quot;.

Astin&#x27;s career has also expanded to include voice-over roles. He narrated the American version of the Animal Planet series &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot;, and voices the title character in &quot;Special Agent Oso&quot; which aired on Playhouse Disney from 2009 to 2011 and Disney Junior from 2011 to early 2014. Astin&#x27;s other voice work includes &quot;Balto III: Wings of Change&quot;, in which he voiced Kodi, a teenage husky who is the son of the titular character, and the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, in the latter of which he provided the voice of Hercules, replacing actor Tate Donovan, who was unavailable but would return for &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Astin also voiced Raphael in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series on Nickelodeon, which premiered on September 29, 2012, running for five seasons and 124 episodes, and ending on November 12, 2017.

In 2010, Astin joined the Stella Adler Los Angeles Theatre Collective acting company. Also as of 2010, Astin and his wife, Christine, were making a film based on Lois Lowry&#x27;s Newbery Medal-winning novel &quot;Number the Stars&quot;. They bought the film rights in 2008 and wrote a screenplay adaptation, with plans to direct and produce it themselves.

In March 2012, Astin played a cosmetic surgeon named Takin Mastuhmik in a fake trailer entitled &quot;Boobathon&quot; which appeared on Funny or Die. In March 2014, Astin played a soldier in &quot;Boys of Abu Ghraib&quot;, a military thriller inspired by the events that made worldwide news in 2004. In June of that year, he began playing the role of Jim Kent on the FX drama &quot;The Strain&quot;.

In October 2015, Astin played Hank Erwin in &quot;Woodlawn&quot;, a story about how a high school football team overcame racism and hate, and found unity and success through following Jesus.

In 2017, Astin played the role of Bob Newby in season two of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. In 2019, Astin reprised the role of Newby in flashback scenes during the series&#x27; third season, played the role of Dr. Greg Pemberton on several episodes of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and had a guest appearance on the fifth season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;. In 2019, he was in the Netflix dramedy &quot;No Good Nick&quot; in which he played Ed. That same year, he appeared in the sixth season of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;.

In May 2020, Astin joined Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot;, which reunites the casts of popular films through video-conferencing and promotes donations to non-profit charities. Others in the episode were fellow &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; castmates Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson.

Astin narrated the 2023 comedy film &quot;Go West&quot;, the first theatrical film from the original cast of the sketch comedy show &quot;Studio C&quot;, produced by their own company, JK Studios. Astin made his Broadway debut as Santa Claus in a revival of &quot;Elf the Musical&quot;, which ran at the Marquis Theatre from November 2024 to January 2025.

== Personal life ==
Astin married Christine Harrell on July 11, 1992. They have three daughters: Alexandra (born in November 1996), Elizabeth (born in August 2002), and Isabella (born in July 2005), all having the middle name Louise. His wife held the Miss Indiana Teen USA title in 1984. Alexandra had a small cameo role in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; as Elanor Gamgee, Astin&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter, and appears in &quot;Bad Kids of Crestview Academy&quot; as Ethel Balducci.

Astin has a tattoo on his ankle of the word &quot;nine&quot; written with the Tengwar script, commemorating his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; involvement and his character&#x27;s membership in the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. Seven of the eight other actors (Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom) all have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies&#x27; stunt double, Brett Beattie, has the tattoo as well.

In an August 2013 interview, Astin said that he is a Lutheran Christian, having been &quot;baptized in my wife&#x27;s Lutheran church&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m a very good [Christian] but I&#x27;m praying the forgiveness thing is legit,&quot; Astin said in an interview.

In January 2015, Astin completed the Dopey Challenge at the Walt Disney World Resort which involves running a 5k, 10k, half-marathon and full marathon on four consecutive days.

On October 10, 2015, Astin competed in the 2015 Ironman World Championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii. Wearing number 143, Astin finished the race in a time of 15:30:31. In the 2020s, Astin enrolled as a Masters student in public administration and policy at American University; he completed the degree in 2024.

=== Political support ===
From 1995 to 2005, Astin served as a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army (CASA) and afterwards served on the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation for two years during the George W. Bush administration. He was awarded the honorary Emeritus Civilian Aide designation in 2022.

Astin is a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party. During the 2004 United States presidential election, Astin backed Senator John Kerry and participated in Kerry&#x27;s campaign rally in Portland, Oregon, as the opening speaker. In the 2008 presidential election, Astin lent his support to then-Senator Hillary Clinton for the first of her two Presidential campaigns and made multiple campaign appearances on her behalf, including joining Clinton&#x27;s daughter Chelsea at some stops. Astin served as the campaign manager for Democrat Dan Adler, a businessman friend in the entertainment industry, in California&#x27;s 36th congressional district special election of 2011. In the 2016 presidential election, Astin campaigned for Hillary Clinton in midwestern states such as Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin. In a 2020 Twitter post, Astin voiced his support for Democratic nominee Joe Biden. On July 29, 2024, Astin appeared in the White Dudes for Harris Zoom call expressing his support for Vice President Kamala Harris&#x27;s presidential campaign. Astin additionally appeared at the 2024 Democratic National Convention during the nominating roll call vote on August 20, 2024, representing Indiana.

In September 2024, Astin urged California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign SB 1047, a bill that would require advanced AI models to undergo safety testing before deployment.

<doc id="113070" wikidata="Q17131" url="?curid=113070" title="Pontius Pilate">
<text>Pontius Pilate (; ) was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, serving under Emperor Tiberius from 26/27 to 36/37 AD. He is best known for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ultimately ordered his crucifixion. Pilate&#x27;s importance in Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the Apostles&#x27; and Nicene Creeds. Because the gospels portray Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church believes that Pilate became a Christian and venerates him as both a martyr and a saint, a belief which is historically shared by the Coptic Church, with a feast day on 19 or 25 June, respectively.

Although Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources regarding his rule have survived. Nothing is known about his life before he became governor of Judaea, and nothing is known about the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship. Coins that he minted have survived from Pilate&#x27;s governorship, as well as a single inscription, the so-called Pilate stone. The Jewish historian Josephus, the philosopher Philo of Alexandria, and the Gospel of Luke all mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate&#x27;s administration. Many of these incidents involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian gospels record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian Tacitus also record this information.

According to Josephus, Pilate was removed from office because he violently suppressed an armed Samaritan movement at Mount Gerizim. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of Syria to answer for this incident before Tiberius, but the emperor died before Pilate arrived in Rome. Nothing is known about what happened to him after this event. On the basis of events which were documented by the second-century pagan philosopher Celsus and the Christian apologist Origen, most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal. Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler: while some believe that he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others believe that his long time in office implies reasonable competence. According to one prominent post-World War II theory, Pilate&#x27;s mistreatment of the Jews was motivated by antisemitism, but most contemporary historians do not accept this theory.

In Late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, Pilate became the focus of a large group of New Testament apocrypha expanding on his role in the gospels, the Pilate cycle. Attitudes split by region: in texts from the Eastern Roman Empire, Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. He and his wife are portrayed as Christian converts and sometimes martyrs. In Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval legends, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate&#x27;s place of birth or death to particular locations around Western Europe, such as claiming his body was buried in a particularly dangerous or cursed local area.

Pilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. Medieval art frequently portrays scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus&#x27;s death. In the art of the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. He plays an important role in medieval passion plays, where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include Anatole France (&quot;Le Procurateur de Judée&quot;), Mikhail Bulgakov, and Chingiz Aitmatov, with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the Second World War. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.

==Life and political career==
===Sources===
Sources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other Roman governors of Judaea. The most important sources are the &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot; (after the year 41) by contemporary Jewish writer Philo of Alexandria, the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; () and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; () by the Jewish historian Josephus, as well as the four canonical Christian gospels, Mark (composed between 66 and 70), Luke (composed between 85 and 90), Matthew (composed between 85 and 90), and John (composed between 90 and 110), each authored anonymously; he is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (composed between 85 and 90) and in the First Epistle to Timothy (written in the second half of the 1st century). Ignatius of Antioch mentions him in his epistles to the Trallians, Magnesians, and Smyrnaeans (composed between 105 and 110). He is also briefly mentioned in &quot;Annals&quot; of the Roman historian Tacitus (early 2nd century), who simply says that he put Jesus to death. Two additional chapters of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot; that might have mentioned Pilate have been lost. The written sources provide only limited information, and each has its own biases, with the gospels in particular providing a theological rather than historical perspective on Pilate.

Besides these texts, dated coins in the name of emperor Tiberius minted during Pilate&#x27;s governorship have survived, as well as a fragmentary short inscription that names Pilate, known as the Pilate Stone, the only inscription about a Roman governor of Judaea predating the Jewish–Roman wars to survive.

===Early life===
The sources give no indication of Pilate&#x27;s life prior to his becoming governor of Judaea. His praenomen (first name) is unknown; his cognomen &quot;Pilatus&quot; might mean &quot;skilled with the javelin ()&quot;, but it could also refer to the or Phrygian cap, possibly indicating that one of Pilate&#x27;s ancestors was a freedman. If it means &quot;skilled with the javelin&quot;, it is possible that Pilate won the cognomen for himself while serving in the Roman military; it is also possible that his father acquired the cognomen through military skill. In the Gospels of Mark and John, Pilate is only called by his cognomen, which Marie-Joseph Ollivier takes to mean that this was the name by which he was generally known in common speech. The name &quot;Pontius&quot; suggests that an ancestor of his came from Samnium in central, southern Italy, and he may have belonged to the family of Gavius Pontius and Pontius Telesinus, two leaders of the Samnites in the third and first centuries BC, respectively, before their full incorporation to the Roman Republic. Like all but one other governor of Judaea, Pilate was of the equestrian order, a middle rank of the Roman nobility. As one of the attested Pontii, Pontius Aquila (an assassin of Julius Caesar) was a tribune of the plebs; the family must have originally been of plebeian origin and later became ennobled as equestrians.

Pilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially. He was probably married, but the only extant reference to his wife, in which she tells him not to interact with Jesus after she has had a disturbing dream (Matthew 27:19), is generally dismissed as legendary. According to the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; established by Augustus for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; historian Alexander Demandt speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the Rhine or Danube. Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.

===Role as governor of Judea ===

Pilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor Tiberius. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office. Josephus states that Pilate governed for ten years (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province. As Tiberius had retired to the island of Capri in 26, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful Praetorian Prefect Sejanus, who was executed for treason in 31. Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus. Daniel R. Schwartz and Kenneth Lönnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate&#x27;s governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19, while Lönnqvist argues for 17/18. These proposed dates have not been widely accepted by other scholars.

Pilate&#x27;s title of prefect implies that his duties were primarily military; however, Pilate&#x27;s troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate&#x27;s duties extended beyond military matters. As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict capital punishment, and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins. Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish Sanhedrin.

Pilate was subordinate to the legate of Syria; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria&#x27;s legate Lucius Aelius Lamia was absent from the region, something which Helen Bond believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate. He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure, after the appointment of Lucius Vitellius to the post in 35. Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in Caesarea, going to Jerusalem mainly for major feasts to maintain order. He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.

As governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish High Priest and also officially controlled the vestments of the High Priest in the Antonia Fortress. Unlike his predecessor, Valerius Gratus, Pilate retained the same high priest, Joseph ben Caiaphas, for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate&#x27;s own removal from the governorship. This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the Sadducee sect were reliable allies to Pilate. Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the temple treasury to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests. Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus. Jean-Pierre Lémonon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the Pharisees are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus&#x27;s arrest and trial.

Daniel Schwartz takes the note in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 23:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king Herod Antipas as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus. Based on John 19:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title &quot;friend of Caesar&quot; (, ), a title also held by the Jewish kings Herod Agrippa I and Herod Agrippa II and by close advisors to the emperor. Both Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt do not think this especially likely.

===Incidents with the Jews===

Various disturbances during Pilate&#x27;s governorship are recorded in the sources. In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event, and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate&#x27;s rule. Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the imperial cult, which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects. Schwartz suggests that Pilate&#x27;s entire tenure was characterized by &quot;continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.&quot;

According to Josephus in his &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (2.9.2) and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate&#x27;s house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an arena, where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards. Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive. She dates this incident to early in Pilate&#x27;s tenure as governor. Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with &quot;the incident with the shields&quot; reported in Philo&#x27;s &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot;, an identification first made by the early church historian Eusebius. Lémonon, however, argues against this identification.

According to Philo&#x27;s &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot; (&quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot; 38), Pilate offended against Jewish law by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on Herod&#x27;s Palace. The sons of Herod the Great petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod&#x27;s sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields. Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and Warren Carter argue that Philo&#x27;s portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law. It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as (son of divine Augustus). Bond dates the incident to 31, sometime after Sejanus&#x27;s death in 17 October.

In another incident recorded in both the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; (2.9.4) and the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the temple treasury () to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed. The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33, based on Josephus&#x27;s chronology.

The Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans &quot;whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices&quot; (Luke 13:1). This reference has been variously interpreted as referring to one of the incidents recorded by Josephus, or to an entirely unknown incident. Bond argues that the number of Galileans killed does not seem to have been particularly high. In Bond&#x27;s view, the reference to &quot;sacrifices&quot; likely means that this incident occurred at Passover at some unknown date. She argues that &quot;[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate&#x27;s governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing. The insurrection in which Barabbas was caught up, if historical, may well be another example.&quot;

===Trial and execution of Jesus===

At the Passover of most likely 30 or 33, Pontius Pilate condemned Jesus of Nazareth to death by crucifixion in Jerusalem. The main sources on the crucifixion are the four canonical Christian Gospels, the accounts of which vary. Helen Bond argues that
the evangelists&#x27; portrayals of Pilate have been shaped to a great extent by their own particular theological and apologetic concerns. [...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.
Pilate&#x27;s role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian Tacitus, who, when explaining Nero&#x27;s persecution of the Christians, explains: &quot;Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious superstition was checked for a moment...&quot; (Tacitus, &quot;Annals&quot; 15.44). Josephus also mentioned Jesus&#x27;s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (&quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; 18.3.3); the text may have been altered by Christian interpolation, but the reference to the execution is generally considered authentic. Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten. In Ignatius&#x27;s epistles to the Trallians (9.1) and to the Smyrnaeans (1.2), the author attributes Jesus&#x27;s persecution under Pilate&#x27;s governorship. Ignatius further dates Jesus&#x27;s birth, passion, and resurrection during Pilate&#x27;s governorship in his epistle to the Magnesians (11.1). Ignatius stresses all these events in his epistles as historical facts.

Bond argues that Jesus&#x27;s arrest was made with Pilate&#x27;s prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18:3. Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved. It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be king of the Jews. Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the &quot;cognitio&quot; , a form of trial for capital punishment used in the Roman provinces and applied to non-Roman citizens that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case. All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the Passover festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single amnesty in the year of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion.
The Gospels&#x27; portrayal of Pilate is &quot;widely assumed&quot; to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo, as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, &quot;Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.&quot; Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacillating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel. Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus&#x27; innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased. Bart Ehrman argues that the Gospel of Mark, the earliest one, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate&#x27;s culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 19:16). He connects this change to increased &quot;anti-Judaism&quot;. Raymond E. Brown argued that the Gospels&#x27; portrayal of Pilate cannot be considered historical, since Pilate is always described in other sources (&quot;The Jewish War&quot; and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; of Josephus and &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot; of Philo) as a cruel and obstinate man. Brown also rejects the historicity of Pilate washing his hands and of the blood curse, arguing that these narratives, which only appear in the Gospel of Matthew, reflect later contrasts between the Jews and Jewish Christians.

Others have tried to explain Pilate&#x27;s behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate&#x27;s caution and the death of Sejanus. Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate&#x27;s behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels. Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke. N. T. Wright and Craig A. Evans argue that Pilate&#x27;s hesitation was due to the fear of causing a revolt during Passover, when large numbers of pilgrims were in Jerusalem.

===Removal and later life===
According to Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (18.4.1–2), Pilate&#x27;s removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed Samaritans at a village called Tirathana near Mount Gerizim, where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by Moses. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been Dositheos, a messiah-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time. The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to Lucius Vitellius the Elder, the governor of Syria (term 35–39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius, however, had died before his arrival. This dates the end of Pilate&#x27;s governorship to 36/37. Tiberius died in Misenum on 16 March in 37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, &quot;Annals&quot; , ).

Following Tiberius&#x27;s death, Pilate&#x27;s hearing would have been handled by the new emperor Caligula: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns. The only sure outcome of Pilate&#x27;s return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return. J. P. Lémonon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting. Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.
The church historian Eusebius (&quot;Church History&quot; 2.7.1), writing in the early fourth century, claims that &quot;tradition relates that&quot; Pilate committed suicide after he was recalled to Rome due to the disgrace he was in. Eusebius dates this to 39. Paul Maier notes that no other surviving records corroborate Pilate&#x27;s suicide, which is meant to document God&#x27;s wrath for Pilate&#x27;s role in the crucifixion, and that Eusebius explicitly states that &quot;tradition&quot; is his source, &quot;indicating that he had trouble documenting Pilate&#x27;s presumed suicide&quot;. Daniel Schwartz, however, argues that Eusebius&#x27;s claims &quot;should not lightly be dismissed.&quot; More information on the potential fate of Pontius Pilate can be gleaned from other sources. The second-century pagan philosopher Celsus polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist Origen, writing , argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus&#x27; death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death. Pilate&#x27;s supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, and Tacitus. Maier argues that &quot;[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.&quot; Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the &quot;Embassy to Gaius&quot;, although he is writing only a few years after Pilate&#x27;s tenure as governor.

==Archaeology==
===Caesarea inscription===

A single inscription by Pilate has survived in Caesarea, on the &quot;Pilate Stone&quot;. The (partially reconstructed) inscription is as follows:
Vardaman &quot;freely&quot; translates it as follows: &quot;Tiberium [?of the Caesareans?] Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea [ ... has given?]&quot;. The fragmentary nature of the inscription has led to some disagreement about the correct reconstruction, so that &quot;apart from Pilate&#x27;s name and title the inscription is unclear.&quot; Originally, the inscription would have included an abbreviated letter for Pilate&#x27;s praenomen (e.g., &quot;T.&quot; for Titus or &quot;M.&quot; for Marcus). The stone attests Pilate&#x27;s title of prefect and the inscription appears to refer to some kind of building called a &quot;Tiberieum&quot;, a word otherwise unattested but following a pattern of naming buildings about Roman emperors. Bond argues that we cannot be sure what kind of building this referred to. G. Alföldy argued that it was some sort of secular building, namely a lighthouse, while Joan Taylor and Jerry Vardaman argue that it was a temple dedicated to Tiberius.

===Ameria inscription===
A second inscription, which has since been lost, has historically been associated with Pontius Pilate. It was a fragmentary, undated inscription on a large piece of marble recorded in Ameria, a village in Umbria, Italy. The inscription read as follows:

:(CIL XI.2.1.4396)

The only clear items of text are the names &quot;Pilate&quot; and the title &quot;quattuorvir&quot; (&quot;IIII VIR&quot;), a type of local city official responsible for conducting a census every five years. The inscription was formerly found outside the church of St. Secundus, where it had been copied from a presumed original. At the turn of the 20th century, it was generally held to be fake, a forgery in support of a local legend that Pontius Pilate died in exile in Ameria. The more recent scholars Alexander Demandt and Henry MacAdam both believe that the inscription is genuine, but attests to a person who simply had the same cognomen as Pontius Pilate. MacAdam argues that &quot;[i]t is far easier to believe that this very fragmentary inscription prompted the legend of Pontius Pilate&#x27;s association with the Italian village of Ameria [...] than it is to posit someone forging the inscription two centuries ago—quite creatively, it would seem—to provide substance for the legend.&quot;

===Coins===

As governor, Pilate was responsible for minting coins in the province: he appears to have struck them in 29/30, 30/31, and 31/32, thus the fourth, fifth, and sixth years of his governorship. The coins belong to a type called a &quot;perutah&quot;, measured between 13.5 and 17mm, were minted in Jerusalem, and are fairly crudely made. Earlier coins read on the obverse and on the reverse, referring to the emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia (Julia Augusta). Following Livia&#x27;s death, the coins only read . As was typical of Roman coins struck in Judaea, they did not have a portrait of the emperor, though they included some pagan designs.

E. Stauffer and E. M. Smallwood argued that the coins&#x27; use of pagan symbols was deliberately meant to offend the Jews and connected changes in their design to the fall of the powerful Praetorian prefect Sejanus in 31. This theory was rejected by Helen Bond, who argued that there was nothing particularly offensive about the designs. Joan Taylor has argued that the symbolism on the coins shows how Pilate attempted to promote the Roman imperial cult in Judaea, in spite of local Jewish and Samaritan religious sensitivities.

===Aqueduct===
Attempts to identify the aqueduct that is attributed to Pilate in Josephus date to the 19th century. In the mid-20th century, A. Mazar tentatively identified it as the Arrub aqueduct that brought water from Solomon&#x27;s Pools to Jerusalem, an identification supported in 2000 by Kenneth Lönnqvist. Lönnqvist notes that the Talmud (Lamentations Rabbah 4.4) records the destruction of an aqueduct from Solomon&#x27;s Pools by the Sicarii, a group of fanatical religious Zealots, during the First Jewish-Roman War (66–73); he suggests that if the aqueduct had been funded by the temple treasury as recorded in Josephus, this might explain the Sicarii&#x27;s targeting of this particular aqueduct. However, more recent research, published in 2021, dates the construction of another one of the aqueducts providing water to Solomon&#x27;s Pools, namely the Biar Aqueduct (also known as Wadi el-Biyar Aqueduct), to the mid-first century AD, probably during the time of Pilate.

===Inscribed ring===
In 2018, an inscription on a thin copper-alloy sealing ring that had been discovered at Herodium was uncovered using modern scanning techniques. The inscription reads (), meaning &quot;of Pilate&quot;. The name Pilatus is rare, so the ring could be associated with Pontius Pilate; however, given the cheap material, it is unlikely that he would have owned it. It is possible that the ring belonged to another individual named Pilate, or that it belonged to someone who worked for Pontius Pilate.

==Apocryphal texts and legends==
Due to his role in Jesus&#x27; trial, Pilate became an important figure in both pagan and Christian propaganda in late antiquity. Perhaps the earliest apocryphal texts attributed to Pilate are denunciations of Christianity and of Jesus that claim to be Pilate&#x27;s report on the crucifixion. According to Eusebius (&quot;Church History&quot; 9.2.5), these texts were distributed during the persecution of Christians conducted by the emperor Maximinus II (reigned 308–313). None of these texts survive, but Tibor Grüll argues that their contents can be reconstructed from Christian apologetic texts.

Positive traditions about Pilate are frequent in Eastern Christianity, particularly in Egypt and Ethiopia, whereas negative traditions predominate in Western and Byzantine Christianity. Additionally, earlier Christian traditions portray Pilate more positively than later ones, a change which Ann Wroe suggests reflects the fact that, following the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (312), it was no longer necessary to deflect criticism of Pilate (and by extension of the Roman Empire) for his role in Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion onto the Jews. Bart Ehrman, on the other hand, argues that the tendency in the Early Church to exonerate Pilate and blame the Jews prior to this time reflects an increasing &quot;anti-Judaism&quot; among Early Christians. The earliest attestation of a positive tradition about Pilate comes from the late first-, early second-century Christian author Tertullian, who, claiming to have seen Pilate&#x27;s report to Tiberius, states Pilate had &quot;become already a Christian in his conscience.&quot; An earlier reference to Pilate&#x27;s records of Jesus&#x27;s trial is given by the Christian apologist Justin Martyr around 160. Tibor Grüll believes that this could be a reference to Pilate&#x27;s actual records, but other scholars argue that Justin has simply invented the records as a source on the assumption that they existed without ever having verified their existence.

===New Testament Apocrypha===
Beginning in the fourth century, a large body of Christian apocryphal texts developed concerning Pilate, making up one of the largest groups of surviving New Testament Apocrypha. Originally, these texts served both to unburden Pilate of guilt for the death of Jesus as well as to provide more complete records of Jesus&#x27;s trial. The apocryphal Gospel of Peter completely exonerates Pilate for the crucifixion, which is instead performed by Herod Antipas. Moreover, the text makes explicit that while Pilate washes his hands of guilt, neither the Jews nor Herod do so. The Gospel includes a scene in which the centurions who had been guarding Jesus&#x27; tomb report to Pilate that Jesus has been resurrected.

The fragmentary third-century Manichaean &quot;Gospel of Mani&quot; has Pilate refer to Jesus as &quot;the Son of God&quot; and telling his centurions to &quot;[k]eep this secret&quot;.

In the most common version of the passion narrative in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus (also called the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;), Pilate is portrayed as forced to execute Jesus by the Jews and as distraught at having done so. One version claims to have been discovered and translated by a Jewish convert named Ananias, portraying itself as the official Jewish records of the crucifixion. Another claims that the records were made by Pilate himself, relying on reports made to him by Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. Some Eastern versions of the Gospel of Nicodemus claim that Pilate was born in Egypt, which likely aided his popularity there. The Christian Pilate literature surrounding the Gospel of Nicodemus includes at least fifteen late antique and early medieval texts, called the &quot;Pilate cycle&quot;, written and preserved in various languages and versions and dealing largely with Pontius Pilate. Two of these include purported reports made by Pilate to the emperor (the &quot;Anaphora Pilati&quot; to Emperor Tiberius and the Letter of Pilate to Claudius) on the crucifixion, in which Pilate recounts Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection, blaming the Jews. Another purports to be an angry reply by Tiberius, condemning Pilate for his role in Jesus&#x27; death, the Letter of Tiberius to Pilate. Another early text is an apocryphal letter attributed to &quot;Herod&quot; (a composite character of the various Herods in the Bible), which claims to respond to a letter from Pilate in which Pilate spoke of his remorse for Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and of having had a vision of the risen Christ; &quot;Herod&quot; asks Pilate to pray for him.

In the so-called &quot;Book of the Cock&quot;, a late-antique apocryphal passion Gospel only preserved in Ge&#x27;ez (Ethiopic) but translated from Arabic, Pilate attempts to avoid Jesus&#x27;s execution by sending him to Herod and writing further letters arguing with Herod not to execute Jesus. Pilate&#x27;s family become Christians after Jesus miraculously cures Pilate&#x27;s daughters of their deaf-muteness. Pilate is nevertheless forced to execute Jesus by the increasingly angry crowd, but Jesus tells Pilate that he does not hold him responsible. This book enjoys &quot;a quasi-canonical status&quot; among Ethiopian Christians to this day and continues to be read beside the canonical gospels during Holy Week.

====Pilate&#x27;s death in the apocrypha====

Seven of the Pilate texts mention Pilate&#x27;s fate after the crucifixion: in three, he becomes a very positive figure, while in four he is presented as diabolically evil. A fifth-century Syriac version of the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot; explains Pilate&#x27;s conversion as occurring after he has blamed the Jews for Jesus&#x27; death in front of Tiberius; prior to his execution, Pilate prays to God and converts, thereby becoming a Christian martyr. In the Greek &quot;Paradosis Pilati&quot; (5th century), Pilate is arrested for the crime of executing Jesus, although he has since converted to be a follower of Christ. His beheading is accompanied by a voice from heaven calling him blessed and saying he will be with Jesus at the Second Coming. The &quot;Evangelium Gamalielis&quot;, possibly of medieval origin and preserved in Arabic, Coptic, and Ge&#x27;ez, says Jesus was crucified by Herod, whereas Pilate was a true believer in Christ who was martyred for his faith; similarly, the &quot;Martyrium Pilati&quot;, possibly medieval and preserved in Arabic, Coptic, and Ge&#x27;ez, portrays Pilate, as well as his wife and two children, as being crucified twice, once by the Jews and once by Tiberius, for his faith.

In addition to the report on Pilate&#x27;s suicide in Eusebius, Grüll notes three Western apocryphal traditions about Pilate&#x27;s suicide. In the &quot;Cura sanitatis Tiberii&quot; (dated variously 5th to 7th century), the emperor Tiberius is healed by an image of Jesus brought by Saint Veronica, Saint Peter then confirms Pilate&#x27;s report on Jesus&#x27;s miracles, and Pilate is exiled by the emperor Nero, after which he commits suicide. A similar narrative plays out in the &quot;Vindicta Salvatoris&quot; (8th century). In the &quot;Mors Pilati&quot; (perhaps originally 6th century, but recorded ), Pilate was forced to commit suicide and his body thrown in the Tiber. However, the body is surrounded by demons and storms, so that it is removed from the Tiber and instead cast into the Rhone, where the same thing happens. Finally, the corpse is taken to Lausanne in modern Switzerland and buried in an isolated lake (perhaps Lake Lucerne), where demonic visitations continue to occur.

===Later legends===

Beginning in the eleventh century, more extensive legendary biographies of Pilate were written in Western Europe, adding details to information provided by the bible and apocrypha. The legend exists in many different versions and was extremely widespread in both Latin and the vernacular, and each version contains significant variation, often relating to local traditions.

====Early &quot;biographies&quot;====
The earliest extant legendary biography is the &quot;De Pilato&quot; of , with three further Latin versions appearing in the mid-twelfth century, followed by many vernacular translations. Howard Martin summarizes the general content of these legendary biographies as follows: a king who was skilled in astrology and named Atus lived in Mainz. The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller&#x27;s daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate&#x27;s name thus results from the combination of the names &quot;Pila&quot; with &quot;Atus&quot;.

A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father&#x27;s court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod&#x27;s power.

The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ&#x27;s healing powers, sends for him only to learn from Saint Veronica that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus&#x27;s coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.

One important version of the Pilate legend is found in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; by Jacobus de Voragine (1263–1273 AD), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages. In the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with Judas, first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas&#x27;s father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben&#x27;s property after Judas has killed his own father.

====Western Europe====
Several places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of Lyon and Vienne in modern France claim to be Pilate&#x27;s birthplace: Vienne has a &quot;Maison de Pilate&quot;, a &quot;Prétoire de Pilate&quot; and a &quot;Tour de Pilate&quot;. One tradition states that Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called Mount Pilatus) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit. This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 AD onwards, while Lake Lucerne has been called &quot;Pilatus-See&quot; (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century. A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany. In addition to Mainz, Bamberg, Hausen, Upper Franconia were also claimed to be his place of birth, while some traditions place his death in the Saarland.

The town of Tarragona in modern Spain possesses a first-century Roman tower, which, since the eighteenth-century, has been called the &quot;Torre del Pilatos&quot;, in which Pilate is claimed to have spent his last years. The tradition may go back to a misread Latin inscription on the tower. The cities of Huesca and Seville are other cities in Spain associated with Pilate. Per a local legend, the village of Fortingall in Scotland claims to be Pilate&#x27;s birthplace, but this is almost certainly a 19th-century invention—particularly as the Romans did not invade the British Isles until 43.

====Eastern Christianity====
Pilate was also the subject of legends in Eastern Christianity. The Byzantine chronicler George Kedrenos () wrote that Pilate was condemned by Caligula to die by being left in the sun enclosed in the skin of a freshly slaughtered cow, together with a chicken, a snake, and a monkey. In a legend from medieval Rus&#x27;, Pilate attempts to save Saint Stephen from being executed; Pilate, his wife and children have themselves baptized and bury Stephen in a gilded silver coffin. Pilate builds a church in the honor of Stephen, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus, who were martyred with Stephen. Pilate dies seven months later. In the medieval Slavonic Josephus, an Old Church Slavonic translation of Josephus, with legendary additions, Pilate kills many of Jesus&#x27;s followers but finds Jesus innocent. After Jesus heals Pilate&#x27;s wife of a fatal illness, the Jews bribe Pilate with 30 talents to crucify Jesus.

==Art, literature, and film==
===Visual art===
====Late antique and early medieval art====

Pilate is one of the most important figures in early Christian art; he is often given greater prominence than Jesus himself. He is, however, entirely absent from the earliest Christian art; all images postdate the emperor Constantine and can be classified as early Byzantine art. Pilate first appears in art on a Christian sarcophagus in 330 AD; in the earliest depictions he is shown washing his hands without Jesus being present. In later images he is typically shown washing his hands of guilt in Jesus&#x27; presence. 44 depictions of Pilate predate the sixth century and are found on ivory, in mosaics, in manuscripts as well as on sarcophagi. Pilate&#x27;s iconography as a seated Roman judge derives from depictions of the Roman emperor, causing him to take on various attributes of an emperor or king, including the raised seat and clothing.
The older Byzantine model of depicting Pilate washing his hands continues to appear on artwork into the tenth century; beginning in the seventh century, however, a new iconography of Pilate also emerges, which does not always show him washing his hands, includes him in additional scenes, and is based on contemporary medieval rather than Roman models. The majority of depictions from this time period come from France or Germany, belonging to Carolingian or later Ottonian art, and are mostly on ivory, with some in frescoes, but no longer on sculpture except in Ireland. New images of Pilate that appear in this period include depictions of the Ecce homo, Pilate&#x27;s presentation of the scourged Jesus to the crowd in , as well as scenes deriving from the apocryphal &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;. Pilate also comes to feature in scenes such as the Flagellation of Christ, where he is not mentioned in the Bible.
The eleventh century sees Pilate iconography spread from France and Germany to Great Britain and further into the eastern Mediterranean. Images of Pilate are found on new materials such as metal, while he appeared less frequently on ivory, and continues to be a frequent subject of gospel and psalter manuscript illuminations. Depictions continue to be greatly influenced by the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;, and the number of situations in which Pilate is depicted also increases. From the eleventh century onward, Pilate is frequently represented as a Jewish king, wearing a beard and a Jewish hat. In many depictions he is no longer depicted washing his hands, or is depicted washing his hands but not in the presence of Jesus, or else he is depicted in passion scenes in which the Bible does not mention him.

Despite being venerated as a saint by the Coptic and Ethiopian Churches, very few images of Pilate exist in these traditions from any time period.

====High and late medieval and renaissance art====

In the thirteenth century, depictions of the events of Christ&#x27;s passion came to dominate all visual art forms—these depictions of the &quot;Passion cycle&quot; do not always include Pilate, but they often do so; when he is included, he is often given stereotyped Jewish features. One of the earliest examples of Pilate rendered as a Jew is from the eleventh century on the Hildesheim cathedral doors (see image, above right). This is the first known usage of the motif of Pilate being influenced and corrupted by the Devil in medieval art. Pilate is typically represented in fourteen different scenes from his life; however, more than half of all thirteenth-century representations of Pilate show the trial of Jesus. Pilate also comes to be frequently depicted as present at the crucifixion, by the fifteenth century being a standard element of depiction of the crucifixion. While many images still draw from the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;, the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine is the primary source for depictions of Pilate from the second half of the thirteenth century onward. Pilate now frequently appears in illuminations for books of hours, as well as in the richly illuminated &quot;Bibles moralisées&quot;, which include many biographical scenes adopted from the legendary material, although Pilate&#x27;s washing of hands remains the most frequently depicted scene. In the , Pilate is generally depicted as a Jew. In many other images, however, he is depicted as a king or with a mixture of attributes of a Jew and a king.
The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries see fewer depictions of Pilate, although he generally appears in cycles of artwork on the passion. He is sometimes replaced by Herod, Annas, and Caiaphas in the trial scene. Depictions of Pilate in this period are mostly found in private devotional settings such as on ivory or in books; he is also a major subject in a number of panel-paintings, mostly German, and frescoes, mostly Scandinavian. The most frequent scene to include Pilate is his washing of his hands; Pilate is typically portrayed similarly to the high priests as an old, bearded man, often wearing a Jewish hat but sometimes a crown, and typically carrying a scepter. Images of Pilate were especially popular in Italy, where, however, he was almost always portrayed as a Roman, and often appears in the new medium of large-scale church paintings. Pilate continued to be represented in various manuscript picture bibles and devotional works as well, often with innovative iconography, sometimes depicting scenes from the Pilate legends. Many, mostly German, engravings and woodcuts of Pilate were created in the fifteenth century. Images of Pilate were printed in the &quot;Biblia pauperum&quot; (&quot;Bibles of the Poor&quot;), picture bibles focusing on the life of Christ, as well as the &quot;Speculum Humanae Salvationis&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Human Salvation&quot;), which continued to be printed into the sixteenth century.

====Post-medieval art====

After the Middle Ages, depictions of Pilate become less frequent, though depictions are still made of his encounter with Jesus, especially in prints. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Pilate was frequently dressed as a Turk or Asian of no specific culture, wearing a turban, long robes, and a long beard, given the same characteristics as the Jews. Notable paintings of this era include Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot; (1566/67), in which Pilate is given the forehead of a philosopher, and Gerrit van Honthorst&#x27;s 1617 &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot;, which was later recatalogued as &quot;Christ before the High Priest&quot; due to Pilate&#x27;s Jewish appearance.

Following this longer period in which few depictions of Pilate were made, the increased religiosity, and artistic productivity, of the mid-nineteenth century caused a slew of new depictions of Pontius Pilate to be created, now depicted as a Roman. In 1830, J. M. W. Turner painted &quot;Pilate Washing His Hands&quot;, in which the governor himself is not visible, but rather only the back of his chair, with lamenting women in the foreground. One famous nineteenth-century painting of Pilate is &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot; (1881) by the Hungarian painter Mihály Munkácsy: the work brought Munkácsy great fame and celebrity in his lifetime, making his reputation and being popular in the United States in particular, where the painting was purchased. In 1896, Munkácsy painted a second painting featuring Christ and Pilate, &quot;Ecce homo&quot;, which however was never exhibited in the United States; both paintings portray Jesus&#x27;s fate as in the hands of the crowd rather than Pilate. The &quot;most famous of nineteenth-century pictures&quot; of Pilate is &quot;What is truth?&quot; () by the Russian painter Nikolai Ge, which was completed in 1890; the painting was banned from exhibition in Russia in part because the figure of Pilate was identified as representing the tsarist authorities. In 1893, Ge painted another painting, &quot;Golgotha&quot;, in which Pilate is represented only by his commanding hand, sentencing Jesus to death. The Scala sancta, supposedly the staircase from Pilate&#x27;s praetorium, now located in Rome, is flanked by a life-sized sculpture of Christ and Pilate in the &quot;Ecce homo&quot; scene made in the nineteenth century by the Italian sculptor Ignazio Jacometti.
The image of Pilate condemning Jesus to death is commonly encountered today as the first scene of the Stations of the Cross, first found in Franciscan Catholic churches in the seventeenth century and found in almost all Catholic churches since the nineteenth century.

===Medieval plays===
Pilate plays a major role in the medieval passion play. He is frequently depicted as a more important character to the narrative than even Jesus, and became one of the most important figures of medieval drama in the fifteenth century. The three most popular scenes in the plays to include Pilate are his washing of hands, the warning of his wife Procula not to harm Jesus, and the writing of the &quot;titulus&quot; on Jesus&#x27; cross. Pilate&#x27;s characterization varies greatly from play to play, but later plays frequently portray Pilate somewhat ambiguously, though he is usually a negative character, and sometimes an evil villain. While in some plays Pilate is opposed to the Jews and condemns them, in others he describes himself as a Jew or supports their wish to kill Christ.

In the passion plays from the continental Western Europe, Pilate&#x27;s characterization varies from good to evil, but he is mostly a benign figure. The earliest surviving passion play, the thirteenth-century from Klosterneuburg, portrays Pilate as a weak administrator who succumbs to the whims of the Jews in having Christ crucified. Pilate goes on to play an important role in the increasingly long and elaborate passion plays performed in the German-speaking countries and in France. In Arnoul Gréban&#x27;s fifteenth-century &quot;Passion&quot;, Pilate instructs the flagellators on how best to whip Jesus. The 1517 portrays Pilate as condemning Christ to death out of fear of losing Herod&#x27;s friendship and to earn the Jews&#x27; good will, despite his long dialogues with the Jews in which he professes Christ&#x27;s innocence. He eventually becomes a Christian himself. In the 1493 , on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ. The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod&#x27;s, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas. Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.

The fifteenth-century Roman depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews. In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century and stressing the Jews&#x27; fear of the &quot;new law&quot; of Christ.

Hourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290 AD, Pilate&#x27;s characterization may have been used primarily to satirize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism. In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law. In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan&#x27;s agent () while plotting Christ&#x27;s torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered. In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ&#x27;s torturer to give him Christ&#x27;s clothes at the foot of the cross. It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas. 

In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with Annas and Caiaphas, becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters. In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan. Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the Potter&#x27;s field, thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide. In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry. The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.

The fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, , exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ&#x27;s tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end. Another play focusing on Pilate&#x27;s death is Cornish and based on the . The by Jean Michel includes legendary scenes of Pilate&#x27;s life before the passion.

===Modern literature===
Pontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ. One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer Anatole France&#x27;s 1892 short story (&quot;The Procurator of Judaea&quot;), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to Sicily. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea. Spending his time at the baths of Baiae, Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.

Pilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1933 play &quot;On the Rocks&quot; where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas. Shortly afterwards, French writer Roger Caillois wrote a novel &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.

Pilate features prominently in Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty-six years after the author&#x27;s death. Henry I. MacAdam describes it as &quot;the &#x27;cult classic&#x27; of Pilate-related fiction.&quot; The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus (Yeshu Ha-Notsri) by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for &quot;Pilatism&quot; by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as &quot;a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.&quot; Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus. Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity. Pilate&#x27;s burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov&#x27;s novel.

The majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt. One of Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s earliest stories (&quot;Pilatus,&quot; 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus. Swiss playwright Max Frisch&#x27;s comedy portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused. The German Catholic novelist Gertrud von Le Fort&#x27;s portrays Pilate&#x27;s wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate&#x27;s guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.

In 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer Chingiz Aitmatov published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled (&quot;The Place of the Skull&quot;). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as a materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope. Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus&#x27;s teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.

===Film===
Pilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ&#x27;s passion already in some of the earliest films produced. In the 1927 silent film &quot;The King of Kings&quot;, Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor Victor Varconi, who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high Roman eagle, which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes &quot;not power that he possesses but power that possesses him&quot;. During the &quot;Ecce homo&quot; scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.

The film &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1935) portrays Pilate as &quot;a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire&quot;, with the actor Basil Rathbone giving him long fingers and a long nose. Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film. The 1953 film &quot;The Robe&quot; portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence. The 1959 film &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; shows Pilate (the Australian actor, Frank Thring Jr.) presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says &quot;seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the 1936 Olympics,&quot; with Pilate bored and sneering. Martin Winkler, however, argues that &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.
Only one film has been made entirely from Pilate&#x27;s perspective, the 1962 French-Italian &quot;Ponzio Pilato&quot;, in which Pilate is played by Jean Marais. In the 1973 film &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, based on the 1970 rock opera, the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and &quot;the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise&quot;. The Pilate in the film, played by Barry Dennen, expands on John 18:38 to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough&#x27;s view, as &quot;an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism&quot;. Speaking of Dennen&#x27;s portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a &quot;cornered animal.&quot; Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminacy, illustrated by Michael Palin&#x27;s Pilate in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, who lisps and mispronounces his r&#x27;s as w&#x27;s. In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), Pilate is played by David Bowie, who appears as &quot;gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus (Willem Dafoe). The trial takes place in Pilate&#x27;s private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus&#x27;s death, which he orders without any qualms.

Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; portrays Pilate, played by Hristo Shopov, as a sympathetic, noble-minded character, fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities&#x27; treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water. McDonough argues that &quot;Shopov gives us a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.&quot;

==Legacy==

Pontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the Nicene Creed and the Apostles Creed. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus &quot;suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.&quot; The Nicene Creed states &quot;For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.&quot; These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians. Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and Mary mentioned by name in the creeds. The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.

He is venerated as a saint by the Ethiopian Church with a feast day on 19 June, and was historically venerated by the Coptic Church, with a feast day of 25 June.

Pilate&#x27;s washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus&#x27;s death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination, and is the origin of the English phrase , meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something. Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the Gospel of John have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the Vulgate. These include ( &quot;Am I a Jew?&quot;), John 18:38 (; &quot;What is truth?&quot;), John 19:5 (, &quot;Behold the man!&quot;), (, &quot;Behold your king!&quot;), and (, &quot;What I have written, I have written&quot;).

The Gospels&#x27; deflection of responsibility for Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting antisemitism from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

===Scholarly assessments===
The main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels &quot;comparatively friendly.&quot; This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate&#x27;s long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.

On the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was &quot;a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.&quot; However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate&#x27;s long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator, while Henry MacAdam argues that &quot;[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.&quot; Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.

Beginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, some scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by Sejanus, that Pilate&#x27;s offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate&#x27;s coins. According to this theory, following Sejanus&#x27;s execution in 31 AD and Tiberius&#x27;s purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vacillating attitude at the trial of Jesus. Helen Bond argues that &quot;[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate&#x27;s coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,&quot; and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus. Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the Holocaust, that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that &quot;[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.&quot;

<doc id="113074" wikidata="Q770568" url="?curid=113074" title="Season of the Inundation">
<text>The Season of the Inundation or Flood () was the first season of the lunar and civil Egyptian calendars. It fell after the intercalary month of Days over the Year (&#x27;) and before the [[Season of the Emergence]] (&#x27;). In the Coptic and Egyptian calendars this season begins at the start of the month of Thout (about 11 September), continues through the months of Paopi and Hathor, before concluding at the end of Koiak (about 8 January). 

==Names==
The pronunciation of the ancient Egyptian name for the Season of the Inundation is uncertain as the hieroglyphs do not record its vowels. It is conventionally transliterated Akhet. The name refers to the annual flooding of the Nile.

==Lunar calendar==
In the lunar calendar, the intercalary month was added as needed to maintain the heliacal rising of Sirius in the fourth month of the season of the Harvest. This meant that the Season of the Inundation usually lasted from September to January. Because the precise timing of the flood varied, the months of &quot;Inundation&quot; no longer precisely reflected the state of the river but the season was usually the time of the annual flooding. This event was vital to the people because the waters left behind fertile silt and moisture, which were the source of the land&#x27;s fertility.

==Civil calendar==
In the civil calendar, the lack of leap years into the Ptolemaic and Roman periods meant the season lost about one day every four years and was not stable relative to the solar year or Gregorian calendar.

==Months==
The Season of the Inundation was divided into four months. In the lunar calendar, each began on a dawn when the waning crescent moon was no longer visible. In the civil calendar, each consisted of exactly 30 days divided into three 10-day weeks known as decans.

In ancient Egypt, these months were usually recorded by their number within the season: I, II, III, and IV &quot;Ꜣḫt&quot;. They were also known by the names of their principal festivals, which came to be increasingly used after the Persian occupation. These then became the basis for the names of the months of the Coptic calendar.

<text>The Season of the Emergence () was the second season of the lunar and civil Egyptian calendars. It fell after the Season of the Inundation (&#x27;) and before the [[Season of the Harvest]] (&#x27;). In the Coptic and Egyptian calendars this season begins at the start of the month of Tobi (about 9 January), continues through the months of Meshir and Paremhat, before concluding at the end of Parmouti (about 8 May). 

==Names==
The pronunciation of the Ancient Egyptian name for the Season of the Emergence is uncertain as the hieroglyphs do not record its vowels. It is conventionally transliterated as Peret or Proyet. The name refers to the emergence of the fertile land beside the Nile from its annual flood and the growth of vegetation and crops over the following season.

It is also known as Winter.

==Lunar calendar==
In the lunar calendar, the intercalary month was added as needed to maintain the heliacal rising of Sirius in the fourth month of the Season of the Harvest. This meant that the Season of the Emergence usually lasted from January to May. Because the precise timing of the flood varied, the months of &quot;Emergence&quot; no longer precisely reflected the state of the river but the season was usually the time for the planting and growth of Egyptian grain.

==Civil calendar==
In the civil calendar, the lack of leap years into the Ptolemaic and Roman periods meant the season lost about one day every four years and was not stable relative to the solar year or Gregorian calendar.

==Months==
The Season of the Emergence was divided into four months. In the lunar calendar, each began on a dawn when the waning crescent moon was no longer visible. In the civil calendar, each consisted of exactly 30 days divided into three 10-day weeks known as decans.

In ancient Egypt, these months were usually recorded by their number within the season: I, II, III, and IV &quot;Prt&quot;. They were also known by the names of their principal festivals, which came to be increasingly used after the Persian occupation. These then became the basis for the names of the months of the Coptic calendar.

<text>The Season of the Harvest or Low Water was the third and final season of the lunar and civil Egyptian calendars. It fell after the Season of the Emergence (&#x27;) and before the spiritually dangerous [[intercalary month (Egypt)|intercalary month]] (&#x27;), after which the New Year&#x27;s festivities began the Season of the Inundation (&quot;Ꜣḫt&quot;). In the Coptic and Egyptian calendars this season begins at the start of the month of Pashons (about 9 May), continues through the months of Paoni and Epip, before concluding at the end of Mesori (about 5 September). 

The festival now is known as Sham Ennessim, and it has been nationally celebrated by all the Egyptians since ancient times, as it is considered a national festival in Modern Egypt as it was related to the agricultural background of the ancient Egyptians, originating from Shemu. Sham Ennessim is an official holiday in modern Egypt.

==Names==
The Season of the Harvest was known to the Egyptians themselves as &quot;LowWater&quot; (), variously transliterated as Shemu or Shomu, in reference to the state of the Nile before the beginning of its annual flood.

It is also referred to as Summer or the Dry Season.

==Lunar calendar==
In the lunar calendar, the intercalary month was added as needed to maintain the heliacal rising of Sirius in the fourth month of this season. This meant that the Season of the Harvest usually lasted from May to September. Because the precise timing of the flood varied, the months of &quot;Low Water&quot; no longer precisely reflected the state of the river but the season was usually the time for the collection of Egypt&#x27;s grain harvest.

==Civil calendar==
In the civil calendar, the lack of leap years into the Ptolemaic and Roman periods meant the season lost about one day every four years and was not stable relative to the solar year or Gregorian calendar.

==Months==
The Season of the Harvest was divided into four months. In the lunar calendar, each began on a dawn when the waning crescent moon was no longer visible. In the civil calendar, each consisted of exactly 30 days divided into three 10-day weeks known as decans.

In ancient Egypt, these months were usually recorded by their number within the season: I, II, III, and IV &quot;Šmw&quot;. They were also known by the names of their principal festivals, which came to be increasingly used after the Persian occupation. These then became the basis for the names of the months of the Coptic calendar.

<doc id="113079" wikidata="Q961751" url="?curid=113079" title="Winnowing">
<text>Winnowing is a process by which chaff is separated from grain. It can also be used to remove pests from stored grain. Winnowing usually follows threshing in grain preparation. In its simplest form, it involves throwing the mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff, while the heavier grains fall back down for recovery. Techniques included using a winnowing fan (a shaped basket shaken to raise the chaff) or using a tool (a winnowing fork or shovel) on a pile of harvested grain.

==In Greek culture==
The winnowing-fan (λίκνον [&quot;líknon&quot;], also meaning a &quot;cradle&quot;) featured in the rites accorded Dionysus and in the Eleusinian Mysteries: &quot;it was a simple agricultural implement taken over and mysticized by the religion of Dionysus,&quot; Jane Ellen Harrison remarked. &quot;Dionysus Liknites&quot; (&quot;Dionysus of the winnowing fan&quot;) was wakened by the Dionysian women, in this instance called &quot;Thyiades&quot;, in a cave on Parnassus high above Delphi; the winnowing-fan links the god connected with the mystery religions to the agricultural cycle, but mortal Greek babies too were laid in a winnowing-fan. In Callimachus&#x27;s &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, Adrasteia lays the infant Zeus in a golden &quot;líknon&quot;, her goat suckles him and he is given honey. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the dead oracle Teiresias tells Odysseus to walk away from Ithaca with an oar until a wayfarer tells him it is a winnowing fan (i.e., until Odysseus has come so far from the sea that people don&#x27;t recognize oars), and there to build a shrine to Poseidon.

==China==


In ancient China, the method was improved by mechanization with the development of the rotary winnowing fan, which used a cranked fan to produce the airstream. This was featured in Wang Zhen&#x27;s book the &quot; Nong Shu&quot; of 1313 AD.

==In Europe==
In Saxon settlements such as one identified in Northumberland as Bede&#x27;s Ad Gefrin (now called Yeavering) the buildings were shown by an excavator&#x27;s reconstruction to have opposed entries. In barns a draught created by the use of these opposed doorways was used in winnowing.

The technique developed by the Chinese was not adopted in Europe until the 18th century when winnowing machines used a &#x27;sail fan&#x27;. The rotary winnowing fan was exported to Europe, brought there by Dutch sailors between 1700 and 1720. Apparently, they had obtained them from the Dutch settlement of Batavia in Java, Dutch East Indies. The Swedes imported some from south China at about the same time and Jesuits had taken several to France from China by 1720. Until the beginning of the 18th century, no rotary winnowing fans existed in the West.

==In the United States==
The development of the winnowing barn allowed rice plantations in South Carolina to increase their yields dramatically.

== Mechanization of the process ==
In 1737 Andrew Rodger, a farmer on the estate of Cavers in Roxburghshire, developed a winnowing machine for corn, called a &#x27;Fanner&#x27;. These were successful and the family sold them throughout Scotland for many years. Some Scottish Presbyterian ministers saw the fanners as sins against God, for the wind was a thing specially made by him and an artificial wind was a daring and impious attempt to usurp what belonged to God alone. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, the winnowing process was mechanized by the invention of additional winnowing machines, such as fanning mills.

<text>Billie Jean King (née Moffitt; born November 22, 1943), also known as BJK, is an American former world No. 1 tennis player. Widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, King won 39 Grand Slam titles: 12 in singles, 16 in women&#x27;s doubles, and 11 in mixed doubles. She was a member of the victorious United States team in seven Federation Cups and nine Wightman Cups.

King is an advocate of gender equality and has long been a pioneer for equality and social justice. In 1973, at the age of 29, she famously won the &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; tennis match against the 55-year-old Bobby Riggs. King was also the founder of the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association and the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation. She was instrumental in persuading cigarette brand Virginia Slims to sponsor women&#x27;s tennis in the 1970s and went on to serve on the board of their parent company Philip Morris in the 2000s.

King was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. The Fed Cup Award of Excellence was bestowed on her in 2010. In 1972, she was the joint winner, with John Wooden, of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsman of the Year award and was one of the &quot;Time&quot; Persons of the Year in 1975. She has also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Sportswoman of the Year lifetime achievement award. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1990, and in 2006, the USTA National Tennis Center in New York City was renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. In 2018, she won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2020, the Federation Cup was renamed the Billie Jean King Cup in her honor. In 2022, she was awarded the French Legion of Honour, and in 2024, she received a Congressional Gold Medal.

==Early life==
Billie Jean Moffitt was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (née Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Her family was athletic; her mother excelled at swimming, and her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays. She also excelled at baseball and softball as a child, playing shortstop at 10 years old on a team with girls 4–5 years older than she. The team went on to win the Long Beach softball championship.

She switched from softball to tennis at the age of 11, because her parents suggested she should find a more &#x27;ladylike&#x27; sport. She saved her own money, $8 ($92.40 in 2024 terms), to buy her first racket. She went with a school friend to take her first tennis lesson on the many free public courts in Long Beach, taking advantage of the free lessons offered by professional Clyde Walker, who worked for the City of Long Beach. One of the city&#x27;s tennis facilities has subsequently been named the Billie Jean Moffitt King Tennis Center. As a kid playing in her first tennis tournaments, she was often hindered by her aggressive playing style. One of King&#x27;s first conflicts with the tennis establishments and status-quo came in her youth, when she was forbidden from being in a group picture at a tournament because she was wearing tennis shorts (sewn by her mother) instead of the usual white tennis dress.

King&#x27;s family in Long Beach attended the Church of the Brethren, where the minister was former athlete and two-time Olympic pole-vaulting champion Bob Richards. One day, when King was 13 or 14, Richards asked her, &quot;What are you going to do with your life?&quot; She said: &quot;Reverend, I&#x27;m going to be the best tennis player in the world.&quot;

King attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School. After graduating in 1961, she attended Los Angeles State College, now California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA). She did not graduate, leaving school in 1964 to focus on tennis. While attending Cal State, she met Larry King in a library in 1963. The pair became engaged while still in school when Billie Jean was 20 and Larry 19 years old and married on September 17, 1965, in Long Beach.

==Career==

King&#x27;s French Open win in 1972 made her only the fifth woman in tennis history to win the singles titles at all four Grand Slam events, a &quot;career Grand Slam&quot;. She also won a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. In women&#x27;s doubles, only the Australian Open eluded her.

King won a record 20 career titles at Wimbledon – six in singles, 10 in women&#x27;s doubles, and four in mixed doubles.

King played 51 Grand Slam singles events from 1959 through 1983, reaching at least the semi-finals in 27 and at least the quarterfinals in 40 of her attempts. King was the runner-up in six Grand Slam singles events. An indicator of her mental toughness in Grand Slam singles tournaments was her 11–2 career record in deuce third sets, i.e., third sets that were tied 5–5 before being resolved.

King won 129 singles titles, 78 of which were WTA titles, and her career prize money totaled US$1,966,487.

In Federation Cup finals, she was on the winning United States team seven times, in 1963, 1966, 1967, and 1976 through 1979. Her career win–loss record was 52–4. She won the last 30 matches she played, including 15 straight wins in both singles and doubles. In Wightman Cup competition, her career win–loss record was 22–4, winning her last nine matches (six in singles and three in doubles). The United States won the cup in ten of the 11 years in which she participated. In singles, King was 6–1 against Ann Haydon-Jones, 4–0 against Virginia Wade, and 1–1 against Christine Truman Janes.

===The early years: 1959–1963===
As Billie Jean King began competing in 1959, she began working with new coaches including Frank Brennan and Alice Marble, who had won 18 Grand Slam titles as a player herself. She made her Grand Slam debut at the 1959 U.S. Championships when she was 15. She lost in the first round. She began playing at local, regional, and international tennis championships. Sports Illustrated already claimed her as &quot;one of the most promising youngsters on the West Coast.&quot; She won her first tournament the next year in Philadelphia at the 1960 Philadelphia and District Grass Court Championships. At her second attempt at the U.S. Championships, King made it to the third round, losing to Bernice Carr Vukovich of South Africa. Also in 1960, she reached the final of the National Girls&#x27; 18 and Under Championships, losing to Karen Hantze Susman. Her national tennis ranking improved from number 19 in 1959 to number 4 in 1960. Despite the success, Marble terminated her professional relationship with King, for reasons stemming from King&#x27;s ambition.

King first gained international recognition in 1961 when the Long Beach Tennis Patrons, the Century Club, and Harold Guiver raised $2,000 to send her to Wimbledon. There, she won the women&#x27;s doubles title in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze. King was 17 and Hantze was 18, making them the youngest team to win the Wimbledon Doubles Title. King had less luck that year in the 1961 Wimbledon women&#x27;s singles, losing to fifth-seeded Yola Ramírez in a two-day match on Centre Court. Despite these performances. she could not get a sports scholarship when later that year she attended Los Angeles State (now California State). For the 1962 singles tournament at Wimbledon, King upset Margaret Court, the World No. 1 and top seed, in a second round match by attacking Court&#x27;s forehand This was the first time in Wimbledon history that the women&#x27;s top seed had lost her first match. That same year, King and Hantze repeated their doubles victory at Wimbledon. In 1963, King again faced Margaret Court at Wimbledon. This time they met in the final, and Court prevailed.

===1964===
In 1964, King won four relatively minor titles but lost to Margaret Court in the Wimbledon semi-finals. She defeated Ann Haydon-Jones at both the Wightman Cup and Fed Cup but lost to Court in the final of the Federation Cup. At the U.S. Championships, fifth-seeded Nancy Richey upset third-seeded King in the quarterfinals. Late in the year, King decided to make a full-time commitment to tennis. While a history major at Los Angeles State College, King made the decision to play full-time when businessman Robert Mitchell offered to pay her way to Australia so that she could train under the great Australian coach Mervyn Rose. While in Australia, King played three tournaments that year and lost in the quarterfinals of the Queensland Grass Court Championships, the final of the New South Wales Championships (to Court), and the third round of the Victorian Championships.

===1965===
In early 1965, King continued her three-month tour of Australia. She lost in the final of the South Australian Championships and the first round of the Western Australia Championships. At the Fed Cup in Melbourne, she defeated Ann Haydon-Jones to help the United States defeat the United Kingdom in the second round. However, Margaret Court again defeated her in the final. At the Australian Championships two weeks later, she lost to Court in the semi-finals in two sets. At Wimbledon, she again lost in the semi-finals, this time in three sets to Maria Bueno. Her last tournament of the year was the U.S. Championships, where she defeated Jones in the quarterfinals and Bueno in the semi-finals. In the final, King led 5–3 in both sets, was two points from winning the first set, and had two set points in the second set before losing to Court in straight sets. She said that losing while being so close to winning was devastating, but the match proved to her that she was &quot;good enough to be the best in the world. I&#x27;m going to win Wimbledon next year.&quot; She won six tournaments during the year. For the first time in 81 years, the annual convention of the United States Lawn Tennis Association overruled its ranking committee&#x27;s recommendation to award her the sole U.S. No. 1 position and voted 59,810 to 40,966 to rank Nancy Richey Gunter and King as co-U.S. No. 1.

===Prime competitive years: 1966–1975===

====Overview====

Six of King&#x27;s Grand Slam singles titles were at Wimbledon, four were at the U.S. Championships/Open, one was at the French Open, and one was at the Australian Championships. King reached the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament in 16 out of 25 attempts and had a 12–4 win–loss record in those finals. In the nine tournaments that she failed to reach the final, she was a losing semi-finalist twice and a losing quarter finalist five times. From 1971 through 1975, she won seven of the ten Grand Slam singles tournaments she played. She won the last seven Grand Slam singles finals she contested, six of them in straight sets and four of them against Evonne Goolagong. All but one of her Grand Slam singles titles were on grass.

King&#x27;s Grand Slam record from 1966 through 1975 was comparable to that of Margaret Court, her primary rival during these years. One or both of these women played 35 of the 40 Grand Slam singles tournaments held during this period, and together they won 24 of them. During this period, Court won 31 of her career 64 Grand Slam titles, including 12 of her 24 Grand Slam singles titles, 11 of her 19 Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles titles, and eight of her 21 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. Court reached the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament in 14 out of 25 attempts and had a 12–2 win–loss record in those finals. Court won seven of the 12 Grand Slam finals she played against King during these years, including 2–1 in singles finals, 4–1 in women&#x27;s doubles finals, and 1–3 in mixed doubles finals.

King was the year-ending World No. 1 in six of the ten years from 1966 through 1975. She was the year-ending World No. 2 in three of those years and the World No. 3 in the other year.

King won 97 of her career 129 singles titles during this period and was the runner-up in 36 other tournaments.

====1966====

In 1966, King defeated Dorothy &quot;Dodo&quot; Cheney (then 49 years old) for the first time in five career matches, winning their semi-final at the Southern California Championships 6–0, 6–3. King also ended her nine-match losing streak to Margaret Court by defeating her in the final of the South African Tennis Championships. She also won the women&#x27;s singles in the Ojai Tennis Tournament. At the Wightman Cup just before Wimbledon, King defeated Virginia Wade and Ann Haydon-Jones. After thirteen unsuccessful attempts to win a Grand Slam singles title from 1959 through 1965, King at the age of 22 finally won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon and the first of twelve Grand Slam singles titles overall, defeating Court in the semi-finals 6–3, 6–3 and Maria Bueno in the final. King credited her semi-final victory to her forehand down the line, a new shot in her repertoire. She also said that the strategy for playing Court is, &quot;Simple. Just chip the ball back at her feet.&quot; At the U.S. Championships, an ill King was upset by Kerry Melville in the second round.

====1967====
King successfully defended her title at the South African Tennis Championships in 1967, defeating Maria Bueno in the final. She played the French Championships for the first time in her career, falling in the quarterfinals to Annette Van Zyl of South Africa. At the Federation Cup one week later in West Germany on clay, King won all four of her matches, including victories over DuPlooy, Ann Haydon-Jones, and Helga Niessen. King then successfully switched surfaces and won her second consecutive Wimbledon singles title, defeating Virginia Wade in the quarterfinals 7–5, 6–2 and Jones. At the Wightman Cup, King again defeated Wade and Jones. King won her second Grand Slam singles title of the year when she won the U.S. Championships for the first time and without losing a set, defeating Wade, Van Zyl, Françoise Dürr, and Jones in consecutive matches. Jones pulled her left hamstring muscle early in the final and saved four match points in the second set before King prevailed. King won the singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships, the first woman to do that since Alice Marble in 1939. King then returned to the Australian summer tour in December for the first time since 1965, playing seven events there and Judy Tegart in six of those events (winning four of their matches). King lost in the quarterfinals of the New South Wales Championships in Sydney to Tegart after King injured her left knee in the second game of the third set of that match. However, King won the Victorian Championships in Melbourne the following week, defeating Dalton, Reid, and Lesley Turner in the last three rounds. At a team event in Adelaide, King won all three of her singles and doubles matches to help the U.S. defeat Australia 5–1. To finish the year, King lost to Tegart in the final of the South Australian Championships in Adelaide.

====1968====
In early 1968, King won three consecutive tournaments to end her Australian tour. In Perth, King won the Western Australia Championships, defeating Margaret Court in the final. In Hobart, King won the Tasmanian Championships by defeating Judy Tegart-Dalton in the final. King then won the Australian Championships for the first time, defeating Dalton in the semi-finals and Court in the final. King continued to win tournaments upon her return to the United States, winning three indoor tournaments before Nancy Richey Gunter defeated King in the semi-finals of the Madison Square Garden Challenge Trophy amateur tournament in New York City before 10,233 spectators. The match started with Gunter taking a 4–2 lead in the first set, before King won 9 of the next 10 games. King served for the match at 5–1 and had a match point at 5–3 in the second set; however, she lost the final 12 games and the match 4–6, 7–5, 6–0. King then won three consecutive tournaments in Europe before losing to Ann Haydon-Jones in the final of a professional tournament at Madison Square Garden. Playing the French Open for only the second time in her career and attempting to win four consecutive Grand Slam singles titles (a &quot;non-calendar year Grand Slam&quot;), King defeated Maria Bueno in a quarterfinal before losing to Gunter in a semi-final 2–6, 6–3, 6–4. King rebounded to win her third consecutive Wimbledon singles title, defeating Jones in the semi-finals and Dalton in the final. At the US Open, King defeated Bueno in a semi-final before being upset in the final by Virginia Wade. On September 24, she had surgery to repair cartilage in her left knee and did not play in tournaments the remainder of the year. King said that it took eight months (May 1969) for her knee to recover completely from the surgery. In 1977, King said that her doctors predicted in 1968 that her left knee would allow her to play competitive tennis for only two more years.

====1969====
King participated in the 1969 Australian summer tour for the second consecutive year. Unlike the previous year, King did not win a tournament. She lost in the quarterfinals of the Tasmanian Championships and the semi-finals of the New South Wales Championships. At the Australian Open, King defeated 17-year-old Evonne Goolagong in the second round 6–3, 6–1 and Ann Haydon-Jones in a three-set semi-final before losing to Margaret Court in a straight-sets final. The following week, King lost in the semi-finals of the New Zealand Championships. Upon her return to the United States, King won the Pacific Coast Pro and the Los Angeles Pro. King then won two tournaments in South Africa, including the South African Open. During the European summer clay court season, King lost in the quarterfinals of both the Italian Open and the French Open. On grass at the Wills Open in Bristol, United Kingdom, King defeated Virginia Wade in the semi-finals (6–8, 11–9, 6–2) before losing to Court. At Wimbledon, King lost only 13 points while defeating Rosemary Casals in the semi-finals 6–1, 6–0; however, Jones upset King in the final and prevented King from winning her fourth consecutive singles title there. The week after, King again defeated Wade to win the Irish Open for the second time in her career. In the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, King lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open to Nancy Richey Gunter 6–4, 8–6. This was the first year since 1965 that King did not win at least one Grand Slam singles title. King finished the year with titles at the Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles, the Stockholm Indoors, and the Midland (Texas) Pro. She said during the Pacific Southwest Open, &quot;It has been a bad year for me. My left knee has been OK, but I have been bothered by a severe tennis elbow for seven months. I expect to have a real big year in 1970, though, because I really have the motivation now. I feel like a kid again.&quot;

====1970====

In 1970, Margaret Court won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments and was clearly the World No. 1. King lost to Court three times in the first four months of the year, in Philadelphia, Dallas, and Johannesburg (at the South African Open). Court, however, was not totally dominant during this period as King defeated her in Sydney and Durban, South Africa. Where Court dominated was at the Grand Slam tournaments. King did not play the Australian Open. King had leg cramps and lost to Helga Niessen Masthoff of West Germany in the quarterfinals of the French Open 2–6, 8–6, 6–1. At Wimbledon, Court needed seven match points to defeat King in the final 14–12, 11–9 in one of the greatest women&#x27;s finals in the history of the tournament. On July 22, King had right knee surgery, which forced her to miss the US Open. King returned to the tour in September, where she had a first round loss at the Virginia Slims Invitational in Houston and a semi-final loss at the Pacific Coast Championships in Berkeley, California. To close out the year, King in November won the Virginia Slims Invitational in Richmond, Virginia and the Embassy Indoor Tennis Championships in London. During the European clay court season, King warmed-up for the French Open by playing in Monte Carlo (losing in the semi-finals), winning the Italian Open (saving three match points against Virginia Wade in the semi-finals), playing in Bournemouth (losing to Wade in the quarterfinals), and playing in Berlin (losing to Masthoff in the semi-finals). The Italian Open victory was the first important clay court title of King&#x27;s career. Along the way, she defeated Masthoff in a three-set quarterfinal and Wade in a three-set semi-final, saving two match points at 4–5 in the second set. The twelfth game of that set (with King leading 6–5) had 21 deuces and lasted 22 minutes, with Wade saving seven set points and holding sixteen game points before King won. In Wightman Cup competition two weeks before Wimbledon but played at the All England Club, King defeated both Wade and Ann Haydon-Jones in straight sets.
Many things bothered King concerning her advocacy for women&#x27;s rights in sports. Among these concerns, she sought better pay for female tennis players, given the substantial differences in budgets between male and female players. In September 1970, there was the Pacific Southwest Open which was a tennis tournament. The prize money for men and women varied significantly, with the top prize for men being $12,500 and for women, a mere $1,500. Women&#x27;s expenses were not covered unless they made the quarterfinals. This had bothered King and was the final straw for her. King and other 8 women did not play because of the budgets which they were willing to take the risk of expulsion from the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association. King and the other women organized the women-only Houston Virginia Slims invitational and this helped launch the series of women-only tournaments.

====1971====
Although King won only one Grand Slam singles title in 1971, this was the best year of her career in terms of tournaments won (17). According to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she played in 31 singles tournaments and compiled a 112–13 win–loss record.

She started the year by winning eight of the first thirteen tournaments she played, defeating Rosemary Casals in seven finals. King&#x27;s five losses during this period were to Françoise Dürr (twice), Casals (once), Ann Haydon-Jones (once), and Chris Evert (in St. Petersburg). At the time, King said that retiring from the match with Evert after splitting the first two sets was necessary because of leg cramps. But in early 1972, King admitted that cramps associated with an abortion caused the retirement.

At the tournament in early May at Hurlingham, United Kingdom, King lost a second round match to an old rival, Christine Truman Janes (now 30 years old), 6–4, 6–2; but King recovered the next week to win the German Open in Hamburg on clay. Four weeks later at the Queen&#x27;s Club tournament in London, King played Margaret Court for the first time in 1971, losing their final. At Wimbledon, King defeated Janes in the fourth round (6–2, 7–5) and Durr in the quarterfinals before losing unexpectedly to Evonne Goolagong in the semi-finals 6–4, 6–4. Two weeks after Wimbledon, King won the Rothmans North of England Championships on grass in Hoylake, United Kingdom, beating Virginia Wade, Court, and Casals in the last three rounds. She then played two clay court tournaments in Europe, winning neither, before resuming play in the United States.

In August, King won the indoor Houston tournament and the U.S. Women&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Indianapolis. King then switched back to grass and won the US Open without losing a set, defeating Evert in the semi-finals (6–3, 6–2) and Casals in the final. King then won the tournaments in Louisville, Phoenix, and London (Wembley Pro). King and Casals both defaulted at 6–6 in the final of the Pepsi Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles in September when their request to remove a lineswoman was denied, eventually resulting in the United States Lawn Tennis Association fining both players US$2,500. To end the year, King played two tournaments in New Zealand but did not win either. She lost in Christchurch to Durr and in Auckland to Kerry Melville Reid.
In 1971, King was the first female tennis player to earn $100,000 a year. Being one of her greatest accomplishments, this earned her congratulatory phone call from President Richard M. Nixon.

====1972====
King won three Grand Slam singles titles in 1972, electing not to play the Australian Open despite being nearby when she played in New Zealand in late 1971. King said, &quot;I was twenty-eight years old, and I was at the height of my powers. I&#x27;m quite sure I could have won the Grand Slam [in] ... 1972, but the Australian was such a minor-league tournament at that time... More important, I did not want to miss any Virginia Slims winter tournaments. I was playing enough as it was.&quot; Her dominance was aided by rival Margaret Court&#x27;s absence from the tour due to childbirth during most of the 1972 season.

At the beginning of the year, King failed to win eight of the first ten tournaments she played. She won the title in San Francisco in mid-January. But then King lost in Long Beach to Françoise Dürr (although King claimed in her 1982 autobiography that she intentionally lost the match because of an argument with her husband) and in Fort Lauderdale on clay to Chris Evert 6–1, 6–0. The inconsistent results continued through mid-April, in Oklahoma City (losing in the quarterfinals); Washington, D.C. (losing in the second round); and Dallas (losing to Nancy Richey Gunter after defeating Evert in the quarterfinals 6–7(4–5), 6–3, 7–5 and Evonne Goolagong in the semi-finals 1–6, 6–4, 6–1). King won the title in Richmond; however, one week later, King lost in the semi-finals of the tournament in San Juan. This was followed in successive weeks by a loss in the Jacksonville final to Marie Neumannová Pinterová and in a St. Petersburg semi-final to Evert (6–2, 6–3).

King did not lose again until mid-August, winning six consecutive tournaments. She won the tournaments in Tucson and Indianapolis. King then won the French Open without losing a set and completed a career Grand Slam. She defeated Virginia Wade in the quarterfinals, Helga Niessen Masthoff in the semi-finals, and Goolagong in the final. On grass, King then won the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments in Nottingham and Bristol and won Wimbledon itself for the fourth time. She lost only one set during the tournament, to Wade in the quarterfinals. That was followed by straight set wins over Rosemary Casals and Goolagong. When the tour returned to the United States, King did not win any of the three tournaments she played before the US Open, including a straight sets loss to Margaret Court in Newport. At the US Open, however, King won the tournament without losing a set, including a quarterfinal win over Wade, a semi-final defeat of Court, and a final win over Kerry Melville Reid. King finished the year by winning the tournaments in Charlotte and Phoenix (defeating Court in the final of both), a runner-up finish in Oakland (losing to Court), and a semifinal finish at the year-end championships in Boca Raton (losing to Evert).

====1973====

1973 was Margaret Court&#x27;s turn to win three Grand Slam singles titles, failing to win only Wimbledon, and was the clear world No. 1 for the year; this was her first full season since winning the Grand Slam in 1970, as she had missed significant portions of 1971 and 1972 due to childbirth. As during the previous year, King started 1973 inconsistently. She missed the first three Virginia Slims tournaments in January because of a wrist injury. She then lost in the third round at the Virginia Slims of Miami tournament but won the Virginia Slims of Indianapolis tournament, defeating Court in the semi-finals 6–7, 7–6, 6–3 and Rosemary Casals in the final. The semi-final victory ended Court&#x27;s 12-tournament and 59-match winning streaks, with King saving at least three match points when down 5–4 (40–0) in the second set. Indianapolis was followed by five tournaments that King failed to win (Detroit, Boston, Chicago, Jacksonville, and the inaugural Family Circle Cup in Hilton Head, South Carolina). King lost to Court in two of those tournaments. After deciding not to defend her French Open singles title, King won four consecutive tournaments, including her fifth Wimbledon singles title when she defeated Kerry Melville Reid in the quarterfinals, Evonne Goolagong in the semi-finals on her eighth match point, and Chris Evert in the final. King lost only nine points in the 6–0 bageling of Evert in the first set of their final.

King also completed the Triple Crown at Wimbledon (winning the singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles titles in the same year), thus becoming the first, and only, player to do so at Wimbledon in the Open Era. In none of the preceding tournaments, however, did King play Court. Their rivalry resumed in the final of the Virginia Slims of Nashville tournament, where Court won for the third time in four matches against King in 1973. (This was the last ever singles match between those players, with Court winning 21 and King 13 of their 34 matches.) Three weeks later at the US Open, King retired from her fourth-round match with Julie Heldman while ill and suffering from the oppressive heat and humidity. When Heldman complained to the match umpire that King was taking too long between games, King reportedly told Heldman, &quot;If you want the match that badly, you can have it!&quot; The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs was held in the middle of the Virginia Slims of Houston tournament. King won her first and second round matches three days before playing Riggs, defeated Riggs, won her quarterfinal match the day after the Riggs match, and then lost the following day to Casals in the semifinals 7–6, 6–1. According to King, &quot;I had nothing left to give.&quot; To end the year, King won tournaments in Phoenix, Hawaii, and Tokyo and was the runner-up in Baltimore.

=====Battle of the Sexes=====
In 1973, King defeated Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match, winning $100,000 ($707,000 in 2024 terms).

Riggs had been a top men&#x27;s player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks. He won the Wimbledon men&#x27;s singles title in 1939, and was considered the World No. 1 male tennis player for 1941, 1946, and 1947. He then became a self-described tennis &quot;hustler&quot; who played in promotional challenge matches. Claiming that the women&#x27;s game was so inferior to the men&#x27;s game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Court 6–2, 6–1. King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him for $100,000 in a winner-takes-all match.

Dubbed &quot;the Battle of the Sexes&quot;, the Riggs–King match took place at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a television audience estimated at 50 million people (U.S.), and 90 million in 37 countries, 29-year-old King beat the 55-year-old Riggs 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. The match is considered a significant event in developing greater recognition and respect for women&#x27;s tennis. as King said to author and photographer Lynn Gilbert in her book &quot;Particular Passions: Talks with Women who Have Shaped Our Times&quot;, &quot;I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn&#x27;t win that match. It would ruin the women&#x27;s tour and affect all women&#x27;s self-esteem,&quot; and that &quot;to beat a 55-year-old guy was no thrill for me. The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis.&quot;

====1974====
King won five of the first seven tournaments she contested in 1974. She won the Virginia Slims of San Francisco, defeating Nancy Richey Gunter in the semi-finals and Chris Evert in the final. The following week in Indian Wells, California, King again defeated Gunter in the semi-finals but lost to Evert in the final. King then won tournaments in Fairfax, Virginia and Detroit before losing a semi-final match to Virginia Wade in Chicago. King won both tournaments she played in March, defeating Gunter in the Akron, Ohio final and Evert at the U.S. Indoor Championships final. Olga Morozova then upset King in her next two tournaments, at Philadelphia in the final and at Wimbledon in a quarterfinal 7–5, 6–2. Afterward, King did not play a tour match until the US Open, where she won her fourth singles title and third in the last four years. She defeated Rosemary Casals in a straight sets quarterfinal, avenged in the semi-finals her previous year&#x27;s loss to Julie Heldman, and narrowly defeated Evonne Goolagong in the final. King did not reach a tournament final during the remainder of the year, losing to Heldman in an Orlando semi-final, Wade in a Phoenix semi-final, and Goolagong in a semi-final of the tour-ending Virginia Slims Championships in Los Angeles.

====1975====
In 1975, King played singles only half the year, as she retired (temporarily, as it turned out) from tournament singles competition immediately after winning her sixth Wimbledon singles title.

She began the year in San Francisco, defeating Françoise Dürr and Virginia Wade before losing to Chris Evert in the final. The following week, King won the Sarasota, Florida tournament, defeating Evert in the final 6–3, 6–2. Evert said immediately after the final, which was her thirteenth career match with King, &quot;I think that&#x27;s the best that Billie Jean has ever played. I hit some great shots but they just kept coming back at me.&quot; Looking back at that match, King said, &quot;I probably played so well because I had to, for the money. Out of frustration comes creativity. Right?&quot; Two months later, Wade defeated King in the semi-finals of the Philadelphia tournament. At the Austin, Texas, tournament in April, King defeated Evonne Goolagong 6–1, 6–3 before losing to Evert in the final. As King was serving for the match at 6–5 in the third set, a disputed line call went in Evert&#x27;s favor. King said after the match that she was cheated out of the match and that she had never been angrier about a match.

King played only one of the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments, defeating Olga Morozova in the Eastbourne semi-finals before losing to Wade in the final. Seeded third at Wimbledon, King defeated seventh seeded Morozova in the quarterfinals (6–3, 6–3) and then top seeded Evert in the semi-finals (2–6, 6–2, 6–3) after being down 3–0 (40–15) in the final set. Evert blamed her semifinal defeat on a loss of concentration when she saw Jimmy Connors, her former fiancé, escorting Susan George into Centre Court. King, however, believes that the match turned around because King planned for and totally prepared for Wimbledon that year and told herself when she was on the verge of defeat, &quot;Hey, Billie Jean, this is ridiculous. You paid the price. For once, you looked ahead. You&#x27;re supposed to win. Get your bahoola in gear.&quot; King then defeated fourth seeded Goolagong Cawley in the second most lopsided women&#x27;s final ever at Wimbledon (6–0, 6–1). King called her performance a &quot;near perfect match&quot; and said to the news media, &quot;I&#x27;m never coming back.&quot;

===The later years: 1976–1990===

====1976====
Except for five Federation Cup singles matches that she won in straight sets in August, King played only in doubles and mixed doubles events from January through September. She partnered Phil Dent to the mixed doubles title at the US Open. She lost to Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat in both of the singles tournaments she played the remainder of the year. Looking back, King said, &quot;I wasted 1976. After watching Chris Evert and Evonne [Goolagong] Cawley play the final at Wimbledon I asked myself what I was doing. So, despite my age and the operations, the Old Lady came back...&quot; King had knee surgery for the third time on November 9, this time on her right knee, and did not play the remainder of the year.

====1977====
King spent the first three months of the year rehabilitating her right knee after surgery in November 1976.

In March 1977, King requested that the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) exercise its right to grant a wild card entry to King for the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Margaret Court, who finished in sixth place on the Virginia Slims points list, had left the tour due to her fourth pregnancy and thus failed to qualify for the tournament because she did not play enough Virginia Slims tournaments leading up to the championships. This left a spot open in the draw, which the WTA filled with Mima Jaušovec. King then decided to play the Lionel Cup tournament in San Antonio, Texas, which the WTA harshly criticized because tournament officials there had allowed Renée Richards, a transgender athlete, to enter. Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Betty Stöve (president of the WTA) criticized King&#x27;s decision because of Richards&#x27;s unresolved and highly controversial status on the women&#x27;s tennis tour. Evert said she was disappointed with King and that until Richards&#x27;s status was resolved, &quot;all of the women should stick together.&quot; Navratilova said, &quot;Billie Jean is a bad girl pouting. She made a bad decision. She&#x27;s mad because she could not get what she wanted.&quot; Stöve said that if King had wanted the competition, &quot;[T]here are plenty of men around here she could&#x27;ve played with. She didn&#x27;t have to choose a &#x27;disputed&#x27; tournament.&quot; The draw in San Antonio called for King to play Richards in the semi-finals had form held; however, Richards lost in the quarterfinals. King eventually won the tournament.

At the clay court Family Circle Cup in late March, King played for the last time her long-time rival Nancy Richey Gunter in the first round. King won 0–6, 7–6, 6–2. She defeated another clay court specialist, Virginia Ruzici, in the second round before winning only one game from Evert in the final.

At Wimbledon in the third round, King played Maria Bueno for the last time, with King winning 6–2, 7–5. In the quarterfinals, Evert defeated King for the first time at a Grand Slam singles tournament and for the first time on grass 6–1, 6–2 in just 46 minutes. Evert said it was the best match she had ever played on grass up to that point in her career, and King said, &quot;No excuses. Let&#x27;s forget knees, ankles, toes, everything else. She just played beautiful tennis. I don&#x27;t think many players would&#x27;ve beaten her today.&quot; King also said after the match, &quot;Maybe I can be happy being number eight instead of number one. At this stage, just playing, that&#x27;s winning enough for me.&quot; But when asked about retirement, King said, &quot;Retire? Quit tournament tennis? You gotta be kidding. It just means I&#x27;ve got a lot more work. I&#x27;ve got to make myself match tough ... mentally as well as physically. I gotta go out and kill myself for the next six months. It&#x27;s a long, arduous process. I will suffer. But I will be back.&quot; There was a small historic note at Wimbledon 1977 in that it was the first time ever that King competed at the championships that she did not reach a final. From her debut in 1961 until 1976, she had played in the final of one of the three championship events for women every year. Perhaps there was irony in this in that as the Wimbledon champion with the most titles in its history, the event was celebrating its centenary in the year King failed to make a final for the first time. The only other years she competed at the championship and did not feature in a final were 1980 and 1982. In her entire Wimbledon career of 22 competitions, King never failed to be a semi-finalist in at least one event every year.

Evert repeated her Wimbledon quarterfinal victory over King at the clay court US Open, winning 6–2, 6–0. This loss prompted King to say, &quot;I better get it together by October or November or that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll have to make some big decisions. I&#x27;m not 20-years-old and I can&#x27;t just go out and change my game. It&#x27;s only the last four weeks I haven&#x27;t been in [knee] pain. [But if] I keep using that as a copout, I shouldn&#x27;t play.&quot;

The remainder of the year, King&#x27;s win–loss record was 31–3, losing to only Evert, Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat, and Michelle Tyler. King won five of the eight tournaments she entered plus both of her Wightman Cup matches. She defeated Navratilova all four times they played, including three times in three consecutive weeks, and beat Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade twice. Beginning September 26, King played seven consecutive weeks. She lost to Tyler in the second round in Palm Harbor, Florida, and Fromholtz Balestrat in the semi-finals in Atlanta. She then won three hard court tournaments in three consecutive weeks. She defeated Navratilova and Wendy Turnbull to win in Phoenix, losing only four points to Turnbull in the third set of the final. The next week, she defeated Navratilova, Fromholtz Balestrat, and Wimbledon runner-up Stöve to win in São Paulo. The third week, she defeated Ruzici, Stöve, and Janet Newberry Wright to win in San Juan. In November, Evert snapped King&#x27;s 18-match winning streak in the final of the Colgate Series Championships in Mission Hills, California. King then won her Wightman Cup matches, defeated Navratilova to win the tournament in Japan, and beat Wade to win the Bremar Cup in London. King said, &quot;I have never had a run like this, even in the years when I was Wimbledon champion. At 34, I feel fitter than when I was 24.&quot;

====1978====
King played ten singles tournaments during the first half of 1978, limiting herself to doubles after Wimbledon.

To start the year, King was the runner-up in Houston and Kansas City (losing to Martina Navratilova in both) and in Philadelphia (losing to Chris Evert). At the Virginia Slims Championships, King lost her first round robin match to Virginia Wade and defaulted her two remaining round robin matches because of a leg injury sustained during the first match.

At Wimbledon, King played with a painful heel spur in her left foot and lost to Evert in the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year 6–3, 3–6, 6–2. The match was on-serve in the third set with King serving at 2–3 (40–0) before Evert won five consecutive points to break serve. King won a total of only two points during the last two games. King said after the match, &quot;I don&#x27;t think my mobility is very good and that&#x27;s what I need to beat her. Physically, she [Evert] tears your guts apart unless you can stay with her. I&#x27;m really disappointed. I really wanted to play well. I just couldn&#x27;t cut it because of my heel.&quot; King and her partner Ray Ruffels lost in the final of mixed doubles in straight sets.

King teamed with Navratilova to win the women&#x27;s doubles title at the US Open, King&#x27;s fourth women&#x27;s doubles title at that tournament and fourteenth Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles title overall. To end the year, King was undefeated in five doubles matches (four with Evert and one with Rosemary Casals) as the U.S. won the Federation Cup in Melbourne, Australia. She also teamed with Tracy Austin in the 1978 Wightman Cup against Great Britain, beating Anne Hobbs &amp; Sue Mappin in the best of seven rubbers, despite the US losing the Cup 3–4. During the Federation Cup competition, King hinted at retirement from future major singles competitions and said that she was &quot;sick and tired of continued surgery&quot; in trying to get fit enough for those events. Nevertheless, King had foot surgery on December 22 in an attempt to regain mobility for a return to the tennis tour.

====1979====
During the first half of 1979, King played only one event – doubles in the Federation Cup tie against Spain – because of major surgery to her left foot during December 1978.

King returned to singles competition at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Chichester. She defeated the reigning Wimbledon champion, Martina Navratilova, in a 48-minute quarterfinal 6–1, 6–2 before losing to Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semi-finals 1–6, 6–4, 10–8. Seeded seventh at Wimbledon, King defeated Hana Mandlíková in the fourth round before losing the last six games of the quarterfinal match with fourth-seeded Tracy Austin 6–4, 6–7(5), 6–2. King partnered with Navratilova at Wimbledon to win King&#x27;s 20th and final Wimbledon title, breaking Elizabeth Ryan&#x27;s longstanding record of 19 Wimbledon titles just one day after Ryan collapsed and died at Wimbledon.

At the US Open, the ninth-seeded King reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set, where she upset the fourth-seeded Virginia Wade 6–3, 7–6(4). Next up was a semi-final match with the four-time defending champion and top-seeded Chris Evert; however, with King hampered by a neck injury sustained during a bear hug with a friend the day before the match, Evert won 6–1, 6–0, including the last eleven games and 48 of the last 63 points. This was Evert&#x27;s eighth consecutive win over King, with Evert during those matches losing only one set and 31 games and winning four 6–0 sets. Evert said after the match, &quot;Psychologically, I feel very confident when I ... play her.&quot;

The following week in Tokyo, King won her first singles title in almost two years, defeating Goolagong Cawley in the final. In November in Stockholm, King defeated Betty Stöve in the final after Stöve lost her concentration while serving for the match at 5–4 in the third set. Three weeks later in Brighton, King lost a semi-final match with Navratilova 7–5, 0–6, 7–6(3) after King led 6–5 in the third set. She ended the year with a quarterfinal loss in Melbourne (not the Australian Open), a second round loss in Sydney, and a three-set semi-final loss to Austin in Tokyo.

====1980–1981====
King won the tournament in Houston that began in February, snapping Martina Navratilova&#x27;s 28-match winning streak in the straight-sets final.

At the winter series-ending Avon Championships in March, King defeated Virginia Wade in her first round robin match 6–1, 6–3. After Wade held serve at love to open the match, King won nine consecutive games and lost only nine points during those games. King then lost her second round robin match to Navratilova and defeated Wendy Turnbull in an elimination round match, before losing to Tracy Austin in the semi-finals

King played the 1980 French Open, her first time since she won the event in 1972 and completed a career singles Grand Slam. She was seeded second but lost in the quarterfinals to fifth-seeded Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat of Australia.

At Wimbledon, King defeated Pam Shriver in a two-hour, forty minute fourth round match after King saved a match point in the second set and recovered from a 4–2 (40–0) deficit in the third set with Shriver serving. In a quarterfinal that took two days to complete, King lost to two-time defending champion and top-seeded Navratilova 7–6, 1–6, 10–8. The beginning of the match was delayed until late afternoon because of rain. Because she wore glasses, King agreed to start the match then on condition that tournament officials immediately suspend the match if the rain resumed. During the first set, drizzle began to fall; however, the chair umpire refused to suspend the match. King led in the tiebreaker 5–1 before Navratilova came back to win the set, whereupon the umpire then agreed to the suspension. When the match resumed the next day, King won 20 of the first 23 points to take a 5–0 lead in the second set and lost a total of seven points while winning the set in just 17 minutes. In the third set, Navratilova broke serve to take a 2–0 lead before King broke back twice and eventually served for the match at 6–5. King then hit four volley errors, enabling Navratilova to break serve at love and even the match. King saved three match points while serving at 6–7 and three more match points while serving at 7–8. During the change-over between games at 8–9, King&#x27;s glasses broke for the first time in her career. She had a spare pair, but they did not feel the same. King saved two match points before Navratilova broke serve to win the match. King said, &quot;I think that may be the single match in my career that I could have won if I hadn&#x27;t had bad eyes.&quot;

King teamed with Navratilova to win King&#x27;s 39th and final Grand Slam title at the US Open. Navratilova then decided she wanted a new doubles partner and started playing with Shriver but refused to discuss the change directly with King. She finally confronted Navratilova during the spring of 1981, reportedly saying to her, &quot;Tell me I&#x27;m too old ... but tell me something.&quot; Navratilova refused to talk about it.

King had minor knee surgery on November 14 in San Francisco to remove adhesions and cartilage.

====1982–1983====
In 1982, King began a comeback, winning the Wimbledon warm-up tournament the 1982 Edgbaston Cup in Birmingham, her first singles title in more than two years. King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7–5, 5–4 (40–0) before Harford&#x27;s apparent winner was deemed &#x27;not up&#x27; by the umpire, something the South African protested vehemently. King then saved the next two match points to win the second set 7–6(2) and then the third set 6–3. King said in her post-match press conference, &quot;I can&#x27;t recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4–5 and love–40, I told myself, &#x27;You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on. In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3–6, 6–4, 6–2 to become the oldest female semi-finalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King&#x27;s first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, &quot;Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2–0 in the third set and the &#x27;2&#x27; seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2–0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn&#x27;t have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.&quot; Two days later in the semi-finals, which was King&#x27;s 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7–6(4), 2–6, 6–3. King was down a set and 2–1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15–40 in the second and fourth games. Having started the year in retirement, King finished 1982 ranked 14 in the world.

In 1983, she reached the semi-finals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6–1, 6–1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger&#x27;s, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to sweat in this match.&quot;

King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. Her tally of 20 Wimbledon titles remained when partnered with Steve Denton and the no.1 seeds in the mixed doubles, they lost 6–7(5–7), 7–6(7–5), 7–5 to John Lloyd &amp; Wendy Turnbull in the final, King being the only player to drop her service in the final game. At her final appearance at the US Open later in 1983, King didn&#x27;t play singles, but partnered Sharon Walsh in the women&#x27;s doubles, reaching the semi-finals and Trey Waltke in the mixed doubles, losing in the second round. The final official singles match of King&#x27;s career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open.

====1984 to present====
King played doubles sporadically from 1984 through 1990. She and Vijay Amritraj were seeded sixth for the Wimbledon mixed doubles 1984, but they withdrew before the tournament began. She retired from competitive play in doubles in March 1990. In her last competitive doubles match, King and her partner, Jennifer Capriati, lost a second round match to Brenda Schultz-McCarthy and Andrea Temesvári 6–3, 6–2 at the Virginia Slims of Florida tournament.

King became the captain of the United States Fed Cup team and coach of its women&#x27;s Olympic tennis squad. She guided the U.S. to the Fed Cup championship in 1996 and helped Lindsay Davenport, Gigi Fernández, and Mary Joe Fernández capture Olympic gold medals.

In 2002, King dismissed Capriati from the Fed Cup team, saying Capriati had violated rules that forbade bringing along and practicing with personal coaches. Opinion was sharply divided, with many supporting King&#x27;s decision but many feeling the punishment was too harsh, especially in hindsight when Monica Seles and Lisa Raymond were defeated by lower-ranked Austrians Barbara Schett and Barbara Schwartz. The following year, Zina Garrison succeeded King as Fed Cup captain.

===Activism within the tennis profession===

==== Player compensation ====
Before the start of the open era in 1968, King earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at California State University, Los Angeles when not playing in major tennis tournaments.

In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the USLTA&#x27;s practice of &quot;shamateurism&quot;, where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism. King said this about the amateur game:

==== Push for female equality ====
When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s games. In 1971, her husband, Larry King created the idea to form a nine player women&#x27;s group with the financial backing of &quot;World Tennis&quot; magazine founder Gladys Heldman and the sponsorship of Virginia Slims chairman Joe Cullman. King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money; however, inequalities continued. King won the US Open in 1972 but received US$15,000 less than the men&#x27;s champion Ilie Năstase. She stated that she would not play the next year if the prize money was not equal. In 1973, the US Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.

King led player efforts to support the first professional women&#x27;s tennis tour in the 1970s called the Virginia Slims, founded by Gladys Heldman and funded by Joseph Cullman of Philip Morris. Once the tour took flight, King worked tirelessly to promote it even though many of the other top players were not supportive. &quot;For three years we had two tours and because of their governments [Martina] Navratilova and Olga Morozova had to play the other tour. Chris [Evert], Margaret [Court], Virginia [Wade], they let us do the pioneering work and they weren&#x27;t very nice to us. If you go back and look at the old quotes; they played for the love of the game, we played for the money. When we got backing and money, we were all playing together – I wonder why? I tried not to get upset with them. Forgiveness is important. Our job was to have one voice and win them over.&quot;

In 1973, King became the first president of the women&#x27;s players union – the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association. In 1974, she, with husband Larry King and Jim Jorgensen, founded &quot;womenSports&quot; magazine and started the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation. Also in 1974, World TeamTennis began, founded by Larry King, Dennis Murphy, Frank Barman and Jordan Kaiser. She became league commissioner in 1982 and major owner in 1984.

King is a member of the Board of Honorary Trustees for the Sports Museum of America, which opened in 2008. The museum is the home of the Billie Jean King International Women&#x27;s Sports Center, a comprehensive women&#x27;s sports hall of fame and exhibit.

Billie Jean King through her various efforts has been said to have started the second wave of feminism. Not just for women in sports, but for women everywhere, Kings triumphs have led to greater opportunities . For example, it is said that “In a single tennis match, Billie Jean King was able to do more for the cause of women than most feminists can achieve in a lifetime” (Paule-Koba). Kings win against Bobby Riggs, one of the greatest male tennis players of their time, was not just a win for herself, but a win for women everywhere. After Riggs sexist comments leading up to the match, King realized she had a lot more to win the match for then a trophy. “Billie Jean King was the rare athlete who brought together sport and feminism, and, in doing so, she put a human face on the ideals of liberal feminism” (Paule-Koba). Since her win against Riggs, King has started her own tour for women to create equal pay for them, influenced and aided the title IX legislation, and helped create the Women&#x27;s sports foundation known as womenSports and World Team Tennis.

=== Other activities ===
King&#x27;s husband Larry co-founded World Team Tennis in 1973 with Dennis Murphy, Jordan Kaiser, and Fred Barman and WTT began in 1974. The couple used their savings to put on a team tennis event at the Oakland Coliseum. King remained involved with World Team Tennis for decades, eventually sharing ownership with her ex-husband, her life partner Ilana Kloss and USTA. In 2017, King sold her majority ownership stake of the league to Mark Ein and Fred Luddy. WTT was based on her philosophy for gender equality and it had been running continuously for over 40 years.

In 1999, King was elected to serve on the board of directors of Philip Morris Incorporated, garnering some criticism from anti-tobacco groups. She no longer serves in that capacity.

 King was involved in the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She also served on the President&#x27;s Council for Fitness, Sports and Nutrition as a way to encourage young people to stay active.

In 2008, King published the book &quot;Pressure is a Privilege: Lessons I&#x27;ve Learned from Life and the Battle of the Sexes&quot;.

In December 2013, US President Barack Obama appointed King and openly gay ice hockey player Caitlin Cahow to represent the United States at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. This has been interpreted as a signal on gay rights, in the context of concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics regarding LGBT rights in Russia. King was forced to drop out of the delegation due to her mother&#x27;s ill health. Betty Moffitt, King&#x27;s mother, died on February 7, 2014, the day of the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.

Billie Jean was selected to deliver the Northwestern University commencement address on June 16, 2017, in Evanston, Illinois.

She attended the 75th Golden Globe Awards in 2018 as a guest of Emma Stone.

King and Kloss became minority owners of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in September 2018, and the WNBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Sparks basketball team. In October 2020, they became part of the ownership group of Angel City FC, a Los Angeles–based team set to start play in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League in 2022.

King is also an investor in Just Women&#x27;s Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women&#x27;s sports.

On June 29, 2023, the Mark Walter Group and BJK Enterprises purchased the intellectual property and other key elements of the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF), a professional women&#x27;s hockey league in the United States and Canada. Headed by Mark Walter and King, respectively, both businesses had entered a partnership with the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) in May 2022, with the intent to create a new professional women&#x27;s ice hockey league in North America. The buyout changed the landscape in North American women&#x27;s professional hockey, as it resulted in a single league with stakeholders from both the PHF and PWHPA. The new league began on January 1, 2024, with the first game played between New York and Toronto in Toronto.

Also in 2023, King competed in season ten of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Royal Hen&quot;. She was the first of Group B to be eliminated on &quot;A Celebration of Elton John&quot;.

Margaret Court, who won more Grand Slam titles than anyone, has said that King was &quot;the greatest competitor I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;.

Chris Evert, winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, has said, &quot;She&#x27;s the wisest human being that I&#x27;ve ever met and has vision people can only dream about. Billie Jean King is my mentor and has given me advice about my tennis and my boyfriends. On dealing with my parents and even how to raise children. And she doesn&#x27;t have any.&quot;

In 1979, several top players were asked who they would pick to help them recover from a hypothetical deficit of 1–5 (15–40) in the third set of a match on Wimbledon&#x27;s Centre Court. Martina Navratilova, Rosemary Casals, and Françoise Dürr all picked King. Navratilova said, &quot;I would have to pick Billie Jean at her best. Consistently, Chris [Evert] is hardest to beat but for one big occasion, one big match, one crucial point, yes, it would have to be Billie Jean.&quot; Casals said, &quot;No matter how far down you got her, you never could be sure of beating her.&quot;

==Personal life==
Billie Jean and Larry King were engaged in fall of 1964 and married in Long Beach, California, on September 17, 1965. Billie Jean credited Larry with introducing her to feminism and for pushing her to pursue tennis as a career. Billie Jean later said she &quot;was totally in love with Larry&quot; when they married.

By 1968, King realized that she was attracted to women. In 1971, she began an affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett (born Marilyn Kathryn McRae on January 28, 1948). Barnett had been living rent-free in the Kings&#x27; Malibu house. In 1979, the Kings asked Barnett to leave their house, but she did not want to. Refusing to leave the house, Barnett threatened to leak records and receipts that she had kept over the years. These receipts included letters from Billie Jean to Marilyn, credit card receipts, and paid bills. After a suicide attempt where she jumped off the balcony of the house leaving her a paraplegic, Barnett sued the Kings in a May 1981 palimony lawsuit for half their income and the Malibu house where she had been staying. Billie Jean acknowledged the relationship between her and Marilyn shortly afterward, making Billie Jean the first prominent female professional athlete to come out. Feeling she could not admit to the extent of the relationship, Billie Jean publicly called it a fling and a mistake. The lawsuit caused Billie Jean to lose an estimated $2 million in endorsements and forced her to prolong her tennis career to pay attorneys. In December 1981, a court order stipulated that Barnett leave the house and that her threats to publish private correspondence between her and King in exchange for money came close to extortion. Barnett&#x27;s palimony suit was thrown out of court in November 1982. But in a bizarre twist of fate, a few months later in March 1983, the house that had been contested was destroyed during a series of freak storms that lashed the southern California coastline.

Also in 1971, King had an abortion that was made public in a &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine article. Larry had revealed Billie Jean&#x27;s abortion without consulting her.

Concerning the personal cost of concealing her sexuality for so many years, Billie Jean said:

Billie Jean and Larry remained married through the palimony suit fallout. Their marriage ended in 1987 after Billie Jean fell in love with her doubles partner, Ilana Kloss. Billie Jean and Larry nevertheless remained close, and she is the godmother of Larry&#x27;s son from his subsequent marriage.

On October 18, 2018, King and Kloss were married by former New York City Mayor David Dinkins in a secret ceremony. King and her wife Kloss have residences in New York City and Chicago. King is a vegetarian.

It was announced in March 2021 that King would be an advisor to First Women&#x27;s Bank in Chicago.

<text>A mastaba ( , or ), also mastabah or mastabat) is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with inward sloping sides, constructed out of mudbricks or limestone. These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt&#x27;s Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. Non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years.

The word &quot;mastaba&quot; comes from the Arabic word (maṣṭaba) &quot;stone bench&quot;. The Ancient Egyptian name was [[Pr (hieroglyph)|pr]]-[[Djed|Djt]], meaning &quot;house of stability&quot;, &quot;house of eternity&quot;, or &quot;eternal house&quot;.

==History==
The afterlife was centralized in the religion of ancient Egyptians. Their architecture reflects this, most prominently by the enormous amounts of time and labor involved in building tombs. Ancient Egyptians believed that the needs from the world of the living would be continued in the afterlife; it was therefore necessary to build tombs that would fulfill them, and be sturdy enough to last for an eternity. These needs would also have to be attended to by the living.

Starting in the Predynastic era (before 3100 BCE) and continuing into later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. They first buried their dead in pit graves dug from the sand with the body placed on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure the Egyptians developed was the &quot;mastaba,&quot; composed of earthen bricks made from soil along the Nile. It provided better protection from scavenging animals and grave robbers. The origins of the mastaba can be seen in Tarkhan, where tombs would be split into two distinct portions. One side would contain a body, oriented in a north-south position, and the other would be open for the living to deliver offerings. As the remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, natural mummification could not take place; therefore the Egyptians devised a system of artificial mummification. Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty were buried in these mastabas.

==Structure==

The term &quot;mastaba&quot; comes from the Arabic word for &quot;a bench of mud&quot;. When seen from a distance, a flat-topped mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia, since at the time they were both building similar structures.

The above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of the sun-dried mud readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials such as stone came into use, the majority were built from mudbricks. Monumental mastabas, such as those at Saqqara, were often constructed out of limestone. Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least in height. They were oriented north–south, which the Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. The roofs of the mastabas were of slatted wood or slabs of limestone, with skylights illuminating the tomb. The above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or &quot;ba&quot;, of the deceased, which had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife. The construction of mastabas was standardized, with several treatments being common for masonry.

Mastabas were highly decorated, both with paintings on the walls and ceilings, and carvings of organic elements such as palm trees out of limestone. Due to the spiritual significance of the color, it was preferable to construct mastabas from white limestone. If this was not available, the yellow limestone or mudbrick of the tomb would be whitewashed and plastered. Mastabas for royalty were especially extravagant on the exterior, meant to resemble a palace.

== Interior ==
A mastaba was essentially meant to provide the &quot;ba&quot; with a house in the afterlife, and they were laid out accordingly. Some would be used to house families, rather than individuals, with several burial shafts acting as &quot;rooms&quot;. The burial chambers were cut deep, into the bedrock, and were lined with wood. A second hidden chamber called a &quot;serdab&quot; (سرداب), from the Persian word for &quot;cellar&quot;, was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, grain, clothes and precious items. The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the &quot;serdab&quot; were small openings that would allow the &quot;ba&quot; to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the &quot;ba&quot; had to return to its body or it would die. These openings &quot;were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue&quot;. The statues were nearly always oriented in one direction, facing the opening. The serdab could also feature inscriptions, such as the testament and mortuary cult of the owner. More elaborate mastabas would feature open courtyards, which would be used to house more statues and allow the dead to perform rites. Over time, the courtyards grew into magnificent columned halls, which served the same purposes. These halls would typically be the largest room in the mastaba, and they could be used for sacrifices of livestock. Larger mastabas also included a network of storerooms, which the presiding phyle would use to maintain the mortuary cult of the mastaba&#x27;s owner. Generally, there would be five of these storerooms, used by the living to store equipment needed for performing rites; unlike the serdab, they were not meant to be used by the deceased. These lacked any form of decoration, again distinguishing their function from that of the rest of the tomb. Due to the great expense of adding a complex of storerooms, these were only constructed in the largest of mastabas, for the royal family and viziers.

==Architectural evolution==

The mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the pharaoh and the social elite. The ancient city of Abydos was the location chosen for many of the cenotaphs. The royal cemetery was at Saqqara, overlooking the capital of early times, Memphis.

Mastabas evolved over the early dynastic period (c. 3100–2686 BCE). During the 1st Dynasty, a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical 2nd and 3rd Dynasty (c. 2686–2313) mastabas was the &#x27;stairway mastaba&#x27;, the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs. Many of the features of mastabas grew into those of the pyramids, indicating their importance as a transitory construction of tombs. This notably includes the exterior appearance of the tombs, as the sloped sides of the mastabas extended to form a pyramid. The first and most striking example of this was Djoser&#x27;s step pyramid, which combined many traditional features of mastabas with a more monumental stone construction.

Even after pyramids became more prevalent for pharaohs in the 3rd and 4th Dynasties, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the Giza Plateau, where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids.

In the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613 to 2494 BCE), rock-cut tombs began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in Upper Egypt in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers. Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. 5th Dynasty mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and &#x27;serdab&#x27;. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court.

Mastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom, where they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside.

By the time of the New Kingdom (which began with the 18th Dynasty around 1550 BC), &quot;the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same variables.
For example,
: formula_1
is a system of three equations in the three variables . A &quot;solution&quot; to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. In the example above, a solution is given by the ordered triple
formula_2
since it makes all three equations valid.

Linear systems are a fundamental part of linear algebra, a subject used in most modern mathematics. Computational algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model or computer simulation of a relatively complex system.

Very often, and in this article, the coefficients and solutions of the equations are constrained to be real or complex numbers, but the theory and algorithms apply to coefficients and solutions in any field. For other algebraic structures, other theories have been developed. For coefficients and solutions in an integral domain, such as the ring of integers, see Linear equation over a ring. For coefficients and solutions that are polynomials, see Gröbner basis. For finding the &quot;best&quot; integer solutions among many, see Integer linear programming. For an example of a more exotic structure to which linear algebra can be applied, see Tropical geometry.

==Elementary examples==

===Trivial example===
The system of one equation in one unknown
: formula_3
has the solution 
: formula_4

However, most interesting linear systems have at least two equations.

===Simple nontrivial example===
The simplest kind of nontrivial linear system involves two equations and two variables:

: formula_5

One method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for formula_6 in terms of formula_7:

: formula_8

Now substitute this expression for &quot;x&quot; into the bottom equation:

: formula_9

This results in a single equation involving only the variable formula_7. Solving gives formula_11, and substituting this back into the equation for formula_6 yields formula_13. This method generalizes to systems with additional variables (see &quot;elimination of variables&quot; below, or the article on elementary algebra.)

==General form==
A general system of &quot;m&quot; linear equations with &quot;n&quot; unknowns and coefficients can be written as
:formula_14
where formula_15 are the unknowns, formula_16 are the coefficients of the system, and formula_17 are the constant terms.

Often the coefficients and unknowns are real or complex numbers, but integers and rational numbers are also seen, as are polynomials and elements of an abstract algebraic structure.

===Vector equation===
One extremely helpful view is that each unknown is a weight for a column vector in a linear combination.
:formula_18
This allows all the language and theory of &quot;vector spaces&quot; (or more generally, &quot;modules&quot;) to be brought to bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side (LHS) is called their &quot;span&quot;, and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a &quot;basis&quot; of linearly independent vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its &quot;dimension&quot;) cannot be larger than &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;, but it can be smaller. This is important because if we have &quot;m&quot; independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side (RHS), and otherwise not guaranteed.

===Matrix equation===
The vector equation is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form
formula_19
where &quot;A&quot; is an &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix, x is a column vector with &quot;n&quot; entries, and b is a column vector with &quot;m&quot; entries.

formula_20
The number of vectors in a basis for the span is now expressed as the &quot;rank&quot; of the matrix.

==Solution set==
A &quot;solution&quot; of a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables 
formula_15 such that each of the equations is satisfied. The set of all possible solutions is called the &quot;solution set&quot;.

A linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:
# The system has &quot;infinitely many solutions&quot;.
# The system has a &quot;unique solution&quot;.
# The system has &quot;no solution&quot;.

===Geometric interpretation===
For a system involving two variables (&quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;), each linear equation determines a line on the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. Because a solution to a linear system must satisfy all of the equations, the solution set is the intersection of these lines, and is hence either a line, a single point, or the empty set.

For three variables, each linear equation determines a plane in three-dimensional space, and the solution set is the intersection of these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set. For example, as three parallel planes do not have a common point, the solution set of their equations is empty; the solution set of the equations of three planes intersecting at a point is single point; if three planes pass through two points, their equations have at least two common solutions; in fact the solution set is infinite and consists in all the line passing through these points.

For &quot;n&quot; variables, each linear equation determines a hyperplane in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. The solution set is the intersection of these hyperplanes, and is a flat, which may have any dimension lower than &quot;n&quot;.

===General behavior===
In general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns. Here, &quot;in general&quot; means that a different behavior may occur for specific values of the coefficients of the equations.
* In general, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such a system is known as an underdetermined system.
* In general, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.
* In general, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an overdetermined system.
In the first case, the dimension of the solution set is, in general, equal to , where &quot;n&quot; is the number of variables and &quot;m&quot; is the number of equations.

The following pictures illustrate this trichotomy in the case of two variables:
The first system has infinitely many solutions, namely all of the points on the blue line. The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines. The third system has no solutions, since the three lines share no common point.

It must be kept in mind that the pictures above show only the most common case (the general case). It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point).

A system of linear equations behave differently from the general case if the equations are &quot;linearly dependent&quot;, or if it is &quot;inconsistent&quot; and has no more equations than unknowns.

==Properties==

===Independence===
The equations of a linear system are independent if none of the equations can be derived algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases the size of the solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as linear independence.
For example, the equations
: formula_22
are not independent — they are the same equation when scaled by a factor of two, and they would produce identical graphs. This is an example of equivalence in a system of linear equations.

For a more complicated example, the equations
: formula_23
are not independent, because the third equation is the sum of the other two. Indeed, any one of these equations can be derived from the other two, and any one of the equations can be removed without affecting the solution set. The graphs of these equations are three lines that intersect at a single point.

===Consistency===

A linear system is inconsistent if it has no solution, and otherwise, it is said to be consistent. When the system is inconsistent, it is possible to derive a contradiction from the equations, that may always be rewritten as the statement .

For example, the equations
: formula_24
are inconsistent. In fact, by subtracting the first equation from the second one and multiplying both sides of the result by 1/6, we get . The graphs of these equations on the &quot;xy&quot;-plane are a pair of parallel lines.

It is possible for three linear equations to be inconsistent, even though any two of them are consistent together. For example, the equations
: formula_25
are inconsistent. Adding the first two equations together gives , which can be subtracted from the third equation to yield . Any two of these equations have a common solution. The same phenomenon can occur for any number of equations.

In general, inconsistencies occur if the left-hand sides of the equations in a system are linearly dependent, and the constant terms do not satisfy the dependence relation. A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.

Putting it another way, according to the Rouché–Capelli theorem, any system of equations (overdetermined or otherwise) is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If, on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has &quot;k&quot; free parameters where &quot;k&quot; is the difference between the number of variables and the rank; hence in such a case there is an infinitude of solutions. The rank of a system of equations (that is, the rank of the augmented matrix) can never be higher than [the number of variables] + 1, which means that a system with any number of equations can always be reduced to a system that has a number of independent equations that is at most equal to [the number of variables] + 1.

===Equivalence===
Two linear systems using the same set of variables are equivalent if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice versa. Two systems are equivalent if either both are inconsistent or each equation of each of them is a linear combination of the equations of the other one. It follows that two linear systems are equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set.

==Solving a linear system==
There are several algorithms for solving a system of linear equations.

===Describing the solution===
When the solution set is finite, it is reduced to a single element. In this case, the unique solution is described by a sequence of equations whose left-hand sides are the names of the unknowns and right-hand sides are the corresponding values, for example formula_26. When an order on the unknowns has been fixed, for example the alphabetical order the solution may be described as a vector of values, like formula_27 for the previous example.

To describe a set with an infinite number of solutions, typically some of the variables are designated as free (or independent, or as parameters), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining variables are dependent on the values of the free variables.

For example, consider the following system:
:formula_28
The solution set to this system can be described by the following equations:
:formula_29
Here &quot;z&quot; is the free variable, while &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are dependent on &quot;z&quot;. Any point in the solution set can be obtained by first choosing a value for &quot;z&quot;, and then computing the corresponding values for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

Each free variable gives the solution space one degree of freedom, the number of which is equal to the dimension of the solution set. For example, the solution set for the above equation is a line, since a point in the solution set can be chosen by specifying the value of the parameter &quot;z&quot;. An infinite solution of higher order may describe a plane, or higher-dimensional set.

Different choices for the free variables may lead to different descriptions of the same solution set. For example, the solution to the above equations can alternatively be described as follows:
:formula_30
Here &quot;x&quot; is the free variable, and &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are dependent.

===Elimination of variables===
The simplest method for solving a system of linear equations is to repeatedly eliminate variables. This method can be described as follows:
# In the first equation, solve for one of the variables in terms of the others.
# Substitute this expression into the remaining equations. This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and unknown.
# Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the system is reduced to a single linear equation.
# Solve this equation, and then back-substitute until the entire solution is found.

For example, consider the following system:
: formula_31
Solving the first equation for &quot;x&quot; gives formula_32, and plugging this into the second and third equation yields
: formula_33
Since the LHS of both of these equations equal &quot;y&quot;, equating the RHS of the equations. We now have: 
: formula_34
Substituting &quot;z&quot; = 2 into the second or third equation gives &quot;y&quot; = 8, and the values of &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; into the first equation yields &quot;x&quot; = −15. Therefore, the solution set is the ordered triple formula_35.

===Row reduction===
In row reduction (also known as Gaussian elimination), the linear system is represented as an augmented matrix

:formula_36
This matrix is then modified using elementary row operations until it reaches reduced row echelon form. There are three types of elementary row operations:
:Type 1: Swap the positions of two rows.
:Type 2: Multiply a row by a nonzero scalar.
:Type 3: Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.
Because these operations are reversible, the augmented matrix produced always represents a linear system that is equivalent to the original.

There are several specific algorithms to row-reduce an augmented matrix, the simplest of which are Gaussian elimination and Gauss–Jordan elimination. The following computation shows Gauss–Jordan elimination applied to the matrix above:
:formula_37
The last matrix is in reduced row echelon form, and represents the system , , . A comparison with the example in the previous section on the algebraic elimination of variables shows that these two methods are in fact the same; the difference lies in how the computations are written down.

===Cramer&#x27;s rule===
Cramer&#x27;s rule is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations, with each variable given by a quotient of two determinants. For example, the solution to the system
:formula_38
is given by
:formula_39
For each variable, the denominator is the determinant of the matrix of coefficients, while the numerator is the determinant of a matrix in which one column has been replaced by the vector of constant terms.

Though Cramer&#x27;s rule is important theoretically, it has little practical value for large matrices, since the computation of large determinants is somewhat cumbersome. (Indeed, large determinants are most easily computed using row reduction.)
Further, Cramer&#x27;s rule has very poor numerical properties, making it unsuitable for solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.

===Matrix solution===
If the equation system is expressed in the matrix form formula_40, the entire solution set can also be expressed in matrix form. If the matrix &quot;A&quot; is square (has &quot;m&quot; rows and &quot;n&quot;=&quot;m&quot; columns) and has full rank (all &quot;m&quot; rows are independent), then the system has a unique solution given by

: formula_41

where formula_42 is the inverse of &quot;A&quot;. More generally, regardless of whether &quot;m&quot;=&quot;n&quot; or not and regardless of the rank of &quot;A&quot;, all solutions (if any exist) are given using the Moore–Penrose inverse of &quot;A&quot;, denoted formula_43, as follows:

: formula_44

where formula_45 is a vector of free parameters that ranges over all possible &quot;n&quot;×1 vectors. A necessary and sufficient condition for any solution(s) to exist is that the potential solution obtained using formula_46 satisfy formula_40 — that is, that formula_48 If this condition does not hold, the equation system is inconsistent and has no solution. If the condition holds, the system is consistent and at least one solution exists. For example, in the above-mentioned case in which &quot;A&quot; is square and of full rank, formula_43 simply equals formula_42 and the general solution equation simplifies to
: formula_51
as previously stated, where formula_45 has completely dropped out of the solution, leaving only a single solution. In other cases, though, formula_45 remains and hence an infinitude of potential values of the free parameter vector formula_45 give an infinitude of solutions of the equation.

===Other methods===
While systems of three or four equations can be readily solved by hand (see Cracovian), computers are often used for larger systems. The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as &quot;pivoting&quot;. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the LU decomposition of the matrix &quot;A&quot;. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix &quot;A&quot; but different vectors b.

If the matrix &quot;A&quot; has some special structure, this can be exploited to obtain faster or more accurate algorithms. For instance, systems with a symmetric positive definite matrix can be solved twice as fast with the Cholesky decomposition. Levinson recursion is a fast method for Toeplitz matrices. Special methods exist also for matrices with many zero elements (so-called sparse matrices), which appear often in applications.

A completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have to be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of iterative methods. For some sparse matrices, the introduction of randomness improves the speed of the iterative methods. One example of an iterative method is the Jacobi method, where the matrix formula_55 is split into its diagonal component formula_56 and its non-diagonal component formula_57. An initial guess formula_58 is used at the start of the algorithm. Each subsequent guess is computed using the iterative equation:
: formula_59

When the difference between guesses formula_60 and formula_61 is sufficiently small, the algorithm is said to have &quot;converged&quot; on the solution.

There is also a quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations.

==Homogeneous systems==
A system of linear equations is homogeneous if all of the constant terms are zero:
: formula_62
A homogeneous system is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form
: formula_63
where &quot;A&quot; is an matrix, x is a column vector with &quot;n&quot; entries, and 0 is the zero vector with &quot;m&quot; entries.

===Homogeneous solution set===
Every homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the &quot;zero&quot; (or &quot;trivial&quot;) solution, which is obtained by assigning the value of zero to each of the variables. If the system has a non-singular matrix () then it is also the only solution. If the system has a singular matrix then there is a solution set with an infinite number of solutions. This solution set has the following additional properties:
# If u and v are two vectors representing solutions to a homogeneous system, then the vector sum is also a solution to the system.
# If u is a vector representing a solution to a homogeneous system, and &quot;r&quot; is any scalar, then &quot;r&quot;u is also a solution to the system.
These are exactly the properties required for the solution set to be a linear subspace of R&quot;n&quot;. In particular, the solution set to a homogeneous system is the same as the null space of the corresponding matrix &quot;A&quot;.

===Relation to nonhomogeneous systems===
There is a close relationship between the solutions to a linear system and the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous system:
: formula_64
Specifically, if p is any specific solution to the linear system , then the entire solution set can be described as
: formula_65
Geometrically, this says that the solution set for is a translation of the solution set for . Specifically, the flat for the first system can be obtained by translating the linear subspace for the homogeneous system by the vector p.

This reasoning only applies if the system has at least one solution. This occurs if and only if the vector b lies in the image of the linear transformation &quot;A&quot;.

<text>The pyramid of Djoser, sometimes called the Step Pyramid of Djoser or Zoser, Step Pyramid of Horus Neterikhet is an archaeological site in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the ruins of Memphis. It is the first Egyptian pyramid to be built. The 6-tier, 4-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.

The pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood tall, with a base of and was clad in polished white limestone. The step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man as of 1997, although the nearby enclosure wall &quot;Gisr el-Mudir&quot; is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.

In March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.

== Djoser ==
Djoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (–2650 BC) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (). He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years. He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.

Djoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors more than a thousand years later. Djoser&#x27;s step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.

The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering. The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the north, rather than at Abydos.

Although the plan of Djoser&#x27;s pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such, most Egyptologists credit Djoser&#x27;s vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex. This is based on the presence of his statue in the funerary complex of Djoser, his title of &quot;overseer of sculptors and painters&quot;, and a comment made by the 3rd century BC historian Manetho claiming Imhotep was the &quot;inventor of building in stone&quot;. Imhotep would later be deified and known as Asclepios by the Greeks for medicinal and stone masonry.

== Precedents ==
Djoser&#x27;s Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents. The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba 3038 ( 2900 BC). The substructure lay in a deep rectangular pit, and had mudbrick walls rising to . Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49°. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser&#x27;s complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected.

== Layout ==
Djoser&#x27;s mortuary complex comprises the great trench, enclosure wall, colonnaded entrance, &quot;T&quot; temple, &quot;Sed&quot; festival complex, north and south pavilions, south tomb and court, western mounds, mortuary temple, and the crowning feature of it all, the step pyramid with its substructure. The complex was a landmark achievement for Egyptian architecture. It was the advent of the pyramidal form of the royal tomb and the first instance of the mass use of limestone in construction, replacing mudbrick which had been the staple building material prior. This shift to limestone – a hard, dense material compared to mudbrick – presented novel challenges to the architects, though they kept to earlier tradition, copying architectonic elements and carving them into the stone. For example, the Egyptians hand-carved 1,680 -tall niches out of the limestone enclosure wall. In earlier projects, this element was built with wooden planks, ropes, and poles hung with reed mats. In a modern context, the same element would be built by laying out the blocks to form the recesses.

== Step pyramid ==

The crowning feature of the complex is the Step Pyramid which rises from the Saqqara plateau in six steps to a height between and . This element was revised repeatedly in construction, going through a series of developmental phases that culminated in its step pyramidal form. These phases are traditionally labelled, following Jean-Philippe Lauer&#x27;s excavations: M1, M2, M3, P1, P1&#x27;, and P2.

In the early stages (M1 to M3) the structure had the form of a mastaba before alterations (P1 to P2) were made to create its step pyramidal form. In the first stage (M1), the mastaba had a square plan in length that rose to a height of . This was built from a core of limestone blocks arranged in horizontal beds and bound with yellow or red clay. A thick casing of fine white Tura limestone was applied to the core arranged in the same horizontal manner. The outer blocks were inclined to ~82° and the top of the mastaba likely had a slightly convex shape. A second casing of fine white limestone was applied to this which increased the mastaba&#x27;s base length to square (M2). The casing was thick at the base and thick at the peak, which was lower than the initial mastaba height. The outer blocks of this second coat also had a steeper incline at ~76°. The mastaba was then extended east to cover a series of eleven shafts deep that ended in passages that led west to the burial chambers of members of Djoser&#x27;s family. This extension was built from locally sourced limestone rubble and cased by thick limestone coating that formed an extension of M2. The mastaba had a new, rectangular ground plan by . At this stage the mastaba still peaked at in height, too short to be seen from outside the high enclosure wall.

Egyptologists are split on the motivations behind the conception of the pyramidal form that the mastaba was converted into. Lauer believed that the alteration was made to have the tomb visible from Memphis. The fact of the mastaba&#x27;s square plan led Rainer Stadelmann, however, to suggest that it was never the intended final form and that it was planned to be a pyramid from the outset. The conversion (P1) encased the mastaba (M3) extending its length by on each axis giving it a base length of by . The alteration from mastaba to pyramid came with a shift in construction. The builders used larger and better quality, roughly dressed limestone blocks – but instead of horizontal beds, they built successive inclined accretion layers thick. These leaned on each other from opposite ends providing greater stability preventing a collapse. The whole was then cased in fine white limestone with a layer of packing in between. This phase of the pyramid had four steps that rose to a height of . The decision was then made to expand the pyramid north and west from four to six steps (P1&#x27;) which was then finished with a final layer of limestone casing (P2) that gave the pyramid its final form. On completion the step pyramid had a base length of by that rose to a height of and occupied a volume of .

Much of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench. It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid, and many plausible models have been suggested. For transport, apparatuses like rollers were used in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled.

== Pyramid substructure ==

Under the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6 km in length and connect to a central shaft 7 m square and 28 m deep. These spaces provide room for the king&#x27;s burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings. The entrance to the 28 m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. These &quot;palace façade&quot; walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb-sed. Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal &quot;ka&quot;.

On the east side of the pyramid, eleven shafts 32 m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for royal family members. These were incorporated into the pre-existing substructure as it expanded eastward. In the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found, many of which predate Djoser. These would have served Djoser&#x27;s visceral needs in the afterlife. An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these. Shafts I–V were used for the burials of royal family members; shafts VI–XI were used as symbolic tombs for the grave goods of royal ancestors from dynasties I–II. More than 40,000 vessels, bowls and vases made of various kinds of stone were found in these galleries. Royal names such as of kings Den, Semerkhet, Nynetjer and Sekhemib were incised on the pots. It is now thought that Djoser once restored the original tombs of the ancestors, and then sealed the grave goods in the galleries in an attempt to save them.

=== Burial chamber ===
The burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial. No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition. The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity.


== Pyramid complex ==

Djoser&#x27;s Step Pyramid complex included several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. A pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive beyond the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (that were not tombs) were built in the provinces. Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king&#x27;s ascension to join the eternal North Star.

The main modern excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean-Philippe Lauer, a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex. The complex covers and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis. Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north–south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east–west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.

=== Great trench ===
Before the enclosure wall, Djoser&#x27;s pyramid complex is surrounded by a trench dug into the underlying rock. At long and wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular in shape, oriented on the north–south axis. The trench resembles a 𓉔 (hieroglyph h) which represents the floorplan of a house. It is decorated with niches which are suggested by Nabil Swelim to have hosted the spirits of members of the king&#x27;s court, there to serve the king in his afterlife. In parts, the trench doubles into two with distinct entries. These make accessing the enclosure wall more difficult, indicating its function as a safe-guard. Miroslav Verner suspects that a single entrance was built at the south-east corner granting access to the area.

=== Enclosure wall ===
The complex is enclosed by a wall high that stretched for over . This wall was built from a thick core of masonry that was encased with Tura limestone, wholly on the outside but partially on the inside. The external façade of the wall had a bastion at a regular interval of adorned with 1,680 hand-carved niches tall. Fourteen of these bastions were larger than the rest. These hosted false double-doors, while a fifteenth situated in the south-east corner of the east façade held the real entrance. The entrance was flanked by two towers leading to a passage past which lay the colonnaded entrance.

The enclosure wall design recalls the appearance of First Dynasty tombs, such as those found directly north of the complex and at Abydos. Alan Spencer compares the design to the panelled construction of the palace façade, which imitates bound bundles of reeds. Jean-Philippe Lauer suggests that the wall was modelled after the &quot;White Walls&quot; of Memphis, though Verner notes that the presence of so many doors renders this unlikely. Hermann Kees thought the fifteen doors were related to the &quot;sed&quot; festival and indicated its duration as being half a lunar month. The remaining doors are known as false doors, and were meant for the king&#x27;s use in the afterlife. They functioned as portals through which the king&#x27;s &quot;ka&quot; could pass between life and the afterlife.

=== Entrance colonnade ===
The entrance colonnade led from the enclosure wall to the south court of the complex. It comprises two distinct passageways oriented approximately east–west. The first is a narrow wide by long corridor cut into the enclosure walls bastion. The ceiling blocks here were carved into the shape of tree trunks. This is followed by a wider corridor flanked by 40 limestone columns, arranged in pairs, that fronted projecting walls, which formed alcoves. The columns were each nearly tall and were fashioned to resemble bundled reeds that had between seventeen and nineteen ribs. They supported a limestone ceiling whose blocks carved again into the form of palm tree trunks. There are 24 alcoves which are suggested to have held statues of the king or perhaps, because of their number, a double statue of the king and a nome deity. Such statues are present in the monuments of the Fourth Dynasty, but no trace of them has been uncovered at Djoser&#x27;s complex. The end walls of the alcoves had slits cut into them near the ceiling thus allow light to filter in. Near the beginning of the colonnade, at its eastern end, is a corridor which leads to the &quot;heb-sed&quot; court. Between the twelfth and thirteenth alcove is a &quot;transverse vestibule&quot; with a passage flanked by eight tall columns and cross-walls leading to a sanctuary. Lauer believes this chamber contained a statue of Djoser on a pedestal that bore his name and Imhotep&#x27;s titles. The torso and base of this statue were found in the entrance colonnade. The west wall of the entrance colonnade has the form of an open door which leads into the south court.

=== South court ===
The south court is a large court between the south tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife. At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.

=== South tomb ===
The south tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king&#x27;s organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.

The substructure of the south tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30 m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues east and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid.

Current evidence suggests that the south tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king&#x27;s inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed. Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife.

=== North temple and serdab court ===
The northern (funerary/mortuary) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the &quot;ka&quot; statue. The king&#x27;s &quot;ka&quot; inhabited the &quot;ka&quot; statue, in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab. This temple appeared on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set. In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the pyramid, where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.

=== Heb-sed court ===
The Heb-sed court is rectangular and parallel to the South Courtyard. It was meant to provide a space in which the king could perform the Heb-sed ritual in the afterlife. Flanking the east and west sides of the court are the remains of two groups of chapels, many of which are dummy buildings, of three different architectural styles. At the north and south ends there are three chapels with flat roofs and no columns. The remaining chapels on the west side are decorated with fluted columns and capitals flanked by leaves. Each of the chapels has a sanctuary accessed by a roofless passage with walls that depict false doors and latches. Some of these buildings have niches for statues. Egyptologists believe that these buildings were related to the important double coronation of the king during the Heb-sed.

<text>The Twinkie is an American snack cake, described on its packaging as &quot;golden sponge cake with a creamy filling&quot;. It was formerly made and distributed by Hostess Brands. The brand is currently owned by Hostess Brands, Inc., itself currently owned by The J.M. Smucker Company and having been formerly owned by private equity firms Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company as the second incarnation of Hostess Brands. During bankruptcy proceedings, Twinkie production was suspended on November 15, 2012, and resumed after an absence of a few months from American store shelves, becoming available again nationwide on July 15, 2013.

Grupo Bimbo&#x27;s Vachon Inc., which owns the Canadian rights to the product and made them during their absence from the U.S. market, produces Twinkies in Canada at a bakery in Montreal. They are made in Emporia, Kansas, in the U.S. Twinkies are also available in Mexican stores as &quot;Submarinos&quot; made by Marinela, and as &quot;Tuinky&quot; made by Wonder; both Marinela and Wonder are also subsidiaries of Mexican bread company Grupo Bimbo. In Egypt, Twinkies are produced under the company Edita. Twinkies are also available in the United Kingdom and Ireland under the Hostess brand name where they are sold in Sainsburys, Tesco, ASDA, and B&amp;M stores. Twinkies are produced and distributed by multiple commercial bakeries in China, where Hostess does not own the brand.

==History==

Twinkies were invented on April 6, 1930, by Canadian-born baker James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Alexander Dewar for the Continental Baking Company in Schiller Park, Illinois. Realizing that several machines used for making cream-filled strawberry shortcakes sat idle when strawberries were out of season, Dewar conceived a snack cake filled with banana cream, which he dubbed the Twinkie. He said he came up with the name when he saw a billboard in St. Louis for &quot;Twinkle Toe Shoes&quot;.

During World War II, bananas were rationed, and the company was forced to switch to vanilla cream. This change proved popular, and banana-cream Twinkies were not widely re-introduced. The original flavor was occasionally found in limited time only promotions; the company used vanilla cream for most Twinkies. In 1988, Fruit and Cream Twinkies were introduced with a strawberry filling swirled into the cream. The product was soon dropped. Vanilla&#x27;s dominance over banana flavoring was challenged in 2005, following a month-long promotion of the movie &quot;King Kong&quot;. Hostess saw its Twinkie sales rise 20% during the promotion; in 2007, the company restored the banana-cream Twinkie to its snack lineup although they are now made with 2% banana purée.

In November 2012, as Hostess announced its plan to shut down its operations, &quot;Time&quot; ranked the Twinkie #1 in its list of 10 &quot;iconic&quot; junk foods, saying that &quot;they&#x27;ve been a staple in our popular culture and, above all, in our hearts. Often criticized for its lack of any nutritional value whatsoever, the Twinkie has managed to persevere as a cultural and gastronomical icon.&quot;

===Hostess bankruptcy===
On January 11, 2012, parent company Hostess filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Twinkie sales for the year, , were 36 million packages, down almost 20% from a year earlier. Hostess said customers had migrated to healthier foods. On November 16, 2012, Hostess officially announced that it &quot;will be winding down operations and has filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking permission to close its business and sell its assets, including its iconic brands and facilities.&quot; Bakery operations were suspended at all plants.
On November 19, 2012, Hostess and the Bakers Union agreed to mediation, delaying the shutdown for two days. On November 21, 2012, U.S. bankruptcy judge Robert Drain approved Hostess&#x27; request to shut down, ending Twinkie production in the United States.

===Return of Twinkies to U.S. market===

On March 18, 2013, it was reported that Twinkies would return to store shelves in May of that year. Twinkies, along with other Hostess Brands, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos &amp; Co for $410 million.
Twinkies returned to U.S. shelves on July 15, 2013. Apollo subsequently sold Hostess for $2.3 billion.

Before Hostess Brands filed for bankruptcy, Twinkies were reduced in size. They now contain and have a mass of 38.5 grams, while the original Twinkies contained and had a mass of 42.5 grams. The new Twinkies also have a longer shelf life of 45 days, which was also a change made before bankruptcy, compared to the 26 days of the original Twinkies.

Twinkies Cereal, made by Post, was introduced in December 2020.

In April 2017, Chocolate Cake Twinkies came on the market.

==Deep-fried Twinkie==

Deep frying a Twinkie involves freezing the cake, dipping it into batter, and deep-frying it. Melissa Clark &quot;(&quot;who interviewed one of the deep fried Twinkie&#x27;s claimed inventors — Christopher Sell, originally from Rugby, England)&quot;, writing in The New York Times,&quot; describes how &quot;Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil. The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies, impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor [...] The cake itself softens and warms, nearly melting, contrasting with the crisp, deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way. The &quot;&quot;, however, is a ruby-hued berry sauce, adding a tart sophistication to all that airy sugary goodness.&quot;

In 2002, Brooklyn restaurateur Clint Mullen introduced the fried Twinkie at several state and county fairs to great popular acclaim, and the notion spread to other establishments that specialize in fried foods. Fried Twinkies are sold throughout the U.S. in fairs as well as ball games, and in various restaurants. Starting in August 2016, Walmart began selling prepackaged, frozen versions of the deep-fried Twinkie at stores nationwide in the US.

==In popular culture==
===Television and film===
In 1984, the Twinkie became known worldwide in countries that did not sell the confection, due to a reference in the hit film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. In the film, the character Egon Spengler describes a speculated level of psychokinetic energy and uses a regular-sized Twinkie to represent the normal level of such energy in New York City. He then says that based on a recent sample, the Twinkie representing New York would be over long and weigh approximately , to which the character Winston Zeddemore replies, &quot;That&#x27;s a big Twinkie.&quot;

On Christmas Eve in 1988, Al Powell, one of the most iconic characters of the action film &quot;Die Hard&quot;, is introduced to the audience as a big Twinkie fan, in a scene where he is seen at a local 7-Eleven near the Nakatomi Plaza also known as the &quot;2121 Avenue of the Stars&quot; or formerly the Fox Plaza buying many Twinkies. When he proceeds to pay, Powell jokingly says to the store clerk &quot;they&#x27;re for my wife... she&#x27;s pregnant&quot; and the clerk sarcastically acknowledges and agrees.

The 1999 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Da Boom&quot; involves the Griffin family moving to Natick, Massachusetts, in search of a Twinkie factory following the Y2K apocalypse. The factory is shown to have survived completely intact, allowing the Griffins to use it as a food source and a means to rebuild society.

In the 2009 film &quot;Zombieland&quot;, Twinkies are the favorite snack of the character Tallahassee, who develops an obsession with finding one in the middle of a Zombie apocalypse.

During Hostess Brands&#x27; 2012 bankruptcy proceedings, television host Wendy Williams launched a &quot;Save the Twinkie&quot; campaign on her show to bring awareness to the financial problems of its parent company, and attempt to save the product from stopping production.

===Song lyrics===
&quot;Habits (Stay High)&quot;, a 2013 song by Swedish singer Tove Lo, mentions Twinkies in the line &quot;I get home, I got the munchies / Binge on all my Twinkies / Throw up in the tub / Then I go to sleep.&quot; In an interview, the singer confessed she had thought that &quot;twinkie&quot; was a synonym for &quot;cookie&quot; and that Hostess had sent her a sample of the product after the success of the song.

===Twinkie defense===
&quot;Twinkie defense&quot; is a derisive label for an improbable legal defense. It is not a recognized legal defense in jurisprudence, but a catch-all term coined by reporters during their coverage of the trial of defendant Dan White for the murders of San Francisco city Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. White&#x27;s defense was that he suffered diminished capacity as a result of his depression. His change in diet from healthful food to Twinkies and other sugary foods was said to be a symptom of depression. Contrary to common belief, White&#x27;s attorneys did not argue that the Twinkies were the cause of White&#x27;s actions, but that their consumption was symptomatic of his underlying depression.

===Shelf life===
A common urban legend claims that Twinkies have a theoretically infinite shelf life, and can last unspoiled for a relatively long time of ten, fifty, or one hundred years due to the chemicals used in their production.

According to a company executive, Twinkies are on the shelf for a short time; he told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2000 that the &quot;Twinkie is on the shelf no more than 7 to 10 days.&quot;
The maximum shelf life was reported to have been 26 days, until the addition of stronger preservatives made beginning in 2012 increased it to 45 days. A box of Twinkies from shortly before Hostess&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2012 was opened eight years later; one had completely molded over with cladosporium, another had a small amount of mold, and the creme filling in a third Twinkie had turned brown with the taste of &quot;old sock&quot;.

The TV show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; depicted this claim in its 5th-season episode &quot;Homer and Apu&quot;. A customer at the Kwik-E-Mart screws up a Twinkie and throws it on the floor in anger. Apu shouts after him, saying he cannot hurt a Twinkie. It then pops back into shape and Apu puts it back on the stand.

It has even been claimed that Twinkies could survive a nuclear war.

The 2012 Super Bowl Chevy Silverado Apocalypse commercial also gives a nod to the Twinkie&#x27;s reputed durability.

===Twinkie diet===
In 2010, Kansas State University professor Mark Haub went on a &quot;convenience store&quot; diet consisting mainly of a snack of Twinkies, Oreos, or Doritos every 3 hours in an attempt to demonstrate to his students &quot;...that in weight loss, pure calorie counting is what matters most, not the nutritional value of the food.&quot; He lost over a two-month period, returning his body mass index (BMI) to within normal range.

In addition to Twinkies, Haub ate Little Debbie snack cakes, cereals, cookies, brownies, Doritos, Oreos and other kinds of high calorie, low-nutrition foods that are usually found at convenience stores. However, despite calling it the &quot;Twinkie diet&quot;, Haub also consumed 1 protein shake per day and one serving of canned green beans or 4 celery stalks, along with the Twinkies, Oreos, and Doritos. Besides the protein shake and multivitamin, Haub also ate nutritionally dense whole milk, carrots, and vitamin fortified cereal. This contradicts representations by other media outlets stating that Haub &quot;only&quot; ate junk food. He ate the vegetables at the dinner table in order to set a good example for his children.

It is claimed legendary bodybuilder Sergio Oliva would sometimes indulge in eating a box of Twinkies (with a 2 liter bottle of Mountain Dew) after his notoriously strenuous workouts.

<text>Djoser (also read as Djeser and Zoser) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 3rd Dynasty during the Old Kingdom, and was the founder of that epoch. He is also known by his Hellenized names Tosorthros (from Manetho) and Sesorthos (from Eusebius). He was the son of King Khasekhemwy and Queen Nimaathap, but whether he was also the direct successor to their throne is unclear. Most Ramesside king lists identify a king named &quot;Nebka&quot; as preceding him, but there are difficulties in connecting that name with contemporary Horus names, so some Egyptologists question the received throne sequence. Djoser is known for his step pyramid, which is the earliest colossal stone building in ancient Egypt.

== Identity ==

The painted limestone statue of Djoser, now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, is the oldest known life-sized Egyptian statue. Today, at the site in Saqqara where it was found, a plaster copy of it stands in place of the original. The statue was discovered during the Antiquities Service Excavations of 1924–1925.

In contemporary inscriptions, he is called by his Horus name &quot;Netjerikhet&quot;, meaning &quot;divine of body&quot;. Later sources, which include a New Kingdom reference to his construction, help confirm that Netjerikhet and Djoser are the same person.

While Manetho names &quot;Necherophes&quot; and the Turin King List names Nebka as the first ruler of the Third Dynasty, many Egyptologists now believe Djoser was first king of this dynasty, pointing out that the order in which some predecessors of Khufu are mentioned in the Westcar Papyrus suggests Nebka should be placed between Djoser and Huni, not before Djoser. More significantly, the English Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson has demonstrated that burial seals found at the entrance to Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb in Abydos name only Djoser, rather than Nebka. This supports the view that it was Djoser who buried and, hence, directly succeeded Khasekhemwy, rather than Nebka.

==Family==

Djoser is linked to Khasekhemwy, the last king of the Second Dynasty of Egypt, through his wife Queen Nimaethap (Nimaat-hap) via seals found in Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb and at Beit Khallaf. The seal at Abydos names Nimaat-hap as the &quot;mother of the king&#x27;s children, Nimaat-hap&quot;. On mastaba K1 at Beit Khallaf, the same person is mentioned as the &quot;mother of the dual king&quot;. Dating of other seals at the Beit Khallaf site place them to the reign of Djoser. This evidence suggests that Khasekhemwy is either the direct father of Djoser or that Nimaat-hap had him through a previous husband. German Egyptologist Gunter Dreyer found Djoser&#x27;s sealings at Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb, further suggesting that Djoser was the direct successor of Khasekhemwy and that he finished the construction of the tomb.

Her cult seems to have still been active in the later reign of Sneferu.

Hetephernebti is identified as one of Djoser&#x27;s queens &quot;on a series of boundary stela from the Step Pyramid enclosure (now in various museums) and a fragment of relief from a building at Hermopolis&quot; currently in the Egyptian museum of Turin.

Inetkawes was their only daughter known by name. There was also a third royal female attested during Djoser&#x27;s reign, but her name is destroyed. The relationship between Djoser and his successor, Sekhemkhet, is not known, and the date of his death is uncertain.

==Reign==
=== Third Dynasty ===
The lands of Upper and Lower Egypt were united into a single kingdom sometime around 2686 BC. The period following the unification of the crowns was one of prosperity, marked by the start of the Third Dynasty and the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The exact identity of the founder of the dynasty is a matter of debate, due to the fragmentary nature of the records from the period. Djoser is one of the principal candidates for the founder of the Third Dynasty. Other candidates are Nebka and Sanakht. Complicating matters further is the possibility that Nebka and Sanakht are referring to the same person.

Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson believes that the weight of archeological evidence favours Djoser (Netjerikhet) as Khasekhemwy&#x27;s successor and therefore founder of the Third Dynasty. A seal from Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb at Abydos, in combination with a seal from mastaba K1 at Beit Khallaf dated to Djoser&#x27;s reign, links the two pharaohs together as father and son respectively. The seal at Abydos names a &#x27;Nimaat-hap&#x27; as the mother of Khasekhemwy&#x27;s children, while the other seal at Beit Khallaf names the same person as the &#x27;mother of the dual-king&#x27;. Further archaeological evidence linking the reigns of the two pharaohs together are found at Shunet et-Zebib, which suggest that Djoser oversaw the burial of his predecessor. Ritual stone vessels found at the sites of the tombs – Khasekhemwy&#x27;s tomb at Abydos and Djoser&#x27;s tomb at Saqqara – of the two pharaohs also appear to have come from the same collection, as samples from both sites contain identical imagery of the god Min. This archeological evidence is supplemented by at least one historical source, the Saqqara king list, which names Djoser as the immediate successor of Beby – a misreading of Khasekhemwy.

=== Length of reign ===

Manetho states Djoser ruled Egypt for twenty-nine years, while the Turin King List states it was only nineteen years. Because of his many substantial building projects, particularly at Saqqara, some scholars argue Djoser must have enjoyed a reign of nearly three decades. Manetho&#x27;s figure appears to be more accurate, according to Wilkinson&#x27;s analysis and reconstruction of the Royal Annals. Wilkinson reconstructs the Annals as giving Djoser &quot;28 complete or partial years&quot;, noting that the cattle counts recorded on Palermo stone register V, and &quot;Cairo Fragment 1&quot;, register V, for the beginning and ending of Djoser&#x27;s reign, would most likely indicate his regnal years 1–5 and 19–28. Unfortunately, next to all entries are illegible today. The Year of coronation is preserved, followed by the year events &quot;receiving the twin-pillars&quot; and &quot;stretching the cords for the fortress Qau-Netjerw (&quot;hills of the gods&quot;)&quot;.

=== Period of reign ===
Various sources provide various dates for Djoser&#x27;s reign. Professor of Ancient Near East history Marc van de Mieroop dates Djoser&#x27;s reign to somewhere between 2686 BC to 2648 BC. Authors Joann Fletcher and Michael Rice date his reign from 2667 BC to 2648 BC giving a regnal period of 18 partial or complete years. Rice further states that Nebkha was Djoser&#x27;s brother and predecessor. Writer Farid Atiya provides a similar regnal period to Fletcher and Rice, offset by a single year – 2668 BC to 2649 BC. This dating is supported by authors Rosalie and Charles Baker in &quot;Ancient Egypt: People of the Pyramids&quot;. Egyptologist Abeer el-Shahawy in association with the Egyptian Museum in Cairo places Djoser&#x27;s reign to the period of 2687 BC to 2668 BC for a similar 18 partial or complete years. Author Margaret Bunson places Djoser as the second ruler of the Third Dynasty, and places his reign to the period of 2630 BC to 2611 BC for 19 partial or complete year reign. In her chronology, Djoser is preceded by Nebka as the &quot;Founder of the Third Dynasty&quot;, reigning for the period 2649 BC to 2630 BC. She, like Rice, makes Nebka a brother of Djoser.

=== Military expeditions ===

Djoser dispatched several military expeditions to the Sinai Peninsula, during which the local inhabitants were subdued. He also sent expeditions there to mine for valuable minerals such as turquoise and copper. This is known from inscriptions found in the desert there, sometimes displaying the banner of Set alongside the symbols of Horus, as had been more common under Khasekhemwy. The Sinai was also strategically important as a buffer between the Nile valley and Asia.

===Construction projects===
His most famous monument was his step pyramid, which entailed the construction of several mastaba tombs one over another. These forms would eventually lead to the standard pyramid tomb in the later Old Kingdom. Manetho, many centuries later, alludes to architectural advances of this reign, mentioning that &quot;Tosorthros&quot; discovered how to build with hewn stone, in addition to being remembered as the physician Aesculapius, and for introducing some reforms in the writing system. Modern scholars think that Manetho originally ascribed (or meant to ascribe) these feats to &quot;Imuthes&quot;, who was later deified as &quot;Aesculapius&quot; by the Greeks and Romans, and who corresponds to Imhotep, the famous minister of Djoser who engineered the Step Pyramid&#x27;s construction.

Some fragmentary reliefs found at Heliopolis and Gebelein mention Djoser&#x27;s name, and suggest he commissioned construction projects in those cities. Also, he may have fixed the southern boundary of his kingdom at the First Cataract. An inscription known as the Famine Stela and claiming to date to the reign of Djoser, but probably created during the Ptolemaic Dynasty, relates how Djoser rebuilt the temple of Khnum on the island of Elephantine at the First Cataract, thus ending a seven-year famine in Egypt. Some consider this ancient inscription as a legend at the time it was inscribed. Nonetheless, it does show that more than two millennia after his reign, Egyptians still remembered Djoser.

Although he seems to have started an unfinished tomb at Abydos (Upper Egypt), Djoser was eventually buried in his famous pyramid at Saqqara in Lower Egypt. Since Khasekhemwy, a pharaoh from the 2nd dynasty, was the last pharaoh to be buried at Abydos, some Egyptologists infer that the shift to a more northerly capital was completed during Djoser&#x27;s time.

== Djoser and Imhotep ==
One of the most famous contemporaries of king Djoser was his vizier (&quot;tjaty&quot;), &quot;head of the royal shipyard&quot; and &quot;overseer of all stone works&quot;, Imhotep. Imhotep oversaw stone building projects such as the tombs of King Djoser and King Sekhemkhet. It is possible that Imhotep was mentioned in the also famous Westcar Papyrus, in a story called &quot;Khufu and the magicians&quot;. But because the papyrus is badly damaged at the beginning, Imhotep&#x27;s name is lost today. A papyrus from the ancient Egyptian temple of Tebtunis, dating to the 2nd century AD, preserves a long story in the demotic script about Djoser and Imhotep. In Djoser&#x27;s time, Imhotep was of such importance and fame that he was honoured by being mentioned on statues of King Djoser in his necropolis at Saqqara.

== Medieval arab tradition ==
Egyptian historian Al-Nuwayri (1279–1333) described Djoser as &quot;a king who was a wise ruler of Egypt&quot; and claimed that the Copts had a feast in honour of him called the &quot;vine festival&quot;. Al-Nuwayri also visited the South tomb of the pyramid complex of Djoser in Saqqara, identifying it as the tomb of &quot;Zosara&quot; and describing a vault decorated with lapis lazuli, as well as a large court with a large granite door inscribed with 30 lines of hieroglyphs.

Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly noted that &quot;Demotic romances of ancient Egyptian rulers such as Zoser, Inaros and Nectanebo also became popular in the medieval Arabic sources, which show them as heroes, with their names and deeds well recognised by the writers&quot;.

== Tomb ==
Djoser was buried in his famous step pyramid at Saqqara. This pyramid was originally built as a nearly square mastaba, but then five further mastabas were literally piled one upon another, each smaller than the previous one, until the monument became Egypt&#x27;s first step pyramid. Supervisor of the building constructions was the high lector priest Imhotep.

=== The pyramid ===
The step pyramid is made of limestone. It is massive and contains only one tight corridor leading to the close midst of the monument, ending in a rough chamber where the entrance to the tomb shaft was hidden. This inner construction was later filled with rubble, for it was of no use anymore. The pyramid was once 62 metres high and had a base measurement of c. 125 × 109 metres. It was tightly covered in finely polished, white limestone.

=== Subterranean structure ===

Under the step pyramid, a large maze of long corridors and chambers was dug. The burial chamber lies in the midst of the subterranean complex; a 28 meter deep shaft that leads directly from the surface down to the burial chamber. The shaft entrance was sealed by a plug stone with a weight of 3.5 tons. The subterranean burial maze contains four magazine galleries, each pointing straight to one cardinal direction. The eastern gallery contained three limestone reliefs depicting king Djoser during the celebration of the Heb-Sed (rejuvenation feast). The walls around and between these reliefs were decorated with bluish faience tiles. They were thought to imitate reed mats, as an allusion to the mythological underworld waters. The other galleries remained unfinished.

At the eastern side of the pyramid, very close to the blue chambers, eleven tomb shafts lead straight down for 30–32 metres, and then deviate in a right angle to the west. Shafts I–V were used for the burials of royal family members; shafts VI–XI were used as symbolic tombs for the grave goods of royal ancestors from dynasties I–II. More than 40,000 vessels, bowls and vases made of various kinds of stone were found in these galleries. Royal names such as of kings Den, Semerkhet, Nynetjer and Sekhemib were incised on the pots. It is now thought that Djoser once restored the original tombs of the ancestors, and then sealed the grave goods in the galleries in an attempt to save them.

=== Serdab statue of Djoser ===

The statue of Djoser is walled into the serdab. The main purpose of the statue was to allow the king to manifest himself and be able to see the rituals performed in and out the serdab. This painted statue is plastered and made out of limestone. Each characteristic of the statue represents something, the striated tripartite wig he is wearing assimilates him to the living world as a dead king. The striped head cloth that covers the wig was used to cover all of his hair. This was a ritual that began to be used by kings in the fourth dynasty. The body is wrapped under a long robe, his hands are placed in a specific way. His right arm is horizontally displayed on his chest while his left arm is resting on his thigh. The placement of his arms are a resemblance to Khasekhem seat. One of the oldest representations of the Nine bows, and the first representation of the nine bows fully developed, is on the seated statue of Pharaoh Djoser. His feet rest upon part of the nine bows, which may have referred to Nubians during his reign because of their use of bows and arrows.

=== Funerary complex ===

The funerary complex is the first architectural project to be built entirely out of stone. This complex had fourteen entrances but only one was functional. It is made up of the Great South Court, and the Heb-sed north court with Djoser&#x27;s step pyramid in the center. The complex is enclosed by a 10.5 meters high stone wall, referred to as the enclosure wall. Along with the main courts there is a Roofed Colonnade Entrance located within the south court and a Serdab chamber that holds the seated statue of the king Djoser.

<doc id="113094" wikidata="Q1923028" url="?curid=113094" title="Gerund">
<text>In linguistics, a gerund ( abbreviated ger) is any of various nonfinite verb forms in various languages; most often, but not exclusively, it is one that functions as a noun. The name is derived from Late Latin &quot;gerundium,&quot; meaning &quot;which is to be carried out&quot;. In English, the gerund has the properties of both verb and noun, such as being modifiable by an adverb and being able to take a direct object. The term &quot;&quot;-ing&quot; form&quot; is often used in English to refer to the gerund specifically. Traditional grammar makes a distinction within &quot;-ing&quot; forms between present participles and gerunds, a distinction that is not observed in such modern grammars as &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; and &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;.

==Traditional use==
The Latin gerund, in a restricted set of syntactic contexts, denotes the sense of the verb in isolation after certain prepositions, and in certain uses of the genitive, dative, and ablative cases. It is very rarely combined with a dependent sentence element such as an object. To express such concepts, the construction with the adjectival gerundive is preferred. By contrast, the term gerund has been used in the grammatical description of other languages to label verbal nouns used in a wide range of syntactic contexts and with a full range of clause elements.

Thus, English grammar uses &quot;gerund&quot; to mean an &quot;-ing&quot; form used in non-finite clauses such as &quot;playing on computers&quot;. This is not a normal use for a Latin gerund. Moreover, the clause may function within a sentence as subject or object, which is impossible for a Latin gerund.
*&quot;Playing on computers&quot; is fun. (&quot;-ing&quot; clause as subject)
*I like &quot;playing on computers&quot; (&quot;-ing&quot; clause as object)
The contrast with the Latin gerund is also clear when the clause consists of a single word.
*&quot;Computing&quot; is fun. (&quot;gerund&quot; as subject)
*I like &quot;computing&quot; (&quot;gerund&quot; as object)
Latin never uses the gerund in this way, since the infinitive is available.

Traditional English grammar distinguishes non-finite clauses used as above from adverbial use, adjective-like modification of nouns, and use in finite progressive (continuous) forms
*&quot;Playing on computers&quot;, they whiled the day away.
* The boys &quot;playing on computers&quot; are my nephews.
*They are always &quot;playing on computers&quot;.
In these uses &quot;playing&quot; is traditionally labelled a participle.

Traditional grammar also distinguishes &quot;-ing&quot; forms with exclusively noun properties as in 

The objection to the term &quot;gerund&quot; in English grammar is that &quot;-ing&quot; forms are frequently used in ways that do not conform to the clear-cut three-way distinction made by traditional grammar into &quot;gerunds&quot;, &quot;participles&quot; and &quot;nouns&quot;.

==Latin gerund==
===Form===
The Latin gerund is a form of the verb. It is composed of:
* the &quot;infectum&quot; stem (the stem used to form present and imperfect tense forms)
* a vowel appropriate to the verb class or conjugation of the verb
* the suffix &quot;-nd-&quot; 
* a nominal inflectional ending
For example,

Related gerundive forms are composed in a similar way with adjectival inflexional endings.

===Function===
The four inflections are used for a limited range of grammatical functions

These functions could be fulfilled by other abstract nouns derived from verbs such as &quot;vēnātiō&quot; &#x27;hunting&#x27;. Gerunds are distinct in two ways.
* Every Latin verb can regularly form a gerund
* A gerund may function syntactically as the head of a verb phrase: for instance, the gerund of a transitive verb may take a direct object in the accusative case, e.g., &quot;ad discernendum vocis verbi figuras&quot; &#x27;for discerning figures of speech&#x27;, &quot;hominem investigando opera dabo&quot; &#x27;I will devote effort to investigating the man&#x27;.
:: However, this was a rare construction. Writers generally preferred the &quot;gerundive&quot; construction, in which the gerundive adjective was inflected to agree with the noun acting as its object: e.g., &quot;res evertendae reipublicae&quot; &#x27;matters concerning the overthrow of the state&#x27; (literally &#x27;of the state being overthrown&#x27;).

When people first wrote grammars of languages such as English, and based them on works of Latin grammar, they adopted the term &quot;gerund&quot; to label non-finite verb forms with these two properties.

==Gerunds in various languages==
Meanings of the term &quot;gerund&quot; as used in relation to various languages are listed below.

===Latin and Romance===
Latin has the non-finite &quot;gerundium&quot;, formed with &quot;-andum&quot;, &quot;-endum&quot; and noun inflexions. It is syntactically equivalent to a noun, except in the nominative and accusative cases, which use the infinitive. In particular the ablative case forms (&quot;-ando&quot;, &quot;-endo&quot;) were used adverbially. Latin grammars written in English use the form &quot;gerund&quot;. See the section above for further detail.

Several Romance languages have inherited the form, but without case inflections. They use it primarily in an adverbial function, comparably to the Latin ablative use. The same form may be used in an adjectival function and to express progressive aspect meaning. These languages do not use the term &quot;present participle&quot;. Grammars of these languages written in English may use the form &quot;gerund&quot;.
:* Italian &quot;gerundio&quot;: stem form + &quot;-ando&quot; or &quot;-endo&quot;
:*Spanish &quot;gerundio&quot;: stem form + &quot;-ando&quot; or &quot;-iendo&quot;
:*Portuguese &quot;gerúndio&quot;: stem form + &quot;-ando&quot;, &quot;-endo&quot; or &quot;-indo&quot;
:* Romanian &quot;gerunziu&quot;: stem form + &quot;-ând(u)&quot; or &quot;-ind(u)&quot;
:* Catalan and French have inherited not the gerund form but the Latin present participle form in -nt. 
::* Catalan &quot;gerundi&quot;: stem form + &quot;-ant&quot; or &quot;-ent&quot;
::* French stem form + &quot;-ant&quot;. French grammar maintains a distinction between:
:::*&quot;participe présent&quot; when the form is used adjectivally, and may be inflected for gender and number.
:::*&quot;gérondif&quot; when the form is used adverbially, without inflection, generally after the preposition &quot;en&quot;. In Modern French, the &quot;gérondif&quot; cannot be used to express progressive meaning.
:::Grammars of French written in English may use the forms &quot;gerundive&quot; and &quot;present participle&quot;.

===Germanic===
In the earliest stages of the West Germanic languages, the infinitive was inflected after a preposition. These dative and, more rarely, genitive case forms are sometimes called &quot;gerundium&quot; or &quot;gerund&quot; or &quot;West Germanic gerund&quot;.
:*Old English &quot;to berenne&quot; (to bear) dative of &quot;beran&quot;
:*Old High German &quot;zi beranne&quot; dative of &quot;beran&quot;
:*Old Saxon &quot;berannia&quot; dative of &quot;beran&quot;
:*Old Frisian &quot;beranne&quot;
::* The modern continental successor languages German and Dutch have preserved a few vestiges of these forms, which are sometimes termed &quot;gerundium&quot;.
::* Frisian preserves the original distinction, e.g., West Frisian &quot;freegje&quot; (&quot;ask&quot;) – &quot;te freegjen&quot;
::* English has no vestige of the&quot; West Germanic gerund&quot;. Traditional grammar uses the term &quot;gerund&quot; for the &quot;-ing&quot; form of a verb when it is used as a noun (for example, the verb &quot;reading&quot; in the sentence &quot;I enjoy reading.&quot;). See the sections below for further detail.
:* In Dutch, it translates either the term &quot;gerundium&quot; or the description &quot;zelfstandig gebruikte, verbogen onbepaalde wijs van het werkwoord&quot;. The infinitive form of the verb is used as gerund, e.g., &quot;Zwemmen is gezond&quot;.
:* Since Afrikaans has by and large lost explicit morphological marking of the infinitive form of the verb, verb stems are used as gerunds, e.g., &quot;Swem is gesond&quot;.

===Slavic===
In descriptions of Slavic languages, the term &quot;gerund&quot; refers to verbal forms that are also frequently referred to as &quot;verbal adverb&quot;, &quot;adverbial participle&quot;, or (in some Slavic languages) &quot;deepričastie&quot;. These forms describe circumstances, actions concurrent (&quot;present gerund&quot;) or immediately preceding (&quot;past gerund&quot;) those in the predicate. Morphologically they are uninflected (except in Czech), and syntactically they have an adverbial function, and thus generally bear resemblance to Romance gerunds such as those found in Italian, rather than to noun-like gerunds in English or Latin.
* In Bulgarian, it translates the term (deepriʧastije). It refers to the verb noun formed by adding the suffix - (&quot;-jki&quot;) to the verb form, like (&quot;hodi, he/she/it walks&quot;) – (&quot;hodejki, while walking&quot;)
* In Macedonian, it refers to the verb noun formed by adding the suffix - (&quot;-jḱi&quot;) to the verb form, like in јаде (&quot;jade, he eats&quot;) — (&quot;jadejḱi, while eating&quot;).
* In Russian, it translates the term (&quot;dejepričastije&quot;) an adverbial participle formed with the suffixes - (&quot;-ja)&quot; Present; - (&quot;-v&quot;) or - (&quot;-vši&quot;) Past.
* In Serbo-Croatian, it was used to refer to what are now classified as participles / verbal adverbs: present (&quot;-ći&quot;) and past (&quot;-vši&quot;, sometimes &quot;-v&quot;). Modern grammars rarely use the term.
Additionally, some linguists use the term to refer to verbal nouns, historically formed with the *-ьje suffix, such as Serbo-Croatian (from ) or Polish (from ).

===Other===
* In Arabic, it refers to the verb&#x27;s action noun, known as the masdar form (Arabic: ). This form ends in a tanwin and is generally the equivalent of the &quot;-ing&quot; ending in English.
* In Hebrew, it refers either to the verb&#x27;s action noun, or to the part of the infinitive following the infinitival prefix (also called the &quot;infinitival construct&quot;).
* In Hungarian, it practically refers to the verbal noun, formed by appending a suffix. Common suffixes are &quot;-ás&quot; (adás, giving), &quot;-és&quot; (kérés, asking). 
* In Japanese, there are three main grammatical structures with gerund-like functions: first, turning verbs into nouns is achieved, depending on the type of verb and other factors, by using either the conjunctive form (&quot;-masu&quot; form) or the nominalization particles &quot;no&quot; and &quot;koto&quot;. Lastly, the continuous and progressive aspect of a verb can be realized by employing the perfective form &quot;(-te&quot; form) plus the auxiliary verb &quot;iru&quot;.
* In Korean, it refers to the word &#x27;것&#x27; (&#x27;thing&#x27;) modified by the adjective form of the verb.
* In Maldivian (Dhivehi), the gerund is the root form of the verb, for example, , meaning &quot;dancing&quot;.
* In Persian, it refers to the verb&#x27;s action noun, known as the ism-masdar form (Persian: ).
* In Turkish, it refers to a large number of verb endings subject to vowel harmony and sometimes used in conjunction with postpositions. Called &quot;zarf-fiil&quot;, &quot;bağ-fiil&quot;, &quot;ulaç&quot; or &quot;gerundium&quot; and defined as &quot;a verb used as an adverb in a sentence&quot;, the Turkish gerund may also constitute part of an (adverbial) clause.

In other languages, it may refer to almost any non-finite verb form; however, it most often refers to an action noun, by analogy with its use as applied to Latin.

==Gerunds in English==
In traditional grammars of English, the term gerund labels an important use of the form of the verb ending in &quot;-ing&quot; (for details of its formation and spelling, see English verbs). Other important uses are termed 
participle (used adjectivally or adverbially), and as a pure verbal noun.

An &quot;-ing&quot; form is termed gerund when it behaves as a verb within a clause (so that it may be modified by an adverb or have an object); but the resulting clause as a whole (sometimes consisting of only one word, the gerund itself) functions as a noun within the larger sentence.

For example, consider the sentence &quot;Eating this cake is easy.&quot; Here, the gerund is the verb &quot;eating&quot;, which takes an object &quot;this cake&quot;. The entire clause &quot;eating this cake&quot; is then used as a noun, which in this case serves as the subject of the larger sentence.

An item such as &quot;eating this cake&quot; in the foregoing example is an example of a non-finite verb phrase; however, because phrases of this type do not require a subject, it is also a complete clause. (Traditionally, such an item would be referred to as a phrase, but in modern linguistics it has become common to call it a clause.) A gerund clause such as this is one of the types of non-finite clause. The structure may be represented as follows:
===Formation===
Non-finite verb forms ending in &quot;-in&quot;g, whether termed gerund or participle may be marked like finite forms as Continuous or Non-continuous, Perfect or Non-perfect, Active or Passive. Thus, traditional grammars have represented the gerund as having 
four forms two for the active voice and two for the passive:

The same forms are available when the term participle is used.

===Examples of use ===
The following sentences illustrate some uses of gerund clauses, showing how such a clause serves as a noun within the larger sentence. In some cases, the clause consists of just the gerund (although in many such cases the word could equally be analyzed as a pure verbal noun).
* Swimming is fun. (gerund as subject of the sentence)
* I like swimming. (gerund as direct object)
* I never gave swimming all that much effort. (gerund as indirect object)
* Swimming in the pool is one way to relax. (gerund phrase as subject)
* Do you fancy swimming in the pool? (gerund phrase as direct object)
* After swimming in the pool, he ate his lunch. (gerund phrase as the complement of a preposition)

Using gerunds of the appropriate auxiliary verbs, one can form gerund clauses that express perfect aspect and passive voice:
* Being deceived can make someone feel angry. (passive)
* Having read the book once before makes me more prepared. (perfect)
* He is ashamed of having been gambling all night. (perfect progressive aspect)

For more detail on when it is appropriate to use a gerund, see Verb patterns classified as gerund use below, and also .

===Distinction from other uses of the &quot;-ing&quot; form===
In traditional grammars, gerunds are distinguished from other uses of a verb&#x27;s &quot;-ing&quot; form: the present participle (which is a non-finite verb form like the gerund, but is adjectival or adverbial in function), and the pure verbal noun or deverbal noun.

The distinction between gerund and present participles is not recognised in modern reference grammars, since many uses are ambiguous.

===Roles of &quot;gerund&quot; clauses in a sentence===

Non finite &quot;-ing&quot; clauses may have the following roles in a sentence:
In traditional grammars, the term &quot;gerund&quot; is not used for roles F, G, and H.

Thus
For more details and examples, see &quot;-ing&quot;: uses.

===&quot;Gerund&quot; clauses with a specified subject ===
In traditional grammars, a grammatical subject has been defined in such a way that it occurs only in finite clauses, where it is liable to &quot;agree&quot; with the &quot;number&quot; of the finite verb form. Nevertheless, non-finite clauses imply a &quot;doer&quot; of the verb, even if that doer is indefinite &quot;someone or something&quot;. For example,
* &quot;We enjoy singing&quot;. (ambiguous: somebody sings, possibly ourselves)
* &quot;Licking the cream&quot; was a special treat (somebody licked the cream)
* &quot;Being awarded the prize is a great honour&quot; (someone is or may be awarded the prize)

Often the &quot;doer&quot; is clearly signalled
* &quot;We enjoyed singing yesterday&quot; (we ourselves sang)
* &quot;The cat responded by licking the cream&quot; (the cat licked the cream)
* &quot;His heart is set on being awarded the prize&quot; (he hopes he himself will be awarded the prize)
* &quot;Meg likes eating apricots&quot; (Meg herself eats apricots)

However, the &quot;doer&quot; may not be indefinite or already expressed in the sentence. Rather it must be overtly specified, typically in a position immediately before the non-finite verb
* &quot;We enjoyed them singing&quot;.
* &quot;The cat licking the cream was not generally appreciated&quot;.
* &quot;We were delighted at Paul being awarded the prize.&quot;
The &quot;doer&quot; expression is not the grammatical subject of a finite clause, so objective them is used rather than subjective they.

Traditional grammarians may object to the term subject for these &quot;doers&quot;. And prescriptive grammarians go further, objecting to the use of forms more appropriate to the subjects (or objects) of finite clauses. The argument is that this results in two noun expressions with no grammatical connection. They prefer to express the &quot;doer&quot; by a possessive form, such as used with ordinary nouns:
* &quot;We enjoyed their singing&quot;. (cf. their voices&quot;, their attempt to sing&quot;)
* The cat&#x27;s licking the cream was not generally appreciated&quot;. (cf. the cat&#x27;s purr&quot;, &quot;the cat&#x27;s escape&quot;)
* &quot;We were delighted at Paul&#x27;s being awarded the prize&quot;. (cf. &quot;Paul&#x27;s nomination, Paul&#x27;s acceptance&quot;)
Nonetheless, the possessive construction with &quot;-ing&quot; clauses is very rare in present-day English. Works of fiction show a moderate frequency, but the construction is highly infrequent in other types of text.

Prescriptivists do not object when the non-finite clause modifies a noun phrase
* &quot;I saw the cat licking the cream.&quot;
The sense of &quot;the cat&quot; as notional subject of &quot;licking&quot; is disregarded. Rather they see &quot;the cat&quot; as exclusively the object of &quot;I saw&quot; The modifying phrase &quot;licking the cream&quot; is therefore described as a participle use.

Henry Fowler claims that the use of a non-possessive noun to precede a gerund arose as a result of confusion with the above usage with a participle, and should thus be called fused participle or geriple.

It has been argued that if the prescriptive rule is followed, the difference between the two forms may be used to make a slight distinction in meaning:
* The teacher&#x27;s shouting startled the student. (&quot;shouting&quot; is a gerund, the shouting startled the student)
* The teacher shouting startled the student. (&quot;shouting&quot; can be interpreted as a participle, qualifying &quot;the teacher&quot;; the teacher startled the student by shouting)
* I don&#x27;t like Jim&#x27;s drinking wine. (I don&#x27;t like the drinking)
* I don&#x27;t like Jim drinking wine. (I don&#x27;t like Jim when he is drinking wine)

However, Quirk et al. show that the range of senses of &quot;-ing&quot; forms with possessive and non-possessive subjects is far more diverse and nuanced:

These sentence exemplify a spectrum of senses from more noun-like to more verb-like. At the extremes of the spectrum they place

* at the noun end (where possessive &quot;Brown&#x27;s&quot; unmistakably expresses ownership) :

* and at the verb end (where &quot;Brown&#x27;s&quot; would clearly be impossible):
In some cases, particularly with a non-personal subject, the use of the possessive before a gerund may be considered redundant even in quite a formal register. For example, &quot;There is no chance of the snow falling&quot; (rather than the prescriptively correct &quot;There is no chance of the snow&#x27;s falling&quot;).

===Verb patterns classified as &quot;gerund&quot; use===
The term gerund describes certain uses of &quot;-ing&quot; clauses as &#x27;complementation&#x27; of individual English verbs, that is to say the choice of class that are allowable after that word.

The principal choices of clauses are
* The term gerund is applied to clauses similar to [4a] and [4b].
* In [6a] and [6b] &quot;coming&quot; is related to the participle use as an adverbial.
* in [5a] and [5b] the verbs kept and coming refer to the same event. &quot;Coming&quot; is related to the progressive aspect use in &quot;She is coming&quot;.
* Verbs such as &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;, although similar to verbs like &quot;keep&quot;, are generally classified with verbs like &quot;remember&quot;. Therefore, &quot;She started coming&quot; is termed a gerund use.
* The proposed test of passivisation to distinguish gerund use after &quot;remember&quot; from participle use after &quot;keep&quot; fails with sentences like [5b].
* The proposed test of possible possessive subject successfully distinguishes [4b] (traditional gerund) from [5b] (traditionally participle). 
: The variant * &quot;We kept Jane&#x27;s coming&quot; is not grammatically acceptable.
: The variant &quot;I remember Jane&#x27;s coming&quot; is acceptable — indeed required by prescriptive grammarians

====Verbs followed by &quot;gerund&quot; pattern====

Historically, the &quot;-ing&quot; suffix was attached to a limited number of verbs to form abstract nouns, which were used as the object of verbs such as &quot;like&quot;. The use was extended in various ways: the suffix became attachable to all verbs; the nouns acquired verb-like characteristics; the range of verbs allowed to introduce the form spread by analogy first to other verbs expressing emotion, then by analogy to other semantic groups of verbs associated with abstract noun objects; finally the use spread from verbs taking one-word objects to other semantically related groups verbs.

The present-day result of these developments is that the verbs followed by &quot;-ing&quot; forms tend to fall into semantic classes. The following groups have been derived from analysis of the most common verbs in the COBUILD data bank:

=====Pattern 4a: &quot;I remember seeing her come&quot;=====

:&#x27;LIKE&#x27; AND &#x27;DISLIKE&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;adore, appreciate, (cannot|) bear, (not) begrudge, detest, dislike, (cannot) endure, enjoy, hate, like, loathe, love, (not) mind, mind, prefer, relish, resent, (cannot) stand, (cannot) stomach, (not) tolerate, take to&quot;

::&quot;dread, (not) face. fancy, favour, fear, look forward to&quot;

:&#x27;CONSIDER&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;anticipate, consider, contemplate, debate, envisage, fantasise, imagine, intend, visualise&quot;

:&#x27;REMEMBER&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;forget, miss, recall, recollect, regret, remember, (cannot) remember&quot;

:&#x27;RECOMMEND&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;acknowledge, admit, advise, advocate, debate, deny, describe, forbid, mention, prohibit, propose, recommend, report, suggest, urge&quot;
:&#x27;INVOLVE&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;allow, entail, involve, justify, mean, necessitate, permit, preclude, prevent, save&quot;

:&#x27;POSTPONE&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;defer, delay, postpone, put off&quot;

:&#x27;NEED&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;deserve, need, require, want&quot;

:&#x27;RISK&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;chance, risk&quot;

:OTHERS WITH &quot;-ING&quot; OBJECT
::&quot;discourage, encourage, endure, mime, practise, get away with, go into. go towards, go without, play at&quot;

=====Pattern 5a: &quot;She kept coming&quot;=====

In addition, the COBUILD team identifies four groups of verbs followed by &quot;-ing&quot; forms that are hard to class as objects. In the verb + &quot;-ing&quot; object construction the action or state expressed by the verb can be separated from the action or state expressed by the &quot;-ing&quot; form. In the following groups, the senses are inseparable, jointly expressing a single complex action or state. Some grammarians do not recognise all these patterns as gerund use.
:&#x27;START&#x27; AND &#x27;STOP&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;begin, cease, come, commence, continue, finish, get, go, (not) go, keep, quit, resume, start, stop, burst out, carry on, fall about, fall to, give over, give up, go about, go around/round, go on, keep on, leave off, take to&quot;

:&#x27;AVOID&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;avoid, (not) bother, escape, evade, forbear, omit, (cannot) resist, shun, hold off&quot;

:&#x27;TRY&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;chance, risk, try&quot;

:&#x27;GO RIDING&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;come, go&quot;

=====Pattern 4b: &quot;I remember her coming&quot;=====
Verbs with this pattern do not normally allow the &#x27;subject&#x27; of the &quot;-ing&quot; clause to be used in an equivalent passive construction such as *&quot;She is remembered coming&quot;. 
The COBUILD Guide analyses &quot;her coming&quot; as the single object of &quot;I remember&quot;.

Many of the verbs that allow pattern 4a (without object) also allow this pattern.

:&#x27;LIKE&#x27; GROUP (verbs from the above &#x27;LIKE&#x27; AND &#x27;DISLIKE&#x27;, &#x27;DREAD AND LOOK FORWARD TO&#x27;, &#x27;CONSIDER&#x27; and &#x27;REMEMBER&#x27; groups)
::&quot;anticipate, envisage, appreciate, (cannot) bear, (not) begrudge, contemplate, dislike, dread, envisage, fear, forget, hate, (will not) have, imagine, like, (not) mind, picture, recall, recollect, remember, (not) remember, resent, see, stand, tolerate, visualise, want, put up with&quot;

:&#x27;REPORT&#x27; GROUP (subset of the above &#x27;RECOMMEND&#x27; GROUP)
::&quot;describe, mention, report&quot;

:&#x27;ENTAIL&#x27; GROUP (subset of the above &#x27;INVOLVE&#x27; GROUP)
::&quot;entail, involve, justify, mean, necessitate&quot;

:&#x27;STOP&#x27; GROUP (subset of the above &#x27;START&#x27; AND &#x27;STOP&#x27; GROUP)
::&quot;avoid, preclude, prevent, prohibit, resist, save, stop&quot;

:&#x27;RISK&#x27; GROUP (identical with above)
::&quot;chance, risk&quot;

=====Pattern 5b: &quot;We kept her coming&quot;=====
In contrast to Pattern 4b, these verbs allow the &#x27;subject&#x27; of the &quot;-ing&quot; clauses to be used in an equivalent passive construction such as &quot;She was kept coming.&quot; 

The COBUILD guide analyses &quot;her coming&quot; as a string of two objects of &quot;We kept&quot;:– (1)&quot;her&quot; and (2)&quot;coming&quot;.

:&#x27;SEE&#x27; GROUP
:: &quot;catch, feel, find, hear, notice, observe, photograph&quot; (usually passive), &quot;picture&quot; (usually passive), &quot;see, show, watch&quot;

:&#x27;BRING&#x27; GROUP
::&quot;bring, have, keep, leave, send, set&quot;

=====Pattern 6a: &quot;She ended up coming&quot;=====
These verbs refer to starting, spending or ending time. 
The following &quot;-ing&quot; form is an adverbial, traditionally classed as a participle rather than a gerund.

::&quot;die, end up, finish up, hang around, start off, wind up&quot;

=====Pattern 6b: &quot;She wasted time coming&quot;=====
These verbs also relate to time (and, by extension, money). The object generally expresses this concept. 
However, the object of &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;occupy&quot; must be a reflexive pronoun, e.g., &quot;She busied herself coming&quot;. 
The following &quot;-ing&quot; form is an adverbial, generally classed as a participle rather than a gerund.

:&quot;begin, busy, end, finish, kill, occupy, pass, spend, start, take, waste&quot;

====Verbs followed by either &quot;gerund&quot; or &quot;to&quot;-infinitive pattern====
Like the &quot;-ing&quot; suffix, the &quot;to&quot;-infinitive spread historically from a narrow original use, a prepositional phrase referring to future time. Like the &quot;-ing&quot; form it spread to all English verbs and to form non-finite clauses. Like the &quot;-ing&quot; form, it spread by analogy to use with words of similar meaning.

A number of verbs now belong in more than one class in their choice of &#x27;complementation&#x27;.

=====Patterns 4a and 3a: &quot;I remember seeing her come&quot; and &quot;She remembered to come&quot;=====

:Verbs in both &#x27;START&#x27; AND &#x27;STOP&#x27; (&quot;-ing&quot;) GROUP and &#x27;BEGIN&#x27; (&quot;to&quot;-infinitive) GROUPS

::Also &quot;go on&quot; — with different meanings
:::&quot;She went on singing&quot; — &#x27;She continued singing&#x27;
:::&quot;She went on to sing&quot; — &#x27;Afterwards, she sang&#x27;
:::&quot;She went on at me to sing&quot; — &#x27;She nagged me to sing&#x27; (i.e. that I should sing)
::Superficially, &quot;stop&quot; appears to be used in the 3a (&quot;to&quot;-infinitive) pattern
:::&quot;She stopped to sing&quot; — &#x27;She stopped in order to sing&#x27;
::However, the phrase &quot;to sing&quot; is quite separate and separable
::: &quot;She stopped for a moment to sing&quot;
::: &quot;She stopped what she was doing to sing&quot;
:: And the phrase may be used in all manner of sentences
:::&quot;She travelled to Paris to sing&quot;
:::&quot;She abandoned her husband and her children to sing&quot;

:Verbs in both &#x27;DREAD&#x27; AND LOOK FORWARD TO&#x27; (&quot;-ing&quot;) GROUP and &#x27;HOPE&#x27; (&quot;to&quot;-infinitive) GROUPS
::&quot;dread, fear&quot;

::&quot;hate, like, love, prefer&quot;
::Unlike other Pattern 3b verbs, the object is indivisible
:::&quot;He hates his wife to stand out in a crowd&quot; does not mean &quot;He hates his wife&quot;
::With &quot;would&quot; there is often a difference of meaning
:::&quot;I like living in Ambridge&quot; — &#x27;I live in Ambridge, and I like it&#x27;
:::&quot;I would like to live in Ambridge&quot; — &#x27;I don&#x27;t live in Ambridge, but I have a desire to live there in the future&#x27;
:::&quot;I would like living in Ambridge&quot; — &#x27;I don&#x27;t live in Ambridge, but if I ever did live there, I would enjoy it&#x27;

:::&quot;I like boxing with an experienced opponent&quot; — &#x27;I like it when I box with an experienced opponent&#x27;

:Verbs in both &#x27;RECOMMEND&#x27; (&quot;-ing&quot;) and &#x27;TELL&#x27; or &#x27;NAG&#x27; AND &#x27;COAX&#x27;(&quot;to&quot;-infinitive) GROUPS
::advise, forbid, recommend, urge
::These verbs do not admit &quot;-ing&quot; Pattern 4b with a word serving as object of the RECOMMEND verb. However they can be used with a possessive &#x27;subject&#x27; of the &quot;-ing&quot; form.

===Borrowings of English &quot;-ing&quot; forms in other languages===
English verb forms ending in &quot;-ing&quot; are sometimes borrowed into other languages. In some cases, they become pseudo-anglicisms, taking on new meanings or uses not found in English. For instance, &quot;camping&quot; means &quot;campsite&quot; in many languages, while &quot;parking&quot; often means a car park. Both these words are treated as nouns, with none of the features of the gerund in English. For more details and examples, see &quot;-ing&quot; words in other languages.

<text>Natron is a naturally occurring mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O, a kind of soda ash) and around 17% sodium bicarbonate (also called baking soda, NaHCO3) along with small quantities of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. Natron is white to colourless when pure, varying to gray or yellow with impurities. Natron deposits are sometimes found in saline lake beds which arose in arid environments. Throughout history natron has had many practical applications that continue today in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components.

In modern mineralogy the term &quot;natron&quot; has come to mean only the sodium carbonate decahydrate (hydrated soda ash) that makes up most of the historical salt.

== Etymology ==
The English and German word &quot;natron&quot; is a French cognate derived through the Spanish &quot;natrón&quot; from Latin &quot;natrium&quot; and Greek &quot;nitron&quot; (). This derives from the Ancient Egyptian word . &quot;Natron&quot; refers to Wadi El Natrun or Natron Valley in Egypt, from which natron was mined by the ancient Egyptians for use in burial rites. The modern chemical symbol for sodium, &quot;Na&quot;, is an abbreviation of that element&#x27;s Neo-Latin name &quot;natrium&quot;, which was derived from &quot;natron&quot;. The name of the chemical element Nitrogen is also a cognate to natron, it derives from Greek &quot;nitron&quot; and &quot;-gen (&quot;a producer of something, in this case Nitric acid, which was produced from niter (potassium nitrate)). Niter was also an obsolete name for natron because in earlier times, both minerals used to be confused with each other.

== Importance in antiquity ==
Historical natron was harvested directly as a salt mixture from dry lake beds in ancient Egypt, and has been used for thousands of years as a cleaning product for both the home and body. Blended with oil, it was an early form of soap. It softens water while removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash. The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, and was used for making leather as well as a bleach for clothing.

The mineral was used during mummification ceremonies in ancient Egypt because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture, the carbonate in natron increases pH (raises alkalinity), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures, natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.

The Pyramid Texts describe how natron pellets were used as funerary offerings in the rites for the deceased pharaoh, &quot;N&quot;. The ceremony required two kinds of natron, one sourced from northern (Lower) and one from southern (Upper) Egypt.

Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called &quot;Egyptian blue&quot;, and also as the flux in Egyptian faience. It was used along with sand and lime in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until AD 640. The mineral was also employed as a flux to solder precious metals together.

=== Decline in use ===
Most of natron&#x27;s uses both in the home and by industry were gradually replaced with closely related sodium compounds and minerals. Natron&#x27;s detergent properties are now commercially supplied by soda ash (pure sodium carbonate), the mixture&#x27;s chief compound ingredient, along with other chemicals. Soda ash also replaced natron in glass-making. Some of its ancient household roles are also now filled by ordinary baking soda, which is sodium bicarbonate, natron&#x27;s other key ingredient.

== Chemistry of hydrated sodium carbonate ==
Natron is also the mineralogical name for the compound sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O), which is the main component in historical natron.Sodium carbonate decahydrate has a specific gravity of 1.42 to 1.47 and a Mohs hardness of 1. It crystallizes in the monoclinic-domatic crystal system, typically forming efflorescences and encrustations.

The term &quot;hydrated sodium carbonate&quot; is commonly used to encompass the monohydrate (Na2CO3·H2O), the decahydrate and the heptahydrate (Na2CO3·7H2O), but is often used in industry to refer to the decahydrate only. Both the hepta- and the decahydrate effloresce (lose water) in dry air and are partially transformed into the monohydrate thermonatrite Na2CO3·H2O.

=== As a source of soda ash ===
Sodium carbonate decahydrate is stable at room temperature but recrystallizes at only to sodium carbonate heptahydrate, Na2CO3·7H2O, then above to sodium carbonate monohydrate, Na2CO3·H2O. This recrystallization from decahydrate to monohydrate releases much crystal water in a mostly clear, colorless salt solution with little solid thermonatrite. The mineral natron is often found in association with thermonatrite, nahcolite, trona, halite, mirabilite, gaylussite, gypsum, and calcite.
Most industrially produced sodium carbonate is soda ash (sodium carbonate anhydrate Na2CO3) which is obtained by calcination (dry heating at temperatures of 150 to 200 °C) of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate monohydrate, or trona.

== Geological occurrence ==
Geologically, the mineral natron as well as the historical natron are formed as transpiro-evaporite minerals, i.e. crystallizing during the drying up of salt lakes rich in sodium carbonate. The sodium carbonate is usually formed by absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by a highly alkaline, sodium-rich lake brine, according to the following reaction scheme:


Pure deposits of sodium carbonate decahydrate are rare, due to the limited temperature stability of this compound and due to the fact that the absorption of carbon dioxide usually produces mixtures of bicarbonate and carbonate in solution. From such mixtures, the mineral natron (and also the historical one) will be formed only if the brine temperature during evaporation is maximally about  – or the alkalinity of the lake is so high, that little bicarbonate is present in solution (see reaction scheme above) – in which case the maximum temperature is increased to about . In most cases the mineral natron will form together with some amount of nahcolite (sodium bicarbonate), resulting in salt mixtures like the historical natron.
Otherwise, the minerals trona or thermonatrite and nahcolite are commonly formed. As the evaporation of a salt lake will occur over geological time spans, during which also part or all of the salt beds might redissolve and recrystallize, deposits of sodium carbonate can be composed of layers of all these minerals.

<text>Nancy A. Collins (born September 10, 1959) is an American horror fiction writer best known for her series of vampire novels featuring her character Sonja Blue. 
Collins has also written for comic books, including the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 2) series, &quot;Jason vs. Leatherface&quot;, &quot;Predator: Hell Come A&#x27; Walkin&quot;&#x27; and her own one-shot issue &quot;&quot;.

Collins was born in McGehee, Arkansas, United States. She lived in New Orleans, Louisiana in the 1980s; after time in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia she moved about the South for several years, living in coastal North Carolina and Virginia, before settling in Macon, Georgia in 2019.

==Writing==
Collins has written numerous novels since 1989, most of which refer to and directly include races of creatures the author calls Pretenders, monsters from myth and legend passing as human to better hunt their prey. She is best known for Sonja Blue, a young woman with demonic powers who after being taught by an older male mentor, hunts and kills vampires. Her first appearance was in 1989. A. Asbjørn Jøn notes possible intertextual links between the Whistler character in the 1998 movie &quot;Blade&quot; and a character named Whistler in the Sonja Blue novel, &quot;A Dozen Black Roses&quot; (1996), as they possess &quot;striking similarities in role, dramatic focus, visual appearance, and sharing the name&quot;. Margaret L. Carter, in her article on 20th century vampire fiction, listed &quot;Sunglasses After Dark&quot; as one of the 13 most influential vampire novels published after 1970, particularly in the way Collins depicted vampires as parasitic beings with no identity of their own who &#x27;borrow&#x27; the memories of their hosts.

<doc id="113109" wikidata="Q7062318" url="?curid=113109" title="Not in Our Name">
<text>Not in Our Name (NION) was a United States organization founded on March 23, 2002 to protest the U.S. government&#x27;s course in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks; it disbanded on March 31, 2008.

==Two key documents==
Early in their existence, NION produced two documents—the &quot;Pledge of Resistance&quot; and the &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;—that NION members believe provide focus and expression to the U.S. anti-war movement.

===&quot;Pledge of Resistance&quot;===
The Pledge is written by Starhawk and Saul Williams, in the style of free verse, beginning:

We believe that as people living 
in the United States it is our 
responsibility to resist the injustices 
done by our government, 
in our names 

Not in our name 
will you wage endless war 

and concluding

Another world is possible 
and we pledge to make it real.
The pledge opposes what it characterizes as &quot;endless war&quot;, &quot;transfusions of blood for oil&quot;, invasions of foreign countries, bombing civilians, and killing children. It goes on, &quot;Not in our name / will you erode the very freedoms / you have claimed to fight for.&quot; It implicitly accuses the Bush administration of deeming &quot;whole peoples or countries&quot; as &quot;evil&quot; and pledges, among other things, &quot;...alliance with those/ who have come under attack /
for voicing opposition to the war / or for their religion or ethnicity.&quot;

The &quot;Not in My Name&quot; EP was released in May 2003 by Saul Williams with assistance from DJ Spooky, DJ Goo and Coldcut.

===&quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;===
NION&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;, drafted in spring 2002, first lists a series of criticisms of the Bush Administration and (secondarily) the U.S. Congress and calls on the people of the U.S. &quot;...to resist the policies and overall political direction that have emerged since September 11, 2001, and which pose grave dangers to the people of the world.&quot;

Among the specific principles advocated in the statement are the right of self-determination for peoples and nations and the importance of due process and dissent. The statement expresses &quot;shock&quot; at &quot;the horrific events of September 11, 2001&quot; but, evoking &quot;similar scenes in Baghdad, Panama City, and, a generation ago, Vietnam&quot;, describes Iraq as &quot;a country which has no connection to the horror of September 11&quot;, and deplores the administration&#x27;s &quot;spirit of revenge&quot; and the &quot;simplistic script of &#x27;good vs. evil&#x27;: &quot;In our name, the Bush administration, with near unanimity from Congress, not only attacked Afghanistan but arrogated to itself and its allies the right to rain down military force anywhere and anytime.&quot;

Referring to the U.S. government&#x27;s treatment of immigrants in the wake of September 11, the statement accuses the U.S. government of creating &quot;two classes of people: those to whom the basic rights of the U.S. legal system are at least promised, and those who now seem to have no rights at all&quot;, and evokes &quot;the infamous concentration camps for Japanese-Americans in World War II&quot;.

Protesting &quot;a pall of repression&quot; and referring specifically to the USA PATRIOT Act as emblematic of that repression, it accuses the executive branch of usurping &quot;the roles and functions of the other branches of government,&quot; and continues, &quot;We must take the highest officers of the land seriously when they talk of a war that will last a generation and when they speak of a new domestic order. We are confronting a new openly imperial policy towards the world and a domestic policy that manufactures and manipulates fear to curtail rights.&quot;

NION urges a movement of resistance: &quot;President Bush has declared: &#x27;you&#x27;re either with us or against us.&#x27; Here is our answer: We refuse to allow you to speak for all the American people ... We refuse to be party to these wars and we repudiate any inference that they are being waged in our name or for our welfare ...&quot; It indicates as inspiration &quot;...Israeli reservists who, at great personal risk, declare &#x27;there IS a limit&#x27; and refuse to serve in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza&quot;, the abolitionists, and &quot;those who defied the Vietnam war&quot; and concludes, &quot;we will resist the machinery of war and repression and rally others to do everything possible to stop it.&quot;

===Signatories===

NION&#x27;s web site lists a broad array of signatories to the pledge, listing only those who signed before July 17, 2002. Among those are:
==2005 Statement of Conscience==
NION issued an updated Statement of Conscience in January 2005, expressing dissent on the occasion of the re-inauguration of George W. Bush as president of the United States.

==Slogans==
The group uses the following phrases in its rhetoric:
* &quot;Not by our will&quot;
* &quot;Not in our name&quot;
* &quot;Not by our hearts&quot;
* I Say NO to the Bush Agenda
* No War On the World
* No Police State Restrictions
* No Round-ups and Detentions

==Controversies==

===Role in the anti-war movement===

A partial parallel for the founding of Not in Our Name (NION) is the founding of the anti-war coalition ANSWER. ANSWER was founded on 14 September 2001, on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, largely by members of the Workers World Party (WWP). NION was founded on 23 March 2002, largely by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), which continues to be prominent among its leadership. (In 2005, four years after its founding, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, an offshoot of WWP, became a more prominent influence than the WWP in the leadership of ANSWER.)

Nonetheless, in contrast to ANSWER, NION has a broad set of endorsers and is generally regarded as a cooperative participant in the broader anti-war movement. An October 2002 article by Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom in &quot;Z&quot; magazine is typical among expressions by anti-war critics of the RCP that, despite its origins, NION is a cooperative participant in the movement. After excoriating the RCP for holding various positions that Albert and Shalom find abhorrent, they then write, &quot;Despite these views, however, RCP does not push its specific positions on NION to the degree that IAC does on ANSWER. For example, while the ANSWER website offers such things as ... [an] IAC backgrounder on Afghanistan ..., the NION website and its public positions have no connection to the sometimes bizarre views of the RCP.&quot; This is reflected in the wide range of signatories to their &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;.

Also, NION is itself now a member of a broader coalition United for Peace and Justice, founded in October 2002 (a year after ANSWER) by individuals and groups seeking to curb ANSWER&#x27;s influence in the anti-war movement.

An example of NION&#x27;s willingness to cooperate came when they postponed their national moratorium against the war to coincide with the March 5, 2003 &quot;Books Not Bombs&quot; student strike called by the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition.

===Donation from Larry Flynt===

In 2004, Robert Corsini, an organizer for Not in Our Name publicized Hardcore pornographer Larry Flynt&#x27;s support for one of their campaigns. Aura Bogado, a feminist radio producer and news anchor for KPFK, objected privately in e-mail and asked to be removed from the organization&#x27;s mailing list. Corsini forwarded his response to Bogado (including a copy of the original private e-mail) to NION national organizers, her employers at KPFK, and to Bruce David at Larry Flynt Publishing. Bogado replied to Corisini in detail on NION&#x27;s public e-mail list, and participated in a sharp debate over the e-mail list that followed. After &quot;Hustler&quot; published a series of articles and sexual caricatures attacking Bogado, she made her criticism public in &quot;Hustling the Left&quot;, published on ZNet in June 2005. Bogado charged that Leftist leaders were tacitly supporting racism and misogyny by aligning themselves with Flynt, and specifically criticized Greg Palast, Amy Goodman, Susie Bright, and Amy Alkon. The discussion of her article inspired similar criticism of Leftist leaders cooperating with Flynt by feminists such as Nikki Craft and pro-feminist Leftists such as Stan Goff (). Shortly after the publication of her article, the Not in Our Name Steering Committee issued a public apology to Bogado and objected to the treatment of Bogado in &quot;Hustler&quot;.

==Antecedents of the name==
Prior to the founding of Not in Our Name, other anti-war groups had used the name, including a group of families who were victims of the 9-11 World Trade Center attack, and Jewish youth protesting Israel&#x27;s policies in the Palestinian territories. &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; is also a slogan used by the UK Stop the War Coalition. &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; has also been a petition drive to be signed by Muslims by CAIR, in which they say it is &quot;not in the name of Muslims&quot; that terrorist leaders such as Osama bin Ladin and Hambali are making these claims.

<text>Old HB, Inc., known as Hostess Brands from 2009 to 2013 and established in 1930 as Interstate Bakeries Corporation, was a wholesale baker and distributor of bakery products in the United States. Before its 2012 closure and liquidation, it owned the Hostess, Wonder Bread, Nature&#x27;s Pride, Dolly Madison, Butternut Breads, and Drake&#x27;s brands.

For many years the company was called Interstate Bakeries and based at 12 East Armour Boulevard, Kansas City, Missouri. In 2009, after it emerged from a 2004 bankruptcy, its name was changed to Hostess Brands and its headquarters moved to Irving, Texas. Hostess Brands sought bankruptcy protection again in January 2012.

On November 16, 2012, the company filed a motion in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in White Plains to close its business and sell its assets. On November 21, the motion was accepted and a judge agreed to sell the Hostess brands. The Hostess and Dolly Madison brands are now produced by Hostess Brands, which was acquired by The J.M. Smucker Company in 2023.

==History==

=== Interstate Bakeries and Interstate Brands ===
The company has its roots in Nafziger Bakeries, founded by Ralph Leroy Nafziger in a church basement at 6th and Prospect Avenue in Kansas City in 1905. Nafziger expanded the bakeries and bought out competitors. In 1925 he sold Nafziger to Purity Bakeries (which became American Bakeries) and acquired a controlling interest in Schulze Baking Company and its Butternut Breads brand.

In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of the Interstate Bakeries Corporation (IBC) with the merger of Schulze Bakery and the seven bakers of Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to become the fifth largest baker in the United States. The company sold Butternut bread, wrapped in gingham, to grocery stores.

Schulze and Western continued to operate separately under the Interstate umbrella until 1937, when they merged with Interstate Bakeries. In 1943 Interstate acquired the Supreme Baking Company of Los Angeles, and in 1950 it bought the O&#x27;Rourke Baking Company of Buffalo, New York.

Acquisitions during the 1950s and early 1960s included the Ambrosia, Remar, Butter Cream, Campbell-Sell and Schall Tasty baking companies, the Kingston Cake and Cobb&#x27;s Sunlit bakeries, Sweetheart Bread Company and Hart&#x27;s Bakeries. In the late 1960s IBC acquired Millbrook Bread, Shawano Farms and the Baker and Shawano canning companies. In 1969 IBC changed its name to Interstate Brands, with its signature brands Butternut and Blue Seal breads and Dolly Madison cakes; Butternut Breads had been in business since 1902.

=== DPF (1975) ===
In 1975 Interstate was acquired by the Data Processing Financial and General Corporation (DPF), a computer-leasing company that had encountered difficulties during the IBM antitrust battles which changed the pricing of IBM hardware. To change its business model, DPF used its cash to buy a low-tech company. The merged company, headquartered in Hartsdale, New York, kept the DPF acronym while continuing to divest its remaining technology assets. Investing heavily in its plants, it acquired the Silver Loaf Baking Company, Eddy Bakeries and Mrs. Cubbison&#x27;s Foods.

=== Interstate Bakeries and IBC Holdings ===
In 1981 DPF completed the sale of its remaining computer systems and changed the company name back to the original Interstate Bakeries, moving its headquarters back to Kansas City. In 1986 Interstate acquired Purity Baking Company and Stewart Sandwiches, followed in 1987 by Landshire Food Products. The following year Interstate became a privately held company, and its name changed to IBC Holdings. IBC bought the Merita-Cotton&#x27;s Bakeries division of the American Bakeries Company. In 1991, IBC again became a public company and changed its name back to Interstate Bakeries.
=== Continental Baking merger (1995) ===
In January 1995, Interstate acquired the Continental Baking Company from Ralston Purina for $330 million and 16.9 million shares of Interstate stock. Continental had acquired Taggart Bakeries of Indianapolis in 1925, and the deal brought Taggart&#x27;s creations (including Wonder Bread and the Hostess brand) to Interstate. Taggart had created Hostess in 1921, and the brand focused on cakes like Twinkies, CupCakes, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos (created during Continental&#x27;s ownership). At this time, the merged company also bought the San Francisco French Bread Company, John J. Nissen Baking Company, Drake&#x27;s and My Bread Company.

With the merger, Interstate held two national bread divisions: Butternut and Wonder Bread. The divisions had different cultures: Butternut was unregimented, with each bakery a self-contained profit center, and Wonder Bread was structured; this caused early problems. In both divisions, snack cakes were more profitable due to economy of scale and logistics. When extended-shelf-life enzymes were developed for bread, it was hoped to convert small, less-efficient bakeries into a network of large bakeries like their snack-cakes operations. The new enzymes gave the bread a different taste and texture, and market forces reduced prices and sales.

=== Bankruptcy (2004) ===
On September 22, 2004, Interstate Bakeries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company named a new chief executive, Tony Alvarez. Interstate Bakery&#x27;s stock, which had been $34 per share, fell to $2.05 with the bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy proceedings (at the time, the longest-running in U.S. history), Interstate fought a 2007 bid from Mexican baker Grupo Bimbo and Ron Burkle of the Yucaipa Companies.

Under Craig Jung, Interstate Bakeries emerged from bankruptcy as a private company on February 3, 2009. The plan included a 50-percent equity stake by Ripplewood Holdings and credit lines from General Electric Capital and GE Capital Markets, Silver Point Finance and Monarch Master Funding. Interstate&#x27;s unionized workers made contract concessions in exchange for equity in the company.

During the 2004–2009 bankruptcy period Interstate closed nine of its 54 bakeries and more than 300 outlet stores, and its workforce declined from 32,000 to 22,000. The company dropped regional brands and operating agreements, such as an agreement to produce Sunbeam Bread for the northeastern U.S.

=== Hostess Brands (2009) ===
On November 2, 2009, IBC became Hostess Brands, named for its Twinkies-and-cupcakes cake division. Hostess Brands continued its bread lines, including Wonder Bread. The company&#x27;s subsidiaries, such as Interstate Brands Corporation and IBC Sales Corporation, continued displaying their name and logo on Hostess Brands products.

=== Bankruptcy and liquidation ===
In December 2011, it was reported that Hostess Brands was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy a second time. The company stopped paying future pension benefits after August, breaking its union contracts. According to a Hostess employee, &quot;We understand that, should we pursue some form of legal action to require the company to live up to the terms of the contract, they may close, but we have come to believe that they will close anyway. We believe the company is poorly managed and the only hope is a complete change in management&quot;.

On January 10, 2012, Hostess Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time. In its filing, the company said it &quot;is not competitive, primarily due to legacy pension and medical benefit obligations and restrictive work rules&quot;. According to Hostess, it employed 19,000 people and was more than $860 million in debt. The company said it would continue to operate with $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing from Monarch Alternative Capital, Silver Point Capital and other investors.

In March Brian Driscoll resigned as CEO and was replaced by Gregory F. Rayburn, who had been hired as chief restructuring officer nine days earlier. &quot;Fortune&quot; reported that unions in the company were unhappy with Driscoll&#x27;s proposed compensation package of $1.5 million, plus cash incentives and $1.95 million in long-term compensation. The court had discovered that Hostess executives received raises of up to 80 percent the previous year. Rayburn cut the salaries of the four top Hostess executives to $1, to be restored by January 1 of the following year or earlier.

In July 2012, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that negotiations with the Teamsters Union, led by Silver Point Capital, were close to an agreement allowing Hostess Brands to cut employee pay and benefits if the company continued funding its pension plans. In May, as required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the company&#x27;s 19,000 workers were warned of a possible layoff. In an email to the Marysville, California &quot;Appeal-Democrat&quot;, Hostess spokesman Erik Halvorson wrote that the May notices were to alert employees to a possible sale of the company but &quot;our goal is still to emerge from bankruptcy as a growing company with a strong future&quot;. Although the layoff notices listed July 7–21 as dates, on July 5 another company spokesman told the &quot;Financial News &amp; Daily Record&quot; that there were no immediate plans to lay off Hostess employees.

In November 2012, Hostess employees nationwide went on strike. The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), representing 6,600 Hostess employees, took action after a contract proposal from Hostess Brands was rejected by 92 percent of its members.

On November 16, Hostess announced that it was ceasing its plant operations and laying off most of its 18,500 employees. The company said that it intended to sell off its assets (including its well-known brand names) and liquidate. According to CEO Gregory Rayburn, &quot;Hostess Brands will move promptly to lay off most of its 18,500-member workforce and focus on selling its assets to the highest bidders.&quot; A BCTGM press release issued that day read in part, &quot;When a highly-respected financial consultant, hired by Hostess, determined earlier this year that the company&#x27;s business plan to exit bankruptcy was guaranteed to fail because it left the company with unsustainable debt levels, our members knew that the massive wage and benefit concessions the company was demanding would go straight to Wall Street investors and not back into the company.&quot;

According to Rayburn, potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the Hostess brand. On November 21, Judge Robert Drain cleared Hostess to close. In approving the plan, Drain ruled against U.S. Trustee for the Southern District Tracy Hope Davis&#x27; motion to convert the bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with an appointed trustee to oversee liquidation. Davis criticized the plan&#x27;s provisions, which would grant bonuses to insiders&#x27; and &#x27;cherry-pick&#x27; which administrative claims get paid&quot;. Drain left Rayburn in charge of the liquidation; Hostess had argued that its assets would devalue if the company had to wait for a trustee to get up to speed on the company. Hostess Brands&#x27; liquidation plan was finalized by a federal bankruptcy judge on November 29. In January 2013, the company asked a judge to set a March 21 deadline for workers to file back-pay claims. On February 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York approved stalking horse bidders for Hostess Brands.

The company received bids for assets from Walmart, Target, Kroger, Flowers Foods and Grupo Bimbo, and was expected to sell its snack-cake and bread brands during 2013.
On January 8, 2013, Hostess Brands hired Hilco to sell its equipment, machinery and real estate. Three days later the company announced a $390 million stalking-horse bid by Flowers Foods for six of its bread brands (including Wonder Bread), and court approval was received for a February 28 auction of the brands.

On January 15, 2013, Hostess Brands began searching for a stalking-horse bidder for its snack cakes; four companies (Grupo Bimbo, a partnership of Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company, Hurst Capital and McKee Foods) were negotiating. Two weeks later the company picked Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company as lead bidder for its snack cakes, with the bid deadlines for all Hostess brands March 11 and 12.

=== Buyers ===
It was announced on January 28, 2013 that United States Bakery was the leading bidder for Hostess&#x27; Sweetheart, Eddy&#x27;s, Standish Farms and Grandma Emilie&#x27;s brands and McKee Foods was the leading bidder for its Drake&#x27;s brand, which included Ring Dings, Yodels and Drake&#x27;s Devil Dogs. On March 11 Apollo Global Management made the sole bid ($410 million) for the company&#x27;s snack business, which included Twinkies; this company later went public under the name Hostess Brands and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker TWNK. On 11 September 2023, The J.M. Smucker Company announced it would buy Hostess for $5.6 billion in a cash and stock deal.

=== Hostess Brands ===
On June 6, 2013, the new Hostess Brands reopened the Emporia, Kansas plant. Hostess announced ten days later that production would resume the following month, and on June 23 said that its brands would be back on store shelves on July 15. although the company would sell fewer products than before, new president Rich Seban said that it might produce innovative pastries and snacks. &quot;We can have some fun with that mixture,&quot; Seban said, suggesting that Hostess might experiment with gluten-free, higher-fiber and lower-sugar and -sodium products.

=== Sold to Apollo and Metropoulos, later J.M. Smucker ===
In January 2013, a joint venture by Apollo Global Management and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company became the leading bidder to purchase Dolly Madison and the Hostess brand of snacks. Silver Point Capital, Grupo Bimbo and Hurst Capital also placed bids for both brands. On March 12, Apollo and Metropoulos won the bid to buy the brands from Hostess for $410 million. The deal was approved by a bankruptcy court, and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company principal Daren Metropoulos announced that Hostess products would be sold again on July 15. 

This division eventually went public as the second incarnation of Hostess Brands, and announced it would be acquired by J.M. Smucker on September 11, 2023.

=== Sold to Bimbo Bakeries USA ===
Bimbo Bakeries USA outbid Flowers Foods for the rights to Beefsteak on February 28, 2013, and the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on March 20. In August, the trademarks of J. J. Nissen and the web domain jjnissenbreads.com were transferred to Bimbo Bakeries, which later purchased other regional Hostess bread brands: Colombo, Cotton&#x27;s, Emperor Norton, Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, Parisian and Toscana.

=== Sold to Flowers Foods ===
In January 2013 it was announced that Flowers Foods had offered to buy six of Hostess&#x27; bread brands, including Wonder Bread. The deal, initially structured at $360 million, involved 20 bakeries and 38 depots. Flowers Foods won the bid to purchase five of the six bread brands (except Beefsteak, purchased by Grupo Bimbo) on February 28. The deal went through a bankruptcy court in March and was completed on July 22, 2013. The five brands are Butternut Bread, Home Pride, Merita Breads, Nature&#x27;s Pride and Wonder Bread.

==Plot==
Hibiki Amawa is an enthusiastic young man whose dream career is to be a professional teacher, having graduated from college with a certificate in athletics. When he is unable to pay his landlady, Lulu Sanjo, the monthly rent for his apartment, he rushes off to the nearby Seitō Sannomiya Private School to apply for a position that is open, but is summarily denied employment because of his gender, as they only hire women. Offended, and more determined than ever to have his way, Hibiki vows to demonstrate the merits of his educational philosophy to his detractors, and with offered help from Lulu, agrees to disguise himself by cross-dressing in order to deceive the school&#x27;s female-only administration. With assistance from some gadgets Lulu engineered for this purpose, he disguises himself very convincingly. Following an initial demonstration of his merits as an educator, he is hired.

Unfortunately for Hibiki, however, life as a gym teacher at this school does not go completely smoothly. With interpersonal conflicts among students causing fights and occasional mild missteps endangering his disguise, Hibiki must not only mediate his class, but also keep up appearances and navigate life in disguise.

==Characters==
===Primary characters===
Some of the characters&#x27; surnames and the school&#x27;s name are derived from train station names in the Kinki area. In addition, most of the surnames of the characters of the Seitō Sannomiya Private School, except for Fūko Kuzuha, are adopted from the names of stations on the Hanshin Main Line.
: (male-Japanese), Yuki Masuda (female-Japanese), Crispin Freeman (male-English), Sally Dana (female-English)
:The central protagonist of the series, Hibiki Amawa is a fairly typical college graduate whose goal is to become a professional school teacher. His life takes an unexpected turn in the process when, in order to pay off his apartment rent, he is forced to cross-dress in order to gain employment at the female-favouring Seitō Sannomiya Private School. His situation only gets more complicated when the school board grows suspicious of him, students take to fighting with each other, and one of the girls of his class (Fūko) develops romantic feelings for him.
:
:Lulu Sanjō, more often referred to as &quot;Granny&quot; by her tenants, is the midget-size tough-as-nails, pistol-packing landlady of the Gochisō apartments, which also doubles as a school supply store that she also owns. Impressed by Hibiki&#x27;s strong determination, she offers to help him in his mission, helping him disguise himself as a woman and maintain the disguise throughout his time on campus. She rides a Harley-Davidson FXSTS softail springer motorcycle with a twin cam engine. It is heavily implied that Lulu is a crossdresser as well.
:
:Clumsy but selfless, Fūko Kuzuha is a student at Seitō Sannomiya. Despite being accident prone, mild-mannered, and easily flustered, Fūko is a very strong-willed girl. Much to her personal anxiety, she starts admiring Hibiki&#x27;s personality, and this admiration develops into a powerful romantic attraction, bringing her considerable confusion and feelings of shame. Her mother died when she was six years old and her widower father is a traveling businessman. Fūko resides at the school dormitories. She also speaks up for Hibiki in the final episode, changing everyone&#x27;s negative opinion of him when Hibiki&#x27;s true gender is exposed.

===Secondary characters===
:
:A salaryman who is a tenant at the Gochisō apartments; room 101. He is a pervert with a fascination with photographing female uniforms with his camera and unusually large mirror; frequently strapped on his back. He is good friends with Tofu Tofukuji.
:
:A retired, elderly man lodging at the Gochisō apartments.
:
:Hibiki&#x27;s pet dog. Lulu often uses Kura Ge as motivational collateral for the unpaid rent. While the breed of Kura Ge is never mentioned, he seems to resemble a Bichon.
:
:The eponymous principal of Seitō Sannomiya. She was appointed office a decade prior to the story and carries herself in a conceited, yet formal, aristocratic manner. At the conclusion of the series, it is revealed that her sexism behavior was stemmed from a man who abandoned her in her younger years, who was the former gym teacher at the school; this reveals that she is an alumna of Seito Sannomiya.
:
:Vice-principal of Seitō Sannomiya. She works closely with Chieko Sannomiya, and like her, is a stern man-hater, resulting from a failed marriage. Reiko grows suspicious of Hibiki early into his career and tries debunking his identity several times. Reiko was successful in exposing Hibiki&#x27;s true gender in the end, but her plan in turning Seitō into an all-girls school was tarnished by Fūko&#x27;s defensive speech for Hibiki.
:
:An aggressive tomboy, Fujio Himejima is a student at Seitō Sannomiya. She wears her hair in two loose pigtails, tied by her signature green bows. She has a black belt in Aikido and develops a crush on fellow student Akira Fukae, who unfortunately does not reciprocate. Fujio resides in the dormitories.
:
:Miho Umeda is a student at the school and is Fujio&#x27;s closest friend. Her maturity is considerably more developed than her friends and this at times makes her behave in an arrogant manner; especially when it comes to her past and current experiences with boys. As a result, the other girls tend to look up to her and this prompts her to act like a role model for them. Miho resides in the dormitories. She is a foil to Seiko Kasuganomichi.
:
:Seiko Kasuganomichi is a fairly quiet student. Her family is wealthy and she is often seen sheltered. She gets uncomfortable at the sight of naked men, in photographs or in the flesh.
:
:Quiet and composed, Akira Fukae is one of the primary male students on campus. Even though he usually tends to be level-headed, Akira is not afraid to speak his mind or take a stand for what he believes he is fair and just. His father is a private investigator.
:
:Kyosuke Aoki is another one of the few male students at the school, arguably the most energetic and is also the tallest; comparable to Miho Umeda to the girls. He takes the biggest interest in Hibiki&#x27;s drag and frequently proclaims it to her and the others. Kyosuke is good friends with Akira Fukae and Shoichi.
:
:Another enrolled male student at the school and a close friend of Kyōsuke Aoki.
:
:The board chairman of Seitō Sannomiya.
:
:Another of the few male students. He is a gentle and quiet boy who appears in Episode 8. He stole Reiko Mukogawa&#x27;s salary when he is asked by Hibiki to visit the teacher&#x27;s lounge and retrieve his grade book. Shiro has a girlfriend named Makoto Uozaki.

<text>Princess Irene of the Netherlands (Irene Emma Elisabeth; born 5 August 1939) is the second child of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard.

In 1964, she converted to Catholicism and married the then-Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma in a Catholic ceremony in Rome, thus forfeiting her place in the royal succession. Since their 1981 divorce, she has espoused left-wing causes, including anti-nuclear campaigns, and has developed a pantheistic philosophy about the relationship between man and nature.

==Childhood and family==
The princess was born on 5 August 1939 at Soestdijk Palace. At the time of her birth, war was a distinct possibility but, because her parents hoped for a peaceful solution, they chose to name their new daughter for Eirene, the Greek goddess of peace. She has three sisters, the eldest of whom is the former queen of the Netherlands, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands; the two younger ones are Princess Margriet and the late Princess Christina.

Because of the invasion of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany during World War II the Dutch royal family first fled to the United Kingdom. Irene was not yet a year old when the family was forced to leave the Netherlands; she was christened in the Chapel-Royal of Buckingham Palace in London, with the wife of King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, being one of her godparents. When the family was leaving the Netherlands, the port where they boarded the British warship was attacked by a German air raid; one of the German bombs exploded within 200 yards of the family. Irene was placed in a gasproof carrier to protect her from chemical warfare.
Princess Juliana and her daughters again took flight when the London Blitz began, this time to exile in Ottawa, Canada, where her younger sister, Margriet, was born and where Irene attended Rockcliffe Park Public School. As a teenager, she was dubbed by the Dutch press &quot;the glamorous Princess of the Netherlands.&quot; During the war, the Royal Dutch Brigade (the formation of Free Dutch soldiers that fought alongside the Allies) was named for Princess Irene. This was continued after the war as the Regiment Prinses Irene.

Always an independent person, Irene was thrilled to receive a sports car from her father, one of the gifts he had been presented with. Irene&#x27;s happiness was short-lived; when she opened the hood of the automobile, she noticed that the vehicle only looked like a sports car but had an ordinary car&#x27;s engine. She asked her father for permission to turn the vehicle into a true racing-type auto, which Prince Bernhard refused to allow.

She was a bridesmaid at the 1962 wedding of Prince Juan Carlos of Spain and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark.

Princess Irene studied at the University of Utrecht, then went to Madrid to learn the Spanish language and became proficient enough to become an official interpreter.

==Marriage controversy==

===Conversion to Catholicism===
While studying Spanish in Madrid, Irene met then Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma, the eldest son of Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne, Xavier, Duke of Parma and Head of the House of Bourbon-Parma. In the summer of 1963, Princess Irene secretly converted from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism. The first time the public or the royal family knew about the conversion was when a photograph appeared on the front page of an Amsterdam newspaper showing the Princess kneeling to receive communion at a Mass in the Roman Catholic Church of the Hieronymites (&quot;Los Jerónimos&quot;) in Madrid. Irene&#x27;s conversion took place a year before her engagement announcement, but the royal family did not officially announce the news until January 1964. When news leaked out that she was engaged to Prince Carlos Hugo (born 1930), it provoked a Protestant outcry and a constitutional crisis.

Although Dutch law did not forbid a Catholic to reign over the Netherlands, Protestant succession was traditional, born out of the 16th-century Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain and the assassination of William of Orange by a supporter of Philip II of Spain who believed William had betrayed both the Spanish monarch and the Catholic Church. By the middle of the 20th century religious attitudes had begun to change, but only very slowly. While members of the Roman Catholic Church accounted for approximately 34 percent of the Dutch population, and Catholic political parties had been in coalition governments since 1918, the high fertility rate of the Catholics was a matter of some concern for all non-Catholics.

Fresh memories of Francisco Franco&#x27;s association with fascism amplified the crisis over a royal conversion to Catholicism and a marriage without approval of the Dutch States-General. For the second in line to the throne to not only convert to Roman Catholicism, but to also associate with an alleged Franco sympathizer, caused shock and consternation in the Netherlands. When Princess Irene left the Netherlands to join Prince Carlos in Paris after the announcement of their engagement, a threat was telephoned to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines by an anonymous caller saying, &quot;you should investigate the plane&quot;. The telephone call was construed to be a bomb threat and the airliner was searched, causing more than an hour&#x27;s delay for the flight. It was the first instance of any threat involving the royal family and their air travel.

Queen Juliana attempted to stop the marriage, first by sending a member of her staff to Madrid to persuade the Princess not to go ahead with a marriage that would be a political disaster for the monarchy in the Netherlands. It seemed to work and the Queen went on Dutch radio to tell the citizens that Princess Irene had agreed to cancel her engagement and was returning to the Netherlands. When the airplane arrived at Schiphol Airport, the Princess was not on it, and Queen Juliana and her husband, Prince Bernhard were supplied with a Dutch military plane to go to Spain to retrieve their daughter. However, a message was delivered to the Queen from the Dutch government warning that it would resign &quot;en masse&quot; if she set foot in Spain. It was suggested that Princess Irene was a pawn of General Francisco Franco who tried to maximize the event to his benefit.

Given the ramifications and the fact that a monarch from the House of Orange had never visited Spain, the Queen had no choice but to turn back. Prince Bernhard then traveled to Madrid to meet with his daughter and her fiancé, who both accompanied him back to the Netherlands, where an immediate meeting took place with the couple, the Queen, Prime Minister Marijnen, himself a Roman Catholic, and three top cabinet ministers. When the meeting ended in the early hours of the morning on Sunday, 9 February 1964, Dutch radio broke its traditional Sabbath day silence to announce that Princess Irene would give up any rights of succession to the throne so she could marry Carlos Hugo. The princess further stated that she did not want the government to create a bill which would grant official consent to her marriage. In an attempt to gain public favour for her proposed marriage, Princess Irene publicly stated that her marriage was intended to help end religious intolerance. This caused a division in public opinion, as less than 40 percent of the country ruled by the Protestant House of Orange was Roman Catholic. Over the ensuing weeks, things deteriorated further when Pope Paul VI granted an audience requested by the couple in Rome. The Vatican believed the meeting was being held with the consent of the Dutch royal family. The Queen at first denied such a meeting had taken place, but it was later verified. Because the constitution prohibits members of the royal family from any involvement in foreign politics, Irene alienated herself from almost every Dutch citizen when a photo appeared in a Dutch paper showing her at a Carlist rally in Spain and she declared that she supported her fiancé&#x27;s political goals. The Dutch government officially announced that it had no responsibility for either the words or actions of Princess Irene in the future on 10 April 1964. It was done in response to Irene&#x27;s declaration of joining Carlos Hugo&#x27;s political campaign to regain the throne of Spain on 8 April 1964.

===Marriage===

No one from the Dutch royal family or any Dutch diplomatic representative attended the marriage of Princess Irene and Prince Carlos Hugo in the Borghese Chapel at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, Italy, on 29 April 1964. There were also no representatives of Spain&#x27;s Franco government at the ceremony; the couple chose Rome as the site of their nuptials because of its neutrality.

Dutch television provided coverage of the marriage and Irene&#x27;s family was among those who watched the ceremonies, although fate conspired in the form of a power failure which made them unable to see the last part of the rite. The Dutch royal family gathered at the home of Prince Bernhard&#x27;s mother, Armgard of Sierstorpff-Cramm, for the television coverage. Princess Armgard had also converted to Roman Catholicism like her granddaughter, but decided against attending the wedding. Irene and her mother spoke on the telephone before she left for the Basilica. Governmental fears that attendance at the wedding by the Dutch royal family might be construed as approval of Spanish politics made it impossible for the family to do anything else. The Dutch government had also vetoed the possibility of the wedding being held in the Netherlands. While it is said that Pope Paul VI had been asked to officiate at the wedding and declined, he did send the couple his special blessing before the ceremony. He received the newlyweds at a private Vatican audience after their wedding. Because she had failed to obtain the approval of the States-General to marry, Irene lost her right of succession to the Dutch throne. She agreed that she would live outside of the Netherlands.

In 1968, Princess Irene was libeled by the West German &quot;rainbow press&quot;. The publications operated similarly to movie and television gossip magazines, with the exception being that instead of stories about film or television stars, the rainbow press wrote about royalty and their supposed secret lives. One of the publications printed a story that Irene had undergone an abortion with parental consent before she was married. Irene&#x27;s father, Prince Bernhard, took the paper to court to clear his daughter&#x27;s name. The court found in favor of father and daughter, ordering the newspaper to pay them both damages and to print a public apology.

After the wedding, Irene was very active in her husband&#x27;s right-wing political cause, but over time they drifted away from right-wing extremism to left-wing sympathies and became a part of the international jet-set crowd. On 9 May 1977 Irene was expelled from Spain on the day after the death in Switzerland of her father-in-law, the Carlist claimant Xavier, Duke of Parma. Her husband Carlos Hugo, now the new Duke of Parma, Head of the House and Carlist claimant to the throne and an opponent of King Juan Carlos I, was also barred from the country for the same reason. Prince Carlos Hugo was allowed to return in late 1977, but Princess Irene was not permitted back in the country until April 1978. The prince, head of the Royal House of Bourbon-Parma, became a naturalized Spanish citizen in 1979. The couple had four children, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1981.

Having been married to the Duke of Parma, she is the only one of her sisters whose husband was of royal status. Her youngest sister, Princess Christina, later waived her rights to the throne when she married Jorge Guillermo, a United States citizen born in Cuba and a Roman Catholic.

==Since divorce==
In 1980, Irene and her children returned to live in the Netherlands, initially moving back into Soestdijk Palace. She became involved in various personal development workshops. By 1981, she and her children had moved to their own home across the street from the palace, where Irene did traditional household chores like grocery shopping. In 1983 and 1985, she publicly spoke out against the additional deployment of NATO missiles at a large anti-nuclear rally in The Hague and with a letter to the newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;. Her connection with nature, that she says she had felt since childhood, intensified, and in 1995 she published her book &quot;Dialogue with Nature&quot;. The book outlined her philosophy that human beings are alienated from the natural world, but the Dutch media seized upon passages that recounted conversations she said she had with the trees and dolphins.

In 1999 Princess Irene purchased a farm near Nieu-Bethesda in South Africa, turning it into a sanctuary. In 2001, she helped establish the NatuurCollege in the Netherlands. She is also the founder of NatureWise, an organization that brings elementary school children in the Netherlands directly in touch with nature. The Princess is an honorary member of the Club of Budapest.

==Children==
Carlos Hugo and Princess Irene had four children:

<doc id="113135" wikidata="Q5365539" url="?curid=113135" title="Elliot N. Dorff">
<text>Elliot N. Dorff (born 24 June 1943) is an American Conservative rabbi. He is a visiting professor of law at UCLA School of Law and Distinguished Professor of Jewish theology at the American Jewish University (formerly the University of Judaism) in California (where he is also rector), author and a bio-ethicist.

Dorff is an expert in the philosophy of Conservative Judaism, bioethics, and acknowledged within the Conservative community as an expert decisor of Jewish law. Dorff was ordained as a rabbi from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1970. He earned his BA and PhD in philosophy from Columbia University in 1971. He has been awarded four honorary doctoral degrees—from the Jewish Theological Seminary, Gratz College, Hebrew Union College, and American Jewish University—and he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the &quot;Journal of Law and Religion.&quot;

Dorff is the chairman of the Rabbinical Assembly&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, and has written many responsa on various aspects of Jewish law and philosophy.

==Philosophy of religion==
Among other topics, Dorff is interested in Jewish philosophy, especially epistemology. As a philosopher, Dorff asks about the difference between belief and knowledge. Given the philosophical definition that knowledge differs from belief (knowledge is often defined as a &quot;justified, true belief&quot;), Dorff&#x27;s works explicitly analyze epistemological questions. His philosophy of religion, as illustrated especially in his book &quot;Knowing God: Jewish Journeys to the Unknowable&quot;, stems from the analytic tradition in philosophy, with careful attention to the grounds of justified belief. He claims, however, that the Jewish tradition did not base its belief in God primarily on intellectual activity because Judaism is theistic, believing in a personal God: just as we do not come to know people through creating proofs of their existence, so too that has not been the primary way in which Jews have come to know God. Instead, he writes, to know people we talk with them and do things with them, and the same is true for how we come to know God: We talk to God through prayer; God talks to us through revelation; we do things with God through following God&#x27;s commandments; and God does things with us by acting in history. In &quot;Knowing God&quot; there is a chapter on each of those aspects of the interaction that Dorff says gives us knowledge of God.

In his book &quot;Conservative Judaism: Our Ancestors to Our Descendants&quot;, Dorff creates and then explains a chart of various views of revelation and Jewish law, including the mainstream Orthodox approach, four Conservative approaches, and the Reform approach. In it he describes himself as &quot;Conservative III,&quot; according to which revelation holds no content in of itself; rather, God inspired people with His presence by coming into contact with them. In this view the Bible is a human response to our ancestors&#x27; encounters with God, and revelation continues each time we study and reinterpret Jewish classical texts.

==Bioethics==
In the spring of 1993, Dorff served on the ethics committee of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Health Care Task Force for her 1993 health care plan, and in March 1997 and May 1999, he, along with other rabbis, testified on behalf of the Jewish tradition on the subjects of human cloning and stem cell research before President Bill Clinton&#x27;s National Bioethics Advisory Commission. In 1999–2000, he served on the U.S. Surgeon General&#x27;s Task Force to create a Call to Action for responsible sexual behavior to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and between 2000 and 2002 he served on the National Human Resources Protections Advisory Commission, charged with reviewing and revising the federal guidelines on research on human beings. He is now on the California Ethics Advisory Commission for embryonic stem cell research done within the state and his perspective has been sought on this topic at a national level.

Dorff is a fellow of the Hastings Center, a research institution that studies issues in bioethics. His book on Jewish medical ethics is &quot;Matters of Life and Death: A Jewish Approach to Modern Medical Ethics&quot;.

==Other areas of ethics==
Dorff has co-edited two anthologies with religion professor Louis E. Newman, formerly of
Carleton College and now of Stanford University—namely, &quot;Contemporary Jewish Ethics and Morality: A Reader&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Jewish Theology: A Reader&quot;, both published by Oxford University Press. In addition, he has written books on social ethics &quot;To Do the Right and the Good&quot;, and &quot;The Way into Tikkun Olam: (Repairing the World)&quot; and personal ethics &quot;Love Your Neighbor and Yourself&quot;. His books on social ethics include chapters on interfaith relations, pluralism within the Jewish community, poverty, justice, war, and communal forgiveness. His book on personal ethics includes chapters on privacy, sexual ethics, family violence, how we talk to and about each other, parents and children, and hope. He has also co-edited with Emory University Professor Jonathan Crane &quot;The Oxford Handbook on Jewish Ethics and Morality&quot;.

In addition to these chapters on specific areas of ethics, Dorff has written extensively on issues in ethical theory—in particular, the relationships between religion and ethics and between Jewish law and ethics.

==Jewish law==
Dorff has written about the theory of Jewish law and has also written rabbinic rulings (teshuvot) on a number of issues in Jewish law. In his book &quot;The Unfolding Tradition&quot;, he describes and analyzes fifteen theories of Jewish law within the Conservative Movement with comparisons to theories on the right in Orthodoxy and on the left in Reform Judaism and yet further left. He articulates his own theory of Jewish law as a living, organic system in his book &quot;For the Love of God and People: A Philosophy of Jewish Law&quot;. In addition to describing how he understands Jewish law as being like a human being with a body (=the body of Jewish law, the corpus juris) and soul (=the Covenant between God and the Jewish People), he has specific chapters on the interaction between Jewish law and morality, theology, and custom, followed by some comparisons to the right and left of his approach and some specific examples of his own rabbinic rulings that illustrate his theory.

==Communal activities==
In Los Angeles, Dorff is a member of the &quot;Board of Jewish Family Service&quot; and has served as its president (2004–2006). From 2008 to 2016 he was a member of the Board of the Los Angeles Jewish Federation Council, co-chairing its task force on Serving the Vulnerable. Since the 1980s he has been a member of the Ethics Committees of UCLA Medical Center and the Jewish Homes for the Aging. He is co-chairman of the &quot;Priest-Rabbi Dialogue&quot; sponsored by the Los Angeles Archdiocese and the Board of Rabbis of Southern California, and he is the former Treasurer and President and current board member of the Academy of Judaic, Christian, and Islamic Studies. He has been Secretary of the Board of the Faithtrust Institute, dedicated to stopping violence against women and children. He is a past president of three academic societies: The Jewish Law Association, The Jewish Philosophical Association, and the Society for Jewish Ethics and Honorary President of the Jewish Law Association between 2012 and 2016.

==Scholarship==
Dorff has published fourteen books and over 200 articles on Jewish thought, law, and ethics, and he has edited or co-edited another fourteen books on those topics. His books relevant to Jewish law include: &quot;A Living Tree: The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law&quot; (with Arthur Rosett), &quot;The Unfolding Tradition: Philosophies of Jewish Law&quot;, and &quot;For the Love of God and People: A Philosophy of Jewish Law&quot;. In addition he has written about 20 rabbinic rulings for the Conservative Movement&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards on such subjects as &quot;Donations of Ill-Gotten Gain,&quot; &quot;Violent and Defamatory Video Games,&quot; and “Providing References for Schools or Jobs,” as well as many topics in medical ethics.&lt;https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards&gt;

==Responsa==
On December 6, 2006, the law committee accepted a paper by Rabbis Elliot Dorff, Daniel Nevins and Avram Reisner on same-sex marriage and ordination of homosexual rabbis, while it upheld the biblical prohibition on male intercourse.
In addition, Dorff has written responsa adopted by the Conservative Movement&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards on these and other topics: end-of-life medical issues; artificial insemination, egg donation, and adoption; assisted suicide; donations of ill-gotten gain; and violent or defamatory video games.

<doc id="113136" wikidata="Q1807212" url="?curid=113136" title="Scrollbar">
<text>A scrollbar is an interaction technique or widget in which continuous text, pictures, or any other content can be scrolled in a predetermined direction (up, down, left, or right) on a computer display, window, or viewport so that all of the content can be viewed, even if only a fraction of the content can be seen on a device&#x27;s screen at one time. It offers a solution to the problem of navigation to a known or unknown location within a two-dimensional information space. It was also known as a handle in the very first GUIs. They are present in a wide range of electronic devices including computers, graphing calculators, mobile phones, and portable media players. The user interacts with the scrollbar elements using some method of direct action, the scrollbar translates that action into scrolling commands, and the user receives feedback through a visual updating of both the scrollbar elements and the scrolled content.

Although scrollbar designs differ throughout their history, they usually appear on one or two sides of the viewing area as long rectangular areas containing a bar (or thumb) that can be dragged along a trough (or track) to move the body of the document. This can be placed vertically, horizontally, or both in the window depending on which direction the content extends past its boundaries. Two arrows are often included on either end of the thumb or trough for more precise adjustments. The &quot;thumb&quot; has different names in different environments: on the Mac OS X 10.4 it is called a &quot;scroller&quot;; on the Java platform it is called &quot;thumb&quot; or &quot;knob&quot;; Microsoft&#x27;s .NET documentation refers to it as &quot;scroll box&quot; or &quot;scroll thumb&quot;; in other environments it is called &quot;elevator&quot;, &quot;quint&quot;, &quot;puck&quot;, &quot;wiper&quot; or &quot;grip&quot;; in certain environments where browsers use agnostic language to the scrollbar terminology, the thumb is referred to as the &#x27;pea&#x27; for vertical movement of the bar and still use &#x27;puck&#x27; for horizontal movement.

Additional functions may be found, such as zooming in/out or various application-specific tools. Depending on the GUI, the size of the thumb can be fixed or variable in size; in the later case of proportional thumbs, its length would indicate the size of the window in relation to the size of the whole document, indicated by the full track. While proportional thumbs were available in several GUIs, including GEM, AmigaOS and PC/GEOS, even in the mid 1980s, Microsoft did not implement them until Windows 95. A proportional thumb that completely fills the trough indicates that the entire document is being viewed, at which point the scrollbar may temporarily become hidden. The proportional thumb can also sometimes be adjusted by dragging its ends, such as in Sony Vegas, a non-linear video editing software package. In this case it would adjust both the position and the zooming of the document, where the size of the thumb represents the degree of zooming applied.
A scrollbar should be distinguished from a &quot;slider&quot; which is another visually similar yet functionally different object. The slider is used to change values, but does not change the display or move the area that is shown as a scrollbar does.

== History and progression ==

In 1974, moving the cursor to the left margin while using Bravo changed its shape to a double-headed arrow to allow for scrolling. Pressing the left or top red button scrolled the content up, and the line next to the cursor went to the top of the window. Pressing the right or bottom blue button scrolled the content down, and the line at the top of the window went down to the cursor. Holding down the middle yellow button changed the cursor to a thumb, allowing for jumping to that percentage of the document with an indicator of current placement.

In 1977, Smalltalk included a stable scrollbar on the left side of the focus window. Clicking at the right half of the scrollbar moved the content up, and the left half moved the content down. The center thumb of the bar could be dragged smoothly and showed the percentage of the content visible; the first proportional scroll bar.

In 1980, Interlisp had a scrollbar that appeared on the left side of the window as the cursor moved towards the left. The bar&#x27;s shaded thumb showed the percentage of content visible and was controlled by the middle button. The left button scrolled up to move the selected position to the top edge of the window, and the right button scrolled down to move the top edge of the window to the selected position.

Between 1981 and 1982, the Xerox Star moved the scrollbar to the right to get it out of the way and reduce visual clutter. Scroll arrows pointed inwards in the direction the content would move based on user studies, and + and – buttons allowed for scrolling by pages. The thumb was a fixed size diamond, independent of how much of document is visible. Clicking in the thumb elevator region would jump to that part of document.

In 1983, the Apple Lisa had arrows pointing up and down, page buttons, and a fixed size thumb.

In 1984, the Macintosh had a light gray rectangle with a &quot;scroll box&quot; thumb, &quot;gray area&quot; track, and arrows pointing in opposite directions towards the content that would be exposed when the respective arrow was pressed. Arrows would scroll a single unit upon one click or auto repeat upon continuous press. Page buttons were removed, and the elevator track could be clicked in instead to move to the next section. Upon pressing the thumb, dragging it would bring it to that particular point unless movement was made far out of the scrollbar before release, aborting the action. An empty scrollbar was displayed when a window was not in focus or if the entire document was visible within the window.

In 1985, GEM used a proportionally-sized &quot;scroll box&quot; thumb, but otherwise operated identically to the Macintosh. The net result was a modern scrollbar that looked and felt no different from the scrollbar in Windows today. GEM allowed the mouse to be moved far away from the scrollbar after clicking and holding, to reduce hand-eye coordination problems. AmigaOS followed later in the year, also with proportionally-sized scroll boxes.

Also in 1985, Viewpoint used the right button to move content by percent or by window rather than by page.

In 1988, Open Look created an elevator thumb with arrow keys directly on it. Clicking on the track moved by pages, and auto repeat would push the pointer along. Cable anchors were placed at the beginning and end of the document, and the center of the elevator could be dragged.

In 1989, NeXT moved the scrollbar back to the left side of the window. The thumb was proportionally sized with arrows together at the bottom of the bar. Actions auto repeated, and the alt-key would move content by window. The thumb could be dragged, and using the alt-key while dragging would slow its movement.

In 1997, the PalmPilot included a conventional scrollbar where text extended past screen boundaries with use of both a draggable thumb and arrows that could be tapped with a stylus. It also had two physical buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down respectively.

In 2001, Mac OS X 10.0 used a proportional thumb and moved both arrow buttons to the bottom of the bar.

In 2007, the iPhone and iOS included a regular scrollbar in the web browser and other applications, though it was only for output and could not be interacted with. In contacts, a scrollbar of letters was provided to jump through content.

In 2011, Mac OS X 10.7 removed the buttons from the end of the bar and was designed to look more like the iOS scrollbar. With the same release of Mac OS X 10.7, Apple introduced &quot;natural scrolling,&quot; which means that the screen moves in the same direction as the user&#x27;s fingers are moving when they use the two finger scroll gesture. If the user&#x27;s fingers move up the trackpad, the content on the page goes up, allowing the user to read content further down the page, and vice versa.

In the 2015 version of Microsoft Word for Macs, disappearing scrollbars were introduced. The placement within a document was no longer visible when the mouse was outside the bar area even if the window in question was in focus. The purpose of this change was to conform to Macs’ standard design practices of hiding the scrollbar when it is not immediately needed for information hierarchical purposes.

== Usage ==

=== Thumb dragging ===
Dragging the thumb is historically the traditional way of manipulating a scrollbar. By moving the cursor over to the thumb on the screen and then pressing and holding, the thumb can be dragged. This is often done using either a trackpad or the left click button on a conventional mouse or touchpad. Moving the cursor while pressing down moves the scrollbar&#x27;s thumb to see different sections of the page. On applications native to OS X 10.11 (and some previous OS X versions), scrollbars do not show up on the user interface until the user uses another scrolling technique, such as the two-finger scroll or using the arrow keys. Therefore, the user must scroll using one of these methods first, and then move their cursor over to the thumb, wherever it appears.

On Microsoft Windows, moving the mouse away too far from the thumb while dragging it will reset the scrolling position to prior.

=== Scroll wheel ===
A scroll wheel on a conventional mouse may also be used. Moving the wheel in a desired direction moves the content in the same direction. Most mice contain scroll wheels that only scroll up and down, but some mice contain scroll wheels that allow the user to scroll in any direction (up, down, left or right), including diagonal directions. While scrolling up and down, the direction in which the page scrolls in response to the direction that the user scrolls the scroll wheel can differ depending on the computer&#x27;s scrolling settings.

=== Arrow keys ===
The arrow buttons on the keyboard may be clicked to scroll up, down, left, or right on a page. This scrolling technique usually results in the screen scrolling very slowly in comparison to the other scrolling techniques. Clicking the arrow buttons would result in the page continuing to scroll until one of the scroll limits has been reached.

=== Clicking the trough ===
The trough above or below the thumb can be clicked in order to immediately jump to that point on the page, or page-by-page for multipage content. After clicking the trough, scrolling automatically begins and then stop once the thumb has reached the position of the mouse pointer. This scrolling technique is faster than others and is best used when the user has to scroll through a lot of content at once, or when the user knows where exactly on a page they need to scroll to.

=== On-screen arrow buttons ===
Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, contain scrollbars with on screen directional arrows for purposes of scrolling. Clicking on the arrows scrolls a small amount of the content, often single lines, at a time, and pressing and holding on them with the cursor continuously scrolls over more area on the page until released.
Sometimes, both arrow buttons appear next to each other for quick, precise manipulation without having to drag the thumb or move the mouse great distances to the other arrow (this was offered as an option in Mac OS 8.5); one of them may also be duplicated so as to show at both ends of the bar, providing familiarity for those used to both separate and adjacent buttons. These arrow buttons existed until Mac OS X 10.7 where they were dropped in favor of trackpad gestures and scroll-wheel mice.

In BeOS, the on-screen scrolling buttons for both directions appear on both ends of the scroll bar. In several Microsoft Office programs, the additional buttons and can be used for per-page navigation.

=== Different mouse buttons ===
Another scrolling technique with scrollbars is to look at which mouse button was pressed. For instance, a left-click on the down arrow might cause the window to scroll down, while a right click in the same place would scroll up (e.g. RISC OS), or the middle button could be used to place the thumb precisely. This form requires less fine motor skills, although it requires a multi-button mouse, and possibly a greater degree of GUI literacy.

=== Windows touchpad ===
Additionally, some Windows-enabled machines have a scrolling mechanism on the side of their touchpad, as shown in the picture. To use this mechanism, a finger is placed on the scroll area and moved up and down or left and right in order to scroll around the page. Again, depending on the computer&#x27;s scrolling settings, moving the finger in certain directions along these scrolling areas could result in different corresponding scrolling directions.

=== Mac trackpad ===
A more modern scrolling technique is using the two-finger scroll on a Mac trackpad. In this technique, the tips of two fingers from the same hand are placed on the surface of the trackpad and moved accordingly. If the user has their trackpad scrolling direction set to &quot;natural,&quot; moving their two fingers toward the top of the trackpad will cause the page to scroll up towards the top of the page; conversely, moving their fingers toward the bottom of the trackpad will cause the page to scroll down towards the bottom. If the user &quot;flicks&quot; their fingers by moving their two fingers very quickly across the trackpad and then releasing their fingers, the page will continue to scroll in the direction in which they flicked until it eventually slows down and stops, either because one of the scroll limits is reached or because the scroll speed slows down so much that it eventually simply stops. This feature is called inertia.

== Alternative designs ==
Many variations on the traditional scrollbar design and usage have been proposed or implemented. To avoid limiting window visibility with scrollbars while still allowing for functionality, the use of a software tether (thin line) associated with movement of the mouse pointer around the tether has been proposed. Similarly, the scrollbar can be directly placed within the content where it is useful, both decreasing space used and reducing required pointer movements.

The inclusion of visual and operational clues within the scrollbar display area can indicate which directions allow for scrolling movement as well as which interactions with the scrollbar are available. This can be a blank field to signal a list&#x27;s end, disabling of scrolling buttons, and color changes in the scrollbar.

Some scrollbars include a visual position indicator to help determine where the scrolling action has gone or will go to in the content. For multipage content, an indicator of the current page number vs the total page number can be included next to the thumb as scrolling occurs, and wider scrollbars can include an overview of the entire page. In scrollbars like those used in phone contact lists made up of the letters of the alphabet, the letter corresponding to the current area can be displayed larger or highlighted in some way. While these are stable and provided by the application, some applications and search engines allow for the use of relevance markers provided or added by the user. These can be strictly visual or can automatically stop action within the scrollbar once each marker is reached. These can be emphasized with color or even sound to further assist the user in finding what they need within the content.

== Simultaneous 2D-scrolling ==
Special scroll-bar like graphical control elements allow panning around a two-dimensional space by simply moving a single rectangle in any direction on the plane. For example, the GtkScrollpane from GTK+ is implemented in the text viewers gv and ghostview.

Another example for simultaneous two-dimensional scrolling is an alignment program for protein sequences. Initially, the horizontal scroll-bar looks like a conventional one. But then the scroll-bar offers three additional features:
# It provides an overview of the entire scene.
# The height can be enlarged.
# The knob can not only be moved left and right but also up and down for vertical scrolling.

In RISC OS dragging a scrollbar with the left mouse button operates in the usual way, but dragging with the right button causes the pointer to disappear and both scrollbars to be manipulated simultaneously. Many GUI operations in RISC OS perform a related but slightly different function when right clicked.

== Customization ==
The ability and specific methods needed to customize the look and function of scrollbars can vary significantly based on which operating system or software application you are attempting to customize. A common method of altering the look of the scrollbar in Web pages is to use CSS directives to change the scrollbar colors. These are non-standard and supported only by Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.x or higher and Opera. And in WebKit-based browsers, there are pseudo-elements called:
*codice_1
*codice_2
*codice_3
*codice_4
*codice_5
*codice_6
*and codice_7
WebKit also provides many pseudo-classes to modify the style of scrollbars.

Scrollbars have also been enhanced to encode information about list entries. For example, Google Chrome introduces trough marks in the vertical scrollbar to indicate places in the document where a particular search term was found.

== Limitations and issues ==
Computer literate users are often familiar with scrollbars, but those with limited knowledge may not intuitively understand them, especially given more recent variations, without assistance. Regardless of literacy, multiple issues can be found across various types of scrollbars and their interactions.
In terms of design, if the window size is already small, the visible content area will be further reduced by the presence of a scrollbar. While some more recent disappearing scrollbars help mitigate this problem, more traditional ones do not avoid it, especially when there are both horizontal and vertical bars present.

In terms of use, many common issues have to do with accuracy. Mapping between the scrollbar and display is linear, so accuracy of use is relative to the size of the content. Navigation through a smaller document is then simpler than navigation through a larger document. This also means that all portions of a document are emphasized equally, and importance of each portion is not recognized by use of the scrollbar.

There is not often an indication of where in the content a scroll has reached unless the scrolling action is stopped to view the content. This makes it difficult regardless of whether or not the user knows what they are looking for or the general organization of the content. Those that do have an indicator are limited by the predetermined settings in visibility, amount, and style.
If attempting to scroll while performing an action such as highlighting, the scroll amount may not correspond to the desired amount, overshooting or prompting the user to reposition multiple times. Overshooting can also occur when attempting to position near the top or the bottom of a single page within a larger set. An attempted small scroll adjustment by the user may result in a larger one as the scrolling activates an automatic action jumping to the next page.

== Studies ==
A 1986 report by William Buxton and Brad Myers tested different two-handed interactions, including scrolling, clicking, and resizing. In their study, clicking and resizing were done in parallel. Their first experiment called for participants to perform a selection/positioning task, and their second experiment requested that participants do a compound navigation/selection task. The study found that users can perform these tasks faster and in parallel when they use both hands, but not necessarily when they use both hands simultaneously. They also found that the more related the tasks were that they user was doing with each of their hands, the faster they performed the tasks they were asked to do.
