<doc id="108167" wikidata="Q208459" url="?curid=108167" title="Sunnyvale, California">
<text>Sunnyvale () is a city located in the Santa Clara Valley in northwest Santa Clara County in the U.S. state of California.

Sunnyvale lies along the historic El Camino Real and Highway 101 and is bordered by portions of San Jose to the north, Moffett Federal Airfield and NASA Ames Research Center to the northwest, Mountain View to the northwest, Los Altos to the southwest, Cupertino to the south, and Santa Clara to the east.

Sunnyvale&#x27;s population was 155,805 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous city in the county (after San Jose) the seventh most populous city in the San Francisco Bay Area, 36th in California, and 176th in the US.

As one of the major cities that make up California&#x27;s high-tech area known as Silicon Valley, Sunnyvale is the birthplace of the video game industry, former location of Atari headquarters. Many technology companies are headquartered in Sunnyvale and many more operate there, including several aerospace/defense companies.

Sunnyvale was also the home to Onizuka Air Force Station, often referred to as &quot;the Blue Cube&quot; because of the color and shape of its windowless main building. The facility, previously known as Sunnyvale Air Force Station, was named for the deceased Space Shuttle Challenger astronaut Ellison Onizuka. It served as an artificial satellite control facility of the U.S. military until August 2010 and has since been decommissioned and demolished.

Sunnyvale is one of the few municipalities in California to have a single unified Department of Public Safety, where all personnel are trained as firefighters, police officers, and EMTs, so that they can respond to an emergency in any of the three roles.

==History==
The Santa Clara Valley was heavily populated by the indigenous Ohlone people when the Spanish first arrived in the 1770s. However, following the arrival of the Spaniards, smallpox, measles, and other Old World diseases greatly reduced the Ohlone population. While some of the Ohlone Native Americans died from diseases, others survived and were converted to Christian faith by the Spanish. In 1777, Mission Santa Clara was founded by Franciscan missionary Padre Junipero Serra and was originally located in San Jose (near what is now the San Jose International Airport runway).

===1800s===
In 1843, Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas was granted to Francisco Estrada and his wife Inez Castro. Portions of the land given in this grant later developed into the cities of Mountain View and Sunnyvale. Two years later, in 1844, another land grant was provided to Lupe Yñigo, one of the few Native Americans to hold land grants. His land grant was first called Rancho Posolmi, named in honor of a village of the Ohlone that once stood in the area.

Martin Murphy Jr. came to California with his father as part of the Stephens–Townsend–Murphy Party in 1844. In 1850, Martin Murphy Jr. bought a piece of Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas for $12,500. Murphy established a wheat farm and ranch named Bay View. Murphy had the first wood-frame house in Santa Clara County; it was shipped from New England. The house was demolished in 1961 but was reconstructed in 2008 as the Sunnyvale Heritage Park Museum. When he died in 1884, his land was divided among his heirs.

In 1861, The San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road was allowed to lay tracks on Bay View and established Murphy&#x27;s Station. Lawrence&#x27;s Station was later established on the southern edge of Bay View.

In the 1870s, small fruit orchards replaced many large wheat farms, because wheat farming turned uneconomical due to county and property tax laws, imports and soil degradation. In 1871, Dr. James M. Dawson and his wife Eloise (née Jones) established the first commercial fruit cannery in the county. Fruit agriculture for canning soon became a major industry in the county. The invention of the refrigerated rail car further increased the viability of an economy based upon fruit. The fruit orchards became so prevalent that in 1886, the San Jose Board of Trade called Santa Clara County the &quot;Garden of the World&quot;.

In the 1880s, Chinese workers made up roughly one third of the farm labor in Santa Clara County. This percentage reduced over time after the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed. In the following decade, the 1890s, many immigrants from Italy, the Azores, Portugal, and Japan arrived to work in the orchards.

In 1897, Walter Everett Crossman bought and began selling real estate. He advertised the area as &quot;Beautiful Murphy&quot; and later, in the 1900s, as &quot;the City of Destiny&quot;. Also in 1897, Encinal School opened as the first school in Murphy. Previously, children in the town had to travel to Mountain View for school. The area also became known as Encinal.

===1900s===
In 1901, the residents of Murphy were informed they could not use the names Encinal or Murphy for their post office. Sunnyvale was given its current name on March 24, 1901. It was named Sunnyvale as it is located in a sunny region adjacent to areas with significantly more fog.

Sunnyvale continued to grow and in 1904, dried fruit production began. Two years later, Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, a Chicago meat-packing company, decided to open its first fruit-packing factory in Sunnyvale. Today, a water tower painted to resemble the first Libby&#x27;s fruit cocktail can label identifies the former site of the factory.

Also in 1906, the Joshua Hendy Iron Works relocated from San Francisco to Sunnyvale after the company&#x27;s building was destroyed by fire after the 1906 earthquake. The ironworks was the first non-agricultural industry in the town. The company later switched from producing mining equipment to other products such as marine steam engines.

In 1912, the residents of Sunnyvale voted to incorporate, and Sunnyvale became an official city.

Fremont High School first opened in 1923. The year 2023 marked the school&#x27;s 100 year anniversary.

In 1924, Edwina Benner was elected to her first term as mayor of Sunnyvale. She was the second female mayor in the history of the state of California.

In 1930, Congress decided to place the West Coast dirigible base in Sunnyvale after &quot;buying&quot; the parcel of farmland bordering the San Francisco Bay from the city for $1.

This naval airfield was later renamed Naval Air Station Moffett and then Moffett Federal Airfield and is commonly called Moffett Field.

In 1939, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the forerunner of NASA) began research at Ames Laboratory.

During World War II, the war economy began a change from the fruit industry to the high-tech industry in Santa Clara County. The Joshua Hendy Iron Works built marine steam engines, naval guns and rocket launchers to aid in the war effort. As the defense industry grew, a shortage of workers in the farm industry was created. Immigrants from Mexico came to Sunnyvale to fill this void of workers.

Following the war, the fruit orchards and sweetcorn farms were cleared to build homes, factories and offices.

In 1950, the volunteer fire department and the paid police department were combined into the department of public safety.

In 1956, the aircraft manufacturer Lockheed moved its headquarters to Sunnyvale.

Since then, numerous high-tech companies have established offices and headquarters in Sunnyvale, including Advanced Micro Devices and Yahoo.

The first prototype of Atari&#x27;s coin-operated &quot;Pong&quot;, the first successful video game, was installed in Sunnyvale in August 1972, in a bar named Andy Capp&#x27;s Tavern, now Rooster T. Feathers. Atari&#x27;s headquarters were located at 1196 Borregas Avenue in north Sunnyvale.

By 2002, the few remaining orchards had been replaced with homes and shops. However, there are still city-owned orchards, such as the Heritage Orchard next to the Sunnyvale Community Center.

In 1979, an indoor mall called Sunnyvale Town Center opened in what used to be a traditional downtown shopping district. After years of successful operation, the mall started to decline in the 1990s. After numerous changes in plans and ownership, the mall was demolished in 2007.

===2000s===
Sunnyvale celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary on August 25, 2012.

According to the Bay Area Census, there was a total population of 130,885 people in households and 875 people in group quarters in 2000. In 2023, the city has a population of 145,302 residents; however, the city&#x27;s population is declining at a rate of −6.77% since the 2020 census, which claimed that Sunnyvale had a population of 155,860 residents.

====Downtown development====

In November 2009, previously closed portions of the main streets in downtown Sunnyvale were reopened as part of the ongoing downtown redevelopment of the Sunnyvale Town Center mall, marking the first time in over three decades that those street blocks have been open to vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Part of the project involved building new apartment buildings, however during the Great Recession the property was repossessed by Wells Fargo in 2009; the developer countersued, leaving the project in legal limbo through 2015.

The two office buildings are now fully occupied by Uber. Mixed-use developments have been built at the former Town and Country location near the Plaza del Sol just north of Murphy Avenue. By mid 2015, new multistory apartment complexes had opened, including a number of ground-floor businesses, and the lawsuit against Wells Fargo was resolved in the bank&#x27;s favor. The development was sold to Sares Regis in late 2016. Redwood Square reopened as a park in 2017. Many apartments are occupied, and more are being completed in 2020. A Whole Foods Market and AMC Theatres multiplex opened in October 2020.

====Major businesses====
In the 2010s, Sunnyvale became home to operations from numerous major technology companies including Apple, LinkedIn (now headquartered in Sunnyvale), Google, Amazon, Meta, Walmart Labs, and 23andMe.

Google announced major development plans in the Moffett Park area in 2017 adjacent to Moffett Field, with these offices ultimately opening in 2022. In addition, Amazon and Meta began leasing buildings in Sunnyvale in 2017 and 2021, respectively.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (3.09%) is water. Its elevation is 130 feet above sea level.

===Climate===
Like most of the San Francisco Bay Area, Sunnyvale has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;), with cool, moist winters and warm, very dry summers.

<text>Aptos (Ohlone for &quot;The People&quot;) is an unincorporated town in Santa Cruz County, California, United States. The town is made up of several small villages, which together form Aptos: Aptos Hills-Larkin Valley, Aptos Village, Cabrillo, Seacliff, Rio del Mar, and Seascape. Together, they have a combined population of 24,402.

== History ==
Aptos was traditionally inhabited by the Awaswas tribe of Ohlone people. The name is one of only three native words that have survived (in Hispanicized form) as place names in Santa Cruz County (the others are Soquel and Zayante).

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping at one of the creeks on October 16, 1769. The expedition diaries don&#x27;t provide enough information to be sure which creek it was, but the direction of travel was northwest, parallel to the coast. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, &quot;We stopped on the bank of a small stream, which has about four varas of deep running water. It has on its banks a good growth of cottonwoods and alders; on account of the depth at which it runs it may be that it cannot be utilized to water some plains through which it runs.&quot; Crespi diary translator Herbert Bolton speculated that the location was Soquel Creek, but it could have been Aptos Creek.

In 1833 the government of Mexico granted Rafael Castro the Rancho Aptos. Initially Castro raised cattle for their hides, but after California became a state in 1850, Castro leased his land to Americans who built a wharf, general store, and lumber mill. The original town was located where Aptos Village Square is now. In 1853 a leather tannery was built, and the main building is a bed &amp; breakfast inn .

In 1875, Frederick A. Hihn and Claus Spreckels partnered to build the Santa Cruz Railroad, and routed it through Aptos where they both had development interests - Hihn with the Loma Prieta Lumber Company, and Spreckels with his Aptos Hotel resort. The railroad tracks ran directly adjacent to the Santa Cruz Watsonville road, whose route was originally established by the 1769 Spanish exploratory expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá.
In 1878 Augustia Castro, daughter of Rafael Castro, and her husband José Arano built the Victorian, Bayview Hotel in Aptos village. The hotel is a Santa Cruz County landmark. It is Santa Cruz county&#x27;s oldest operating hotel. It has been a State Historic Monument since 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1993. Since being originally built, the hotel was moved to its current location.

In the mid to late 1800s, a series of major epidemics hit the area. A particularly bad one occurred in the early winter of 1868. Cases of smallpox were reported among the poor of San Juan Bautista. Efforts were made to localize the rapidly spreading disease, such as, barricading the roads leading in and out of San Juan Bautista. These efforts failed however, and when cases appeared in Watsonville, Santa Cruz citizens attempted to again quarantine the disease by destroying the Aptos Bridge. These efforts again failed and only created a rift between the two cities. The death toll of the smallpox epidemic lead to the local press publishing of the latest remedies available for home use as well as methods to prevent the spread of smallpox and inoculations.

By 1872, Claus Spreckels, a sugar millionaire, began buying the land from Castro. He built a hotel near the beach and a summer mansion and ranch with a racetrack for his horses. A large area was fenced and stocked with deer for hunting, and became known as &quot;the Deer Park,&quot; home of today&#x27;s Deer Park Center.

From 1880 to 1920 redwood timber harvesting became the major industry, and Aptos became a boom town. The Loma Prieta Lumber Company logged all of what is now The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. The Valencia Mill logged everything to the east. Within 40 years the hills were bare, and apples became the next industry. The Hihn Apple Barn is a historic building from that era; in 2016-2017, the building had been relocated nearby to be used as a grocery store and make way for a shopping complex.

On March 16–20, 1905, the Leonard Ranch near La Selva was the site of experiments with a new tandem-wing glider designed and built by John J. Montgomery. Hoisted aloft by hot-air balloon to considerable heights, over a series of test flights pilot Daniel J. Maloney was able to demonstrate the control and flight of the Montgomery glider design. These flights, with starting altitudes over 3,000 feet above the ground, were the first high-altitude flights in the world. A marker was placed at this location in 2005 honoring the centennial of these accomplishments.

After Spreckels&#x27; death, Seacliff Park and Rio Del Mar Country Club (today&#x27;s Seacliff State Beach) were developed in the late 1920s. Rio Del Mar Country Club included a clubhouse, a grand hotel on the bluffs, a beach club, a polo field, and a golf course. The estuary was filled in (now Rio Beach Flats) and the SS &quot;Palo Alto&quot; cement ship was moored and converted into an amusement pier with restaurants, swimming pool, and a dance pavilion. Both Rio Del Mar and Seacliff were popular during Prohibition as drinking and gambling were discreetly available. These amusements were interrupted by the Great Depression and World War II.

In the early 1960s Aptos began a period of rapid development, including Cabrillo College, Rancho Del Mar Shopping Center, the Seascape Resort development, and many residential developments.

In 2020s, Microsoft named a new Windows font after this community.

<text>Ben Lomond is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, California, United States, and also the name of the mountain to the west. The CDP includes the communities of Glen Arbor and Brackney. The population was 6,337 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The nearby Ben Lomond Mountain was named after the mountain in Scotland by John Burns, a Scottish man who settled on the west side of the ridge in 1851. Burns became one of the first vintners in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and is usually also credited with naming the community of Bonny Doon. The San Lorenzo River watershed contains extensive forests of Coast redwood, and was an early center of the logging/lumber industry in Santa Cruz County. The community was originally known as Pacific Mills, after a sawmill operation located there. When, in 1887, the community applied for a U.S. Post Office, residents voted to adopt the name of the mountain.

Alba School, a one-room schoolhouse, was constructed in 1895 and was in use until 1940; it later served as a library and a community center. It was destroyed in the CZU Lightning Complex fires in August 2020.

==Geography==

<doc id="108173" wikidata="Q2195131" url="?curid=108173" title="Boulder Creek, California">
<text>Boulder Creek () is a small rural mountain community in the coastal Santa Cruz Mountains. It is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, California, with a population of 5,429 as of the 2020 census. Throughout its history, Boulder Creek has been home to a logging town and a resort community, as well as a counter-culture haven. Today, it is identified as the gateway to Big Basin Redwoods State Park.

==History==
The Boulder Creek area is in the traditional tribal territory of the Achistaca, an Awaswas-speaking people of the Ohlone cultural unit, who were a group of contiguous bands that inhabited the coastal region of present-day California from the San Francisco Bay to the Monterey Peninsula and down to San José and Salinas Valley.

There are no living survivors of the Achistaca, who are spoken for by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.

According to one anthropologist, the indigenous name for the area was &quot;Achista&quot; and tentatively included &quot;Acsaggi&quot;.

The earliest European presence in the area was a Spanish exploratory party in 1769, led overland from Mexico by Don Gaspar de Portolá and Father Juan Crespí. On August 28, 1791, a Spanish mission, Mission Santa Cruz, was established by the Franciscans from Mission Santa Clara de Asís for the conversion of the Awaswas. The Awaswas were moved to Mission Santa Cruz and Mission San Juan Bautista, which claimed the land and peoples. The Awaswas language and its dialects became the main language spoken at Mission Santa Cruz.

Upon independence from Spain in 1821, the area became a part of Mexico. Although Spain had not awarded land grants in the Santa Cruz area, the Mexican government started issuing them in 1822 when it took over the administration of California. Most of the grants lay along the coast, with the only ones within the San Lorenzo Valley being Rancho Zayante and Rancho San Agustin. Under Mexican administration, only natural citizens could own land. Although not a Mexican citizen, in 1841, Isaac Graham purchased the Rancho Zayante land grant by proxy from frontiersman and naturalized Mexican citizen Joseph Ladd Majors. In 1843, together with Peter Lassen, Graham built one of the first water-powered sawmills in California and, with it, the first significant settlement in the area. Graham&#x27;s settlement marked the beginning of San Lorenzo Valley&#x27;s lumber-based economy.

Following the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848 and the California Gold Rush of 1848, the area steadily grew in population, including considerable immigration. While the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the War obliged the United States to honor Mexican land grants, the process took many years of court hearings. In the meantime, squatters and entrepreneurs moved into the valley to harvest its rich resources of timber and lime. Despite the lack of roads, many families braved the wilderness to homestead the upper San Lorenzo. There were few large operations in the upper San Lorenzo Valley, leading the pioneers to develop their own systems of harvesting and transporting to the lumber and tanning markets. Logging in the valley supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the mines after the initial rush of gold-panning gave way to other mining techniques. By the late 1850s, early settlers and lumbermen were using the Turkey Foot floodplain as a gathering point for their mule and oxen teams.

===Timber town===
Branciford Alcorn was one of the first to settle along Bear Creek in 1865. Daniel Crediford and his sons Wilfred and Stephen moved about up Boulder Creek to the Sequoia district in 1867. West Virginian Joseph Wilbur Peery also settled in the Boulder area in 1867 and began a small-scale logging project along the San Lorenzo River. Peery built a dam across the river at Two Bar Creek to provide water power to his mill and for the one he later built south of the junction of the river, Boulder and Bear creeks. Twin brothers Austin and Oscar Harmon assisted at the Two Bar Creek mill until its closure. The erection of the Two Bar Creek sawmill by Peery later helped in the establishment of the settlement of Boulder.

The year 1868 was the founding year for the settlement of Boulder. Transportation remained a problem, slowing development of the small communities that now dotted the valley. A road extension from Graham Hill Road linking the upper San Lorenzo valley with Santa Cruz through Felton was completed in May. It also marked the completion of the United States government&#x27;s survey of all land not held by grants in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which was then opened for purchase and homesteading. Government surveyors divided the largely unsettled San Lorenzo Valley into claimable sections. The area of Boulder Creek occupied two tracts. The northern half, between Harmon and Bear Creeks, was awarded to John Alcorn, Branciford&#x27;s son. Loggers moved up the San Lorenzo and its tributaries removing every marketable tree that were then sold to the demanding market of the San Francisco Bay area. The lumbermen and their families moved into scattered cottages and homes around the periphery of Peery&#x27;s Two Bar Creek sawmill, while a general store, livery stable, and blacksmith shop arose nearby to support the mill and its visitors. The increase in the number of families with children determined the need for a school, the first one of which was started in a small building on Alcorn&#x27;s land on what is now West Park Drive.

Lumber could not be shipped over the mountains to Santa Clara Valley. Two years later in 1871, another road extension, the Saratoga Toll Road, was added from the summit at the Saratoga Gap and ran to meet the road that ran about above Boulder Creek. In June, the Maclay Turnpike officially opened. Alcorn erected a two-story boarding house, the Boulder Creek House. That same year, Peery was awarded a land grant and relocated his lumber mill a mile south to Lorenzo, a settlement that he laid out, which was bounded by what is now Harmon, West, South, and East Streets. With an access point to the greater San Francisco Bay Area came the establishment of a post office named Boulder Creek in 1872, with Peery becoming the first postmaster. Mail runs were limited to twice a week because it took a mail carrier two days to travel from Santa Clara to Felton.

What is now Boulder Creek was originally once two settlements: Lorenzo at the southern end of town, and Boulder was north of the current town core.

Boulder Creek served as the upper terminus of the San Lorenzo Valley Logging Flume terminating in Felton, which began construction in 1874 and, when formally opened in October 1875, was augmented by a new rail line to transport logs to the wharf in Santa Cruz. In the 1880s, this lumber town which was called Lorenzo took the name of the Boulder Creek post office that had been established in the 1870s.

==Geography==
Boulder Creek is located on the West Coast of the United States. The community has a total area of , of which all is land. The community is bordered by San Mateo County to the northwest; Santa Clara County to the northeast; Big Basin Redwoods State Park to the west; and Brookdale to the south. Boulder Creek is from Santa Cruz, from San Jose, from San Francisco, and from Sacramento.

Boulder Creek sits at the north end of the San Lorenzo Valley at the confluence of San Lorenzo River and Boulder Creek within the Santa Cruz Mountains, a Level IV ecoregion designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an area surrounded by steep, redwood- and pine- covered hills formed by the river, creek, and their tributaries. The river flows through Boulder Creek on the east and south through Brookdale, Ben Lomond, and Felton, and continues south to the City of Santa Cruz where it enters Monterey Bay. Directly across from Boulder Creek&#x27;s confluence with the San Lorenzo River, Bear Creek flows into the river and creates a topographical feature known as the Turkey Foot. The Turkey Foot creates a floodplain, particularly on the western side of the river where the mountainside is less steep.

===Climate===

Boulder Creek has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) characteristic of California&#x27;s coast, with moist, mild winters and dry summers. Located about inland, the Boulder Creek skies can be overcast due to moisture from the Pacific Coast marine layer.

The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in August at .

====Flooding====
Flooding of the San Lorenzo River, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive damage. A &quot;Santa Cruz Surf&quot; newspaper article from January 25, 1890 mentioned the San Lorenzo River being at its highest known since 1849, with Boulder Creek having received of rainfall up to that date during the 1889-90 winter season. A log jam was reported at the junction of the river and Bear Creek, with Boulder Creek being &quot;higher than ever known&quot;. Bear Creek Bridge gave way and a cottage from the tributary Hesse Creek was carried by flood waters down to Boulder Creek, where it was stopped by rescue parties. There was one casualty. In an April 19 article of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; that same year, Boulder Creek held first place in the season&#x27;s precipitation with of rain received.

According to a March 24 article of the &quot;Santa Cruz Morning Sentinel&quot;, the 1907 flood destroyed and swept away all five bridges within town limits that connected the eastern and western sides of Boulder Creek - Booth, Schroder, Swinging Bridge, Barker, and Grover Dam bridge.

Modern records began in 1937 with the highest river level rise recorded during the December 1955 storm from December 22 to 23. According to the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel-News&quot;, Boulder Creek recorded of rain during that storm. Within the area, Highway 9 in the vicinity of Wildwood Grove had minor undercutting of the road fill and Riverside Grove experienced principal residential damage.

During the January 1982 El Niño storm, from January 3 to 4, of rainfall occurred in Boulder Creek over the period of 24 hours. This generated debris flows and shallow landslides. During the El Niño winter of 1996 and 1997, higher concentrations of debris flows were observed in the area around Boulder Creek.

====Fire====
Fires have occurred throughout Boulder Creek&#x27;s history as almost all of the town is within a fire hazard severity zone, making residents ineligible for home insurance.

Two conflagration-sized fires nearly destroyed downtown Boulder Creek and the nearby village of Lorenzo on July 17, 1891.

The CZU Lightning Complex fires started on August 16, 2020 due to a severe thunderstorm that initially started several separate fires. Due to a change in wind conditions, these separate fires merged together and rapidly spread through nearby communities, including Boulder Creek. The CZU fire incident was finally contained on September 22, after destroying a number of houses but sparing the town&#x27;s historic main street.

==Cityscape==
California State Route 9 enters Boulder Creek from the south at River Street, bisecting the community as the Central Avenue arterial thoroughfare, before passing by Bear Creek Road to the northeast and becoming SR 9 once again. Within the community core, Route 9 connects to the southern terminus of California State Route 236 with an at-grade intersection, which provides access to the northwest of the community as Big Basin Way. Route 236 then continues westward from Boulder Creek and into Big Basin Redwoods State Park.

The community is divided into three geographical sections of unequal size: Village Core, South Village, and Outlying Village Areas.

===Architecture===
The architecture of Boulder Creek varies but is generally popular among tourists and locals. Many of the commercial buildings along Central Avenue are designed primarily in the Boomtown style. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne and a variety of Victorian styles. For examples, the designs of the McLeod House and the Stagg/Hartman House are drawn from these architectural movements. Modern and other non-classical architectural styles, such as Minimal Traditional and Ranch, are also seen throughout the community. Outside downtown Boulder Creek, architectural styles are even more varied. The former Grace Episcopal Church is designed in the Gothic Revival style.

<text>Capitola is a small seaside city in Santa Cruz County, California. Capitola is located on the northern shores of Monterey Bay, on the Central Coast of California. The city had a population of 9,456 at the 2024 census, the same year it became known as The New Midtown. Capitola is a popular tourist destination, owing to its beaches and restaurants.

== History ==
The original settlement now known as Capitola grew out of what was then called Soquel Landing. Soquel Landing got its name from a wharf located at the mouth of Soquel Creek. This wharf, which dates back to the 1850s, served as an outlet for the produce and lumber grown in the interior. In 1865, Captain John Pope Davenport, a whaleman at Monterey, moved his operations to be near the wharf. Unable to capture any whales, he moved his operations the following year to Point Año Nuevo.

In 1869, Frederick A. Hihn, who owned the property in the vicinity of the wharf, decided to develop it as a seaside resort. At first he leased the area to Samuel A. Hall and the area became known as Camp Capitola. Most authorities believe that it was Hihn who chose the name of Capitola, but they are unsure as to why he did so. Several possibilities have been asserted, one being that it was named for the heroine of &quot;The Hidden Hand&quot;, a novel by the popular author E. D. E. N. Southworth, favored by Hall&#x27;s daughter Lulu. Capitola is known as the oldest beach resort on the West Coast.

In the summer of 1961 hundreds of birds attacked the town. Most of the birds were sooty shearwaters, a normally non-aggressive species that rarely comes to shore. Alfred Hitchcock was a regular visitor to nearby Santa Cruz and read about this episode. He went on to direct a film—&quot;The Birds&quot;—based on the idea of hundreds of birds attacking humans. The reason for this attack remained unknown for over 25 years until it was discovered that the birds had been affected by domoic acid, a toxin produced by red algae.

The Capitola Classic was a skateboarding event held in Capitola village in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Capitola Classic was known in skating circles for its annual downhill race, which was a head-to-head speed competition that drew top names in the sport, many local as well as international, including Santa Cruz, California local John Hutson, who held the world speed record for skateboarding at 53.45 mph and dominated the event each year.
Starting in 2009 efforts were made to revive the event.

On March 24, 2011, a drainage pipe burst following heavy rains, sending a surge of water through the historic village area.
Two days later cleanup operations were interrupted when the area was flooded again.

== Geography ==
Capitola Village is located at the beach by the mouth of Soquel Creek.

Capitola sits on the northeast shore of Monterey Bay. Cliffs mark access to several popular beaches, including New Brighton Beach, or drop directly to the rocky shoreline of the bay. Capitola Village sits in a depression among the cliffs so that the popular tourist and shopping area leads directly to Capitola Beach. Colorful houses and hotels line the slopes of the town leading back up to the clifftops.

The Venetian Court sits on the beach just east of the pier and is on the Register of National Historic Places as &quot;The first Condominium Beach Community in the United States, built in 1924&quot;.

<text>Felton is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, California, United States. The population was 4,489 as of 2020 census and according to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==

Felton is part of the traditional territory of the Sayant, an Awaswas-speaking group considered part of the Ohlone people. Most of the Sayant were sent to Mission Santa Cruz and the area of the San Lorenzo Valley remained unpopulated except for occasional travelers. In 1833, Rancho Zayante was established at the confluence of the San Lorenzo River and Zayante Creek and granted to Joaquín Buelna. The rancho subsequently passed to Francisco Moss in 1839, then Joseph L. Majors on April 22, 1841. Majors acquired it on behalf of Isaac Graham, who operated a lumber mill on the property.

In the aftermath of California statehood in 1850, the California Gold Rush expanded outward, eventually reaching the San Lorenzo Valley. Gold was struck along western tributaries of the San Lorenzo River such as Gold Gulch. These miners, combined with lumbermen and their families, began a community known in early days as &quot;San Lorenzo.&quot; After Graham died in 1863, his lawyer Edward Stanly oversaw the subdivision of his estate. In 1868, he hired Horace Gushee to subdivide the property and Frederick A. Hihn to promote it. Gushee was a director of the failed San Lorenzo Railroad scheme and planned to make the community into the terminus for the railroad. In 1868, he or Stanly named the town Felton, probably after former Oakland mayor John B. Felton, who may have been an investor.

Although the railroad was never built, Felton continued to grow as a town focused on the lumber, lime, and mining industries. In 1875, it became the southern terminus of the San Lorenzo Valley Logging Flume from Boulder Creek, and the northern terminus of the Santa Cruz and Felton Railroad to Santa Cruz. and when formally opened in October 1875 was augmented by a new rail line to transport logs to the wharf in Santa Cruz. To enable it to negotiate on better terms with the South Pacific Coast Railroad, Felton was incorporated as a town by the Legislature on March 8, 1878. This gamble did not pay off and the new railroad established a depot across the San Lorenzo River at a site nicknamed &quot;New Felton&quot; by locals. In 1917, Felton was disincorporated, relinquishing corporate responsibilities to the county of Santa Cruz.

In 1927, the Felton community of Lompico, California, was established.

In 1963, the steam-powered Roaring Camp Railroad began tourist operations on the Big Trees Ranch out of the Old Felton Depot. The company later constructed a replica logging camp and another depot farther down the property, and in 1985, took over operations on the old SPC/Southern Pacific standard gauge line to Santa Cruz. Roaring Camp is a re-creation of an 1880s logging camp and home to the original South Pacific Coast (later Southern Pacific) Felton depot and freight shed, as well as two unique railroads — the Roaring Camp and Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad, a steam-powered line up Bear Mountain, and the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway.

Felton is home to the Felton Covered Bridge, an 80-foot-long covered bridge over the San Lorenzo River built in 1892 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The Trout Farm Inn was located in Felton. It burned down on June 5, 2016. It reopened in 2022.

The local high school is San Lorenzo Valley High School. The 2007 boys basketball team won the only Boys Basketball SCCAL Championship in school history. Led by five players who all went to elementary school at the now closed Quail Hollow School. Scott Krueger, Josh Payne, Kyle Morris, Clint Gorman and Taylor West were known as the “Quail Hollow 5.” Their success was helped by the students who would regularly attend their games and called themselves, “The Red Sea.”

On August 20, 2020 at 8:00 AM Pacific Time, due to the CZU Lightning Incident fires of 2020, Felton was ordered to evacuate by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

<text>Live Oak is a census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, California between the cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola and north of the former Union Pacific railroad. Live Oak sits at an elevation of . The population was 17,038 at the 2020 census. The population of the greater Live Oak area, including Twin Lakes and Pleasure Point, was 27,921.

==Geography==
Live Oak is located at (36.981363, -121.980476).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.2 square miles (8.4 km2), all of it land.

==History==

For several thousand years, the Awaswas-speaking Ohlone people inhabited the area from Half Moon Bay to Aptos, including the area now known as Live Oak. When missionaries established the Mission Santa Cruz in 1791, they noted &quot;an area to the east of the San Lorenzo River &quot;in sight of the Sea&quot; that was crisscrossed by &quot;steep gulches containing running water&quot; and three &quot;reed-lined&quot; lagoons. Spanish colonial settlers, who later established the secular pueblo of Villa de Branciforte on the east side of the San Lorenzo, ran their herds of cattle and horses in the &quot;common lands&quot; of this area.

In 1834 and 1837, territorial governors divided these lands between two brothers, Alejandro and Francisco Rodriguez. Alejandro Rodriguez was granted Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo, named for the &quot;rodeo&quot; (cattle roundup) area located in a low-lying natural amphitheater along Rodeo Creek. (These grounds were later filled in during the construction of Highway 1.) Francisco Rodriguez was granted a rancho bearing the name &quot;Los Esteros&quot; (never patented) because of the sizeable estuaries forming two of its boundaries. Originally known as Twin Lakes, the westernmost of the &quot;twins&quot; is now the Santa Cruz Harbor.
With the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and American statehood in 1849, legal maneuvering turned the Rodriguez brothers&#x27; holdings over to a handful of white settler-farmers. Their farms produced wheat, oats, and barley, supporting small households of adobe and rough-cut lumber. The farmers prospered, establishing a Grange Hall and, in 1872, a small schoolhouse called the &quot;Live Oak School&quot;, named for the evergreen live oak trees that dot the area. The Live Oak School District has maintained a facility at this location, now the intersection of 17th Avenue and Capitola Road, to the present day.

By the start of the 20th century, fifty years of wheat and oat farming had depleted the soil such that farmers turned to cultivating fruits and vegetables. Owing to the irrigation needs of these crops, these farms eventually failed and were replaced by a large poultry operation near the present-day intersection of Capitola Road and Soquel Drive, and a floriculture bulb nursery (specializing in callas, narcissus, freesias and begonias) near the present-day intersection of 17th Avenue and East Cliff Drive.

Around 1910, two Santa Cruz real estate agents, the brothers Frank and David Wilson, purchased and subdivided several of the old 19th century wheat farms. The new lots were long and narrow, normally of , and came with a &quot;poultry unit&quot; that included a kit for a two-bedroom house, and one or two large chicken coops stocked with a flock of 500 or 1,000 hens and roosters. The layout and shape of these lots has left a distinctive mark on the area&#x27;s subsequent development. A feed mill to serve the area soon followed.

Egg and poultry prices plummeted in the early years of the Great Depression, and this difficulty was compounded by a double plague of Pullorum Disease and Coccidiosis, which swept through the chicken coops of Live Oak in 1931.

Paved roads and utilities were brought to the area during the 1940s, which also saw the incorporation of Capitola to the east. Bulb nurseries, particularly those specializing in begonias, thrived throughout this period and into the 1950s, when the area was beginning to develop into a residential suburb of Santa Cruz. The west-to-east serial numbering of Live Oak&#x27;s north–south streets during that period reflected the expectation that the area would soon be annexed to the city of Santa Cruz. Annexation never came, and a movement for Live Oak to incorporate itself as a municipality was abandoned too, in light of the expense of providing the needed services to the area. In the 1970s, Capitola expanded westward, incorporating the tax-rich commercial neighborhood along 41st Avenue. Residential and commercial development in Live Oak continued at a steady pace, under the direction of Santa Cruz County.

==Live Oak today==

Sporadic infill development in Live Oak over the last half century has contributed to the area&#x27;s eclectic patchwork of trailer parks, ranch-style houses, townhome condominium complexes, and single-family homes in cul-de-sacs, with the 2½ acre plots and their two-bedroom kit houses left over from the chicken farming days (the farms are no longer operating).

Live Oak has no downtown center, but 17th Avenue between Highway 1 and East Cliff Drive is the address for several schools, the Santa Cruz Live Oak Grange Hall, the Fire Department, a Santa Cruz County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the Family Swim Center, and the majority of Live Oak&#x27;s business establishments.

While identified as part of Live Oak, Pleasure Point, Santa Cruz, California, has its own history and developed out of El Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo rather than Rancho Encinalitos.

<text>Scotts Valley is a small city in Santa Cruz County, California, United States, about south of downtown San Jose and north of the city of Santa Cruz, in the upland slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 12,224. Principal access to the city is supplied by State Route 17 that connects San Jose and Santa Cruz. The city was incorporated in 1966.

==History==
Approximately ten thousand years ago there was a lake in the lowest elevation of Scotts Valley. Archeological excavations of site CA-SCR-177 (Scotts Valley Site) in 1983 and 1987 support dates for human settlement of this area as between 9,000 and 12,000 years before present (&quot;YBP&quot;). The lake drained during the Mid-Holocene warming period (4,000-5,000 
YBP) forming what is now known as Carbonera Creek. When the lake drained, the people moved downslope following the lake water&#x27;s transformation as in became the creek. Around 2000 BC, Ohlone people occupied areas along the remaining creeks, spring and seep areas, along with permanent and seasonal drainages, and on flat ridges and terraces. Permanent villages were usually placed on elevations above seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering. Therefore, areas along watercourses are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Several watercourses, including portions of Carbonera Creek, Bean Creek, and MacKenzie Creek, are within the city.

Scotts Valley was named after Hiram Daniel Scott, who purchased Rancho San Agustin, including the valley, in 1850 from Joseph Ladd Majors.
Before Majors, the property was owned by José Bolcoff. Bolcoff was the original settler and first European to claim title and live in what was to be Scotts Valley. He was born Osip Volkov around 1794 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Siberia. Working as a fur trader around 1815, Bolcoff jumped ship on the Monterey Bay shoreline, quickly assimilated into the Spanish culture, and was well received by the Spanish authorities. Volkov had his Russian Orthodox baptism validated in Mission Soledad in 1817, and was given the Spanish name José Antonio Bolcoff. Bolcoff lived with and traveled with Alta California&#x27;s governor Pablo Vicente de Solá, acting as an interpreter.

Becoming a Mexican citizen in 1833, Bolcoff moved his family to his land grant building, an adobe casa historians speculate was located near present-day Kings Village Shopping Center. Bolcoff relinquished his interest in the Rancho San Augustin, selling and accepting $400 from Joseph Ladd Majors, also known as Don Juan José Mechacas. July 7, 1846, marked the shift of power in the region from Mexico to the United States.

Hiram Scott built the Greek revival style Scott House in 1853. Situated behind City Hall, it is a Santa Cruz County Historical Trust Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The house originally stood on Scotts Valley Drive, near where a Bank of America branch is now located.

From the 1840s, money-making activity in Scotts Valley centered on several industries: lumber, grain, the milling of grain, and most importantly the tanning of hides and working of leather. Beginning in the 1930s, peat moss was removed from Scotts Valley and taken to San Francisco to supply soil for difficult indoor plants such as gardenias. When the peat ran out, sand and gravel were quarried and sold.

The area was the site of Santa&#x27;s Village, a Christmas-themed amusement park which opened on May 30, 1957, on a site which was formerly Lawridge Farm, part of the former Rancho San Augustin. &quot;Residents&quot; of the park included Santa, Mrs. Santa, and elves and gnomes who operated the rides and sold tickets. There was a petting zoo, a bobsled ride, a whirling Christmas tree ride, and a train ride, as well as a Fairy Tale Land. The park was sold in 1966 but continued to be operated under lease by the Santa&#x27;s Village Corporation. When that corporation went bankrupt in 1977. the owner considered launching a Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm type of complex but was denied a permit by the city of Scotts Valley, and the park closed for good in 1979.

Scotts Valley&#x27;s most famous resident was film director Alfred Hitchcock, who lived in a mountaintop estate above the Vine Hill area from 1940 to 1972. Florence Owens Thompson, made famous by Dorothea Lange&#x27;s &quot;Migrant Mother&quot; photograph, died in Scotts Valley in 1983.

Netflix was founded in Scotts Valley by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997.

==Economy==

===Tourism===
From its early years as a stop on the stage route across the mountains, the Scotts Valley area has provided services to travelers. With the growing usage of the automobile in the early 20th century, the area became commercialized and tourism developed as a local industry.

In the early 1920s, Edward Evers established Camp Evers at the junction of the State Highway and Mt. Hermon Road. Camp Evers consisted of a small store, gas pumps, dance hall and tents, becoming a resort and rest stop for travelers.

The Beverly Gardens were established in the 1930s and featured a collection of exotic birds and animals, a restaurant, and cabins.

Axel Erlandson opened The Tree Circus in 1947, featuring trees grafted and trained in strange and unusual shapes. Bright &quot;life size&quot; painted dinosaurs overlooking Highway 17 were added to the Tree Circus in 1964 when it changed its name to The Lost World. Surviving trees have since been moved to Gilroy Gardens.

Santa&#x27;s Village, one of three locations in America&#x27;s first theme park chain, was established in 1956. It was the most popular of the many attractions, attracting millions of visitors to Scotts Valley for over twenty years, and it was the last of Scotts Valley&#x27;s theme parks to close its doors, in 1979. H. Glenn Holland, who had already developed a Santa&#x27;s Village elsewhere the previous year, leased at the former Lawridge Farm, which was a portion of the former Rancho San Augustin for the Scotts Valley location of Santa&#x27;s Village. The park maintained a historically correct team of Mexican burros that lived on the back field. Four reindeer from Unalakleet, Alaska, pulled Santa&#x27;s sleigh. All the buildings were designed to look like log chalet-type structures, replete with snowy roofs and gingerbread trim. One chalet housed a legendary fresh gingerbread bakery. Theme-appropriate music flowed from speakers hidden in towering redwood trees. In 1977 the Santa&#x27;s Village Corporation had filed for bankruptcy, and in 1979 the park&#x27;s gates were finally closed. The site is currently a playing field at the former headquarters of Borland.

Scotts Valley is also near Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, and Roaring Camp Railroads. The town is surrounded by coast redwood forests. The city of Santa Cruz lies to the south. A relatively large municipal skateboard park, where pro skateboarder Eric Costello died in October 2005 due to improper helmet use, is near Skypark, the site of a former airport, in central Scotts Valley.

Three hotels operate in Scotts Valley: a Best Western hotel located near the Granite Creek entrance to Highway 17, a Four Points by Sheraton located on Scotts Valley Drive, and a Hilton hotel located near the Mount Hermon junction with Highway 17.

===Redevelopment and high technology===
Evidence regarding blighted conditions in the Redevelopment Area of Santa&#x27;s Village and the Skypark Airport was established in the year 1990.

E-mu Systems, Seagate Technology, Sessions, and Borland Software Corporation were all formerly headquartered in Scotts Valley.

Zero Motorcycles manufactures all-electric motorcycles in Scotts Valley.

Netflix&#x27;s first headquarters were established in Scotts Valley by Reed Hastings, a Stanford graduate, in 1997. The headquarters were later moved to nearby Los Gatos, California.

In May 2016, the University of California, Santa Cruz signed a 20-year lease to occupy the former Borland headquarters establishing its Scotts Valley Center. The center serves as the professional offices for three of its divisions — Information Technology services, Business and Administrative services, and University Relations.

<text>Soquel (; Ohlone: &quot;Sokel&quot;) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Santa Cruz County, California, located on the northern coast of Monterey Bay. The population was 9,980 at the 2020 census.

==History==

&quot;Osocalis&quot; was the Spanish phonetic rendering for the name of the creek which runs through the area, as transcribed from the local Native American Indian language of the Ohlone peoples. The later name &quot;Soquel,&quot; which was subsequently derived from the name of that creek, is first known to have appeared in 1833 as the name of the Mexican land grant which included this creek and adjacent lands.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping at one of the creeks on October 15, 1769. The expedition diaries don&#x27;t provide enough information to be sure which creek it was, but the direction of travel was northwest, parallel to the coast. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that &quot;We stopped on the bank of a small stream, which has about four varas of deep running water. It has on its banks a good growth of cottonwoods and alders; on account of the depth at which it runs it may be that it cannot be utilized to water some plains through which it runs.&quot; Translator Herbert Bolton speculated that the location was Soquel Creek.

Martina Castro was granted Rancho Soquel by Alta California governor José Figueroa in 1833. Martina was one of the daughters of Santa Cruz &quot;fundadore&quot; José Joaquín Castro, who came as a boy with his family to Alta California from Mexico with the second De Anza expedition in 1775. Several of Martina&#x27;s Californio brothers and sisters also became &quot;rancheros&quot;.

The town of Soquel is notorious for its flooding. The lowlands in and around the Soquel Creek have flooded many times. The most recent flood was in January 1982, and it nearly topped its banks in 1986. Uncleared log jams downstream in the city of Capitola have been blamed for the flooding. Capitola City Planner Richard Steele implemented a debris removal program after the near flooding in 1986.

In 1965, Soquel was the location of the first &quot;Acid Test&quot; party.

<text>Watsonville is a city in Santa Cruz County, California, in the Monterey Bay Area of the Central Coast of California. The population was 52,590 at the 2020 census. Predominantly Latino and Democratic, Watsonville is a self-designated sanctuary city.

==History==

Watsonville&#x27;s land was first inhabited by an Ohlone nation of Indigenous Californians. This tribe settled along the Pajaro Dunes since the land was fertile and useful for the cultivation of their plants and animals.

===Spanish era===
In 1769, the Portolá expedition, the first Europeans to explore the area, arrived from the south, where soldiers described a big bird they saw near a large river. The story survived in the river&#x27;s name, &quot;Rio del Pajaro&quot; (River of the Bird).

The Portolá expedition continued north through the area, camping at one of the lakes north of town for five nights, on October 10–14, 1769. Many of the expedition&#x27;s soldiers had scurvy, so progress was slow. While the sick recuperated, scouts led by Sergeant Ortega looked for the best way forward. On the fifth day, Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, wrote in his diary, &quot;This afternoon the explorers returned. The sergeant reported that he had gone ahead twelve leagues without getting any information of the harbor that we are looking for, and that he went to the foot of a high, white mountain range.&quot;

During the October March 10, the explorers first saw the Coast redwood tree (Spanish: &quot;palo colorado&quot;). A bronze plaque at Pinto Lake (now a city park) commemorates the event. On October 15, the expedition continued to the northwest past today&#x27;s community of Freedom, camping that night at Corralitos Lagoon.

The area became part of the Spanish colonial province of Las Californias, and in 1804 the northern part was split off to form Alta California. The area&#x27;s pasture lands were assigned to the Spanish mission to the south, in Carmel.

===Mexican era===

When Mexico gained independence, it took possession of &quot;Alta California&quot;. The Spanish missions were secularized in the 1830s, and the future Watsonville area became Rancho Bolsa del Pajaro, a land grant made to Sebastian Rodríguez in 1837. Under Mexico&#x27;s more liberal land-ownership laws, immigration to the area from Europe and the U.S. increased.

In 1833, Governor José Figueroa granted Rancho San Andrés to José Joaquín Castro, who came to California as part of the 1776 Anza Expedition and later became patriarch of a locally prominent Californio family. His son, Juan José Castro, built the Castro Adobe, the only two-story hacienda in the area at the time. Today, the adobe is owned by California State Parks and is undergoing restoration to serve as the Rancho San Andrés Castro Adobe State Historic Park.

===Post-Conquest era===
Following the American Conquest of California and the ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the region began to receive large waves of migrants, mainly Americans from the East Coast and Europeans.

John H. Watson and D. S. Gregory laid out the town in 1852. The community was incorporated as the Town of Watsonville on or about March 30, 1868, named after Watson. It became the City of Watsonville about 1889. Voters adopted a charter in 1903.
===Modern era===

From 1904 to 1913, the Watsonville Railway and Navigation Company operated an interurban railway to Port Watsonville on Monterey Bay, where it connected with an overnight produce packet boat to San Francisco.

The Watsonville riots was a race riot that occurred in January 1930. The riots were preceded by efforts of a local justice of the peace, D.W. Rohrback to stoke anti-Filipino sentiments. Filipino American farmworkers, then-U.S. nationals, were attacked by White Americans, including the killing of Fermin Tobera. In May 2023, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors issued an apology for the riot in form of a resolution during Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

===Maggie Sue Earthquake of 2024===

The Maggie Sue Earthquake with a magnitude of 4.5, a shallow depth of 7 kilometers, and an epicenter of approximately 3 kilometers West of Moss Landing struck on September 29, 2024 at 2:47 AM local time. The Maggie Sue Earthquake had a high intensity rating with impacts especially strong throughout the Moss Landing, Aromas, and Watsonville areas, with intense shaking felt throughout Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties as far south as Salinas and Monterey.

Watonsville&#x27;s present city charter was adopted on February 16, 1960.

In 1985, cannery workers in Watsonville went on strike for 18 months to protest a decrease in their wages and benefits. In the end, they won a new contract. The movement was led by primarily Latina women, and was noted as a historic labor rights win for the Mexicano/Chicano community.

==Geography==

Watsonville is in the Monterey Bay area, at the southern end of Santa Cruz County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Watsonville has habitat areas that support the endangered species Santa Cruz Tarweed on the California coastal prairie ecosystem. Population has grown considerably since 1980, requiring preparation of a number of Environmental Impact Reports, with resultant development removing certain lands of the city from productive natural habitat.

Most of the coastal land adjacent to Watsonville is part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Another protected natural resource is the Watsonville wetlands, a system of fresh water sloughs with open water and native vegetation that extend from the city to the ocean. The slough system is only one of a few remaining wetland areas of its kind in the California Coastal Region. Not only are the wetlands home to approximately nine species of fish and over 200 species of waterfowl, raptors and songbirds; they are also a vital stop on the Pacific Flyway for thousands of migrating birds. In 1990, private and municipal organizations worked together to stop development and protect this resource. The Watsonville Wetlands Watch was established at that time with the task of restoring and protecting the slough&#x27;s natural habit.

===Climate===

The National Weather Service cooperative station at the Watsonville Waterworks reports cool, relatively wet winters and mild, dry summers.

The history of East Asians in Watsonville dates back to the late 19th century and are involved in the local agricultural industry. It is presumed that as a result of Japanese-American internment during WWII, local farm companies began to attract Mexican migrant labor to the area in higher numbers and the town&#x27;s racial-ethnic composition became more Hispanic in the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>Anderson is a city in Shasta County, California, approximately south of Redding. Its population is 11,323 as of the 2020 census, up from 9,932 from the 2010 census.

Located north of Sacramento, the city&#x27;s roots are as a railroad town near the northern tip of the Central Valley of California.

The city was named after ranch owner Elias Anderson, who granted the Oregon and California Railroad trackage rights and land for a station. Elias Anderson was a farmer, hotel owner, and postmaster. Elias married Elizabeth Summers in 1839 and built the Prairie House in the community of Cottonwood in 1856 on the south side of Cottonwood Creek (now Tehama County).

Elias Anderson purchased the American Ranch from Thomas Freeman in 1856 and built the American Ranch Hotel in what would become downtown Anderson, California. The post office was inside the hotel. Elias Anderson purchased from Pierson B. Reading in 1865 and deeded a right-of-way through his property to Central Pacific Railroad in 1872; in return the railroad gave the depot his name. Elias and Elizabeth Anderson built their new home at 2865 East Street in 1873; it no longer exists. While it stood, the house was designated as California Historical Landmark No. 12. In 1876 the Andersons moved their ranch hotel to the corner of Main and Ferry Streets.

<doc id="108188" wikidata="Q2594862" url="?curid=108188" title="Big Bend, California">
<text>Big Bend of the Madesi Valley is the indigenous homeland of the Madesi tribe, located in Shasta County, northeastern California. It is named for a major change in course of the Pit River.

Its population is 79 as of the 2020 census, down from 102 from the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Big Bend as a census-designated place (CDP).

==History==
===Native Americans===
For several thousand years prior to the 19th century, Big Bend was the heart of the territory of the Madesi tribe (pronounced Mah-day-see) tribe (or &quot;band&quot;) of Pit River Native Americans. The Madesi is one of nine bands (also called &quot;tribelets&quot;) that spoke the Achomawi language. (Early anthropologists mistakenly called all nine bands in the language group &quot;Achomawi,&quot; although only one of the bands was actually called Achomawi.)

The Madesi band&#x27;s territorial region included Big Bend and the surrounding area of the Lower Pit River (&quot;Ah-choo&#x27;-mah&quot; in the Madesi dialect, which has few or no speakers still living), and several of its tributaries, such as Kosk Creek (&quot;An-noo-che&#x27;che&quot;) and Nelson Creek (&quot;Ah-lis&#x27;choo&#x27;-chah&quot;). The main village of the Madesi was on the north bank of the Pit River, east of Kosk Creek, and was called &quot;Mah-dess&#x27;,&quot; or &quot;Mah-dess&#x27; Atjwam&quot; (Madesi Valley), and was directly across the river from the smaller villages that surrounded the hot springs on the river&#x27;s south bank, which were called &quot;Oo-le&#x27;-moo-me, Lah&#x27;-lah-pis&#x27;-mah,&quot; and &quot;Al-loo-satch-ha.&quot;

The Madesi people enjoyed great abundance of food sources, which mainly consisted of acorns, deer, salmon, and other fish from the river.

===Euro-American settlers===
The Big Bend area is so remote and isolated that the Madesi was one of the last indigenous peoples of California to be invaded and pushed out of their ancestral homeland.

As white settlers began to come to Big Bend in the 1860s, few Madesi were left in the area, and the newcomers began to claim the conquered land as their own. By the 1890s, Big Bend was becoming a small quiet town of white settlers, centered around the hot springs. It was originally called Elena (1890) by the Euro-Americans settlers, and then changed to Henderson, (1906) before they began calling it &quot;Big Bend&quot; (1922).

Early white settlers built a log hotel with a post office and a saloon just above the main hot springs. Many visitors around the turn of the 20th-century came to Big Bend to soak in the hot springs, seeking the reputed healing qualities of the hot mineral water baths.

Big Bend grew slowly until the late 1930s, when Pacific Gas and Electric Company began construction on the and Pit Five Power House. The dam construction brought thousands of jobs and people to Big Bend. This included engineers, builders, tunnel diggers (around 2000 hard-rock miners), and service workers to the area. Big Bend saw a &quot;boom and bust&quot; cycle, and the population was declining by the late 1940s, after the dam work was completed. Although the maintenance of the hydroelectric facilities and a large commercial logging industry still require numerous employees, almost all of the people working in such jobs live outside of Big Bend, contributing further to the population decline.

The population of Big Bend was only 102 people in the 2010 census, apparently the lowest number of residents since the 1860s.

==Geography==
Big Bend is located at (41.019803, -121.907881).

The community is situated on a long bend in the Pit River which is the longest tributary to the Sacramento River. The Pit River (traditionally called Achoma) is one of only three rivers that crosses the Cascades mountain range and drains into the Pacific Ocean. Before the dams were built, the Pit River hosted the third largest Salmon run on the west coast of the US. From Big Bend is a striking view of Chalk Mountain (called Too-le-pah-ah-te Ah-ko by the Madesi tribe) which has a natural exposed slide feature of diatomaceous earth. The slide is locally called the &quot;White Buffalo,&quot; since it resembles a white bison. Another prominent mountain hovering over the town of Big Bend is called Bald Peak (called Ma-how-mah-day Ah-ko by the Madesi tribe), which has dozens of cold water springs, creating numerous creeks that feed into the Pit River, a spring-fed, or a &quot;free stone&quot; river.

Big Bend is known in the Northern California region for its geothermal hot springs. There are several hot spring sources on the Big Bend Hot Springs property along the Pit River. Privately owned land containing hot springs is expected to open for public tourism.

===Pit River===
The Pit River is a &quot;free stone river&quot; and provides excellent fishing for McCloud River redband trout.

The Pit River has had occasional white water level releases from the dams to provide white water rafting with Class 4 and Class 5 rapids.

A highly scenic gravel road follows the Pit River upstream from Big Bend to Highway 89 near McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park.

===Iron Canyon Reservoir===
Iron Canyon Reservoir, located near Big Bend, impounds water diverted from the McCloud River and contains Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout. This reservoir provides an opportunity for canoeing and float tubing. The reservoir is in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and has two campgrounds, one administered by the US Forest Service and one by Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

==History==
French Gulch was founded by French miners in 1849 and became one of California&#x27;s major gold producing areas. The town became a major supply place when it became the terminus of the western branch of the California Trail. French Gulch was registered as a California Historical Landmark in 1935.

French Gulch was an important, early, hard rock mining district. The Washington vein system was discovered in 1852, and was worked periodically through about 1914. It is estimated to have produced about 100,000 ounces of gold. The Niagara Mine is estimated to have produced about 50,000 ounces from its past operations. As of 2008, limited production has resumed from the Washington and Niagara mines.

On August 14, 2004, the entire town of French Gulch was evacuated due to a forest fire which roared out of control through much of Shasta County. The fire burned 13,005 acres and destroyed 26 residences, 1 commercial building, and 76 outbuildings. The evacuation lasted 3 days, allowing residents to return home on August 17, 2004. A total of 1,345 fire personnel helped get the blaze under control. The cause was never determined.

On July 22, 2018, French Gulch was evacuated due to the Carr Fire, which was started by a motor vehicle malfunction. As of August 2, air and ground crews continued to work in the area to protect the town from the fire, and many of the buildings, including the historic hotel, were still standing. On August 8, the evacuation order for French Gulch and surrounding areas was lifted, and residents were allowed to return to their homes.

<text>Palo Cedro (Spanish for &quot;Cedar Wood&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Shasta County, California, United States. It is 8 miles (13 km) east of Redding. Its population is 2,931 as of the 2020 census, up from 1,269 from the 2010 census.

Originally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the Sacramento Valley by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including Alexander McLeod (1829) and John Work (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th century.

As of the 2020 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 780 people per square mile (300/km2). Award-winning country musician Merle Haggard lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
Prior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California. These tribes included the Wintu, Patwins, Nozi, Pit Rivers, Hat Creeks, Shastas, Paiutes, and Modoc Indian tribes. The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek. Penutian Indian tribes on the Pacific coast or valley included the Maidu, Miwok, Constanoan, Yokuts, Yanas, and other divisions. Historians said that, in the lower 48 continental United States, California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes and more different Indian languages. The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. 

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the Portolá expedition, in 1769–1770, that led to the founding of Alta California, reaching as far north as San Francisco Bay.

The 19th century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under Ivan Kuskov established a colony at Fort Ross on the coast of what is now Sonoma County. As early as 1817, Father Narciso Durán, on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called &quot;Jesus Maria&quot;, from what is now the Marysville plains. Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer Luis Argüello and company, sighted two &quot;twin&quot; mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen. In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trader Peter Skene Ogden. In 1828, Mt. Shasta was seen by United States fur trapper Jedediah Smith; he named it &quot;Mt. Simpson&quot;. On April 11, 1828 Smith and his party traveled north and entered what is now Shasta County, and proceeded to what is now Burnt Ranch in Trinity County.

The earliest European American history of Palo Cedro comes from the exploration of Hudson&#x27;s Bay trapper Alexander McLeod (c. 1782 – 11 June 1840) who sometime between March 26, 1829 and April 6, 1829, along with guide John Turner, and a brigade of trappers, traveling through Mexican California, started from the Pit River following the Cow Creek trail, and reached the Sacramento River. Cow Creek is a Sacramento River tributary that runs through Palo Cedro and serves as its southeastern border. McLeod had been sent out earlier in January 1829 from Fort Vancouver to find the origins of a mythical Buenaventura River. After crossing the Sacramento River, McLeod explored and trapped in the Sacramento Valley as far South as present day Stockton. Upon his return with an abundant supply of furs, he camped on the west bank of the Sacramento River by present day Anderson in December 1829. While attempting to cross the Cascades in winter, McLeod was met by a snow storm at the headwaters of the river named after him, the &quot;McLeod River&quot; (McCloud River), he lost all his horses, was forced to cache his furs, and by snowshoe trek back to Vancouver, arriving on February 10, 1830. 
In 1832, another Hudson&#x27;s Bay trapper John Work (c.1792-1861), searching for a route to connect the Columbia River to the Sacramento River, reported in his journal traveling through Mexican California in with a group from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur traders, staying east of the Siskiyous, bypassing Mt. Lassen, along Cow Creek, through the areas now known as Millville and Palo Cedro, finding a way to the Sacramento Valley. In the surrounding area, Work noted there were local Indians who lived in huts, in addition to various wildlife and numerous animals, including deer, elk, and grizzly bears. Local Indian men gave Work and his men food. Work called Cow Creek, &quot;Canoe River&quot;, and his men chopped down pine trees to make canoes, camped near what is now called Anderson. During their stay, while his men were making the canoes, Work said the Indians were weeping and lamenting and observed six fires were burning in the Indian camp. Work later learned that the local Indian camp had been attacked and burned by another Indian raiding party, possibly the Shastas. After trapping in the Sacramento Valley, work retraced his steps to the Pit River, and using the same route as McLeod had earlier used through Bartle&#x27;s Gap, but without disaster, emerged from the mountains and was assisted back to Vancouver.

In 1846, on his third expedition, John C. Frémont and his military party, followed the Cow Creek, Walla Walla Trail through what is now Shasta County, headed north to Klammath Lake area in Oregon. Frémont&#x27;s guide for three federal expeditions was mountain man Kit Carson.

In June 1850, U.S. Army Captain Nathaniel Lyon, and his military party along with Colonel Freaner, left Pierson Reading&#x27;s Rancho Buena Ventura following Fremont&#x27;s route through the Cow Creek and Pit River. Lyon had been sent from Benicia by his government to avenge the death of Captain Warren. 

In 1883, a United States post office was established for this area; at that time, the town was known as Albertson. The name was changed to Roberts in 1885 and finally to Palo Cedro in 1893, meaning &quot;cedarwood&quot; in Spanish, after the cedar trees of the area.

In 1891, T. W. H. Shannahan and Joe Enright bought of land from Lem Benton and had it divided into 12 lots. The town never materialized or was developed, but the original cedar tree for which it was named was cut down. School children since then planted cedar trees at the Junction School District yard.

In 1897, or shortly before, the Anderson and Bella Vista Railroad was constructed by the Terry Lumber Company from Anderson to Bella Vista, passing through Palo Cedro. Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista. The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.

===20th and 21st centuries===

In the early 1900s, the stage route went from Redding through Palo Cedro, Millville, Oak Run, and on to Fall River Mills.

Palo Cedro&#x27;s first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the &quot;new&quot; Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.

In 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east. A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store. She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.

John Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer&#x27;s son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer&#x27;s building. Mary Jones&#x27; assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.

The first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44. The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.

As Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975. Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to a location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. In 2014 Rite Aid purchased both of the local pharmacies, Foothill Pharmacy and Palo Cedro Pharmacy; and opened a Rite Aid Pharmacy in late 2017 Northeast of Deschutes in the Holiday Shopping Center. Tri Counties Bank has a branch in town, along with four gas stations, several restaurants, several automotive repairs shops and a number of for profit and non-profit businesses that serve Palo Cedro and Eastern Shasta County.

<text>Redding is the county seat of Shasta County, California, and the economic and cultural capital of the Shasta Cascade region of Northern California. Redding lies along the Sacramento River, north of Sacramento, and south of California&#x27;s northern border with Oregon. Its population is 95,542 as of 2022, up from 93,611 at the 2020 census.

== Etymology ==
During the Gold Rush, the area that now comprises Redding was called Poverty Flats. In 1868 the first land agent for the Central Pacific Railroad, a former Sacramento politician named Benjamin Bernard Redding, bought property in Poverty Flats on behalf of the railroad so that it could build a northern terminus there. In the process of building the terminus, the railroad also built a town in the same area, which they named Redding in honor of Benjamin Redding.

In 1874, there was a dispute over the name by local legislators and it was changed for a time to Reading, in order to honor Pierson B. Reading, who arrived in the area in 1843, owned the Buenaventura land grant on which Redding sits, and had died only a few years before, in 1868. The name was officially changed back to Redding by 1880.

== History ==
=== Indigenous culture ===
The area is inhabited by a tribe of Native Americans called the Wintu. At their height, the Wintu had as many as 239 villages in the Shasta County area.

=== Spanish and Mexican eras ===
Although Europeans had been to California as early as 1542, when Juan Cabrillo sailed to what is now San Diego Bay, indigenous natives long remained the only inhabitants of the Northern California region.

The first European settlement in the area was established in 1844 by Pierson B. Reading, an early California pioneer who received a Rancho Buena Ventura Mexican land grant for that is now covered by Redding and Cottonwood, California. At the time, it was the northernmost nonnative settlement in California.

=== Gold Rush era ===
During the Gold Rush, 49ers found gold to the north on Rock, Middle and Salt creeks, near Shasta, California, and to the south along Oregon and Olney creeks but the area that is now Redding was poor placer gold ground and called Poverty Flats. In 1868 the first land agent for the Central Pacific Railroad, a former Sacramento politician named Benjamin B. Redding, bought property in Poverty Flats on behalf of the railroad for a northern terminus, which the tracks reached in 1872. In the process of building the terminus, the railroad also built the town of Redding which was officially incorporated on October 4, 1887. In 1888, Redding won the county seat from Shasta.

=== 20th century ===

In the early twentieth century the town&#x27;s economic growth was spurred by the significant copper and iron mineral extraction industry nearby. The mining industry eventually declined, causing the economy and population to falter by 1920. It recovered in the thirties as the economy boomed due to the construction of Shasta Dam to the northwest. The building of the dam, which was completed in 1945, caused Redding&#x27;s population to nearly double, also spurring the growth and development of other towns in the area.

Redding continued to grow steadily in the 1950s due to the region&#x27;s growing lumber industry and tourism brought about by the newly completed dam. The constructions of Whiskeytown and Keswick dams also helped boost the economy by bringing new workers to the area. Interstate 5 was built during the sixties and seventies, which added to development and tourism in the region.

Growth in Redding during the 1960s and 1970s was further spurred by the annexation of an area east of the Sacramento River that included the unincorporated community of Enterprise; the residents voted to support the annexation primarily to acquire less expensive electricity via Redding&#x27;s municipal utility, which receives power from the dam.

During the 1970s, the lumber industry suffered from decline. In the early 1990s Lumber mills in the area closed down due to the preservation of the living habitat of the Spotted Owl. This heavily impacted the Redding area. The economy picked up, due to a retail and housing boom in the late 1980s that continued until the mid-1990s.

Also in the 1970s, the Market Street Redevelopment Project, established in 1968, began the development of the Midtown Mall. The mall was established to prevent further property deterioration and to restore and maintain the economic health of the downtown area&#x27;s commercial and retail activity. The mall suffered multiple difficulties. The passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 reduced the mall&#x27;s property valuation and consequently, the city had to continuously loan money to keep the bonds for the mall&#x27;s parking structure from going into default; the bonds completely repaid in 2003 and Midtown began to pay off its more than $1.5 million debt to the City of Redding. By the 1980s, the properties around the mall and along the old State Highway 99/273 corridor continued to suffer urban blight, including deteriorating and dilapidated utilities and structures and inappropriate mixed land uses; this required further public intervention in the form of another Market Street Redevelopment Project with significant changes to Midtown in 1990 to include a mix of residential and commercial land around the original project.

=== 21st century ===
Following redevelopment of Midtown, property values within the Market Street Redevelopment Project area improved; further redevelopment continued. A plan for the downtown area adopted in January 2001 led to the renovation of the historic Cascade Theatre, the removal of the Midtown Mall roof creating an open air pedestrian street, the installation of a visitor way-finding system, the completion of a Health Sciences and University Center with partnership with Shasta College, and the renovation of various buildings along California Street with the help of a private developer.

In 2017, the city adopted a new flag after holding a redesign contest.

The 21st century has also seen a number of devastating wildfires near and in Redding. In 1999, the Jones Fire destroyed over 100 structures, followed by the Bear Fire in 2004. In late July 2018, the Carr Fire in Shasta County seriously impacted the Redding area with the destruction of at least 1,100 buildings, with several thousand more threatened, 38,000 people instructed to evacuate and 8 deaths. Most recently, the Fawn Fire in 2021 also resulted in the evacuation of over 4,000 people and the destruction of 185 buildings.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land, and of it (2.50%) is beneath water.

Redding is located at the very northwestern end of the Central Valley, which transitions into the Cascade foothills. The city is surrounded by mountains to the north, east, and west and fertile farm land to the south. Outermost parts of the city are part of the Cascade foothills, whereas southern and central areas are in the Sacramento Valley.

The elevation in Redding is on average, whereas anywhere to the north, east, or west of downtown ranges between . Southern portions range between .

The Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River provides a considerable level of flood protection for Redding. The dam is capable of controlling flows up to 79,000 cubic feet (7,300 cubic meters) per second. The flow rate exceeded this threshold in both 1970 and 1974.

Soils in and around town are composed mostly of clay or gravelly loam texture, with red or brown mineral horizons. They are slightly or moderately acidic in their natural state.

There are several rare and endangered species in Redding and its immediate vicinity. The Redding Redevelopment Plan EIR notes the California State listed endangered species, slender Orcutt grass (&quot;Orcuttia tenuis&quot;), occurs in eastern Redding near the municipal airport, where vernal pools are known to exist. This endemic grass is a Federal Candidate for listing and is endangered throughout its range, confined to several populations, and seriously threatened by agriculture, overgrazing, and residential development. Vernal pools provide the preferred habitat for this plant, which the California Native Plant Society considers a rare and endangered species. These same vernal pools also support federally protected species such as the federally threatened vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi).

=== Climate ===
Redding has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with very hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Redding is known for very high summer temperatures, despite being located north of the 40th parallel north. The somewhat strange juxtaposition of its northern position within the United States and non-desert climate, with the extreme summer heat, has long been noted by visitors and residents. The exceptional temperatures found in the city are often cited in national news sources.

Winter (October–April) provides the most precipitation of any season in Redding—the weather tends to be either rainy or foggy and at times, snow occurs. While summers are mostly hot and dry, thunderstorms are not uncommon. The average daily maximum temperature in July stays near . The highest official recorded temperature in Redding is on July 6, 2024. Redding has an average possible sunshine of 88%, the second-highest percentage (after Yuma, Arizona) of any US city.

Summer overnight lows are unusually warm by Sacramento Valley standards and average warmer than coastal towns&#x27; daytime highs. The warmest night annually averages . Since the station opened in 1986, the hottest night was in June 2004. Redding&#x27;s warm summer days and nights compared to areas further south are a result of a greater distance to maritime influences than the lower end of the valley.

Redding occasionally receives snow, though it has received as much as of snow in a single storm, occurring on December 4–7, 1909 and December 22–24, 1968, including on December 23, 1968, the most in any calendar day on record. It rarely gets sleet or freezing rain. Frost occurs commonly in December through February, less often in March or November. In spring, rain is common. The city is located near the foothills of the Cascade and Klamath mountain ranges and it therefore gets much more rain than most places in the Sacramento Valley. The Northern parts of the city can get up to a few more inches of rain a year due to its closer location to the mountains; temperature differentials between land and sea cause moist air from the latter to flow over the southern Sacramento valley during the summer months, producing intense heat in Redding. The direction of this winds switches from the north and east in the summer, as hot, high-pressure air flows from land to sea, making the area very dry. Tornadoes are extremely rare; flooding occurs only around the area near the Sacramento River. The coldest temperature recorded in Redding was on January 17, 2012, and December 9, 2009. The average coldest daytime high of the year is and the lowest on record is in 1990, which remains the latest year to record an ice day.

<text>Round Mountain is a census-designated place in Shasta County, California, United States. Its population is 160 as of the 2020 census, up from 155 from the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Round Mountain is located at (40.799633, -121.943058).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , 99.60% of it land and 0.40% of it water.

Round Mountain is the geographic center of the Achomawi and Atsugewi or &quot;Pit River&quot; first nation. The &quot;Pit River&quot; tribe has never signed a treaty with the federal government and remains a strong force of opposition to federal control.

Round Mountain is the home of Hill Country Health and Wellness Center, one of the most solvent clinics in California. It also has the highest awarded LEEDS construction certificates of any clinic in California. Hill Country maintains a large youth facility.

Some organic farmers in Round Mountain are members of the Shasta Regional Seed Cooperative and work together to maintain hundreds of heirloom food crops as well as bio-dynamic farming techniques. Many residents are off the grid, using hydroelectric, solar and wind resources for their home power. Some of these forward-thinking residents also maintain local crime-watch activities and network projects to advance the sustainability of the region.

A large electrical substation is in the area, and power lines (Path 66 and a set of connecting wires to Path 15) run through the town.

A second substation was planned, then canceled, in 2009, along with of electrical lines from central California thru Round Mountain and then northbound. This plan, called TANC (Transmission Authority of Northern California), was halted by citizens who produced presentations statewide, showing that Department of Energy data conflicted with the project&#x27;s stated goals. This 1.4 billion dollar TANC project was stopped in about 90 days.

Cedar Creek Elementary School is not currently operating as most Round Mountain students are attending schools in the Mountain Union (K-8) District in nearby Montgomery Creek. Round Mountain Community Center is administered through the local Lion&#x27;s Club/VFW and has capacity for about 200.

The geography in Round Mountain has been at times very unstable. Several homes, a store, and a nightclub have been among buildings destroyed in landslides. Many of the power lines in the area appear to be constantly repaired due to shifting foundations. After both the Fountain Fire and the introduction of power lines (which increased erosion due to construction as well as due to a program to maintain low or no vegetation under and alongside high-tension wires), slides in the area increased. The location of a major road reconstruction project in 2009 of &quot;the fountain&quot; (a set of curves leading into Round Mountain from the west) became the scene of major shifting, road buckling, and surface water eruptions in the first rain season after completion.

Local geography invites fishing, mountain climbing, and hiking as well as opportunities to experience some of California&#x27;s wildest land.

<text>The City of Shasta Lake, known as Central Valley or CV prior to incorporation, is a city in Shasta County, California, United States. It is the closest settlement to Shasta Dam and Shasta Lake reservoir, which are popular tourist destinations. Its population is 10,371 as of the 2020 census, up from 10,164 from the 2010 census.

==History==

Shasta Lake City started out as five small communities named Central Valley, Toyon, Project City, Pine Grove, and Summit City, all of which came about with the beginning of construction of Shasta Dam in 1938. Project City was built at the intersection of U.S. Route 99 and Shasta Dam Boulevard; a larger Central Valley at a midpoint on Shasta Dam Boulevard; Summit City at the intersection of Shasta Dam and Lake boulevards; and Pine Grove at what today is the intersection of Interstate 5 and Pine Grove Avenue.

=== Toyon ===
The Bureau of Reclamation built the town of Toyon, first called Government Camp. Toyon was the premier community, built on of what was once the Seaman Ranch. By 1950 Toyon had two tennis courts, an outdoor basketball court, a Community Center, green lawns, concrete side walks, commercial water and power from Shasta Dam, its own sewage treatment plant, and its own landfill. Initially, Toyon also had two large dormitories for bachelor employees. All the residents of Toyon worked for the US Bureau of Reclamation. Bureau headquarters office and maintenance facilities were located on Kenneth Avenue, parallel to Shasta Dam Boulevard.

All bureau employees were forced to vacate Toyon by the end of 1964 when the facility was turned over to the Job Corps as a work camp as a part of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Great Society. The Job Corps supervision ended in 1972. Toyon was subsequently occupied by local Native Americans who hoped to stake claim and have Toyon recognized as tribal lands; this did not occur. Water and electric power were turned off after the Native Americans failed to pay a $28,000 utility bill. Conflicts between law enforcement and the occupying Native Americans continued, and a large number of the homes burned to the ground. The historic Seaman Ranch Community House and the large USBR headquarters building also burned to the ground in this era. Today, one metal storage building and the flagpole are the only remaining structures other than overgrown streets and sidewalks. The site is fenced off from Shasta Dam Boulevard.

The workers at Shasta Dam built these communities because land was cheap and most families needed low-cost housing while working on the dam. Later on, Central Valley became the commercial hub of workers on Shasta Dam. Initially, there was no water supply for these new communities, and attempts at digging wells produced very limited water supplies.

When oil production slowed down in the 1970s, Redding surpassed Central Valley in population in 1965 when it incorporated the community of Enterprise. The population figures in 1980 were Central Valley at 3,424, Project City at 1,659, and Summit City at 1,139. Talk of incorporation spread in the early 1990s and it became a reality on July 2, 1993, when 60% of the communities&#x27; people voted for incorporation.

Several restaurants, gas stations and a few motels encompass the area of the Shasta Dam Boulevard and Interstate 5 interchange. These were all built around 2000, and several more fast food outlets and motels are planned for this interchange.

Shasta Lake is located at (40.678167, -122.370003).

===Local===
Because Loyalton is Sierra County&#x27;s most populous municipality and its only incorporated city, the location of the Sierra County Board of Supervisors twice-monthly meetings alternate between Downieville, Sierra County&#x27;s county seat, and the city of Loyalton.

The City of Loyalton&#x27;s total expenditures for 2012 were $1.2 million, funded mostly from outside sources such as federal and county grants. Local tax collection revenue that year was $163,000. In 2016, the city recovered over $400,000 that had been embezzled by an employee but it still faces an $80,000 budget shortfall.

In 2012, the Loyalton City Council decided to withdraw from CalPERS because its last employee with a guaranteed pension had retired. The city had been fully paying its required annual contribution of $30,000 and had only four remaining pensioners. CalPERS then demanded $1.6 million from the city. CalPERS publicly uses actuarial present value to calculate member contributions but when a member withdraws it utilizes a non-public calculation to define unfunded liabilities. Loyalton has not yet paid the bill so CalPERS is charging 7.5% annual interest and had sent a final demand letter in September 2016.

==In popular culture==

Loyalton was extensively used as a filming location in the 1949 movie &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot;, starring Bette Davis and Joseph Cotten, and directed by King Vidor. Main street business facades are featured, as are the evident owners of the businesses and other townspeople. In the script, the town is referred to as &quot;Loyalton, Wisconsin.&quot;

<doc id="108203" wikidata="Q611982" url="?curid=108203" title="Dunsmuir, California">
<text>Dunsmuir is a city in Siskiyou County, California. It is on the upper Sacramento River. Its population is 1,707 as of the 2020 census, up from 1,650 from the 2010 census.

Dunsmuir is currently a hub for tourism in Northern California, with Interstate 5 passing through it. Visitors enjoy fishing, skiing, climbing, or sight-seeing. During the steam locomotive railroad era, it was the site of an important Central Pacific (and later Southern Pacific) railroad yard, where extra steam locomotives were added to assist trains on the grade to the north.

==Commerce and tourism==

Located in the Shasta Cascade area of Northern California, Dunsmuir is a popular destination for tourists. Visitors come to fish trout in the Sacramento and McCloud Rivers, or to see and climb Mount Shasta, Castle Crags or the Trinity Alps. Visitors ski (both alpine and cross-country) and bicycle, or can hike to the waterfalls, streams and lakes in the area, including nearby Mossbrae Falls, Hedge Creek Falls, Lake Siskiyou, Castle Lake and Shasta Lake.

Dunsmuir is located on the Upper Sacramento River, a blue ribbon trout stream that attracts fishermen from all over the world. Wild rainbow trout abound in the river. Additionally, the city has a private stocking permit from the Department of Fish and Game. The city currently has a &quot;Big Fish Program&quot; and stocks the river within the city limits with trophy-sized rainbow trout up to . These stockings take place during the summer months. Catch-and-release fishing is permitted in the river during the off-season, so fly-fishing is available year-round.

The town is also a destination for historical and cultural tourists, as the town has preserved an authentic 1920s and 1930s look and feel. Dunsmuir&#x27;s long connection with the railroad draws railfans to enjoy the sights and sounds of the railroad in the steep Sacramento River canyon. Dunsmuir is officially a Union Pacific &quot;Train Town&quot; and enjoys many financial benefits because of its relationship with the railroad.

During the summer, the city hosts many local weekend festivals, including &quot;State of Jefferson Brewfest&quot;, &quot;Dogwood Daze&quot;, &quot;Railroad Days&quot; and the &quot;Tribute to the Trees&quot; al fresco dinner/concert along the river in the city&#x27;s pristine park, home to Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens. The city also has another river&#x27;s edge park, Tauhindauli Park, over which passes the I-5 freeway, and several popular easy-access fishing spots.

==History==

Sites in and near Dunsmuir have been inhabited for over 5000 years. At least three waves of early peoples swept through area, establishing residence. At the time of the first European-American contact in the 1820s, the site of Dunsmuir was within the range of the Okwanuchu tribe of Native Americans.

During the 1820s, early European-American hunters and trappers passed through Dunsmuir&#x27;s site, following the Siskiyou Trail. In the mid-1830s, pioneer horse and cattle drives came up the Sacramento Canyon, delivering livestock from Mexican California to the new settlements in the Oregon Country to the north. In 1841, an overland party of the famous United States Exploring Expedition passed through the area.

The California Gold Rush led to increased traffic along the Siskiyou Trail through Dunsmuir&#x27;s site, leading to the first non-Native American settlers at Upper Soda Springs in north Dunsmuir in the early 1850s. The discovery of gold at Yreka, California dramatically increased movement through the site of Dunsmuir, and a toll bridge and stagecoach hotel were built at Upper Soda Springs.

In 1887, the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad along the line of the Siskiyou Trail led to the creation of the modern town of Dunsmuir. The railroad developed a division point on the flats south of Upper Soda Springs, where railroad steam engines would be serviced, and added to trains to push them up the steep grades north of town. A roundhouse and turntable were built. All this activity required the creation of a town, initially known as &#x27;Poverty Flats&#x27; or &#x27;Pusher&#x27;. South of the present downtown and north of Castella is an area known as Nutglade, which was previously known as Dunsmuir and before that, Cedar Flat. So the name moved north from the South rail yard to the main rail yard. During the railroad heyday, Dunsmuir was the largest town in this County which is the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.

In 1888, Alexander Dunsmuir, second son of British Columbian coal baron Robert Dunsmuir, was passing through, and according to contemporary accounts, was so taken with the beauty of the area that he offered to donate a fountain to the new town, if they would rename the town in his honor.

By the early 1900s, Dunsmuir was the largest town in Siskiyou County, and for a long time had been the largest California city north of Sacramento. The construction of the Pacific Highway along the Siskiyou Trail in the mid-1910s brought more tourists. By the mid-1950s, the railroad transitioned from steam to diesel locomotives, and the substantial workforce in Dunsmuir was not needed, resulting in the town&#x27;s contraction. Interstate 5 runs through the canyon along with the railroad and the upper Sacramento River.

As a result, Dunsmuir retains today much of the charm and scale of the 1920s and 1930s, and has been designated on the National Register of Historic Places. The downtown area is now a designated historic district. The California Theater, after fifty years without an organ, were able to acquire and re-install their original Wurlitzer instrument.

In July 1935, two fugitives were passing through town. Police Chief F.R. &quot;Jack&quot; Daw, and California Highway Patrol Officer C. &quot;Doc&quot; Malone went to catch them. The criminals ambushed the officers wounding Officer Malone and killing Chief Daw. One of the criminals, Clyde Johnson, was caught and put in jail in Yreka to await trial. A group of vigilantes from Dunsmuir went to Yreka, broke Johnson out of jail and lynched him. To this day the identity of those vigilantes has never been formally acknowledged. It is said to have been the last public lynching in California.

===California&#x27;s largest hazardous chemical spill===
On the night of July 14, 1991, a Southern Pacific train derailed into the upper Sacramento River at a horseshoe curve of track known as the Cantara Loop, upstream from Dunsmuir. Several cars made contact with the water, including a tank car. On the morning of July 15, it became apparent that the tank car had ruptured and spilled its entire contents into the river – approximately 19,000 gallons of the soil fumigant metam sodium. Ultimately, over a million fish, and tens of thousands of amphibians and crayfish were killed. Millions of aquatic invertebrates, including insects and mollusks, which form the basis of the river&#x27;s ecosystem, were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of willows, alders, and cottonwoods eventually died. Many more were severely injured. The chemical plume left a 41-mile wake of destruction, from the spill site to the entry point of the river into Shasta Lake. The accident still ranks as the largest hazardous chemical spill in California history.

The Upper Sacramento River is now largely recovered from the spill though some species (crayfish and frogs) have not yet come back. The watershed is carefully stewarded by The Upper Sacramento River Exchange. The popular fishery is again healthy. Recent changes to angling regulations have opened the Upper Sacramento River to catch-and-release fishing all year round. Five-pound trout have often been caught right in the city.

==City parks and botanical gardens==
Dunsmuir has numerous parks located throughout the city. 
Dunsmuir City Park and Botanical Gardens is a municipal park and botanical garden maintained by Dunsmuir Botanical Gardens Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization of volunteers within Dunsmuir City Park. It requires public support to maintain the Gardens, which are on City of Dunsmuir property under the general control of Siskiyou County, via the Board of Directors of the Dunsmuir Park &amp; Recreation District. In 1924, New York Yankees Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel visited the park as part of a barnstorming tour, playing an exhibition baseball game against Dunsmuir locals.

Tauhindauli Park and Trail is on the former site of Upper Soda Springs resort along the Sacramento River canyon. It consists of approximately of level ground on the bank of the river, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park, in the heart of Dunsmuir. Long a local fishing spot, swimming hole, and site of both historical and ecological significance, the site has been improved to enhance its recreational opportunities and aesthetics. Environmental work and levee restructuring has improved flood control for the entire town. The Tauhindauli river restoration project created a park with pathways winding through native grasses and plants, with fishing access and picnic areas. For ecological and flood-control purposes, riparian forests and meadows have been restored close to their original condition. Levees have been moved and built up for maximum protection for the park from river erosion and to restore the watershed to the natural habitat which provides food for animals. The Park can be accessed from River Avenue. to the south and Stagecoach Road to Upper Soda Springs Road in the canyon. Tauhindauli Park and Trail was a project of the Dunsmuir Garden Club. Funding for this project came principally from the Cantara Trustee Council and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

==Historic resorts and waterfalls==
Shasta Springs was the name of a popular summer resort on the Upper Sacramento River, during the late Nineteenth Century and early Twentieth Century. It was located just north of the City of Dunsmuir, California and just north of Upper Soda Springs along the Siskiyou Trail in northern California

Upper Soda Springs is on the banks of the Sacramento River in Dunsmuir, California. It consists of approximately of level ground on both sides of the River, the surrounding hillsides, and continues north along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River to the Dunsmuir City Park. The State of California and the City of Dunsmuir are creating a new park on this historic site. The Upper Soda Springs site contains a riparian ecosystem and includes its namesake mineral water springs. In large part because of its location on the Siskiyou Trail, the site mirrors the history of the state and of the American West.

Mossbrae Falls is a waterfall flowing into the Upper Sacramento River, in the Shasta Cascade area in Dunsmuir, California. The falls are located just south of the lower portion of Shasta Springs. Access to the falls via a mile-long hiking trail on the Union Pacific Railroad tracks is currently closed, as Union Pacific and the City of Dunsmuir figure out a safer route to the falls.

Hedge Creek Falls is a waterfall on Hedge Creek, in the Shasta Cascade area in Dunsmuir, California. There is a small cave located behind the waterfall, allowing visitors to walk behind the cascading water. Shortly after the waterfall, Hedge Creek flows into the Sacramento River south of Mossbrae Falls. There is a viewing platform over the river, with a view of Mount Shasta. Access to the waterfall and viewing platform is via a short hiking trail. The trail starts at a small park off the Dunsmuir Ave/Siskiyou Ave exit on Interstate 5. The close proximity to Interstate 5 makes the waterfall a very popular stopping point for passing motorists. Charles E. Bolton, better known as Black Bart, robbed the Roseburg, Oregon to Redding, California stage near Dunsmuir on October 25, 1879. Evidence found at the time indicated that Bart hid in the shallow cave behind the falls prior to the holdup. This was one of three holdups committed by Black Bart in this area. Normally he operated much further south.

==Geography==
Dunsmuir is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 97.86% of it land and 2.14% of it water.

At an elevation of approximately above sea level, a unique setting is created by the Sacramento River in which class 3 whitewater rapids are usually created during summer run off through a town of about 2,000 residents. In plain view from some of the city&#x27;s public streets, this may be one of the few places in western North America where three categories of &quot;twos&quot; (population, elevation, and whitewater difficulty) are met or eclipsed. (Eastern US example: the Cherry River at Richwood, WV)

Mt. Shasta&#x27;s lava layers filter the drinking water and eliminate the need for filtration or treatment; thus the town&#x27;s marketing slogan, &quot;Home Of The Best Water On Earth&quot;. Three water fountains are located on Dunsmuir Avenue in the Historic District. Two of the fountains previously ran 24 hours a day, however have since been changed in 2015 to only flow on demand due to water conservation measures placed on the state of California by Governor Jerry Brown.

<text>Fort Jones is a town in the Scott Valley area of Siskiyou County, California, United States. Like many of the communities that surround Mount Shasta, it lies in the southern tip of the Cascadia bioregion. Its population is 695 as of the 2020 census, down from 839 from the 2010 census.

==History==
===Naming===
Fort Jones is registered as a California Historical Landmark. It takes its name from the frontier outpost once located less than a mile to the south of the city&#x27;s corporate limits. The town was originally named Scottsburg (c. 1850), but was changed to Scottsville shortly afterward. In 1852, the site was again renamed Wheelock, this time in honor of Mr. O. C. Wheelock who, with his partners, established the area&#x27;s first commercial enterprise. In 1854, a post office was established and the town was renamed again, becoming known as Ottitiewa, the Indian name for the Scott River branch of the Shasta tribe. The name remained unchanged until 1860 when local citizens successfully petitioned the postal department to change the name to Fort Jones, a name that is retained to the present day.

The earliest permanent building at the town site was built in 1851 by two Messrs. Brown and Kelly. It was purchased soon after construction by O. C. Wheelock, Captain John B. Pierce, and two other unknown partners. Wheelock and his partners established a trading post, a bar, and a brothel at this site, which primarily served the troopers stationed at the fort. Near the end of the 1850s, the nearby mining camps of Hooperville and Deadwood began to disband as a result of the dwindling stores of placer gold, epidemic illness and devastating fires.

The mines around Scott Valley attracted many immigrants from many parts of the United States and the world, attracted to the area by news of the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. Irish and Portuguese immigrants remained as ranchers in the area after making enough on the gold fields to purchase property tracts in the valley. In the early years of the twentieth century, the northern Scott River tributaries of Moffitt and McAddams creeks were extensively settled by the Portuguese. The Irish surname Marlahan lives on after that family received a shipment of British hay seed infected with the seed of a plant known as Dyers Woad. Those seeds spread their spawn throughout Scott Valley, culturing a plant known in the area as &quot;Marlahan Mustard&quot;. The plant has a beautiful, canary plume in the spring which matures to small, black, hard seeds. Unfortunately, the herbivore beasts of burden will not eat hay in which this plant exists, and ever since it has been a scourge on the ranchers of Scott Valley.

On December 14, 1894, Billy Dean, a Native American, was lynched by unknown persons in the town of Happy Camp, California while in the custody of Constable Fred Dixon. Dean was accused of shooting co-worker William Baremore near Grinder Creek outside of Happy Camp on December 5, 1894. Constable Dixon and Dean were staying at a hotel in Happy Camp while on their way the Yreka, California jail, where Dean would be safe from local vigilantes. Baremore&#x27;s friends were tailing the pair and waited for their moment. At two in the morning on December 14, 1894, a dozen masked men stormed the room and disarmed Constable Dixon. They tied Dean&#x27;s hands and carried him to the Wheeler Building which was under construction where they strung him up by the neck from a derrick. His body was left hanging until 11:00 a.m. That day&#x27;s headline in the Scott Valley News boasted, &quot;He Is Now A Good Indian. Billy Dean Kills a White Man Without Cause and Is Summarily Hoisted to the Happy Hunting Ground.&quot;

===Fort Jones===
Located at , the post of Fort Jones was established on October 18, 1852, by its first commandant, Captain (brevet Major) Edward H. Fitzgerald, E Company, 1st U.S. Dragoons. Fort Jones was named in honor of Colonel Roger Jones, who had been the Adjutant General of the Army from March 1825 to July 1852.

Such military posts were to be established in the vicinity of major stage routes, which would have meant locating the post in the vicinity of Yreka, to the Northeast. The areas around Yreka did not contain sufficient resources, including forage for their animals, so Capt. Fitzgerald located his troop some sixteen miles to the southwest, in what was then known as &quot;Beaver Valley&quot;. Fort Jones would continue to serve Siskiyou County&#x27;s military needs until the order was received to evacuate six years later, on June 23, 1858.

Among the officers stationed at Fort Jones who would attain national prominence in ensuing years were Phil Sheridan (Union Army); William Wing Loring (Confederate); John B. Hood (Confederate); George Crook (Union), who would become one of the greatest leaders of the Grand Army of the Republic less than a decade later; and George Pickett (Confederate). Ulysses S. Grant later a (Union) commander was ordered to Fort Jones, but resigned from the Army before his tenure was to begin.

==Nestle plant==
In 2006 Nestlé began a negotiations process with the town of McCloud to build one of the nation&#x27;s largest bottled water plants and use a portion of the water flowing from the springs of Mt. Shasta. The contract process was protested by local special interest groups whose claims include that Nestle neglected to study the impact on the region&#x27;s ground water and have overstated the potential economic benefits of the proposed plant. On May 13, 2008 AP Press reported that Nestle announced plans to reduce the size of the proposed McCloud Bottled Water plant to from the originally-planned proposal. Nestle also agreed to monitor the impact of the plant on the local watershed for two years. Nestle opened a different bottling plant in Sacramento, in July 2009, and then in September 2009 Nestle announced they would no longer pursue any bottling operation in McCloud. Nestle plans to sell the property they had acquired for the bottling site, which was the site of the defunct McCloud lumber mill (closed by last mill owners CalCedar).

On July 1, 2014, the former McCloud River Lumber Company site was purchased by an eclectic group of investors, McCloud Partners, LLC. This group has revived the property after being closed, vandalized, and abandoned for almost two decades. McCloud Partners has turned the property into a self funded enterprise zone that supports new business, employment opportunities, and new ideas. The property hosts several fire agencies and fire agency support services. It has hosted 3 CalFire Fire Camps with abundant water resources, an air support dipping pond, and hostfacilities. The importance of property stewardship shows the priority how the partnership values the community in where it&#x27;s located.

<text>Mount Shasta (also known as Mount Shasta City) is a city in Siskiyou County, California, United States, at about above sea level on the flanks of Mount Shasta, a prominent northern California landmark. The city is less than southwest of the summit of its namesake volcano. Its population is 3,223 as of the 2020 census, down from 3,394 from the 2010 census. 

==History==
The site of the present-day city of Mount Shasta was within the range of the Okwanuchu tribe of Native Americans. 

During the 1820s, early Euro-American trappers and hunters first passed through the area, following the path of the Siskiyou Trail. The Siskiyou Trail was based on a network of ancient Native American footpaths connecting California and the Pacific Northwest. The discovery of gold at nearby Yreka, California in 1851 dramatically increased traffic along the Siskiyou Trail and through the site of present-day Mount Shasta. Pioneer Ross McCloud built one of the first lumber mills in the area, near the site of the present Sisson Museum. The completion of a stagecoach road between Yreka and Upper Soda Springs in the late 1850s led to the building of Sisson&#x27;s Hotel, as a stop for weary travelers, and as a staging ground for adventuresome tourists intending to climb Mount Shasta.

The area where the town grew was known first as Strawberry Valley, and then as Berryvale. The post office opened in 1870 as Berryvale. After 1886 it was known as Sisson after a local businessman, Justin Hinckley Sisson who ran a stagecoach inn and tavern, Strawberry Valley Station, as well as donated the land for the town site and the Central Pacific Railroad station in 1886. Street names honor members of Sisson&#x27;s family.

The 1887 completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail, brought a dramatic increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into Mount Shasta. This early development continued to focus on tourism and lumbering. The early 1900s saw the influx of a large number of Italian immigrants to Mount Shasta and neighboring towns, most of whom were employed in the timber industry.

The city incorporated on May 31, 1905. The name of the city was finalized &quot;City of Mount Shasta&quot; on November 10, 1925, after a popular vote in 1922.

==Geography==
Mount Shasta is located at 41°18&#x27;52&quot; North, 122°18&#x27;41&quot; West (41.314542, -122.311510), along Interstate 5 south of Weed and north of Dunsmuir, California.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and only 0.10% of it is covered by water.

The area hydrology consists of an unnamed stream in the south part of town which joins Big Springs Creek, which then flows south as Cold Creek to join the headwaters of the South Fork of the Sacramento River. The typical depth to groundwater is quite shallow in the predominant alluvium.

The settlement is on the distal gently sloping southwest flanks of Mount Shasta, with the chief surficial soils being Quaternary alluvium. This alluvium is adjacent to and probably underlain by volcanic clastic rock deposited by Mount Shasta in the course of its development. Groundwater elevation is approximately at the elevation of the underlying native black peat soil. Where it occurs this peat, of approximately two feet thickness, is underlain by stream deposit sands and gravels.

=== Climate ===
Mount Shasta to the east forces moisture out of the air as it rises and cools, and the dip in the Klamath Mountains allows more moisture to reach inland, so the city receives more precipitation than the semiarid region to the north. This means that in the winter, the city gets nearly of snowfall despite its low elevation. Other towns in the region get much less snow, for example Yreka averages only , and much cooler Klamath Falls only . The Köppen climate classification is &quot;Csb&quot;, or warm-summer Mediterranean climate. It can be very warm and cold according to the Californian summer anex. The USDA hardiness zone is 7b.

The record high temperature was on July 29, 2022, and the record low temperature was on December 22, 1990. The wettest “rain year” was from July 1997 to June 1998 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with . The most rainfall in one month was in January 1995, including on January 9. The most snowfall in one year was in 1952, including in January 1952. The most snow on the ground was on December 31, 1992.

<doc id="108218" wikidata="Q823127" url="?curid=108218" title="New Jersey Route 56">
<text>Route 56 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. Also known as Landis Avenue, it runs from an intersection with Route 77 and County Route 622 (CR 622) in Upper Deerfield Township, Cumberland County, to an intersection with Route 47 (Delsea Drive) in Vineland, Cumberland County. The route serves as a connector between Bridgeton and Vineland. West of the interchange with Route 55 in Vineland, Route 56 is a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas of Cumberland County, also entering a corner of Salem County. East of Route 55, the route is a four-lane locally maintained road that runs through commercial areas of Vineland.

The portion of current Route 56 in Vineland was built as a 100-foot (30 m) wide road when Vineland was planned in the 1860s, serving as the main east–west road through the community. In the past, the Route 56 number was used twice for a never-built road between the Laurelton Circle and Mantoloking in Ocean County legislated in 1938 and for the portion of U.S. Route 30 between current Route 157 and Atlantic City between 1938 and 1953. The current iteration of Route 56 was legislated in 1977 to run from Route 77 north of Bridgeton to Route 47 in Vineland, replacing County Route 22 between Route 77 and the Salem County border, County Route 6 within Salem County, and County Route 23 between the Salem County border and Route 47. This portion of road was designated as Route 56 in October 1983. In 2007, two bridges along the route were replaced. The Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township was rebuilt after it was washed out by the April 2007 Nor&#x27;easter while the Maurice River bridge was reconstructed to make it wider and higher.

==Route description==

Route 56 begins at Route 77 and CR 622 in Upper Deerfield Township, Cumberland County, a short distance north of Bridgeton. From this intersection, the route heads to the northeast as two-lane undivided Landis Avenue. Shortly after it begins, it passes businesses and intersects CR 611. From here, Route 56 turns to the east-northeast and passes a mix of residences and farm fields. The route comes to a five-way junction with CR 553 and CR 687 before intersecting County Route 645. The road heads into Deerfield Township, coming to a junction with CR 686. Past this intersection, Route 56 continues toward the community of Rosenhayn. Here, the road intersects CR 737 before running past homes and crossing CR 634, where there are some businesses along the road. A short distance later, the route intersects CR 717, where it crosses into Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.
Route 56 heads through a mix of farms and woodland, passing to the south of Rainbow Lake. Past the lake, the road turns to the east and continues into agricultural areas and intersects CR 655. Traveling eastward, the road crosses CR 638 and a Winchester and Western Railroad line. The route heads into forested areas, where it passes over the Maurice River into Vineland in Cumberland County. Here, it widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 55. Past this interchange, Route 56 becomes a four-lane undivided road that is locally maintained. The route heads through commercial sectors of Vineland before coming to a crossroads with CR 628. The route continues past more inhabited areas and businesses before reaching its end at Route 47 (Delsea Drive). From here, Landis Avenue continues to the east toward the downtown area of Vineland.

==History==
The portion of Route 56 in Vineland was built as a wide road when Vineland was planned in the 1860s, serving as the main east–west road through the community. In 1938, two separate roads numbered Route 56 were legislated. One was located in Ocean County and was to run from the Laurelton Circle east to Mantoloking; this road was never built. The other was located in the Atlantic City area along U.S. Route 30 (Absecon Boulevard) east of current Route 157; the Route 56 designation on this road was dropped in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. What is modern-day Route 56 was originally designated as County Route 22 between Route 77 and the Salem County border, County Route 6 in Salem County, and County Route 23 between the Salem County border and Route 47. In 1977, Route 56 was legislated onto its current alignment between Route 77 in Upper Deerfield Township and Route 47 in Vineland, replacing County Routes 6, 22, and 23. The route was designated in October 1983.

Due to the April 2007 Nor&#x27;easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township was washed out and the New Jersey Department of Transportation had to replace it with a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic traveling between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.

<doc id="108219" wikidata="Q985254" url="?curid=108219" title="Weed, California">
<text>Weed is a city in Siskiyou County, California, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the city had a total population of 2,862, down from 2,967 in 2010. There are several unincorporated communities adjacent to, or just outside, Weed proper, including Edgewood, Carrick, and Lake Shastina. These communities generally have mailing addresses that use Weed or its ZIP code. Weed is about west-northwest of Mount Shasta, a prominent northern California landmark, and the second-tallest volcano in the Cascade Range.

Weed&#x27;s city motto is &quot;Weed like to welcome you&quot;. Weed has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==History==
The City of Weed derives its name from the founder of the local lumber mill and pioneer Abner Weed, who discovered that the area&#x27;s strong winds were helpful in drying lumber. In 1897, Abner Weed bought the Siskiyou Lumber and Mercantile Mill and of land in what is now the City of Weed, for $400. By the 1940s Weed boasted the world&#x27;s largest sawmill.

===Boles Fire===
On September 15, 2014, the Boles Fire spread through Weed, driven by 40-mph winds. The fire started behind the Boles Creek Apartments in the central part of Weed at approximately 1:30 p.m., and within four hours quickly spread to over . Evacuations were immediately ordered, and a shelter was first set up at College of the Siskiyous, but as fire headed towards the college, the evacuation center was relocated first to the Siskiyou Golden Fairgrounds in Yreka, then to Yreka and Mount Shasta High Schools, then to the armory in Mt. Shasta.

Over 200 structures were damaged or destroyed, including two churches, the elementary school, high school, and Roseburg mill. The schools and mill sustained only minimal damage to outbuildings. About 7,678 Pacific Power customers in both Weed and Mt. Shasta lost power as a result of the fire.

=== Beaughan Spring ===

The City of Weed gets its water from the Beaughan Spring, with the water being piped directly to homes.

In September 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that French billionaire Pierre Papillaud demanded that Weed give up its Beaughan Spring spring water source so that Papillaud&#x27;s bottle water company could have more water to sell. Disconnecting from Beaughan Spring would leave Weed without public water. In March 2021, it was reported that the parties involved had reached a compromise which will allow Weed to continue to have access to water from Beaughan Spring in perpetuity.

===Mill Fire===

In early September 2022, the Mill Fire started in or near Weed, burning down the Lincoln Heights neighborhood.

==Geography==
Weed is off Interstate 5, south of the California–Oregon border. The next large settlement to the north on I-5 is Yreka; to the south is the City of Mount Shasta. U.S. Route 97 runs to the northeast and Klamath Falls, Oregon.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 0.10% is covered by water. The closest cities with a population greater than 50,000 are Redding, California (69 miles south) and Medford, Oregon (91 miles north).

===Climate===
Weed has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification system), featuring cool, wet winters with occasional snowfall, and hot, dry summers. Its average annual precipitation is . Its USDA hardiness zone is 7b.

==Transportation==
Weed is at the intersection of Interstate 5 and U.S. Route 97. Interstate 5 is the primary north–south transportation corridor for the west coast of the United States running from the Mexico–US border to the Canada–US border. U.S. Route 97 is a major north-south U.S. highway continuing from Weed in a northeasterly direction toward Klamath Falls, Oregon, thence through Oregon and Washington to the Canada–US border. California State Route 265 also runs through the City of Weed, locally known as North Weed Boulevard. Only two blocks long, it is the second-shortest state highway in California.

Weed is served by Siskiyou County&#x27;s public transportation bus lines, Siskiyou Transit and General Express, commonly called &quot;The STAGE&quot;.

The closest airports for commercial air travel are Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport and Redding Municipal Airport. The Weed Airport serves general aviation and as a base of operations for search and rescue operations on Mount Shasta. Corporate visitors or geological researchers typically use this facility.

Amtrak trains pass through Weed, but do not stop there. The Amtrak bus/shuttle has one stop in South Weed. The nearest depot for Amtrak train travel is in Dunsmuir, approximately to the south.

Greyhound Bus Lines has a bus station, with both north and southbound buses making stops.

==Economy==

From its founding in 1901, to as late as the 1980s, Weed was home to a thriving lumber industry. Roseburg Forest Products (plywood), International Paper Company, Morgan Products Ltd. (wooden door manufacturing), and J.H. Baxter (wood treatment) were all based in Weed. The historic industrial area at the northeast corner of Weed has been plagued with environmental concerns and clean-up efforts as a result of chemicals used for wood treatment, as well as chemical residue from glue used in the door factory.
Although historically reliant on logging, wood processing and forest-related products, Weed&#x27;s economy has become more reliant on tourism as a source of economic activity. Weed&#x27;s microbrewery, Mt. Shasta Brewing Company, relies on tourists for 92 percent of its business, according to co-owner Vaune Dillman.

Today, most of the wood-product-related industry has been scaled back or ceased altogether, and new retail and light industrial activity is concentrated in the southeast corner of Weed. Retail at the south end of Weed, in the form of restaurants and hotels, caters primarily to tourist travel on the Interstate 5 corridor. Light manufacturing of bottled water from Crystal Geyser Water Company has also added economic stability to the area.

Weed is part of the Shasta Valley Enterprise Zone which provides tax breaks, fee reductions, and permit fast-tracking for employers locating in the area.

As of 2007, the largest employers in Weed were:

*College of the Siskiyous (100–249 employees)
*Roseburg Forest Products (100–249 employees)
*Crystal Geyser CG Roxane (25–99 employees)
*Weed Union Elementary School District (25–99 employees)

As a small community with few retail outlets, taxable sales within the city are somewhat limited, totaling $89 million in 2012.

In the November 2014 general election, the voters of Weed passed Measure J, which raised the city&#x27;s sales and use tax rate by 0.25 percent.

==Education==

Primary education in Weed is conducted at Weed Elementary School (K-8th grade). Butteville Elementary School (K-8th grade) is just outside the City of Weed, in the hamlet of Edgewood, and has an enrollment similar to Weed Elementary.

Secondary-level students are educated at Weed High School (grades 9–12), part of the Siskiyou Union High School District. The school is known for its picturesque campus and diverse student body.

The College of the Siskiyous, located in Weed, provides a steady source of employment for faculty and staff, a source of visitors for the local economy, and offers a two-year junior college education with various associate degree and vocational certificate programs.

==Recreation and tourism==
Visitors use Weed as a base to engage in trout fishing in the nearby Klamath, Sacramento and McCloud Rivers, or come to see and climb Mount Shasta, Castle Crags or the Trinity Alps. Visitors also engage in nearby skiing (both alpine and cross-country) and biking, or hike to the waterfalls, streams and lakes in the area, including nearby Mossbrae Falls, Lake Siskiyou, Castle Lake and Shasta Lake.

The town&#x27;s name, being the same as a slang term for cannabis, has caused it to gain a small notoriety. Many shops have popped up around town selling shirts and other trinkets that say &quot;I Love Weed, California&quot;.

===Recreation facilities and parks===

Weed is near Castle Crags State Park, Lava Beds National Monument, and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge. In addition to these state and federal parks, there are numerous local recreation opportunities.

*The Lake Shastina Golf Resort offers an 18-hole golf course, and a 9-hole Scottish links course in a scenic setting.
*Local parks managed by the Weed Parks and Recreation District include: Lincoln Park (renamed Charles Byrd Community Park in 2004) which is an park with restrooms, a playground, basketball courts, and is the home to the Weed Skatepark; as well as Bel Air Park, adjacent to College of the Siskiyous and home of the community swimming pool.
*Weed is on the Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway, and is a short distance from the Pacific Crest Trail.

===Ethnic migration===

Weed&#x27;s historic lumber industry and manufacturing facilities made it a magnet for ethnic minority migration, that may not have otherwise been the case in this region of the country. A large number of Italian immigrants migrated to Weed, and other towns in southern Siskiyou County at the turn of the 20th century. While immigrants were a source of labor for the region, they were not always well treated, in fact in 1909 complaints from workers in the lumber industry reached the Italian consul. However, in time the Italian population came to be a cornerstone of Weed civic life. Many streets in the early Italian neighborhood bear names of Italian cities, such as Rome, Genoa, Como, and Venice. Annually since 1954, Weed has held the Weed Italian Carnevale in June or July, although recently dropping &quot;Italian&quot; from its name while maintaining the Italian spelling of carnival and the traditional bocce ball tournaments.

A large number of black-Americans migrated to Weed as well, to work in Long-Bell Lumber Company&#x27;s Weed facility after the company closed two mills in Louisiana in 1922. The company promised to advance travel expenses and provide housing for workers relocating to Weed. Immigrants locating in Weed since the 1980s have come primarily from Mexico and Laos. As a result of these migrations, Weed has a much more ethnically diverse population than Siskiyou County as a whole. Netting the Hispanic or Latino population out of Census figures for white race, Weed&#x27;s white population is 60.6 percent compared to Siskiyou County at 79.5 percent using the same metric.

==Politics==
The city council of Weed is composed of five members who are elected at large and serve four-year terms.

In March 1851, Abraham Thompson, a mule train packer, discovered gold near Rocky Gulch while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail from southern Oregon. By April 1851, 2,000 miners had arrived in &quot;Thompson&#x27;s Dry Diggings&quot; to test their luck, and by June 1851, a gold rush &quot;boomtown&quot; of tents, shanties, and a few rough cabins had sprung up. Several name changes occurred until the city was called Yreka. The name comes from , a word meaning &quot;north mountain&quot; or &quot;white mountain&quot;, the name of nearby Mount Shasta in the Shasta language.

Mark Twain tells a different story:
In 1853–54, poet Joaquin Miller described Yreka as a bustling place with &quot;a tide of people up and down and across other streets, as strong as if a city on the East Coast&quot;. Incorporation proceedings were completed on April 21, 1857.

===Lynchings===
There have been two documented lynchings in Yreka. The first took place on August 26, 1895, when four men—William Null, Garland Stemler, Luis Moreno, and Lawrence Johnson—awaiting trial for various charges of murder and robbery, were simultaneously hanged by a lynch mob from a railroad tie suspended from two adjacent trees.

The second lynching occurred on July 28, 1935. Clyde Johnson and Robert Miller Barr robbed a local business and its patrons in Castella, California. They then stole a car from a patron and drove north to Dunsmuir, California, where they planned to abandon the car and make a getaway by train. Soon after they abandoned the car north of Dunsmuir, they were stopped by California Highway Patrolman George &quot;Molly&quot; Malone and Dunsmuir honorary Chief of Police, 38-year-old Frank R. &quot;Jack&quot; Daw. Johnson pulled out a Luger pistol and wounded both policemen. Malone recovered, but Daw died the next day. Johnson was caught a few hours later by a dragnet and taken into custody. Barr, who was holding the $35 that they obtained from the robbery, panicked during the shootout and ran off into the woods, then escaped on a freight train. Daw was a beloved figure in Dunsmuir. His title of Chief of Police was given to him because of his cool head and experience as a World War I veteran. The night of Daw&#x27;s funeral a dozen cars from Dunsmuir, carrying approximately 50 masked men, drove north to Yreka to lynch Johnson. On August 3, 1935, at 1:30 a.m., the vigilante mob reached the Yreka jail and lightly knocked on the door. Deputy Marin Lange, the only guard on duty at the jail, opened the door slightly and was quickly overtaken. He was driven nine miles east of Yreka where he was released, barefoot. The mob searched the jail, found Johnson, drove him away in one of the cars and hanged him from a pine tree. Barr was arrested over a year later, on September 4, 1936, in Los Angeles on a burglary charge. During his time on the run, he secured a part as an extra in the Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald film &quot;Rose Marie&quot;, scenes of which were filmed near Lake Tahoe. He is credited in the film under his real name.

=== Yreka rebellion ===

On November 27, 1941, a group of young men gained national media attention when, brandishing hunting rifles for dramatic effect, they stopped traffic on U.S. Route 99 south of Yreka, and handed out copies of a Proclamation of Independence, stating that the State of Jefferson was in &quot;patriotic rebellion against the States of California and Oregon&quot; and would continue to &quot;secede every Thursday until further notice.&quot;

The secession movement ended quickly, though not before Del Norte County District Attorney John Leon Childs of Crescent City was inaugurated as governor of the State of Jefferson on December 4, 1941.

The first blow was the death of Mayor Gable on December 2, followed by the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7. Those in favor of secession focused their efforts on the war effort, which crippled the movement.

== Palindromes ==
&quot;Yreka Bakery&quot; is a palindrome. The loss of the &quot;B&quot; in a bakery sign read from the reverse is mentioned as a possible source of the name Yreka in Mark Twain&#x27;s autobiography. The original Yreka Bakery was founded in 1856 by baker Frederick Deng. The palindrome was recognized early on: &quot;spell Yreka Bakery backwards and you will know where to get a good loaf of bread&quot; is quoted as an ad in the May 23, 1863, Yreka &quot;Semi-Weekly Journal&quot; and states that 12 loaves cost $1 (~$ in ). The Yreka Bakery moved eventually to its longtime location, 322 West Miner Street, where it remained under several ownerships until it closed in 1965 on retirement of the baker &quot;Martin&quot;, and clerk Alta Hudson. Another Yreka Bakery opened in a different location in 1974, but is no longer in business. Author Martin Gardner mentioned that Yreka Bakery was in business on West Miner Street in Yreka, but it was pointed out by readers &quot;the Yreka Bakery no longer existed. In 1970 the original premises were occupied by the art store Yrella Gallery, also a palindrome&quot;. The historic Brown-Nickell-Authenrieth Building, 322–324 West Miner Street, houses a restaurant.

<text>Rio Vista (Spanish: &quot;Río Vista&quot;, meaning &quot;River View&quot;) is a city located in the eastern end of Solano County, California, in the Sacramento River Delta region of Northern California. The population was 7,360 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Rio Vista is a small city in Solano County approximately south of Sacramento, on the Sacramento River in the Sacramento River Delta.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (5.68%) is water.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Rio Vista has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

==Origin and history==
The present location of Rio Vista town center is several miles south of the original settlement. Colonel Nathan H. Davis founded &quot;Brazos del Rio&quot; near the entrance of Cache Slough at the Sacramento River, on the Rancho Los Ulpinos Mexican land grant, in 1858. The settlement was renamed &quot;Rio Vista&quot; before a flood in 1862 that resulted in the town moving to its present location on higher ground. The city&#x27;s name combines the Spanish words for &quot;river&quot; and &quot;view.&quot; Post authorities established office in 1858. The community was officially incorporated as Rio Vista on December 30, 1893. The newspaper of record there was the River News-Herald and Isleton Journal, established in 1890. 

===Army facility at Rio Vista===
From 1911 through 1992 Rio Vista was home to the United States Army Reserve Center, Rio Vista. The facility was initially established as a base for river control activities by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During the 1950s it was used by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps to store and maintain harbor craft, and during the 1960s and 1970s it was used to prepare amphibious vehicles for transportation to Vietnam and to train troops in their use. In 1980 it was transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve and in 1992 it was closed due to a BRAC decision. The town also hosts a United States Coast Guard station, established in 1963.

===Humphrey the humpback whale===
Rio Vista was visited by a lost humpback whale in 1985, despite being up the Sacramento River from the Pacific Ocean. The young whale, nicknamed &quot;Humphrey&quot;, attracted throngs of curiosity seekers before he was eventually guided back to sea by rescuers. The Army Reserve Unit (481st Transportation Company (Heavy Boat)) was activated to use their vessels (Landing Craft Utility (LCU)) to assist in the guiding of Humphrey back to the sea. Again in May 2007, humpbacks were sighted in Rio Vista. &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;Dawn,&quot; mother and calf, stopped at least twice in the river near the town.

===Flannery land purchases===
In 2018, a group of investors called Flannery Associates, a subsidiary of California Forever, began purchasing most of the land surrounding Rio Vista and suing those refusing to sell Flannery their land for &quot;constraint of trade.&quot;

Natural gas was discovered in the Rio Vista area in 1936 and the Rio Vista Field, (RVGU Rio Vista Gas Unit ) at one time there was a gas well behind RV City Hall in the middle of boat launch parking lot. Amerada Hess Corporation was the first major operations. When Amerada sold out to Sheridan Energy another buy out would soon take shape by Calpine Natural Gas. Calpine fell into the energy collapse when Enron went under then Calpine sold off a majority of its natural gas holdings to Rosetta Resources. Next buyer was Vintage Petroleum who sold out to and currently running operations California Resources Corporation as of 2022. Same address since 1936. Rio Vista Gas Unit was the largest natural gas field in California, became a major source of employment for the remainder of the 20th century. Other industries include agriculture, manufacturing and tourism. There are over 750 wind turbines belonging to the three renewable energy projects (Shiloh Wind Power Plant, NextEra Energy Resources&#x27; High Winds Energy Center and one owned by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District) on the Montezuma Hills, close to the city. There are plans to add an additional 200 wind turbines.

==History==

Suisun City was established in the 1850s. Its location made it ideal for commerce and transportation during the California Gold Rush.

In 1868—1869, it was connected to the First transcontinental railroad at Sacramento via the California Pacific Railroad (Cal-P) main line, expanding the region&#x27;s reach across the United States. By 1879 Central Pacific Railroad owned the Cal-P mainline and rerouted the transcontinental overland route through the new branch from Port Costa, via the railroad ferry Solano to Benicia, across the Suisun Marsh to Suisun City, putting the region directly on the overland route from San Francisco to Ogden and beyond.

In 1888, a fire destroyed much of downtown Suisun, including many city landmarks, such as the Robert Hotel, Crowley&#x27;s saloon, the Union Hotel, and the Orkel grain warehouses. Citizens considered abandoning the city after the devastation, but instead decided to rebuild and raise money to construct a waterworks system that would allow them to fight future fires more effectively.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Suisun City experienced rapid growth as the San Francisco Bay Area&#x27;s suburban ring expanded to the formerly rural Solano County. Also in the 1960s, Interstate 80 was constructed outside the city, effectively moving commercial traffic away from railways and water conveyance.

<text>Bodega Bay is a village and census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma County, California, United States. The population was 912 at the 2020 census. The town, located along State Route 1, is on the eastern side of Bodega Harbor, an inlet of Bodega Bay on the Pacific coast.

==History==

Bodega Bay is the site of the first Russian structures built in California, which were erected in 1809 by Commerce Counseller Ivan Alexandrovich Kuskov of the Russian-American Company in the lead-up to the establishment of Fort Ross. The Russians named the Bodega Bay settlement Port Rumyantsev after the Russian Foreign Minister Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev, and it served as a port to support Fort Ross and the larger Russian community known as Colony Ross.

The town is now named in honor of Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, a Spanish naval officer who explored the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska during multiple voyages of discovery in the late 18th century.

The location scenes in the Alfred Hitchcock-directed film &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) were filmed in both Bodega Bay and nearby Bodega (though both were represented as being parts of the film&#x27;s Bodega Bay.) The town markets itself by using the film in many ways, including its &quot;Birds&quot;-themed visitors&#x27; center although none of the film&#x27;s primary locations is found there. The church and the schoolhouse shown in the film are on the Bodega Highway in Bodega.
The town also featured in the cult horror film &quot;Puppet Master&quot; (1989).

The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) wanted to build a nuclear power plant at Gaffney Point on Bodega Head, across the bay from the town, in the 1960s, but the plans were shut down after a large protest (the first for environmental reasons) and the geologic fault which was found while it was digging the hole for the first reactor. The hole filled with water and became known as &quot;The Hole in the Head&quot;.

<text>Boyes Hot Springs (also called Boyes Springs or The Springs) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma Valley, Sonoma County, California, United States. The population was 6,656 people at the 2010 census. Resorts in Boyes Hot Springs, El Verano, Fetters Hot Springs, and Agua Caliente were popular health retreats for tourists from San Francisco and points beyond until the middle of the 20th century because of the geothermic hot springs that still well up from deep within the Earth.

==History==
The area was first occupied by Indigenous peoples, who discovered and used the hot springs that the area is named after. Under Mexican rule, in July 1840, Lazaro Piña was deeded 50,000 acres as Rancho Agua Caliente. Sometime in 1849 Thaddeus M. Leavenworth acquired 320 acres of the Rancho in what became present-day Agua Caliente, Fetters Hot Springs, Boyes Hot Springs, and part of Maxwell Farm. In 1889, property was being sold in the area as being near the &quot;celebrated old Indian Medicine Spring.&quot; Henry Ernest Boyes discovered hot springs in 1895 in the central part of the area. He and his wife called the area Agua Rica. and started the Boyes Hot Springs Hotel, now the site of the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa. The area became popular with tourists, with over 70,000 visiting each year. A railroad serviced the area during this period.

A wildfire in September 1923 destroyed the settlement.

During the Great Depression, the area&#x27;s tourism business stopped and the hotel closed. During that period, the Oakland Oaks and San Francisco Seals did their spring training in Boyes Hot Springs. Tourism became the region&#x27;s main economic focus again later in the 1930s, then during World War II it was taken over by the United States Navy, who sent sailors to the area for recreation. Railroad service stopped in 1942.

Today, the area is primarily residential with a large Latino population. Boyes Hot Springs is part of an area called &quot;The Springs&quot;, which also includes Fetters Hot Springs and Agua Caliente.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. Boyes Hot Springs is known for, and named after, the hot springs that run 1,100 feet below the surface. Today, the springs are accessible through the Fairmont Hotel and Spa located in the area. The springs run at 135 degrees.

<text>Cloverdale is a city in Sonoma County, California, United States; it is both the westernmost and the northernmost city in the San Francisco Bay Area. The San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad reached the area in 1872. The Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California is headquartered there. The population was 8,996 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Cloverdale began as an early stagecoach stop, known as Markleville, on the Rancho Rincon de Musalacon Mexican grant. In 1856, R.B. Markle and W.J. Miller bought , which included the present site of the town, from Johnson Horrell. In 1859, James Abram Kleiser bought Markle&#x27;s interest, and the town was laid out. The town was incorporated when the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad arrived in 1872. By 1878, the railroad service provided three trains a day between Cloverdale and Ferries of San Francisco Bay.
In 1881, Jules Leroux and Armand Dehay established a colony south of Cloverdale named &quot;Icaria Speranza&quot;, based on the French Utopian movement, the Icarians. The settlement ended in 1886 and today, there is a marker south of town where the schoolhouse was located.

Cloverdale Citrus Fair began in 1892.

The San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition is run by the Cloverdale Citrus Fair. Since 2000, the San Francisco Chronicle has been its title sponsor.

Cloverdale suffered severe economic hardship, losing 500 to 600 manufacturing jobs between 1988 and 1994, with the closing of a fire equipment factory and the shrinking of the logging industry. On July 6, 2005, Cloverdale began its economic reform with the &quot;RTB&quot; (Real-Estate Transfer Bureau) plan granting money for businesses and commerce to return to the city. This plan fell through as the grant was moved to Los Altos, California and changed to the &quot;1750&quot; plan. In 1993, 300 jobs were eliminated alone when Louisiana-Pacific closed its lumber mill. In 1994, Highway 101, which formerly bisected the town, was rerouted around town with a bypass. Some businesses closed, and many natives believed the bypass radically changed the town&#x27;s character.

Since the bypass, signs of civic revival have occurred with the development of pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, a performing arts center, a brewpub, and a downtown plaza hosting live concerts and a farmers&#x27; market. In 1997, Clover Springs, a development with 362 houses, was opened on the south end of town. In 2011, the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District transferred of former ranchland to the City of Cloverdale for use as a park and open-space preserve.

==Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians==

The Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians is a landless federally recognized tribe with a membership of almost 500. In 2008, the Tribe acquired at the southern end of town.

The Rancheria is a community of Pomo Indians who are indigenous to Sonoma County and speak the Southern Pomo language. Pomo people are renowned for their basket weaving, done by both men and women. Elsie Allen, considered to be one of the best California basketweavers of her generation, was a member of the Rancheria and spent part of her childhood there.

According to tribal history, the Pomo people lived peacefully in the area since ancient times. The Rancheria was created by the federal government in 1921, when the tribe became federally recognized, and deeded the tribe on the southern edge of town.

In 1958, the Rancheria was terminated, along with 43 other rancherias in California. This process transferred tribal community land to private ownership.

In 1979, Tillie Hardwick, a Pomo woman, filed a class action suit on behalf of 16 of the illegally terminated rancherias. In 1983, the Courts reinstated the federal recognition of the illegally terminated tribes, including the Cloverdale Rancheria.

In 1994, the Highway 101 bypass cut through the Rancheria land, forcing tribal landowners to sell their property for the freeway.

In 2006, the tribe began efforts to revive and restore their traditional culture. The tribe is also interested in opening up a casino.

<text>Cotati (; Miwok: &quot;Kota’ti&quot;) is an incorporated city in Sonoma County, California, United States, located approximately north of San Francisco in the 101 corridor between Rohnert Park and Petaluma. Cotati&#x27;s population as of the 2020 Census was 7,584, making it the least populous incorporated community in Sonoma County.

Like the rest of Sonoma County, Cotati is included in both the San Francisco Bay Area and the North Coast. Located in the Sonoma Coast AVA, Cotati can also be considered part of Wine Country. E &amp; J Gallo Winery operates a vineyard called Two Rock Vineyard in the hills west of town. Cotati&#x27;s hexagonal downtown plaza, one of only two hexagonal town layouts in the United States, is California Historical Landmark number 879. The other U.S. city with a hexagonal layout is Detroit, Michigan.

==History==
The Coast Miwok civilization thrived in the Cotati area since at least 2000 BC, with principal villages built near major streams. Documented villages in the area included &quot;Lumen-takala&quot; (northeast of present-day Cotati), &quot;Payinecha&quot; (west of present-day Cotati), and &quot;Kotati&quot;.

In 1827, an Irishman named John Thomas Reed ventured into Miwok territory and built a cabin near Crane Creek. After the natives burned it, he retreated south to Mill Valley.

===Rancho Cotate===
In July 1844, the Mexican government granted Rancho Cotate (encompassing present-day towns of Cotati, Penngrove and Rohnert Park, and home to Coast Miwok people) to Captain Juan Castaneda, a Mexican military commander from Texas, in payment for his service as a soldier under General Vallejo. The grant took its name from the Coast Miwok village of Kotati. However, a legend arose that Rancho Cotate was named after a Pomo chief named Cotati, and in 1973 the state perpetuated this legend on the historical marker it placed in the plaza.

Rancho Cotate consisted of . Captain Castaneda moved to San Francisco and never developed Rancho Cotate. Because he failed to fulfill the legal requirements of the grant, he lost control of the rancho, which passed to Thomas Larkin and then to Joseph Ruckle. In 1849, Ruckle sold the land to Dr. Thomas Stokes Page, a former resident of Valparaíso, Chile, for $1,600. &quot;Rancho Cotate&quot; was recorded in California state records as follows:

With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Cotati was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Thomas Stokes Page, February 18, 1858, for 17,238.60 acres. 

The landholding remained in the Page family for over eighty years. Subject to seasonal flooding from the Laguna de Santa Rosa, the land was used to graze cattle and sheep. In October 1870, the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad completed the first railroad from Petaluma to Santa Rosa, and a town formed around the wood and water stop called &quot;Page&#x27;s Station&quot;, then &quot;Cotati&quot;.

===Development of a town===

Cotati&#x27;s hexagonal plaza and street grid plan was designed during the 1890s by Newton Smyth as an alternative to the traditional grid. Dr. Thomas Page&#x27;s barn once stood where the plaza is today, and each of the streets surrounding the plaza is named after one of his sons. In 1892, the Page family created the Cotati Land Company to subdivide their ranch into parcels of five to twenty acres (two to eight hectares). By 1901, good land was selling for $30 to $60 per acre. Page family ownership ended in 1944.

The Cotati area was shaken up by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. After the quake, Drury Butler reported that &quot;the chimneys were as a rule thrown down&quot;. In particular, the Stony Point School at suffered a chimney failure.

The Northwestern Pacific Railroad built the Cotati Depot in 1907. It was located near the East Cotati Avenue crossing, almost east of the plaza. It was demolished to make way for Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit&#x27;s Cotati station.

Prior to 1915, the major north–south roads (Petaluma Hill Road and Stony Point Road) bypassed Cotati. In that year, the state routed the Redwood Highway (part of U.S. Route 101) onto the mostly unpaved Cotati Boulevard. U.S. 101 passed through the downtown plaza until 1955, when the highway was rerouted further west. U.S. 101 still bisects Cotati, and the former route is called Old Redwood Highway.

In February 1921, the old schoolhouse at 201 West Sierra burned down. A new school built on the same site opened in 1922. This building has served as City Hall since 1971. The rear of this building housed the Cotati Police Department until September 3, 2003, when the department moved into a new building next door.

The Cotati Speedway, a wooden oval track for automobile racing, was built near the depot around 1921. It was about in circumference. World records were set there, but it failed in its first season and was torn down in 1922.

In 1927, the Cotati Volunteer Fire Department was organized. Since 1993, Cotati has been part of the Rancho Adobe Fire Protection District.

A local weekly newspaper called &quot;The Cotatian&quot; was established by E. A. Little in 1944 and lasted until 1964. The current local paper is &quot;The Community Voice&quot;, published in neighboring Penngrove.

===Incorporation, growth, and rent control===
On July 2, 1963, less than a year after the incorporation of the lands north of town to form Rohnert Park, voters approved (by a 284-to-41 margin) the incorporation of Cotati as a separate city. After incorporation, the city grew rapidly, due in part to being within commuting range of San Francisco. Between 1965 and 2000, the population increased by more than a factor of four.

In 1979, Cotati voters approved a rent control ordinance for all residential rentals, but in 1995, that ordinance was partly preempted by the passage of AB (Assembly Bill) 1164, known as the Costa/Hawkins Bill. At the time, Cotati was one of five cities in California with &quot;strong rent control&quot; laws which included vacancy control. (The other cities were West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Berkeley and East Palo Alto). The Costa/Hawkins bill made it impossible for California municipalities to enforce vacancy control, except in special cases like mobile home parks. When the 1979 ordinance was repealed by Cotati voters in 1998, it was replaced with a more limited ordinance aimed at mobile home parks. At the present time, eight of the nine incorporated areas in Sonoma County have rent control for mobile home parks, the exception being Healdsburg.

In 1990, Cotati citizens voted to impose a limit on future annexation of land by the city. This was followed in 1997 by a ballot measure prohibiting &quot;big-box&quot; retail stores of more than . However, on November 4, 2003, Cotati voters approved (by 1,047 votes to 1,013) Measure B, granting an exception to this ordinance so that a Lowe&#x27;s home improvement warehouse could be built on the west side of U.S. 101.

===Budget crisis===
In order to cope with declining revenue, the City instituted a series of budget cuts, starting in 2007. As of August 2009, the City expected to run out of money in its General Fund within a year.

In April 2010, Cotati voters passed Measure A, which imposed a 0.5% sales tax for five years. In June 2014, they passed Measure G (by a vote of 922 to 808) to increase the city sales tax to 1%.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , 0.53% of which is water.

The city is about from the Pacific Ocean. It lies entirely in the drainage basin of the Laguna de Santa Rosa. The Petaluma River watershed begins just south of town. To the west is the Stemple Creek watershed. The sources of all three watercourses lie in the hilly area between Stony Point Road and U.S. 101, just west of town.

A gap in the coastal ridges near Petaluma often allows coastal fog to reach Cotati in the summer, giving it a marine climate that is noticeably cooler and less sunny than the &quot;coastal&quot; climates of nearby Santa Rosa and Sebastopol. Cotati averages fewer than 800 hours per growing season in the range.

The soils of the Cotati area are characterized by recent alluvial materials, explicitly those areas bordering the Laguna de Santa Rosa and its tributary Washoe Creek. These materials are largely stream and valley alluvium, with artificial fill in some areas.

Active faults near Cotati include the Rodgers Creek Fault ( east) and the Tolay Fault.

To the west of Cotati is wetland habitat for Sebastopol meadowfoam, Pitkin Marsh lily, Showy Indian clover, and several other endangered species.

<doc id="108231" wikidata="Q1816945" url="?curid=108231" title="Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente, California">
<text>Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma Valley, Sonoma County, California, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the CDP population was 4,144. The name Agua Caliente translates into English, from Spanish, as &quot;hot water&quot;, referring to the hot springs historically found in the area.

==Geography==
Generally considered separate from one another, Fetters Hot Springs and Agua Caliente are adjacent communities located along the Sonoma Highway (State Route 12), approximately northwest of Sonoma, California, and immediately north of Boyes Hot Springs and El Verano. Over time, the boundaries between these four communities became blurred and they are often grouped together and referred to collectively as &quot;the Springs&quot; area of Sonoma Valley.

As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a total area of , all land.

==History==

The area was first occupied by Indigenous peoples who discovered and used the hot springs that the area is named after. The Mexican government deeded 50,000 acres to Lazaro Piña as Rancho Agua Caliente, a land grant long on the east side of Sonoma Creek, in 1840. In 1849 Thaddeus M. Leavenworth acquired 320 acres of the Rancho in what became present-day Agua Caliente, Fetters Hot Springs, Boyes Hot Springs, and part of Maxwell Farm. In 1889, property was being sold in the area as being near the &quot;celebrated old Indian Medicine Spring.&quot;

George and Emma Fetters opened the Fetters Hot Springs resort in 1908. Flamboyant restaurateur Juanita Musson opened her second Sonoma Valley restaurant in the old Fetters hotel around 1970, but it burned to the ground five years later. The land stood vacant for almost forty years until the Fetters Apartments, built as affordable housing for sixty families, opened in 2017.

According to Sonoma State University professor Jonah Raskin, Forestville &quot;was a gathering place for bohemians and writers and artists, circa 1900.&quot;

Today businesses in the town consist of one gas station, one bar, one hardware store, a grocery store, two convenience markets, a pharmacy, several churches, a number of restaurants, a post office, an assortment of small businesses, a full time fire station operated by Sonoma County Fire District, a volunteer-run Youth Park, and three ATMs. The annual Forestville Youth Park Parade is held each June as a fund-raising event. It is associated with two days of music, bingo, and carnival rides in the Youth Park. Food and handicrafts booths are staffed by local vendors and non-profit organizations.

A number of bed and breakfast inns and wineries have been developed along the Russian River and to the east.

Graton is located at the southeastern end of Green Valley, on the east bank of the seasonally flooding Atascadero Creek. The elevation ranges from approximately above Mean Sea Level (MSL) at Atascadero Creek to MSL at Oak Grove School.

Graton is noted as lying at the approximate furthest southern and eastern extent of Russian colonization of the Americas. Research on Fort Ross has indicated that several farms were developed inland from the coastal fur trading fort in northwestern Sonoma County. These farms or ranches were used for producing additional food and for agricultural projects conducted by Fort Ross&#x27;s agronomist Yegor Chernykh. In 1836, a farm was established along Purrington Creek, between what are now the towns of Occidental and Graton. There Chernykh erected barracks and five other structures, and grew vegetables, fruit, wheat, and other grains. Chernykh also developed a large vineyard, introducing what has since become a major crop in the area.

<text>Guerneville () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in the Russian River Valley of Sonoma County, California, United States. The town is historically known as a logging community. It was founded by the Guerne family in the 1850s.

In the 21st century, Guerneville is also known for its natural environment, liberal atmosphere, and proximity to wine-tasting and redwood forests.

==History==

Guerneville developed adjacent to the Russian River. Redwoods grew in the riverbed with such vigor that just a few centuries ago, the valley had the greatest biomass density on the planet, according to local lore. The local Pomo Indians had long used the area as a summer camp and called it &quot;Ceola&quot; ( or &quot;cee-oh-lay&quot;) which meant &quot;shady place.&quot;

A large stand of ancient trees is preserved in the Fife Creek watershed, now the centerpiece of Armstrong Woods Park. But many of the trees were logged in the late 19th century and the early 20th century, giving rise to the first English name for the place – &quot;Stumptown.&quot; Logging in the area boomed after vast amounts of lumber were needed for rebuilding after the 1906 earthquake and associated fires.

The annual town parade still commemorates the old place name by calling itself &quot;Stumptown Days.&quot; The present name Guerneville was introduced to honor Swiss immigrant George Guerne, a local businessman of the 19th century who owned the town&#x27;s sawmill. By 1870, there was a U.S. Post Office in Guerneville; it was listed by the name &quot;Guerneville&quot;. Although locals may be found selling T-shirts that say &quot;Don&#x27;t call it Guerneyville&quot; (alluding to the &quot;GURN-vil&quot; pronunciation), many have called the town &quot;Guerneyville&quot; in spelling and pronunciation since the 1800s. The extensive redwood forests on the surrounding mountains are less than 200 years old, having been replacement plantings for much of the logging done in the 19th century.

In the late 19th century, the area became popular with wealthy vacationers from San Francisco and surrounding communities. The San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad in 1877 linked the town to the ferries of San Francisco Bay. Even with the demise of train service in the late 1930s, the area&#x27;s resorts remained popular with vacationers who came by automobile through the 1950s. A local movie theater, the River, was built near the beach and showed double features throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

The advent of jet airplane travel in the 1960s marked a period of decline for many of the older resorts. Winter floods in 1964 caused a further decline in local businesses. A renaissance took place in the late 1970s as numerous gay entrepreneurs from San Francisco identified the area as a prime recreational destination for weekends. Many older resorts benefited from increased tourism, and the town&#x27;s businesses began to thrive.

Guerneville is the home of non-commercial radio station KGGV-FM, 95.1 MHz.

The Russian River area occasionally appears in local and/or national news due to significant winter flooding, the worst of which occurred in 1986. Because much of the housing is elevated, thanks in large part to FEMA grants, floods no longer have the impact they once did and recovery for most residents and businesses is much faster than in earlier times. The effects of floods are mitigated by the extensive upstream floodplain storage capacity of the Laguna de Santa Rosa.

==Filming location==
Guerneville&#x27;s older metal truss bridge can be filmed from the newer bridge, and made an appearance in the movie &quot;Mumford&quot; (1999) as a location for people to walk and talk in idyllic settings.

<text>Monte Rio (Spanish: &quot;Monte Río&quot;, meaning &quot;River Mountain&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sonoma County, California along the Russian River near the Pacific Ocean. The town of Guerneville lies northeast of Monte Rio, and Jenner is to the west. The population was 1,152 at the 2010 census, up from 1,104 at the 2000 census. Bohemian Grove is located in Monte Rio.

==History==

Starting in the 1870s, Monte Rio was a stop on the North Pacific Coast Railroad connecting Cazadero to the Sausalito, California ferry. Redwood lumber from local sawmills was shipped to build San Francisco. After the sawmills left, the area became known as Vacation Wonderland with trains transporting San Franciscans to summer cabins and even a seven-story hotel downtown. Portions of the 1942 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; were filmed at the Village Inn Resort in Monte Rio. The trains no longer run, and the area now is mainly inhabited by year-round residents.

Despite heavy logging during the second half of the 19th century, the Sonoma Lumber Company preserved a grove of old-growth redwood trees, which was sold to San Francisco&#x27;s Bohemian Club in 1899. The club purchased dozens of other parcels in the area, and now owns , which are used for its summer retreats.

<text>Spurn is a narrow sand tidal island located off the tip of the coast of the East Riding of Yorkshire, England that reaches into the North Sea and forms the north bank of the mouth of the Humber Estuary. It was a spit with a semi-permanent connection to the mainland, but a storm in 2013 made the road down to the end of Spurn impassable to vehicles at high tide.

The island is over long, almost half the width of the estuary at that point, and as little as wide in places. The southernmost tip is known as Spurn Head or Spurn Point and was, until early 2023, the home to an RNLI lifeboat station and two disused lighthouses. It forms part of the civil parish of Easington.

Spurn Head covers above high water and of foreshore. It has been owned since 1960 by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and is a designated national nature reserve, heritage coast and is part of the Humber Flats, Marshes and Coast Special Protection Area.

== History ==

Spurn Head was known to classical authors, such as Ptolemy as &quot;Ocelum Promontorium&quot; (). In the Middle Ages, Spurn Head was home to the port of Ravenspurn (a.k.a. Ravenspur or Ravensburgh), where Henry of Bolingbroke landed in 1399 on his return to dethrone Richard II. It was also where Sir Martin de la See led the local resistance against Edward IV&#x27;s landing on 14 March 1471, as he was returning from his six months&#x27; exile in the Netherlands. An earlier village, closer to the point of Spurn Head, was Ravenser Odd. Along with many other villages on the Holderness coast, Ravenspurn and Ravenser Odd were lost to the encroachments of the sea, as Spurn Head, due to erosion and deposition of its sand, migrated westward.
The lifeboat station at Spurn Head was built in 1810. Owing to the remote location, houses for the lifeboat crew and their families were added a few years later. By the 1870s a room in the high lighthouse was being used as a chapel for the small residential community on Spurn Head, serving &#x27;the keepers, coast-guardsmen and fishermen who live at the Point&#x27;.

During the First World War two coastal artillery batteries were added at either end of Spurn Head, with quick-firing guns in between. The emplacements can be clearly seen, and the northern ones are particularly interesting as coastal erosion has partly toppled them onto the beach, revealing the size of the concrete foundations very well.

As well as a road, the peninsula also used to have a railway, parts of which can still be seen. Unusual &#x27;sail bogies&#x27; were used as well as more conventional light railway equipment.

Following a tidal surge in December 2013 the roadway became unsafe, and access to Spurn Point is on foot only, with a warning not to attempt this when exceptionally high tides are due. Spurn has now become a tidal island, as the narrowest part of the sandbank connection to the mainland is flooded with each high tide.

Plans to build a new visitor centre for the reserve were unveiled in September 2014 by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust (YWT). Planning consent for the initial plans was refused by East Riding of Yorkshire Council in July 2016 but revised plans were approved in January 2017. These plans face local opposition because of the perceived feeling of commercialisation of the reserve by YWT, with plans to build extensive car park facilities, no longer free. The new visitor centre was officially opened by Simon King on 20 March 2018.

A February 2023 inspection of the RNLI launch jetty revealed structural issues, as a result the station was moved to Grimsby.

==Geography==

The spit is made up from sand, shingle and boulder clay eroded from the Holderness coastline washed down the coastline from Flamborough Head. Material is washed down the coast by longshore drift and accumulates to form the long, narrow embankment in the sheltered waters inside the mouth of the Humber Estuary. It is maintained by plants, especially marram grass (&quot;Ammophila arenaria&quot;). Waves carry material along the peninsula to the tip, continually extending it; as this action stretches the peninsula it also narrows it to the extent that the sea can cut across it in severe weather. When the sea cuts across it permanently, everything beyond the breach is swept away, only to eventually reform as a new spit pointing further south. This cycle of destruction and reconstruction occurs approximately every 250 years. More recently, Dr. John Pethick of Hull University put forward a different theory to explain the formation of Spurn Head. He suggests that the spit head has been a permanent feature since the end of the last ice age, having developed on an underwater glacial moraine. As the ice sheets melted, sea level gradually rose and longshore drift caused a spit to form between this and other islands along the moraine. Under normal circumstances, the sea washes over the neck of the spit taking sand from the seaward side and redepositing it on the landward side. Over time, the whole spit, length intact, slips back – with the spit-head remaining on its glacial foundation. This process has now been affected by the protection of the spit put in place during the Victorian era. This protection halted the wash-over process and resulted in the spit being even more exposed due to the rest of the coast moving back since the &#x27;protection&#x27; was constructed. The now crumbling defences will not be replaced and the spit will continue to move westwards at a rate of per year, keeping pace with the coastal erosion further north.

The second of the &quot;Six Studies in English Folk Song&quot; composed in 1926 by Ralph Vaughan Williams, the &quot;Andante sostenuto&quot; in E flat &quot;Spurn Point&quot; celebrates this peninsula.

It was featured on the television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of Yorkshire.

==Ecology==
The landward-side mud flats are an important feeding ground for wading birds, and the area has a bird observatory, for monitoring migrating birds and providing accommodation to visiting birdwatchers. Their migration is assisted by east winds in autumn, resulting in drift migration of Scandinavian migrants, sometimes leading to a spectacular &quot;fall&quot; of thousands of birds. Many uncommon species have been sighted there, including a cliff swallow from North America, a lanceolated warbler from Siberia and a black-browed albatross from the Southern Ocean. More commonly, birds such as northern wheatears, whinchats, common redstarts and flycatchers alight at Spurn on their way between breeding and wintering grounds elsewhere. When the wind is in the right direction migrants are funnelled down Spurn Point and are counted at the Narrows Watchpoint, more than 15,000 birds can fly past on a good morning in autumn with 3,000 quite normal.

==Lighthouses==
The earliest reference to a lighthouse on Spurn Point is 1427. From the 17th century there are records of a pair of lighthouses being maintained as leading lights: a high light and a low light.

===Old High and Low Lights===
In 1767, John Smeaton was commissioned to build a new pair of lighthouses. Smeaton&#x27;s high light (a tower) remained in use until 1895, but there were problems (as there had been in previous years) with maintaining the low light; within a short time it had been washed away by the sea. A series of more-or-less temporary replacements were used in the years that followed, until a more solid lighthouse designed by James Walker was constructed in 1852 under the supervision of engineer Henry Norris. Unlike its predecessor this low light was built the estuary side (i.e. to the west) of the high light, rather than on the seaward side.

Initially both lighthouses were coal-fired. In 1819 Smeaton&#x27;s high light was equipped with 24 Argand lamps and reflectors); later, in 1853, it was fitted with a new Fresnel lens: a large (first-order) fixed optic by Henry Lepaute of Paris. (Prior to installation this lens had been exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851). Later, a red sector was added to the high light, which warned ships of hazards to the south ranging from Clee Ness to Sand Haile Flats.

The low light, meanwhile, had also been fitted with oil lamps and reflectors in 1816. Then, in 1848, a small Fresnel lens (a fifth-order lenticular dioptric) had been installed, which was reused when the new tower was built in 1852.
In 1895 both this low light and Smeaton&#x27;s high light were decommissioned and replaced by a single lighthouse which still stands on the grass of Spurn Head. The 1852 low light also still stands on the sandy shore of the island, though its lantern has been replaced by a large water tank. (Of the old Smeaton high light only the foundations remain; after dismantling, its optic was re-used in the high lighthouse at Nash Point, where it was installed as part of a programme of improvements.)

===The new Spurn Lighthouse===
The 1895 lighthouse is a round brick tower, high, painted black and white. It was designed by Thomas Matthews. The lantern contained a very large revolving hyper-radiant optic by Chance Brothers &amp; Co. Its white light had a range of and displayed a flash once every 20 seconds. In addition there were separate sector lights, two of which marked particular shoals or sandbanks, while another indicated the main channel along the Humber. Initially oil-lit, the lighthouse was converted to electricity in 1941 to enable the light to be lit briefly (as and when requested by allied ships and convoys) and then extinguished.

Then, in 1957, the lighthouse was converted to acetylene gas operation. A new, smaller, gas-driven revolving optic was installed, which flashed once every fifteen seconds; and the subsidiary lights were provided with occulting mechanisms, also gas-driven. The new systems were automated; the keepers therefore moved out and their cottages were demolished.

Due to improvements in navigation, the light was discontinued in 1985; the main optic was removed the following year. The combined acetylene lamp and gas-powered optic were subsequently put on display, first in the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum, then in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. Since 1986, the lighthouse remained empty, but in 2013, Yorkshire Wildlife Trust was awarded a £470,500 grant to restore the lighthouse with a view to its being reopened as a visitor centre. This was scheduled to take place in 2015, with work starting in April 2015. The work was completed in March 2016, and opened to the public for the Easter weekend.

==History==

Founded in 1876, Occidental was a stop on the North Pacific Coast Railroad connecting Cazadero to the Sausalito ferry. In return for donating right-of-way to the railroad, a local landowner named &quot;Dutch Bill&quot; Howards received a lifetime railway pass, and the station was named after him.

The railway caused a rapid expansion of the timber industry, and by 1877 there were six sawmills in the Occidental area. Trains also brought vacationers from San Francisco.

Howard’s Station Cafe is a restaurant that is located at the old narrow gauge railroad stop in downtown Occidental.

==Geography==
Occidental has a total area of , all of it land.
