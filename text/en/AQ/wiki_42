<text>Seffner is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 8,362, up from 7,579 at the 2010 census.

Located approximately east of downtown Tampa, Seffner is considered a suburb. Though still characterized by towering live oak trees, strawberry farms and lakes, Seffner has been growing rapidly in recent years, with housing subdivisions being added to the once rural landscape.

==History==
Some historians claim that Seffner&#x27;s streets were originally laid out in 1862, but not recorded as a plat formally until 1885. Seffner&#x27;s post office opened in 1884, when a new railroad line in the area had been planned. The community was named for its first postmaster, Frederick P. Seffner. That same year, Seffner&#x27;s first school and store were opened. Seffner quickly became a prosperous small community with citrus groves, a hotel, one drug store, several dry goods stores, and a livery stable. When an epidemic of yellow fever hit Tampa in the fall of 1887 and in 1888, many Tampa refugees fled to Seffner for temporary shelter in the hotel. However, as refugees and mail arrived in Seffner, they were fumigated as protection from the epidemic. Among the refugees was T.C. Taliaferro of the First National Bank of Tampa, who operated a branch banking business from Seffner during the epidemic.

The main thoroughfare leading north and south was Lenna Avenue, and leading east and west was Highway Number 23, renamed Buffalo Avenue, because of its erstwhile use as a buffalo trail, and then renamed again in 1989 to its current name, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (Hwy 574). Seffner and neighboring Mango and Dover served as the three primary towns along the South Florida Railroad right-of-way between Tampa and Plant City. These towns owe their existence and prosperity to the railroad, each becoming an important shipping center.

The cold in the winter of 1894–1895 brought disaster to Seffner. Many citizens left, while others remained to recoup their losses. Seffner survived and eventually regained its affluence. Attractive residential neighborhoods were built to accommodate the influx of desirable residents. By 1925, Seffner was the fourth-largest town in Hillsborough County.

<doc id="109247" wikidata="Q2152032" url="?curid=109247" title="Temple Terrace, Florida">
<text>Temple Terrace is a city in northeastern Hillsborough County, Florida, United States, adjacent to Tampa. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 26,690. It is the third and smallest incorporated municipality in Hillsborough County, after Tampa and Plant City. Incorporated in 1925, the community is known for its rolling landscape, bucolic Hillsborough River views, and sand live oak trees; it is a Tree City USA. Originally planned in the 1920s as a Mediterranean-Revival golf course community, it is one of the first such communities in the United States. It is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area, more commonly known as the Tampa Bay area.


Temple Terrace was named for the then-new hybrid, the Temple orange also called the tangor. It is a cross between the mandarin orange—also called the tangerine—and the common sweet orange; it was named after Florida-born William Chase Temple, one-time owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, founder of the Temple Cup, and first president of the Florida Citrus Exchange. Temple Terrace was the first place in the United States where the new Temple orange was grown in large quantities. The &quot;terrace&quot; portion of the name refers to the terraced terrain of the area by the river where the city was founded. One of the original houses also had a terraced yard with a lawn sloping, in tiers, toward the river.
==History==

===Pre-Columbian===

The original inhabitants of the Temple Terrace area were known as the Tocobaga, a group of Native Americans living around Tampa Bay, both in prehistoric and historic times, until roughly 1760.

===Spanish exploration===


Spanish exploration of the Temple Terrace area dates back to 1757 when explorer Don Francisco Maria Celi of the Spanish Royal Fleet made his way up the Hillsborough River (naming it &quot;El Rio de San Julian y Arriaga&quot;) to what is now Riverhills Park in search of pine trees to use as masts for his ships. Here, in the extensive longleaf pine forest, he erected a cross in what he named &quot;El Pinal de la Cruz de Santa Teresa&quot; (the Pine Forest of the Cross of Saint Theresa). Confirmation of the fleet&#x27;s travels is found in its map and logbook. A historic marker and a replica of the cross erected to honor St. Theresa are found in Riverhills Park today. Up to 1913, the longleaf pine, sand live oak, and cypress trees made the area suitable for turpentine manufacturing and logging.
===The Potter Palmer years===

The area now known as Temple Terrace was originally part of an exclusive game preserve called &quot;Riverhills&quot; belonging to Chicago socialite Bertha Palmer, wife of businessman Potter Palmer. She played an extensive role in making Sarasota the &quot;City of the Arts&quot; that it is today. She was one of the largest landholders, ranchers, farmers, and developers in Florida at the turn of the twentieth century. The &quot;Evening Independent&quot; newspaper in 1918 described the preserve as &quot;a well-stocked hunting preserve north of Tampa being one of the most attractive hunting grounds in the state.&quot; Property acquisition by the Palmers and the Honorés began in 1910; only one of the original buildings from the preserve, now known as the Woodmont Clubhouse, remains. Because it escaped logging, the grounds of the clubhouse harbor some of the largest specimens of live oak and longleaf pine in the city.

Mrs. Potter-Palmer&#x27;s vision for her property was that it be developed into a golf course community surrounded by extensive citrus groves, but her death in 1918 prevented her from fully realizing that vision. At her death, the trustee of her estate and brother, Adrian Honoré, sold her local land holdings to Burks Hamner, Vance Helm, Maud Fowler, Cody Fowler, and D. Collins Gillett, who formed two development corporations: Temple Terrace Estates, Inc., which developed the golf course and residential areas; and Temple Terraces, Inc., which developed of orange groves that originally surrounded the city to the west and north, the largest orange grove in the world in the 1920s. (Adrian Honoré retained a seat on the board.) D. Collins Gillett oversaw Temple Terraces, Inc. and owned the first and largest citrus nursery in Florida, Buckeye Nurseries of Tampa. His father, Myron E. Gillett, thirty-first mayor of Tampa, was instrumental in popularizing the exotic hybrid Temple orange in the United States.

The 1920 vision for the community was that wealthy retired Northerners would purchase one of the lots in Temple Terrace, build a Mediterranean Revival villa on the lot and also purchase a parcel in the extensive adjoining citrus grove to either manage as a hobby or provide extra income. Temple Terrace was originally only occupied during &quot;The Season&quot; (which lasted roughly from December to the annual Washington Ball held at the clubhouse on February 22). For the rest of the year, the houses were cared for by caretakers until The Season came again and the homeowners returned.

In 1924, part of the area platted as the Temple Orange grove and called Temple Terraces, Inc. was developed into the present-day neighborhood of Temple Crest, immediately adjacent to Temple Terrace and its west, hugging the Hillsborough River. The land occupied by nearby Busch Gardens was also part of Mrs. Palmer&#x27;s original ranch.

In 1925 and 1926, the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club (which is still in existence) hosted the Florida Open (in 1925 billed as the &quot;Greatest Field of Golfers ever to Play in Florida&quot;). &quot;Long&quot; Jim Barnes was the resident professional of the course at the time (James Kelly Thomson was the course&#x27;s first pro), and every major golfer of the day competed in the event except for Bobby Jones. Leo Diegel won the tournament. Jim Barnes&#x27; friend Fred McLeod is also associated with the early days of the course. The golf-course architect was Tom Bendelow, who also designed Medinah Country Club&#x27;s Course #3 in Chicago, a golf course that has hosted three U.S. Opens (1949, 1975, 1990) and two PGA Championships (1999, 2006). The golf course of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club is virtually unchanged since its design by Bendelow and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. It measures 6,414 yards with a par of 72.

Temple Terrace is one of the first planned golf-course communities in the United States (1920). The town plan was created by town planner and landscape architect George F. Young, who also created the plan for nearby Davis Islands (Tampa) and McClelland Park (Sarasota), among others. The architecture was designed in the Mediterranean-Revival style by two different architects in two different periods. The first phase was in 1921 by noted Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott (Centro Asturiano de Tampa and Old Tampa City Hall) designed the initial houses and the public buildings. In 1926 renowned New York architect Dwight James Baum (architect of John Ringling&#x27;s Cà d&#x27;Zan, the Hotel El Verona in Sarasota, and the West Side YMCA in New York City) also designed residences in Temple Terrace.

There are fifteen houses and buildings designed by Elliott remaining in the city, the largest collection of his work anywhere. In addition, there are over 35 houses in the city designed by architect Dwight James Baum, which is thought to be the largest collection of his work in the Southeast.

Temple Terrace struggled through the 1930s like the rest of Florida. Building activity began to pick up again after World War II. There is now a fine collection of mid-century modern homes and buildings, at least two of which were designed by well-known architect Frank Albert DePasquale.

==Florida College==

Florida Bible Institute bought the old Country Club Clubhouse in the late 1930s from the city for back taxes and remains a cherished part of Florida College. Florida College is now a private liberal arts college (founded in 1946) and occupies some of the community&#x27;s oldest buildings, including the Temple Terrace Country Club, which is now Sutton Hall. Billy Graham attended Florida Bible Institute, which owned the property now occupied by Florida College, in the late 1930s. In his autobiography, he writes that he received his calling &quot;on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club&quot;. A Billy Graham Memorial Park is on the east side of the 18th green on the river.

==Rejuvenation and redevelopment==

Temple Terrace&#x27;s rebirth took place in 1984–1987 with the appointment of Thomas C. Mortenson as the city&#x27;s Building and Zoning Director and 1st Community Development Director. Mortenson, with the assistance of City Engineer Paul Tomasino, and City Attorney Ted Taub, were responsible for the annexation of Telecom Park and numerous areas adjacent to the city, thereby tripling the tax base and doubling the size of the city. Creating a favorable development environment and working with the Mayor and City Council, the trio worked to attract new businesses, and shopping centers, as well as redevelopment of existing business areas and vastly expanded housing in the community. Numerous new subdivisions were created during this period giving the city a firm tax base and identity that made Temple Terrace a desirable safe place for raising families, conducting business, and an environmentally sound community.

Temple Terrace is currently in the process of redeveloping (the southeast quadrant) of its 1960s-era downtown. The goal of the city is to build a mixed-use, medium-density, pedestrian-oriented downtown.

The city hired noted town planner Torti Gallas + Partners in 2004 to create a New Urbanist master plan and redevelopment code for the entire downtown area (four quadrants of 56th Street and Busch Boulevard), all with citizen input. The city also initiated a form-based code for its downtown, created a façade-improvement grant program, implemented a multi-modal transportation model to encourage alternatives to the automobile, and began revitalizing 56th Street with entry towers, landscaping, street furniture, placing utilities underground, and improved lighting.

The site of the new downtown area is the site of the downtown area that was originally planned in the 1920s but never built because of the Great Depression. Many of the planning concepts and architecture of the redevelopment area are based on the original plan and Temple Terrace&#x27;s unique 1920s historic Mediterranean Revival architecture.

==Neighbors==

Many of Temple Terrace&#x27;s residents teach or work at the nearby University of South Florida, and the close-knit community has strong ties to that institution. (The USF campus was also part of Mrs. Palmer&#x27;s original ranch.)

Eureka Springs Park, located to the east of Temple Terrace, is Hillsborough County&#x27;s only botanical garden. The park was started by Russian immigrant and amateur horticulturalist Albert Greenberg, who donated his park to the county in 1967. Poet Robert Frost and other famous personalities made it a point to visit Greenberg in the years before World War II.

The Museum of Science &amp; Industry, commonly called MOSI, is located in Tampa near the Temple Terrace city line.

Sitting just one mile to the west of Temple Terrace is Busch Gardens Tampa.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the City of Temple Terrace is located in north-central Hillsborough County at (28.041546, –82.382519). The city is bounded by Tampa to the west and north, Del Rio to the south, and rural Hillsborough County, near Interstate 75, to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.70%, are water. The Hillsborough River flows through the eastern and southern parts of the city and forms some of its southern boundary.

==Climate==

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally warm winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of Temple Terrace has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Library==
The Temple Terrace Public Library is located at 202 Bullard Parkway in the City of Temple Terrace and is part of the Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative (HCPLC).

=== History ===

The Temple Terrace Library was established in 1959 by the Temple Terrace Women&#x27;s Club. The doors officially opened on January 15, 1960, after pursuing a collection of enough donations to facilitate a small library for the community. It was originally run by volunteers of the Women&#x27;s Club and was located in a small house. As demand grew, they relocated to a City Hall building in April 1961, which is now part of Florida College. The library shortly outgrew this too as they built their collection and by 1965 they needed a new building and a larger overall operation which included appointing a Library Board which was run by the city. They broke ground in September of that year and opened in April 1966. The Women&#x27;s Club remained involved and provided the money for the library&#x27;s service desk. By the mid-70&#x27;s they were running out of space and added 5,600 square feet which enlarged the structure by April 1978. On February 18, 1982, tragedy ensued when a fire was set by an arsonist. The library lost a devastating 11,666 books and 1,010 recordings. The Women&#x27;s Club stepped in again and helped restore the building which then opened a year after the fire. In the meantime, they relocated materials to the Lightfoot Recreation Center to keep the library going. In 1997 the library was once again renovated for expansion which brought the library to 20,000 square feet. It reopened in March 1998 with an online catalog, computers, and internet access which is largely how it is utilized to this day with a collection of over 100,000 volumes and 52 community computers.

<text>Thonotosassa is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,238 at the 2020 census, up from 13,014 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The name &quot;Thonotosassa&quot; comes from the Seminole-Creek words &#x27; &quot;flint&quot; and &#x27; &quot;some&quot;, meaning the place was a source of valuable flint. Following the establishment of Fort Brooke in 1824 in what is now Tampa, a road that ran northwest of Lake Thonotosassa was built between Fort Brooke and Fort King in Ocala. This road became known as the Fort King Road, which today is crossed in several locations by U.S. Route 301. Nevertheless, the presence of a Seminole village largely discouraged whites from moving into the area. After the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, whites began to settle.

In 1893, the Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad opened a route between the two growing communities. This line today no longer extends into Thonotosassa, its northern tracks having been removed along with the town depot by the 1980s, but its southern portion remains a busy industrial spur, joining with the CSX main line at Neve Wye.

Among other areas for recreation for the youth is the Morris Bridge Road area and its Nature&#x27;s Classroom.

I-4 leads east to Lakeland and west to downtown Tampa, while I-75 leads north to Ocala and south to Bradenton.

<text>Valrico is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. As of 2020 the population was 37,895.

== History ==
Before the Civil War, the area was known as Long Pond and consisted of several cotton plantations. It was renamed Valrico, meaning &quot;rich valley&quot; in Spanish, in the 1880s when William G. Tousey, a philosophy professor from Tufts College, purchased property in the area. In 1890, an influx of immigrants arrived, following the construction of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad through the area.

When the railroad was completed, Tousey began building up the community with retail stores, streets, and a bank. In 1893, Mr. Bryan built a steam mill at Valrico station. In 1895, a major freeze halted these developments, and the population began to dwindle. Nonetheless, the town continued, and a schoolhouse was completed in 1896. The population continued to fall, from 100 people in 1893 to only 50 in 1911.

This setback did not deter local landowners from pushing forward with the town&#x27;s development. From 1910 to 1914 Judge Hamner, Governor Van Sant, D. Humbird, W.H., S.C. Phipps and W.F. Miller started an improvement project along Hopewell Road, later designated SR 60. W.F. Miller, serving as president of the Valrico Improvement Association, raised $3,500 to erect the Valrico Civic Center, now known as the James McCabe Theater. The area&#x27;s first general store was opened by Lovett Brandon in 1912.

Valrico once again suffered a major blow during the stock market crash of 1929, which saw nearly every business in the town shut down. Not until the mid-1950s did the town begin to see growth again, primarily due to the connection of SR 60 to Tampa&#x27;s Adamo Drive, placing Valrico right along a major Florida thoroughfare.

<text>Wimauma is an unincorporated census-designated place in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. The population was 6,373 at the 2010 census, up from 4,246 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Wimauma was founded by Captain C.H. Davis in 1902. Davis named the town using the first few letters of the names of his daughters Will, Maude, and Mary. Wimauma was located on a railroad route that was built south from Durant to Manatee County and into Sarasota, with construction starting in 1895. It was incorporated in 1902 as the United States &amp; West Indies Railroad and Steamship Company. It became the Florida West Shore Railway on May 9, 1903 and then merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1909. In 1902, Capt. Davis helped to build the railroad connecting Turkey Creek and Bradenton. He decided to found a town at the halfway point, opening a post office there on October 24, 1902. The town had the railroad tracks as the eastern boundary and was centered on Lake Tiger, now called Lake Wimauma. A railroad depot was constructed in 1903. The town was officially incorporated in 1925 as the county&#x27;s fourth municipality, but the city government ceased to function some time in the 1930s. In 1993, this fact was rediscovered, but it was concluded that the incorporation was no longer valid after about 60 years without a city government.

<text>Fellsmere is a city in Indian River County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Sebastian–Vero Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,834 at the 2020 census.

It is home of the Fellsmere Frog Leg Festival and was home to the now closed National Elephant Center. Fellsmere is the first place in Florida where women were allowed to vote. In a municipal election on June 19, 1915, resident Zena M. Dreier became the first woman to legally cast a ballot in the American South, five years before the 19th Amendment established women&#x27;s suffrage nationally.

==History==
In 1915, Fellsmere became the first municipality in Florida (or anywhere south of the Mason–Dixon line) to grant women the right to vote. It also, at the same time, held the first election in which corporations could vote. Mrs. Zena M. Dreier was the first woman to cast a vote in the city, and E. Nelson Fell cast a vote on behalf of his company Fellsmere Farms. The city had unanimously adopted a charter in February 1915, which granted these rights, and the city charter was ratified by the state legislature without any notice being paid to this provision. This, despite the fact that several statewide suffrage measures had failed in the legislature that year. Women&#x27;s suffrage was not granted nationally in the United States until five years later, in August 1920, with the passage of the 19th Amendment.

==Geography==

==Public transportation==
Fellsmere is served by the #10 bus route of GoLine, providing service to the North County Transit Hub.

The first railroad to reach Fellsmere was the narrow-gauge Sebastian-Cincinnatus Railroad, built by the sons of printing magnate Anthony Octavius Russell. It was replaced by the standard-gauge Fellsmere Railroad in 1910. The line was later extended west to the now-gone town of Broadmoor before being bought by the Trans-Florida Central Railroad in 1924. The line was abandoned in 1952.

<doc id="109261" wikidata="Q2443721" url="?curid=109261" title="Gifford, Florida">
<text>Gifford () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Indian River County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Sebastian–Vero Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,511 at the 2020 census. Gifford has a rich African American history and is noted as the hometown of several African-American landscape artists who were members of The Highwaymen. Gifford is one of the poorest communities in Florida.

==History==
The settlement of Gifford was organized in the mid-1880s, according to the Indian River County Historical Society. The area was named as the Woodley precinct in the 1900 census, and as a settlement village for black families, the community grew. By 1893, the early settlers of Gifford had been joined by black laborers who had come to work on Henry Flagler&#x27;s new railroad project, the Florida East Coast Railway. The residents named the small agricultural community Brownsville after farmer William Brown who settled there in 1880s, but another town in North Florida carried the same name. Instead, the community was named after Charlie Gifford, the railroad&#x27;s stationmaster and Henry T. Gifford&#x27;s son.

The town&#x27;s first school was built in 1898, but only served white children. In 1901 William Edward Geoffrey, a black man from Darlington, South Carolina who had come to work on the railroad, set up school for black children. The school served as the heart of the community and remained Gifford High School until integration, and the last graduating class was in 1969, before transitioning into the middle school.

In 2018, the Historic Macedonia Church was converted into the Gifford Historical Museum by the Gifford Community Cultural &amp; Resource Center (GCCRC).

One of the highlights of Gifford is the Victor Hart Sr. Community Enhancement Complex located at the northern end of 43rd Avenue. The complex was renamed in 2017 to honor Mr. Hart for his work and outreach in the community.

In 1715, several Spanish ships loaded with treasure (known as the 1715 Treasure Fleet) encountered a storm off the shores of the Treasure Coast and were lost. It is estimated that only a portion of the sunken treasure has been found. The value placed on the treasure lost from the 1715 fleet has been estimated at more than US$500 million.

The town of Sebastian was a fishing village as early as the 1870s. In the early 1880s David Peter Gibson and Thomas New settled in the area. New filed to start a post office under the name New Haven. However, New got into legal trouble for misuse of his position as postmaster and was removed. Officially, Sebastian was founded in 1882 and named St. Sebastian, after Saint Sebastian. Later, “St.” was removed from the name of the town, but not from the river. Sebastian was incorporated as a city in 1923.

Nearby Pelican Island was declared the first National Wildlife Refuge in the United States in 1903.

<text>Vero Beach is a city in and the county seat of Indian River County, Florida, United States. According to the 2020 census, the city had a population of 16,354. Nicknamed &quot;The Hibiscus City&quot;, Vero is situated about southeast of Orlando along the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean on Florida&#x27;s Treasure Coast. Because it is located about north of West Palm Beach at the northern end of the South Florida region, the city has adopted two similar mottos &quot;The Gateway to the Tropics&quot; and &quot;Where the Tropics Begin&quot;.

Vero Beach was named the 7th Best Small Beach Town in Florida by &quot;Southern Living Magazine&quot; in 2023. The main roadways in the city are U.S. Route 1, Florida State Road A1A, and Florida State Road 60 (20th Street), which has its eastern terminus at Sexton Plaza in the city.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian===
Parts of a human skeleton were found north of Vero in association with the remains of Pleistocene animals in 1915. The find was controversial, and the view that the human remains dated from much later than the Pleistocene prevailed for many years. In 2006, an image of a mastodon or mammoth carved on a bone was found in vicinity of the Vero man discovery. A scientific forensic examination of the bone found the carving had probably been done in the Pleistocene. Archaeologists from Mercyhurst University, in conjunction with the Old Vero Ice Age Sites Committee (OVIASC), conducted excavations at the Old Vero Man site in Vero Beach in 2014–2015. Starting in 2016, archaeologists from Florida Atlantic University joined the Old Vero Man site excavations.

===Post-Columbian===
In 1715, a Spanish treasure fleet wrecked off the coast of Vero. Eleven out of twelve Spanish ships carrying tonnes of silver foundered in a hurricane. The remains of the silver attracted pirates. A group of 300 unemployed English privateers led by Henry Jennings stole about £87,500 in gold and silver in their first acts of piracy. The coins still wash to the shore to this day.

In 1872, Captain Allen W. Estes officially established the first land patent between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian River Lagoon, after settling in the area in 1870.

In 1893, Henry Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railway began operation through the area.

The town of Vero was chartered on June 10, 1919, with a population of 71 residents.

Vero was officially renamed &quot;Vero Beach&quot; and was switched from being part of St. Lucie County to becoming the county seat of Indian River County upon its formation on May 19, 1925. There are many theories on possible origin of the city name, but there&#x27;s no consensus. Early residential construction in the area often utilized Florida cracker architecture style.

During the war year of 1942, the U.S. Navy selected surrounding the Vero Beach Municipal Airport as the site of Fort Pierce Naval Amphibious Training Base, a Naval Air Station. Due to the bombing practices conducted during the WWII, there are many buried explosives and the Army Corps officials have conducted ongoing search &amp; clearing exercises for the potentially dangerous items since 2014.

In 1951, Barber Bridge was built from mainland to barrier islands. It was later demolished and replaced in 1995 with the Merrill P. Barber Bridge. It is named after Merrill P. Barber who was the mayor of Vero beach in 1947.

In 1957, Piper Aircraft began research and development in Vero Beach. In 1961 Piper Aircraft moved administrative and manufacturing operations to Vero after completing building additions.

In 1965, the A1A bridge over the Sebastian Inlet connected the two barrier islands. In 1979, the 17th Street Bridge was completed, allowing a second point of access from Vero Beach mainland to the barrier islands.

<doc id="109275" wikidata="Q156268" url="?curid=109275" title="Pierre Bourdieu">
<text>Pierre Bourdieu (, ; ; 1 August 1930 – 23 January 2002) was a French sociologist and public intellectual. Bourdieu&#x27;s contributions to the sociology of education, the theory of sociology, and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields (e.g. anthropology, media and cultural studies, education, popular culture, and the arts). During his academic career he was primarily associated with the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and the Collège de France.

Bourdieu&#x27;s work was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society, especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order is maintained within and across generations. In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics. Building upon and criticizing the theories of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Erwin Panofsky and Marcel Mauss among others, his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods, and introduced such influential concepts as cultural, social, and symbolic forms of capital (as opposed to traditional economic forms of capital), the cultural reproduction, the habitus, the field or location, and symbolic violence. Another notable influence on Bourdieu was Blaise Pascal, after whom Bourdieu titled his &quot;Pascalian Meditations&quot;.

Bourdieu was a prolific author, producing hundreds of articles and three dozen books, nearly all of which are now available in English. His best-known book is &quot;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&quot; (1979), in which he argues that judgments of taste are acts of social positioning. The argument is put forward by an original combination of social theory and data from quantitative surveys, photographs and interviews, in an attempt to reconcile difficulties such as how to understand the subject within objective structures. In the process, Bourdieu attempts to reconcile the influences of both external social structures and subjective experience on the individual. The book was named &quot;the sixth most important sociological work of the twentieth century&quot; by the International Sociological Association (ISA).

Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s work emphasized how social classes, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations despite the myth that contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility, achieved through formal education.

==Life and career==
Pierre Bourdieu was born in Denguin (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), in southern France, to a postal worker and his wife. The household spoke Béarnese, a Gascon dialect. In 1962, Bourdieu married Marie-Claire Brizard, and the couple would go on to have three sons, Jérôme, Emmanuel, and Laurent.

Bourdieu was educated at the Lycée Louis-Barthou in Pau before moving to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. From there he gained entrance to the École Normale Supérieure (ENS), also in Paris, where he studied philosophy alongside Louis Althusser. After getting his agrégation, Bourdieu worked as a lycée teacher at Moulins for a year before his conscription into the French Army in 1955.

His biographers write that he chose not to enter the Reserve Officer&#x27;s College like many of his fellow ENS graduates as he wished to stay with people from his own modest social background. Deployed to Algeria in October 1955 during its war of independence from France, Bourdieu served in a unit guarding military installations before being transferred to clerical work.

After his year-long military service, Bourdieu stayed on as a lecturer in Algiers. During the Algerian War in 1958–1962, Bourdieu undertook ethnographic research into the clash through a study of the Kabyle peoples of the Berbers, laying the groundwork for his anthropological reputation. The result was his first book, &quot;Sociologie de l&#x27;Algérie&quot; (1958; &quot;The Sociology of Algeria&quot;), which became an immediate success in France and was published in America in 1962. He later drew heavily on this fieldwork in his 1972 book &quot;Outline of a Theory of Practice&quot;, a strong intervention into anthropological theory.

Bourdieu routinely sought to connect theoretical ideas with empirical research and his work can be seen as sociology of culture or, as he described it, a &quot;Theory of Practice&quot;. His contributions to sociology were both evidential and theoretical (i.e., calculated through both systems). His key terms would be habitus, &quot;capital&quot;, and field.

He extended the idea of capital to categories such as &quot;social capital&quot;, &quot;cultural capital&quot;, &quot;financial capital&quot;, and &quot;symbolic capital&quot;. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional &quot;social space&quot;; a person is not defined only by social class membership, but by every single kind of capital he can articulate through social relations. That capital includes the value of social networks, which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.

In 1960, Bourdieu returned to the University of Paris before gaining a teaching position at the University of Lille, where he remained until 1964. From 1964 onwards Bourdieu held the position of Professor (Directeur d&#x27;études) in the VIe section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études (the future École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales), and from 1981 the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France (held before him by Raymond Aron and Maurice Halbwachs). In 1968, Bourdieu took over the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, founded by Aron, which he directed until his death.

In 1975, with the research group he had formed at the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, he launched the interdisciplinary journal , with which he sought to transform the accepted canons of sociological production while buttressing the scientific rigor of sociology. In 1993 he was honored with the &quot;Médaille d&#x27;or du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique&quot; (CNRS). In 1996 he received the Goffman Prize from the University of California, Berkeley and in 2001 the Huxley Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Bourdieu died of cancer at the age of 71.

== Thought ==
Much of Bourdieu&#x27;s work observes the role of educational and cultural resources in the expression of agency. Bourdieu was in practice both influenced by and sympathetic to the Marxist identification of economic command as a principal component of power and agency within capitalist society.

Bourdieu&#x27;s anthropological work was dominated by social hierarchy reproduction analysis. Bourdieu criticized the importance given to economic factors in the analysis of social order and change. He stressed, instead, that the capacity of actors to impose their cultural reproductions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of dominant social structures. Symbolic violence is the self-interested capacity to ensure that the arbitrariness of the social order is either ignored, or argued as natural, thereby justifying the legitimacy of existing social structures. This concept plays an essential part in his sociological analysis, which emphasizes the importance of &quot;practices&quot; in the social world. Bourdieu was opposed to the intellectualist tradition and stressed that social domination and cultural reproduction were primarily focused on bodily know-how and competent practices in the society. Bourdieu fiercely opposed &quot;Rational Choice Theory&quot; because he believed it was a misunderstanding of how social agents operate.

===Influences===
Bourdieu&#x27;s work is influenced by much of traditional anthropology and sociology which he undertook to synthesize into his own theory. From Max Weber he retained an emphasis on the dominance of symbolic systems in social life, as well as the idea of social orders which would ultimately be transformed by Bourdieu from a sociology of religion into a theory of fields.

From Marx he gained his understanding of &#x27;society&#x27; as the ensemble of social relationships: &quot;what exist in the social world are relations – not interactions between agents or intersubjective ties between individuals, but objective relations which exist &#x27;independently of individual consciousness and will&#x27;.&quot; (grounded in the mode and conditions of economic production), and of the need to dialectically develop social theory from social practice. (Arnold Hauser earlier published the orthodox application of Marxist class theory to the fine arts in &quot;The Social History of Art&quot; (1951).)

From Émile Durkheim, through Marcel Mauss and Claude Lévi-Strauss, Bourdieu inherited a certain structuralist interpretation of the tendency of social structures to reproduce themselves, based on the analysis of symbolic structures and forms of classification. However, Bourdieu critically diverged from Durkheim in emphasizing the role of the social &quot;agent&quot; in enacting, through the embodiment of social structures, symbolic orders. He furthermore emphasized that the reproduction of social structures does not operate according to a functionalist logic.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty and, through him, the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl played an essential part in the formulation of Bourdieu&#x27;s focus on the body, action, and practical dispositions (which found their primary manifestation in Bourdieu&#x27;s theory of &quot;habitus&quot;).

Bourdieu was also influenced by Wittgenstein (especially with regard to his work on rule-following) stating that &quot;Wittgenstein is probably the philosopher who has helped me most at moments of difficulty. He&#x27;s a kind of saviour for times of great intellectual distress&quot;. Bourdieu&#x27;s work is built upon an attempt to transcend a series of oppositions which he thought characterized the social sciences (subjectivism/objectivism, micro/macro, freedom/determinism) of his time. His concepts of habitus, capital, and field were conceived with the intention of overcoming such oppositions.

===As a public intellectual===
During the 1990s, Bourdieu became more and more involved in political debate, becoming one of the most important public faces of intellectual life in France. While a fierce critic of neoliberalism, Bourdieu was also critical of the &quot;total intellectual&quot; role played by Jean-Paul Sartre, and he dismissed Sartre&#x27;s attempts to intervene in French politics as &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;opportunistic.&quot; Bourdieu saw sociology not as a form of &quot;intellectual entertainment&quot; but as a serious discipline of a scientific nature. There is an apparent contradiction between Bourdieu&#x27;s earlier writings against using sociology for political activism and his later launch into the role of a public intellectual, with some highly &quot;visible political statements.&quot; Although much of his early work stressed the importance of treating sociology as a strict scientific discipline,—&quot;&quot; ()—his later career saw him enter the less academic world of political debate in France, raising the issue of whether the sociologist has political responsibilities extending to the public domain.

Although Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre, he had strong political views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By the time of his later work, his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born, from an &quot;urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate.&quot;

Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effects—particularly the harm—of neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;, although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles. &quot;The Weight of the World&quot; represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists, it also shows Bourdieu&#x27;s collaborative character, indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category of public intellectual.

Nevertheless, Bourdieu&#x27;s activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage, fulfilling his &quot;constructionist view of social life&quot; as it relied upon the idea of social actors making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very public action of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm. It is notable that, in his later writings, Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals, describing them as &quot;like the Trojan Horse&quot; for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description &#x27;public intellectual&#x27;, worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.
== Theory of habitus ==

Bourdieu developed a theory of action, around the concept of &quot;habitus&quot;, which exerted a considerable influence in the social sciences. This theory seeks to show that social agents develop strategies which are adapted to the structures of the social worlds that they inhabit. These strategies are unconscious and act on the level of a bodily logic.

In Bourdieu&#x27;s perspective, each relatively autonomous field of modern life (such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education), ultimately engenders a specific complex of social relations where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field. This &quot;disposition&quot;, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through their engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, i.e. &quot;habitus&quot;: lasting, acquired schemes of perception, thought and action.

&quot;Habitus&quot; is somewhat reminiscent of some preexisting sociological concepts, such as socialization, though it also differs from the more classic concepts in several key ways. Most notably, a central aspect of the habitus is its &quot;embodiment&quot;: habitus does not only, or even primarily, function at the level of explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the &#x27;muscle memory&#x27; cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball—the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens&#x27; concept of &quot;practical consciousness&quot;.

The concept of &quot;habitus&quot; was inspired by Marcel Mauss&#x27;s notion of body technique and &quot;hexis&quot;, as well as Erwin Panofsky&#x27;s concept of &quot;intuitus&quot;. The word &quot;habitus&quot; itself can be found in the works of Mauss, as well as of Norbert Elias, Max Weber, Edmund Husserl, and Alfred Schutz as re-workings of the concept as it emerged in Aristotle&#x27;s notion of &quot;hexis&quot;, which would become &quot;habitus&quot; through Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s Latin translation.

=== Disposition ===
&quot;Disposition&quot;—a key concept in Bourdieu&#x27;s work—can be defined as a &quot;sense of the game&quot;; a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like &#x27;knee-jerk&#x27; opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often &quot;acknowledge&quot;, &quot;legitimate&quot;, and &quot;reproduce&quot; the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.

Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the subjective structures of the &quot;habitus&quot; can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains the continuity of the social order through time. As the individual &quot;habitus&quot; is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person&#x27;s life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.

Some examples of his empirical results include showing that, despite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people&#x27;s artistic preferences (e.g. classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position; and showing that subtleties of language such as accent, grammar, spelling and style—all part of cultural capital—are a major factor in social mobility (e.g. getting a higher-paid, higher-status job).

Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Sociological arguments have raged between those who argue that the former should be sociology&#x27;s principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks that dispositions be considered, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology, asserting a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that the proper object of sociological analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.

== Field theory ==

According to Bourdieu, agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. Rather, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic—a practical sense—and bodily dispositions. Instead of confining his analysis of social relations and change to voluntaristic agency or strictly in terms of class as a structural relation, Bourdieu uses the agency-structure bridging concept of &quot;field&quot;.

A &quot;field&quot; can be described as any historical, non-homogeneous social-spatial arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. In simpler terms, a &quot;field&quot; refers to any setting in which agents and their social positions are located. Accordingly, the position of each particular agent in the field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent&#x27;s habitus, and agent&#x27;s capital (social, economic, and cultural). Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.

For Bourdieu, social activity differences led to various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.

Social agents act according to their &quot;feel for the game&quot;, in which the &quot;feel&quot; roughly refers to the habitus, and the &quot;game&quot;, to the field.

===Media and cultural production===
Bourdieu&#x27;s most significant work on cultural production is available in two books: &quot;The Field of Cultural Production&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Rules of Art&quot; (1996). Bourdieu builds his theory of cultural production using his own characteristic theoretical vocabulary of &quot;habitus&quot;, &quot;capital&quot; and &quot;field&quot;.

David Hesmondhalgh writes that: By &#x27;cultural production&#x27; Bourdieu intends a very broad understanding of culture, in line with the tradition of classical sociology, including science (which in turn includes social science), law and religion, as well as expressive-aesthetic activities such as art, literature and music. However, his work on cultural production focuses overwhelmingly on two types of field or sub-field of cultural production…: literature and art.According to Bourdieu, &quot;the principal obstacle to a rigorous science of the production of the value of cultural goods&quot; is the &quot;charismatic ideology of &#x27;creation&#x27;&quot; which can be easily found in studies of art, literature and other cultural fields. In Bourdieu&#x27;s opinion, this charismatic ideology &quot;directs the gaze towards the apparent producer and prevents us from asking who has created this &#x27;creator&#x27; and the magic power of transubstantiation with which the &#x27;creator&#x27; is endowed.&quot;

For Bourdieu, a sociologically informed view of an artist ought to describe: (1) their relations to the field of production (e.g. influences, antagonisms, etc.); and (2) their attitudes to their relations to the field of consumption (e.g. their readers, enthusiasts, or detractors). Further, a work of literature, for example, may not adequately be analysed either as the product of the author&#x27;s life and beliefs (a naively biographical account), or without any reference to the author&#x27;s intentions (as Barthes argued). In short, &quot;the subject of a work is a &quot;habitus&quot; in relationship with a &#x27;post&#x27;, a position, that is, within a field.&quot;

According to Bourdieu, cultural revolutions are always dependent on the possibilities present in the positions inscribed in the field.

== Objective (field) and subjective (habitus) ==
For Bourdieu, &quot;habitus&quot; was essential in resolving a prominent antinomy of the human sciences: objectivism and subjectivism.

As mentioned above, Bourdieu used the methodological and theoretical concepts of habitus and field in order to make an epistemological break with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social phenomenology and structuralism. Habitus and field are proposed to do so.

The individual agent develops these dispositions in response to the objective conditions it encounters. In this way, Bourdieu theorizes the inculcation of objective social structures into the subjective, mental experience of agents. For the objective social field places requirements on its participants for membership, so to speak, within the field. Having thereby absorbed objective social structure into a personal set of cognitive and somatic dispositions, and the subjective structures of action of the agent then being commensurate with the objective structures and extant exigencies of the social field, a &quot;doxic&quot; relationship emerges.

===Habitus and doxa===
&quot;Doxa&quot; refers to the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, unconscious beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent&#x27;s actions and thoughts within a particular field. &quot;Doxa&quot; tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may be thought of as a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the &#x27;subjective&#x27;, internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, the social world is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.

Bourdieu thus sees habitus as an important factor contributing to social reproduction, because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life. Individuals learn to want what conditions make possible for them, and not to aspire to what is not available to them. The conditions in which the individual lives generate dispositions compatible with these conditions (including tastes in art, literature, food, and music), and in a sense pre-adapted to their demands. The most improbable practices are therefore excluded, as unthinkable, by a kind of immediate submission to order that inclines agents to make a virtue of necessity, that is, to refuse what is categorically denied and to will the inevitable.

===Reconciling the objective (field) and the subjective (habitus)===
Amongst any society of individuals, the constant performance of dispositions, trivial and grand, forms an observable range of preferences and allegiances, points and vectors. This spatial metaphor can be analysed by sociologists and realised in diagrammatic form. Ultimately, conceptualising social relations this way gives rise to an image of society as a web of interrelated spaces. These are the social fields.

For Bourdieu, habitus and field can only exist in relation to each other. Although a field is constituted by the various social agents participating in it (and thus their habitus), a habitus, in effect, represents the transposition of objective structures of the field into the subjective structures of action and thought of the agent.

The relationship between habitus and field is twofold. First, the field exists only insofar as social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata that are necessary to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how that will allow them to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.

Bourdieu attempts to use the concepts of habitus and field to remove the division between the subjective and the objective. Bourdieu asserts that any research must be composed of two &quot;minutes,&quot; wherein the first minute is an objective stage of research—where one looks at the relations of the social space and the structures of the field; while the second minute must be a subjective analysis of social agents&#x27; dispositions to act and their categories of perception and understanding that result from their inhabiting the field. Proper research, Bourdieu argues, thus cannot do without these two together.

=== Science and objectivity ===
Bourdieu contended there is transcendental objectivity, only when certain necessary historical conditions are met. The scientific field is precisely that field in which objectivity may be acquired. Bourdieu&#x27;s ideal scientific field is one that grants its participants an interest or investment in objectivity. Further, this ideal scientific field is one in which the field&#x27;s degree of autonomy advances and, in a corresponding process, its &quot;entrance fee&quot; becomes increasingly strict. The scientific field entails rigorous intersubjective scrutinizing of theory and data. This should make it difficult for those within the field to bring in, for example, political influence.

However, the autonomy of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted. An important part of Bourdieu&#x27;s theory is that the historical development of a scientific field, sufficiently autonomous to be described as such and to produce objective work, is an achievement that requires continual reproduction. Having been achieved, it cannot be assumed to be secure. Bourdieu does not discount the possibility that the scientific field may lose its autonomy and therefore deteriorate, losing its defining characteristic as a producer of objective work. In this way, the conditions of possibility for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.

===Reflexivity===
Bourdieu insists on the importance of a &quot;reflexive sociology&quot; in which sociologists must at all times conduct their research with conscious attention to the effects of their own position, their own set of internalized structures, and how these are likely to distort or prejudice their objectivity. The sociologist, according to Bourdieu, must engage in a &quot;sociology of sociology&quot; so as not to unwittingly attribute to the object of observation the characteristics of the subject. They ought to conduct their research with one eye continually reflecting back upon their own habitus, their dispositions learned through long social and institutional training.

It is only by maintaining such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot themselves in the act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students&#x27; work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears &#x27;polished&#x27;, marking down those guilty of &#x27;vulgarity&#x27;. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it—not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.

Bourdieu also describes how the &quot;scholastic point of view&quot; unconsciously alters how scientists approach their objects of study. Because of the systematicity of their training and their mode of analysis, they tend to exaggerate the systematicity of the things they study. This inclines them to see agents following clear rules where in fact they use less determinate strategies; it makes it hard to theorise the &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; logic of the social world, its practical and therefore mutable nature, poorly described by words like &#x27;system&#x27;, &#x27;structure&#x27; and &#x27;logic&#x27; which imply mechanisms, rigidity and omnipresence. The scholar can too easily find themselves mistaking &quot;the things of logic for the logic of things&quot;—a phrase of Marx&#x27;s which Bourdieu is fond of quoting. Again, reflexivity is recommended as the key to discovering and correcting for such errors which would otherwise remain unseen, mistakes produced by an over-application of the virtues that produced also the truths within which the errors are embedded.

==Theory of capital and class distinction==
Bourdieu introduced the notion of &quot;capital&quot;, defined as sums of particular assets put to productive use. For Bourdieu, such assets could take various forms, habitually referring to several principal forms of capital: &quot;economic&quot;, &quot;symbolic&quot;, &quot;cultural&quot; and &quot;social&quot;. Loïc Wacquant would go on to describe Bourdieu&#x27;s thought further: Capital comes in 3 principal species: economic, cultural and social. A fourth species, symbolic capital, designates the effects of any form of capital when people do not perceive them as such.Bourdieu developed theories of social stratification based on aesthetic taste in his 1979 work &quot;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&quot; (in ), published by Harvard University Press. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one&#x27;s social space to the world—one&#x27;s aesthetic dispositions—depicts one&#x27;s status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that children internalize these dispositions at an early age and that such dispositions guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and foster an aversion towards other behaviors.

Bourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and cultural capital. Society incorporates &quot;symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence…[as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction.&quot; Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that &quot;differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes.&quot;

The development of aesthetic dispositions are very largely determined by social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time. The acquisition of cultural capital depends heavily on &quot;total, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life.&quot; Bourdieu argues that, in the main, people inherit their cultural attitudes, the accepted &quot;definitions that their elders offer them.&quot;

He asserts the primacy of social origin and cultural capital by claiming that social capital and economic capital, though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that &quot;one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions.&quot;

According to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation are indicators of class because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual&#x27;s place in society. Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. The multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction &quot;has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator, or tailor.&quot;

However, Bourdieu does not disregard the importance of social capital and economic capital in the formation of cultural capital. For example, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument &quot;presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means...and spare time.&quot; However, regardless of one&#x27;s ability to act upon one&#x27;s preferences, Bourdieu specifies that &quot;respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate…culture.&quot;[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a &#x27;sense of one&#x27;s place,&#x27; guiding the occupants of a given...social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position. Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences. These &quot;cognitive structures…are internalized, &#x27;embodied&#x27; social structures,&quot; becoming a natural entity to the individual. Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in &quot;disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance (&#x27;feeling sick&#x27;) of the tastes of others.&quot;

Bourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are:most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste.Indeed, Bourdieu believes that &quot;the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning&quot; would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are &quot;an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in &#x27;showing off&#x27; a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).&quot; The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.

Children from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose &quot;heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap&quot; in their dinner layouts, opting for &quot;plentiful and good&quot; meals as opposed to foods that are &quot;original and exotic.&quot; These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu&#x27;s &quot;ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy,&quot; that contrasts the &quot;convivial indulgence&quot; characteristic of the lower classes. Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.

The degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one&#x27;s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, &quot;economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending.&quot; This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.

=== Symbolic capital ===
Bourdieu sees symbolic capital (e.g., prestige, honor, attention) as a crucial source of power. Symbolic capital is any species of capital that is, in Loïc Wacquant&#x27;s terms &quot;not perceived as such,&quot; but which is instead perceived through socially inculcated classificatory schemes. When a holder of symbolic capital uses the power this confers against an agent who holds less, and seeks thereby to alter their actions, they exercise &quot;symbolic violence&quot;. Research published in Organization Science shows that symbolic capital can be divided along two dimensions – reputability and respectability – and can be transferred by association.

Symbolic violence is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just. It is the incorporation of unconscious structures that tend to perpetuate the structures of action of the dominant. The dominated then take their position to be &quot;right.&quot; Symbolic violence is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the spectre of legitimacy of the social order.

In his theoretical writings, Bourdieu employs some terminology used in economics to analyze the processes of social and cultural reproduction, of how the various forms of capital tend to transfer from one generation to the next. For Bourdieu, formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success, according to Bourdieu, entails a whole range of cultural behaviour, extending to ostensibly non-academic features like gait, dress, or accent. Privileged children have learned this behaviour, as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers&#x27; expectations with apparent &#x27;ease&#x27;; they are &#x27;docile&#x27;. The unprivileged are found to be &#x27;difficult&#x27;, to present &#x27;challenges&#x27;. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this &#x27;ease&#x27;, or &#x27;natural&#x27; ability—distinction—as in fact the product of a great social labour, largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents&#x27; class position in the wider social system.

=== Cultural capital ===
Cultural capital refers to assets, e.g., competencies, skills, qualifications, which enable holders to mobilise cultural authority and can also be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example, working class children can come to see the educational success of their middle-class peers as always legitimate, seeing what is often class-based inequality as instead the result of hard work or even &#x27;natural&#x27; ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of people&#x27;s symbolic or economic inheritance (e.g., accent or property) into cultural capital (e.g., university qualifications).

Bourdieu argues that cultural capital has developed in opposition to economic capital. Moreover, the conflict between those who mostly hold cultural capital and those who mostly hold economic capital finds expression in the opposed social fields of art and business. The field of art and related cultural fields are seen to have striven historically for autonomy, which in different times and places has been more or less achieved. The autonomous field of art is summed up as &quot;an economic world turned upside down,&quot; highlighting the opposition between economic and cultural capital.

=== Social capital ===
For Bourdieu, &quot;social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing &quot;a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships&quot; of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&quot; In order for individuals to gain such capital, they must work for it constantly and it takes time according to Bourdieu. For some families, cultural capital is accumulated over a period of generations as they adopt cultural investment strategies and pass them on to their children. This gives children an opportunity to realize their potential through education and they pass on those same values to their children. Over time, individuals in such families gain cultural currency which gives them an inherent advantage over other groups of people, which is why there is such variation in academic achievement in children of different social classes. Having such cultural currency enables people to compensate for a lack of financial capital by giving them a certain level of respect and status in society. Bourdieu believes that cultural capital may play a role when individuals pursue power and status in society through politics or other means. Social and cultural capital along with economic capital contribute to the inequality we see in the world, according to Bourdieu&#x27;s argument.

====Language====
Bourdieu takes language to be not merely a method of communication, but also a mechanism of power. The language one uses is designated by one&#x27;s relational position in a field or social space. Different uses of language tend to reiterate the respective positions of each participant. Linguistic interactions are manifestations of the participants&#x27; respective positions in social space and categories of understanding, and thus tend to reproduce the objective structures of the social field. This determines who has a &quot;right&quot; to be listened to, to interrupt, to ask questions, and to lecture, and to what degree.

The representation of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language, dialect, and accent. For example, the use of different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. For example, until the French Revolution, the differences in dialect directly reflected a person&#x27;s presumed social status. Peasants and the lower classes spoke local dialects, while only nobles and the upper classes were fluent in the official French language. Accents can reflect an area&#x27;s inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.

Because language characteristics are acknowledged and noticed as signifiers of power they become mechanisms of power.

Bourdieu discusses language in his earlier work on education with sociologists Jean-Claude Passeron and Monique de Saint-Martin. This book, &quot;Rapport pédagogique et communication&quot; (1965) was translated into English in 1994. In their work, the authors argue that &quot;Academic language is a dead language for the great majority of French people, and is no one&#x27;s mother tongue [...]&quot;. This statement is widely cited by scholars working on second language acquisition, particularly in the context of teaching English academic writing to speakers of languages other than English.

== Legacy ==
Bourdieu &quot;was, for many, the leading intellectual of present-day France…a thinker in the same rank as Foucault, Barthes and Lacan.&quot; His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities. They have also been used in pedagogy. Several works of his are considered classics, not only in sociology, but also in anthropology, education, and cultural studies. &quot;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste&quot; (&quot;La Distinction&quot;) was named as one of the 20th century&#x27;s ten most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association. &quot;The Rules of Art&quot; has significantly affected sociology, history, literature and aesthetics.

In France, Bourdieu was seen not as an ivory tower academic or &quot;cloistered don&quot; but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001, a documentary film about Bourdieu—&quot;Sociology is a Martial Art—&quot;&quot;became an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed how much of a politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was, taking on the mantle of Émile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what people like him should do.&quot;

For Bourdieu, sociology was a combative effort that sought to expose the un-thought structures that lie beneath the physical (somatic) and thought practices of social agents. He saw sociology as a means of confronting symbolic violence and of exposing those unseen areas in which one could be free.

Bourdieu&#x27;s work continues to be influential. His work is widely cited, and many sociologists and other social scientists work explicitly in a Bourdieusian framework. One example is Loïc Wacquant, who persistently applies the Bourdieusian theoretical and methodological principles to subjects such as boxing, employing what Bourdieu termed &quot;participant objectivation&quot; (&quot;objectivation participante&quot;), or what Wacquant calls &quot;&quot;carnal sociology&quot;.&quot; In addition to publishing a book on Bourdieu&#x27;s lasting influence, novelist Édouard Louis uses the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu as a literary device.

Bourdieu also played a crucial role in the popularisation of correspondence analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. &quot;I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that &#x27;thinks&#x27; in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field,&quot; Bourdieu said, in the preface to &quot;The Craft of Sociology&quot;.

<text>Campbellton is a town in Jackson County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Florida Panhandle in North Florida, and has a predominately African American majority. The population was 191 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Campbellton was established as a community around 1840 or possibly earlier, and may have been named for Judge R.L. Campbell (who resided in Jackson County), or derived from two families who camped in the area.

It was the site of a small skirmish on September 26, 1864, during the waning days of the Civil War. Local Confederate cavalry under the command of Captain Alexander Goodwin unsuccessfully contested the advance of a Federal column led by Brigadier General Alexander Asboth during the preliminary phase of what would become the Battle of Marianna.

The nearby Forks of the Creek Swamp, along the border with Alabama, was a refuge for many Unionist and Confederate deserters during the war. Joseph Sanders, a former Confederate officer who had switched sides and taken a commission as a lieutenant in the Union army, hid out in the swamp for four months during the winter and spring of 1864; he emerged in March of that year to mount an unsuccessful attack on Newton, Alabama, which resulted in the loss of three of his men. Repeated Southern efforts to dislodge the Unionists in the swamp proved unsuccessful.

The Town of Campbellton was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1925, despite being a settlement since at least 1840.

==Geography==

==Transportation==
Graceville was served by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad at the end of the stub Georgiana Branch which reached the town on July 16, 1902, and, later, by the Seaboard System from 1983, and then by the Alabama and Florida Railroad, when the line was spun off as a shortline. The line was freight-only, the last L&amp;N passenger local having come off circa late 1950. Train 27 departed Georgiana, Alabama, at 7:15 a.m., arriving at Graceville at 10:40 a.m. Returning train 28 departed Graceville at 11:05 a.m. and arrived at Georgiana at 2:35 p.m. Following World War II, with the improvement of local roads and the availability of private vehicles, the railroad petitioned the Alabama Public Service Commission to discontinue daily except Sunday trains between Georgiana and Graceville on November 6, 1947. &quot;Passenger travel on trains 27 and 28 is now, and has been for several years, at a very low ebb, there being times when the train crew exceeds the number of passengers on the train,&quot; explained the railroad company in court documents dated October 31, 1950, appealing the commission&#x27;s refusal to allow discontinuance. The operating deficit averaged ~$188 per day.

The A&amp;F abandoned the line between Geneva and Graceville on January 16, 1984. The Atlanta and St. Andrews Bay Railroad also built a seven-mile connection into town from the east from their Dothan-Panama City mainline at Campbellton, completed July 14, 1971, but this, too, was abandoned by 1996 after the possible bridge traffic from the A&amp;F disappeared. The &quot;Bay Line&quot; would buy the small yard and wye in town from the A&amp;F. Only a few rails embedded in former town grade crossings mark the abandoned right of ways.

<text>Jacob City is a city in Jackson County, Florida, United States. The city is population is predominantly African American, and located on the Florida Panhandle in North Florida. The population was 217 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Jacob City&#x27;s history begins in the early 19th century, when many formerly enslaved people moved from Webbville to isolate themselves from harassment from the white people there, most of whose residents moved to Marianna in 1882. Webbville no longer exists, but was located around the current location of U.S. 231 and State Road 73. Marianna was known as the rich man&#x27;s town and no Black people were welcome. The first known settlement of Jacob City was by a white man named Jacob Jones, who accepted Black people to be housed on his property. That is where Jacob City got its name, as they would tell their friends, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Jacob&#x27;s.&quot; As Black people arrived to escape oppression, they moved farther down and made horse wagon trails into dirt roads, forming a small community.

By the mid-19th century, Jacob was Jackson County&#x27;s first Black community. Black people started their own store, but the owner was murdered and the store was never re-opened. By the late 19th century, St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church was built on what is now Main Street. It is commemorated by a Jacob City historical marker. By the early 20th century, Jacob&#x27;s dirt roads were improved and its population rose, but the poverty level was high due to the lack of education, as there was no school for Black children.

St. Mary&#x27;s Church provided a school, but many of its students never made it past seventh grade because they had to help with farm work at home with their parents. In 1953, St. Paul&#x27;s school was established near Campbellton as an elementary and high school where Jacob children could get a better education. The Campbellton school lasted until 1972. In the late 20th century, Jacob modernized and joined the Florida League of Cities. In 1983, Jacob became Jacob City and built a city hall.

In 2000, the median income for a household in the town was $28,611, and the median income for a family was $38,281. Males had a median income of $31,979 versus $19,345 for females. The per capita income for the town was $5,701. About 7.9% of families and 10.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.3% of those under age 18 and 17.5% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Marianna is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Florida, United States, and it is home to Chipola College. The official nickname of Marianna is &quot;The City of Southern Charm&quot;. The population was 6,245 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Marianna was founded in 1828 by Scottish entrepreneur Scott Beverege, who named the town after his daughters Mary and Anna. The following year, it was designated as the county seat, superseding the earlier settlement of Webbville, which soon after dissolved and no longer exists. Marianna was platted along the Chipola River. Many planters from North Carolina relocated to Jackson County to develop new plantations to take advantage of the fertile soil. They relied on the labor of enslaved African Americans brought from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade.

===Civil War era===

Governor John Milton, a major planter who owned the Sylvania Plantation and hundreds of slaves, was a grandson of Revolutionary War hero John Millton, and a descendant of Sir Christopher Milton, the brother of the famous English poet, John Milton. However, Milton did not have to rely solely on a distinguished American founding family name. A Marianna resident, he was elected as governor of Florida, serving during the Civil War years. Governor Milton opposed the Confederate States of America rejoining the United States.

As federal troops were preparing to take control of Tallahassee, Governor Milton received word that the Civil War had ended and that Florida would again be part of the United States. On April 1, 1865, as the Southern cause was collapsing, Milton died of a gunshot wound from his gun at Sylvania. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article, written in polemic style, attributed Governor Milton&#x27;s sudden death to suicide, which conflicted with local reporting from Florida. The Governor&#x27;s words, likely political oratorical hyperbole, that he &quot;would rather die&quot; than suffer the humiliation of Federal invasion, were linked to his sudden death by the New York Times. The West Florida News reported the sudden death of Florida&#x27;s fifth Governor as a hunting accident. Governor Milton was buried in the St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal churchyard at Marianna. The New York Times article&#x27;s account persisted in the difficult days of Reconstruction.

Marianna was the site of a Civil War battle in 1864 between a small home guard of about 150 boys, older men, and wounded soldiers, and a contingent of approximately 700 Federal troops.

===Reconstruction period===

During the early years after the Civil War, violence flared in Marianna and Jackson County, where 150 to 200 Republicans, some black, were assassinated in what was known as the Jackson County War by members of the Ku Klux Klan in an effort to secure white supremacy. Locals claimed this was the work of &quot;ruffians&quot; from border states and carpetbaggers. Bishop Charles H. Pearce of Massachusetts, an AME minister who became a state senator in Florida, had first-hand knowledge of the situation. He placed the blame on the planters of Jackson County, who supported action against black Republicans. Disputes over farm land caused much of the disorder, as poor whites objected to negro ownership of choice farms.
===Post-Reconstruction to mid-20th century===

Violence continued in the state after Reconstruction, reaching a peak in most areas at the turn of the 20th century. This was the period in which southern states also disenfranchised most blacks and thousands of poor whites by raising barriers to voter registration. From 1900 to 1930, Florida had the highest rate of lynchings per capita in the South and the nation. Refusing to accept the violence, thousands of African Americans left the state during the Great Migration of the early 20th century, going to northern and midwestern industrial cities for work and other opportunities. 

====Lynchings in Marianna====

In 1934 Claude Neal, a local African-American man, was accused of the rape and murder of a young white woman. He was moved between jails, but a lynch mob found him in Brewton, Alabama. The mob abducted him and brought him back to Florida, killing him near the Chattahoochee River and Greenwood. The men brought his body to the Cannady farm, where a larger mob of an estimated 2,000 persons was waiting; people shot and mutilated the body. Neal&#x27;s body was hanged from a tree at the Marianna courthouse square. The next day, whites rioted in town, attacking blacks and destroying some of their houses. The governor ordered more than 100 troops of the National Guard to Marianna to suppress the violence. About 200 blacks and two police were injured. The six white vigilantes who led the lynching remain unidentified.
In 1943 Cellos Harrison was taken from the county jail at Marianna by a white mob and hanged (lynched) near Greenwood. His case had been in the courts for two years in appeals after the African-American man was arrested and twice convicted by all-white juries and sentenced to death for the 1940 murder of a white man. He had confessed without benefit of counsel, and his convictions were overturned by the Florida Supreme Court as a result. But whites were tired of waiting for the case to be resolved, and lynched him. President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the Department of Justice to investigate Harrison&#x27;s lynching; he felt it was unjust that blacks were getting lynched at home while the U.S. was ostensibly fighting for freedom in Europe. No one was ever prosecuted for Harrison&#x27;s death.

===Florida School for Boys===

The Florida School for Boys, a large state reform school, operated in Marianna from January 1, 1900, to June 30, 2011. For a time, it was the largest juvenile reform institution in the United States. Throughout its 111-year history, the school gained a reputation for abuse, beatings, rapes, and torture of students by staff. It was rumored that students had died there as a result of injuries. Despite periodic investigations, changes of leadership, and promises by the state to improve conditions, the allegations of cruelty and abuse continued.

Many of the allegations were confirmed by separate investigations by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2010 and the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice in 2011. State authorities closed the school permanently in June 2011. In 2015, a multi-year investigation of the cemetery and grounds by the University of South Florida (USF), which was attempting to find undocumented burials on the grounds, revealed details of a secret &quot;rape dungeon&quot;, where boys younger than 12 were sexually abused. It positively identified five bodies from remains recovered on the grounds. By January 2016, the end of the USF&#x27;s studies of the grounds and exhumation of remains, it had identified 55 previously unknown burials, made a match for seven bodies through DNA, and presumptively identified another 14 sets of remains of 51 found. Twenty-seven more graves were discovered in 2019. The team created a website containing documentation of their investigation and will continue to work with state agencies and families of former students to identify more remains.

=== Hurricane Michael ===

The city was one of several Florida Panhandle communities devastated by Category 5 Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018. The downtown area was heavily hit, with several historic buildings collapsing and blocking Lafayette Street, which is the main road. The city was without power for three weeks, which caused extensive school cancellations. More than 80% of homes and businesses in Marianna were heavily damaged or destroyed due to Michael&#x27;s extreme winds. Millions of dollars in insurance claims were filed and the area also suffered millions of dollars in economic losses. This hurricane is the worst natural disaster to ever strike Marianna, surpassing the damages caused by a F-3 tornado spawned by Hurricane Ivan in September 2004.

<doc id="109289" wikidata="Q750113" url="?curid=109289" title="Astor, Florida">
<text>Astor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lake County, Florida, United States, located on the west side of the St. Johns River between Lake George and Lake Dexter. The community straddles State Road 40, with the community of Volusia in Volusia County across the St. Johns to the east and Astor Park to the west. The population was 1,556 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

Astor is located in northern Lake County at (29.1639, -81.5346). Via State Road 40, it is west of Ormond Beach and east of Ocala. Tavares, the county seat of Lake County, is to the southwest via SR 40 and SR 19.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Astor CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 11.93%, are water. Astor&#x27;s water area includes the west half of the St. John&#x27;s River and a network of canals, extending over in total length, providing river access for many of its residents. Astor lies entirely within the boundaries of the Ocala National Forest.

==History==
The Astor area and much of the land along the St. Johns River was inhabited by Timucua natives prior to settlement by Europeans. Early attempts at settlement included an English trading post in 1763, and in 1822 a plantation growing sugar cane and oranges was established by Jewish immigrant Moses Elias Levy. By 1838 the Seminole Wars had begun and the United States government established Fort Butler to defend the river as the primary route of transportation inside Florida. These earliest efforts at settlement all met with failure due to war or disease, and until the 1870s the area was largely deserted.

In 1874, William Backhouse Astor Jr. from New York City&#x27;s wealthy Astor family purchased over of land, upon which he began to establish a town he called &quot;Manhattan&quot;. New settlers arrived by steamboat to the town which Astor had endowed with a church, schoolhouse, botanical garden, and free cemetery. William Astor also built a hotel, saw mill, and eventually a railroad, the St. Johns and Lake Eustis Railway, which headed southwest towards the communities of Eustis and Leesburg. A few miles to the west of town, a satellite community called Astor Park grew up along the shore of Lake Schimmerhorn (named for Astor&#x27;s wife, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor). Over the next twenty years Astor saw his town grow, but the Manhattan name never caught on. When William Astor died in 1892, the town was officially renamed &quot;Astor&quot; in his honor.

John Jacob Astor IV inherited his father William&#x27;s estate and continued to promote the town and their business interests in Florida. Following his demise in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, the estate passed to his son, Vincent. William Vincent Astor was not interested in his grandfather&#x27;s Florida enterprises, and so the Astor family&#x27;s interests in the area were sold. This, combined with a severe decline in steamboat travel on the St. Johns due to increased availability of rail travel, signaled the end of the town&#x27;s prosperity and prominence. The first Astor Bridge was built in 1926; by 1928, Astor&#x27;s hotel had burned down and the railroad was abandoned, leaving Astor without telephone or telegraph service for the next few decades.

Today the community of Astor is largely reliant upon tourism, and is a popular spot for winter visitors from the north and for fishing, hunting, and boating enthusiasts.

<doc id="109291" wikidata="Q531446" url="?curid=109291" title="Clermont, Florida">
<text>Clermont is the most populous city in Lake County, within the U.S. state of Florida. The population was 43,021 in 2020. It is about west of Orlando and southeast of Leesburg. The city is largely residential in character and its economy is centered in retail trade, lodging, and tourism-oriented restaurants and bars. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Clermont is home to the 1956 Florida Citrus Tower, one of Florida&#x27;s early landmarks.

==History==

Before European colonization and settlement, the area which is today Clermont was originally inhabited by the indigenous Timucua people. Urriparacoxi was reportedly a chieftain in the area during the 1539-40 Hernando de Soto expeditions. The population of the Timucua were whittled by epidemics of infectious diseases introduced by Europeans, then by attacks and slave raids largely conducted under Spanish colonial rule.

After the collapse of Timucua society, the indigenous Seminole people came to inhabit the region. In 1819, Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain with the Adams–Onís Treaty. Four years later, the area of modern-day Clermont became a part of an Indian reservation under the Treaty of Moultrie Creek. The Seminole were ultimately ethnically cleansed by federal troops in the Seminole Wars or driven out on the Trail of Tears. The region was geographically called the High Sand Hills by Americans, according to maps by Washington Hood. The first white settlers arrived in the area in 1853, soon after the Seminole Wars.

Clermont was founded in 1884, and named for the French birthplace of A.F. Wrotnowski, manager of the Clermont Improvement Company, a company to develop land. The municipality was incorporated as a town from June 9, 1891, then disbanded on May 25, 1895. It was reincorporated as a city on December 28, 1916.

Much of the county was developed as orange and other citrus groves, which was the basis of the economy through the mid-20th century. Apshawa Groves, which owned and worked large expanses of land in the county, became a major real estate company. Tourism also became increasingly important.

The groves, which were the namesake of the Citrus Tower, dwindled rapidly because of recurrent freezes and suburban development in the late 20th century and into the 2000s. The regional economy shifted from agricultural production to real estate. The population growth attracted numerous companies to the area.

From 2000 to 2020, the population grew more than 250 percent amid real estate development and urban sprawl in Central Florida. This brought economic growth and big-box retail stores. Clermont was described as one of the fastest-growing cities in Central Florida of the time. In spring 2010, the Clermont Landings shopping center opened with 20 shops and restaurants and the city&#x27;s first cinema. Increased pollution from runoff and residential development has hurt the city&#x27;s lakes and other natural resources.

Since 2001, when Orlando Health, with Pure Athletics and USA Triathlon, opened the National Training Center in Clermont, the city has been noted for its training facilities for Olympic and college athletes. The Center later added a nearby facility for Special Olympics Florida. In 2014, the city sought to market itself as a training center by adopting the slogan &quot;Choice of Champions&quot; and a flag with Olympic rings. Twenty athletes who trained in Clermont went to the 2016 Rio Olympics; others went to the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Lake-Sumter State College and the University of Central Florida have a joint-use campus in Clermont. The Lincoln Park Education Center offers courses from Lake-Sumter State College and Lake Technical College for students.

===Public library===
The Cooper Memorial Library in Clermont is staffed by the Lake-Sumter State College and the Lake County Library System.

A salesman wandered into town in 1904, and spoke promises of donating books to start a library if the town helped him sell his Chautauqua lectures to residents. Many town members with money to spare put forth what they could, excited at the prospect of a library. However, when it came time for the lectures only a few of the speakers showed; no salesman or books were present. Not all money was handed over; the cost for the last lecture was still available, and with that amount they began to organize their own library. This was hosted in the Montrose Street home of Mrs. Payson Pierce, with the collection of books open to the town on Saturday afternoons. Patrons paid 50 cents a year. The Clermont Library Club also hosted their meetings at Pierce&#x27;s house. The growing collection was moved to Isiah Benson&#x27;s Lake Avenue house in 1910, then to the Baptist Church the following year.

In the summer of 1914, the Friends of the Library raised $600 to erect a one-room building on 630 DeSoto Street, a lot donated by Alice Cooper. The library was funded by the club and its small circulating collection staffed by Clermont Women&#x27;s Club volunteers until the city took over in the 1950s and the Cooper Memorial Library Association was formed to administer the public library. In 1980, a former bank building was purchased. A human chain of town volunteers passed the books, hand to hand, from the old to the new location. Mike Delaney, a Friends of the Library member, said, &quot;It was an amazing honor to be part of the early book brigade when I was seven...It was an experience that I will never forget that brought the community together&quot;. In 1984, the building was expanded by more than 4,000 square feet, adding the Florida Room and Children&#x27;s Room. In 1982, the Cooper Memorial Library joined the Lake County Library System, and is the only continuous member of that system.

<doc id="109292" wikidata="Q988940" url="?curid=109292" title="Eustis, Florida">
<text>Eustis is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 23,189 at the 2020 census.

The City of Eustis holds a festival every year which begins on the last Friday of February and runs through Sunday and has been held since 1902. This festival, referred to simply as GeorgeFest, is recognized today as the longest ongoing annual event held in honor of George Washington, first President of the United States.

==History==
The people of Eustis, on the east shore of Lake Eustis, took their time deciding on a name. First it was Highlands, then Pendryville, and finally Lake Eustis, itself named about 1825 for General Abraham Eustis. General Eustis, prominent in the Seminole Wars, had skirmished with the Indians on the south shore, near present-day Tavares, Florida. In 1876, A.S. Pendry homesteaded and set out a citrus grove. In 1877 he opened the Ocklawaha Hotel. The post office in the lobby carried the sign &quot;Pendryville&quot;. 

Before railroads came in the 1880s, Eustis was a busy port for steamers plying Lakes Harris, Eustis, Dora, and Griffin. In 1883 the &quot;Lake&quot; was dropped and the town became just Eustis. Although the U.S. opened up the area for homesteading in the 1850s, settlement was delayed by the Civil War. Surveying was finally completed in 1875 and settlement began in earnest. Among the earliest settlers was Guilford David &quot;G.D.&quot; Clifford, who established a store and began the first mail service for the new settlement. It was in the Clifford General Store second floor meeting hall that the town&#x27;s first churches were formed. Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups all organized and held services there before they had their own buildings.

The first homes were those of D.W. Herrick, A.D. Herrick, and Henry Key. In 1881 Clifford and Smith built the first general store in the building later occupied by A.D. and C.D. Miller. A big year was 1878 when the town&#x27;s first telegraph line connected Eustis, Leesburg, and Sanford. The railroad arrived in 1880, the first train coming from Astor to Fort Mason, where passengers and freight made lake steamer connections to Leesburg, Helena, Yalaha, Bloomfield, Lane Park, and Tavares. Bertie Clifford was the first baby born before Eustis was incorporated in 1883, and Edith Hutchins the first baby of the newly incorporated town. D.W. Herrick was the first mayor. G.D. Clifford&#x27;s dream home in Eustis was designed in 1894 but the Big Freeze of 1894–1895 postponed its completion until 1911. Says Eustis historian Louise Carter, &quot;Even though the freeze brought the town&#x27;s economy to a standstill, Mr. Clifford kept his lakefront general store open and extended credit until people could recover.&quot;

According to an 1887 business directory, the Clifford Store on Lake Eustis sold groceries, hardware, building material, fertilizers, stoves, crockery, glassware, hay, and grain. The opera house, on the second floor, was a cultural center of Eustis and a wide swath of Central Florida. The eighteen-room house at the corner of Bay Street and Bates Avenue today houses the Eustis Historical Museum and Preservation Society, and takes visitors back to the gracious Lake County lifestyle of one hundred-odd years ago.

Dr. J. H. Potter, the founding pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, encouraged the development of Eustis Seminary in 1886, under the direction of Professor Byron F. Marsh (for whom Marsh Memorial Park is named). The seminary served students from first through twelfth grades. Its buildings were located near the present site of Eustis High School on Washington Avenue. Struggling financially, the school closed around 1895. By the early 1900s, Eustis was already a winter vacation spot for many. The Ocklawaha Hotel catered to the wealthy. Eustis continues to be a popular winter destination.

<text>Fruitland Park is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 8,325 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Fruitland Park antedates the American Civil War, although the name of the town only came later, as it was originally called Gardenia. The earliest settler was M. Calvin Lee, of the Evander Lee family of Leesburg, who planted a citrus grove. After the war, a son-in-law of the Lee family, P.S. Bouknight, homesteaded near Mirror Lake.

In 1875, the State of Florida sent Captain Kendricks to the northern part of the United States to talk about the advantages of living in Florida. Due to Major Orlando P. Rooks&#x27; poor health, and already considering a move, he had his wife, Josephine, moved to Fruitland Park. They built their first home on Crystal Lake in 1877. It was here that the first white child, Frederic, was born in 1882.

The Fruitland Nurseries of Augusta, Georgia, was owned by J. P. Berckmann, friend of Major Rook. Major Rook named the town Fruitland Park for the nurseries, and the main street Berckmann Street for this friend.

The postal authorities refused to recognize the name Fruitland Park as there was already a Fruitland in the state. At their request, the name was changed to Gardenia in 1884. The Florida Railroad, put through the town just prior to this, had listed the town as Fruitland Park in all their printed matter and refused to recognize the new name of Gardenia. Consequently, all freight and express had to be directed to Fruitland Park and all mail addressed to Gardenia. This caused a great deal of confusion, which lasted from 1884 to 1888, when a petition was sent to the postal authorities to have the name changed back to Fruitland Park. The petition was granted in 1888.

On December 20, 1884, Rev. G.W. Butler organized the first &quot;community&quot; church in Fruitland Park, it was called the Community Church a Methodist Episcopal church founded by the Illinois conference. The church had acquired lots on College Ave., between Fountain St. and Lime St. The church was built in 1886–1887. That building burned in 1934, but was rebuilt in 1935. That building was later sold to the United Pentecostal Church and still remains today.

Fruitland Park was granted a charter by the state, and incorporated on May 25, 1927.

Fruitland Park is also home to the oldest Dirt Kart Track in America. The 1/8 mile clay oval kart track has hosted Saturday Night Dirt Kart Racing for Go Kart enthusiasts since opening in 1958.

===Expansion of The Villages===

On December 10, 2013, The Villages of Lake-Sumter Inc. closed on a deal to purchase property in Fruitland Park for $8 million from a private owner. Subsequently, they also began the annexation and rezoning process with the city. The property is currently the construction site for 2,038 new Villages homes, a project with final completion projected sometime in 2016. It was determined that the city of Fruitland Park stands to earn approximately $13 million in impact fees and building permits as a result of the expansion, not including ongoing tax revenues upon completion.

===Groveland case===

In 1949 four young African-American men (Samuel Shepherd, Walter Irvin, Charles Greenlee, and Ernest Thomas) were charged with raping a 17-year-old white farm girl in Groveland, Florida. They were convicted by an all-white jury. The case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court which found that:&quot;Two witnesses for the State testified as to the identity of the four [men]. From the description of the automobile as given by the two witnesses the same was later located. The three defendants testified they were driving the car in question during the same hours of the early morning except they were driving in the Orlando area, which was in the opposite direction.&quot; In addition to the eyewitness testimony, there was physical evidence linking the car in which the young men were riding to the crime. The Florida Supreme Court stated:&quot;Near the scene of the crime a handkerchief and some cotton were found. The woman was found near the scene of the crime about dawn. A large track about the scene fit the shoe of one of the appellants. Cotton or lint about the car and broken glass in the automobile testified to by the woman assisted the officers in identifying the car which the appellants admit they were riding in at the exact hour the State charge the crime was committed.&quot; The victim testified that she had known Shepherd for years and that Irvin was someone she had seen in and around the Groveland community before the night of the assault. She reported the rape to the police within five hours after it occurred. One of the three men she accused (Thomas) was shot and killed by the police during his arrest.

After the Florida Supreme Court decided to uphold the guilty verdicts, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.

Attorney Thurgood Marshall, then the special counsel with the NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund, represented the four men, on the briefs, taking their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Oral argument was conducted by attorney Franklin H. Williams. The Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdicts. The Court found that sensational headlines in the local papers (&quot;Night Riders Burn Lake Negro Homes&quot; and &quot;Flames From Negro Homes Light Night Sky in Lake County&quot;), and newspaper reports of the sheriff&#x27;s statement that the young men had confessed while in custody, resulted in an unfair trial. &quot;These defendants were prejudged as guilty and the trial was but a legal gesture to register a verdict already dictated by the press and the public opinion which it generated.&quot; A new trial was ordered.

In 1949, Harry T. Moore, the executive director of the Florida NAACP, organized a campaign against the conviction of the Groveland Four. Soon afterward, Sheriff Willis V. McCall of Lake County, Florida, shot Shepherd and Irvin. He asserted that they were trying to escape. Shepherd was killed, and Irvin was seriously wounded. When Irvin recovered, he told investigators that the sheriff had shot the two prisoners, without provocation, while they were in handcuffs.

Moore demanded that the sheriff be indicted for murder and requested that the Governor suspend McCall from office. On December 25, 1951, a bomb exploded in Moore&#x27;s house, killing him and his wife, Harriette.

Some alleged that Sheriff McCall was associated with ordering this bombing; however, an extensive FBI investigation at the time and additional separate investigations have failed to produce any evidence supporting allegations of McCall&#x27;s involvement.

Although members of the Ku Klux Klan were suspected of the crime, the people responsible were never brought to trial.

In 2016, the City of Groveland and Lake County each apologized to survivors of the four men for the injustice against them. On April 18, 2017, a resolution of the Florida House of Representatives requested that all four men be exonerated. The Florida Senate quickly passed a similar resolution; lawmakers called on Governor Rick Scott to officially pardon the men. On January 11, 2019, the Florida Board of Executive Clemency voted to pardon the Groveland Four. Newly elected Governor Ron DeSantis subsequently did so. On November 22, 2021, Judge Heidi Davis granted the state&#x27;s motion to posthumously exonerate the men.

===Grant money for cemeteries===
In 2022, the city received a large grant to restore The Oak Tree Union Colored Cemetery of Taylorville, an abandoned cemetery in Groveland.

=== International Dark Sky Community ===
In 2022, the City of Groveland passed a robust outdoor lighting ordinance to help curb light pollution against the ongoing rapid development. The ordinance requires residential and commercial development to have responsible outdoor lighting that minimizes glare, reduces light trespass, and does not pollute the night sky. Groveland is currently retrofitting old streetlamps with dark-sky-friendly lights, which are shielded downward with a low color temperature with the goal to replace every light fixture by 2027.

In 2023, the City of Groveland became the first certified International Dark Sky Community in Florida and the Southeast US. This achievement is the result of a three-year Dark Sky Initiative that included extensive education, community outreach, events, the adoption of a comprehensive lighting ordinance, a citywide lighting inventory, and numerous commitments intended to reduce light pollution and protect the night sky. Groveland held its first Star Party in 2023 at Cherrylake Farms, attracting over 700 attendees.

The City of Groveland continues to work with new residents, potential developers and neighboring communities to raise awareness about the importance of natural night skies, to improve safety and quality of life, and to protect the natural environment for all living things.

<text>Leesburg is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. As of 2020, the population had exactly 27,000 residents.

Leesburg is in central Florida, between Lake Harris and Lake Griffin, at the head of the Ocklawaha River. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Lake–Sumter State College and Beacon College are located in Leesburg.

==History==

Leesburg was first settled in 1857 by Evander McIver Lee. Several of his brothers followed him to the area. One of them, Calvin Lee, was credited with giving the town its name. The city was incorporated in 1875, and was designated as the county seat of Sumter County for a time. When Lake County was formed in 1887, Tavares was designated as its seat. It was officially incorporated as the &quot;City of Leesburg&quot; on July 12, 1875.

In the early 20th century, Leesburg was an important center for watermelon production. In 1930, it held its first Watermelon Festival, an annual tradition that lasted for nearly 30 years. But gradually watermelon production dwindled and, for the last festival in 1957, watermelons had to be brought to the city from outside the area.
In 1938, during the Great Depression, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration invested in infrastructure and improvement projects across the county. Its Works Progress Administration began work on the Venetian Gardens waterside park, located on the shores of Lake Harris. These canals and gardens have been a centerpiece of the community ever since.

Lake Square Mall, the city&#x27;s major shopping mall, opened in 1980.

On March 19, 1982, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s guitarist Randy Rhoads, as well as the band&#x27;s makeup artist and bus driver, were killed in a plane crash at Flying Baron Estates.

The citrus industry was the principal business in this area for decades, but devastating freezes in December 1983 and February 1985 persuaded growers to move their groves further south. In 1997, Leesburg Bikefest started. It has since become an annual spring tradition, with upwards of 250,000 people attending every year.

Today, most of Leesburg&#x27;s growth and economic development is the result of its increasing popularity as a retirement destination. In addition, the rapid growth of nearby Orlando has resulted in demand for housing here, as many people commute to Orlando for work. In 1977, 2011, 2016 and 2017, the Leesburg High School boys&#x27; basketball team won the FHSAA Class 4A State Championship, with the back to back 16/17 championships happening under head coach Sean Campbell. 

In spring 2017, the Holding Company of the Villages planned to acquire 2,600 acres north and south of County Road 470 along the east side of Florida’s Turnpike for future development. The deal with the mega-retirement community has passed due diligence by the Leesburg City Commission. Age-restricted zoning ordinance changes have already been approved by the Leesburg Planning Commission (with the city commission giving final approval). The initial plans call for building approximately 4,500 homes and some commercial development.

<doc id="109304" wikidata="Q2086666" url="?curid=109304" title="Minneola, Florida">
<text>Minneola is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Minneola tangelo is named after the city. The population was 13,843 at the 2020 census.

== Etymology ==
The name Minneola is directly derived from the Dakota language. The city states the name means &quot;much water.&quot; Specifically, the name is sourced from the words &quot;&quot; (water) and &quot;ota&quot; (much/many).

The name was chosen by the wife of George W. Hull, an early settler of the city.

== History ==

=== Indigenous habitation and colonization ===
Before European colonization and settlement, the area which is today Minneola was originally inhabited by the indigenous Timucua people. The population of the Timucua were whittled by epidemics of infectious diseases introduced by Europeans, then by attacks and slave raids largely conducted under Spanish colonial rule.

After the collapse of Timucua society, the indigenous Seminole people came to inhabit the region. In 1819, Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain with the Adams–Onís Treaty. Four years later, the area of modern-day Minneola became a part of an Indian reservation under the Treaty of Moultrie Creek. The Seminole were ultimately ethnically cleansed by federal troops in the Seminole Wars or driven out on the Trail of Tears. The region was geographically called the High Sand Hills by Americans, according to maps by Washington Hood.

=== Settlement and incorporation ===
The first white settler in what is today Minneola was Captain William A. Smith, originally from Georgia. The settlement was established shortly after the Civil War on the north shore of Plum Lake.

Other settlers began to move into the area around what was then called either Cow House Lake or Palatlakaha Lake in 1880. At this time, citrus groves began to be established in the area by the settler Henry Wilson. The settlement had a post office established three years later by George W. Hull, the city&#x27;s first postmaster, based out of his home. The settlement was surveyed and mapped under direction by George W. Hull, and Cow House Lake was renamed to Lake Minneola; the namesake of the city.

Minneola was formally founded in 1884 as an unincorporated area, originally as a part of Sumter County. The town would become a part of Lake County when it was created in 1887.

The city would be formally incorporated in 1925 or 1926. Archibald A. Pitt served as the city&#x27;s first mayor.

==Geography==

<text>Mount Dora is a city in Lake County, Florida. It is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee, Florida, metropolitan statistical area. Founded in 1880, Mount Dora is known for its small-town southern charm. It has many antique shops in the downtown area. The downtown area overlooks Lake Dora. Mount Dora is home to one of three freshwater lighthouses in Florida. It hosts many monthly festivals and is known as the &quot;Festival City&quot;. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 16,341.

==History==

The town of Mount Dora began in 1874 when the area was settled by David Simpson, his wife, and two children. In 1880, Ross C. Tremain became the town&#x27;s first postmaster, and later a major real-estate developer for the area. A post office called Mount Dora has been in operation since 1883. Tremain named the unincorporated village &quot;Royellou&quot;, after his children, Roy, Ella, and Louis. The community was renamed for Dora Ann Drawdy, who was an early settler of the town in the mid-1880s. In 1846, the surveyors named Lake Dora after her, and in 1883, the town was renamed after the lake. The Mount in Mount Dora reflects the fact that the town is on a plateau 184 feet above sea level. In addition to this, Dora is memorialized through Dora Drawdy Way, an alleyway located in the downtown area. The town’s original name is honored in a similar fashion through another alleyway simply named &quot;Royellou&quot;.

The town became a popular winter retreat for hunters, fishermen, and boaters, and in 1883, the Alexander House, a two-story hotel, was opened. The Alexander House has been renamed several times and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A railroad came to town in 1887, followed by an orange-packing house, fertilizer factories, and a cannery. The town was granted a charter in 1910 with John Philip Donnelly as its first mayor; the town had 371 residents at the time.

In the 1920s, Mount Dora began to grow significantly, both in residential development and business development. Mount Dora began investing in public infrastructure, including streetlights, a water system, curbs, and paved roads. The first two public parks were created and the Mount Dora Community Building was built largely from funds raised by Mount Dora residents. The building has since served as the city&#x27;s performance and meeting venue.

In 2013, the City of Mount Dora began to develop an area of land called the Wolf Branch Innovation District. That plan was developed as the Wekiva Parkway started to expand and State Road 453 opened right into Mount Dora. The Wolf Branch Innovation District is currently being developed to become a high-technology and life-sciences business area. Expansion of infrastructure and roadways continues as Mount Dora prepares for future growth.

==History==

The focal point of a golf resort for the region was the Historic Mount Plymouth Hotel, which was constructed in 1926 at a cost of $350,000. The hotel became a center of activity in the area. Guests such as Al Capone, Connie Mack, Babe Ruth and Kate Smith were able to utilize the hotel&#x27;s airfield for arrival.

Four 18-hole golf courses patterned after the St. Andrews course in Scotland were originally planned for the resort. However, the Florida real estate crash of 1926 prevented completion of three of the four courses. The first course, called Mount Plymouth Golf Club, closed in 2007. Lucia Mida would use Mount Plymouth as her temporary place of residence while participating in Florida state golfing tournaments.

In 1959, Florida Central Academy occupied the building and grounds of the 150-room hotel. Originally a boys boarding school, in 1971 the academy began accepting girls. The school remained operational until June 1983. The building, condemned by county health officials, quickly became the target of vandals. In 1986 and 1987, fire destroyed the building.

==History==
Organized in 1885, and completed in 1888 on land donated by St. Clair-Abrams, the Union Congregational Church was the first church in Tavares.

Tavares was founded in 1880 by Alexander St. Clair-Abrams, a newspaper and railroad man from a Creole family in New Orleans . He gave it the surname of a Portuguese ancestor. In 1883 a post office was established; by the next year, a hotel, three stores, a sawmill, and eight cottages were built. St. Clair-Abrams&#x27;s dream of Tavares as the state capital was not realized, but in 1887 it was designated the county seat of Lake County. St. Clair-Abrams later chartered a railroad from Tavares to Orlando. In 1919, Tavares incorporated as a town.

In 1949, the Groveland Four, were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1949. One was killed after fleeing, and three were convicted at trial in Tavares. The two adults were sentenced to death and the minor to life in prison. The Supreme Court of the United States overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial for the two capital defendants. One was killed while being transported to Tavares in 1951. Walter Irvin survived the shooting by the sheriff and was convicted again at trial. In 1955, his death sentence was commuted to life. He was paroled in 1968 and died in 1970. In 2016, the city of Groveland and Lake County formally apologized to families of all the men for injustice; in 2017, the Florida Legislature issued a formal apology and exonerated the men, calling on the governor to officially pardon them.

==Historic library and museum==
Alva is the home of a small library dating back to 1909 and a chapel that opened in 1901. The Alva Library was the first library in what is today Lee County and was constructed in the classical revival style.

The Alva Library grew from the private Alva Book Club into the first public library in southwest Florida, thanks in part to donation of land from Captain Peter Nelson. The founder of the book club and Alva&#x27;s first librarian was Esther Hovey. The library closed in 1937, but the building continued in use over the years for various purposes such as high school art classes and a community center. In 1974, the Alva Garden Club turned the building into a museum with the Library Association trustees&#x27; permission.

Both the library and the 1901 chapel are open to the public and house the town&#x27;s nonprofit museum, featuring Seminole artifacts and objects from the town&#x27;s founding families.

<text>Bonita Springs is a city in Lee County, Florida, United States. The population was 53,644 at the 2020 census, up from 43,914 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, on the state&#x27;s southwest coast.

Bonita Springs&#x27; history dates back approximately 8,000 years, with evidence of early inhabitants including the Calusa Indians. In the 1870s, the US Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the area, establishing a camp along what is now the Imperial River. This site became known as Survey, and the river was called Surveyor&#x27;s Creek.

In the 1880s, Braxton Comer bought 6,000 acres around Survey and brought indentured families to work on his plantation. By the early 20th century, developers decided to rename the area Bonita Springs to make it more appealing to settlers and investors. By 1912, streets and avenues were laid out, and the names Survey and Surveyor&#x27;s Creek were changed to Bonita Springs and the Imperial River, respectively.

The completion of a road to Fort Myers in 1917 and the extension of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s Fort Myers Southern Branch through Bonita Springs to Marco Island in the 1920s spurred significant growth. The Tamiami Trail, completed in 1928, further contributed to this development. During this time, Bonita Springs experienced a land boom, leading to the establishment of citrus groves and various tourist attractions, including the Everglades Wonder Gardens and the Shell Factory.

The advent of air conditioning, the construction of Interstate 75, and the opening of Southwest Florida International Airport in the late 20th century brought more tourists and retirees to Bonita Springs.

<doc id="109322" wikidata="Q462789" url="?curid=109322" title="Cape Coral, Florida">
<text>Cape Coral is a city in Lee County, Florida, United States, on the Gulf of Mexico. Founded in 1957, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 194,016 as of the 2020 census, a 26% increase from 154,309 at the 2010 census, making it the ninth-most populous city in Florida. With an area of , Cape Coral is the largest city between Tampa and Miami in both population and area. It is the largest and principal city in the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city has over of navigable waterways, more than any other city on earth.

==History==
The original inhabitants around the Cape Coral area were the Calusa. After Florida became a state in 1845, multiple pioneers started selling and buying land in what is now Cape Coral under the Homestead Act. Cape Coral&#x27;s modern history began in 1957 when two brothers from Baltimore, Maryland, Leonard and Jack Rosen, flew over the peninsula known as Redfish Point, across the Caloosahatchee River near present-day Fort Myers. The brothers, who were real estate developers, purchased a tract with a small group of partners for $678,000 and in 1958 began development of the city as a planned community.

The Gulf American Land Corporation (GALC) was formed to develop the area. GALC developed a marketing model that was a departure from traditional selling methods. Approval was secured from Lee County to master-plan the entire property into lots. Instead of listing the lots with real estate agents, GALC developed the land sales, dinner-party model, operating from banquet rooms in local hotels. People were invited to attend by offering a free dinner for two. The model, referred to as team-selling, allowed for a well-trained team to close deals in 90 minutes. Buyers would sign a contract and agree to come to the property within six months and cancel if not satisfied. Ezio Valentini, an Italian real estate developer, joined GALC and became director of sales. The program was so successful that offices were opened in 24 states, and an arrangement was made with an airline to charter flights to fly buyers to the property.

Instead of borrowing from banks and lenders, the developers factored the sales contracts to pay for building the infrastructure. Canals were dug (without first obtaining state permits, an omission which later bankrupted Gulf American), streets paved, houses and businesses built. Cape Coral was promoted like no other Florida development. Celebrities were brought in to tout the benefits of &quot;the Cape&quot;, as it is known locally. The first building in Cape Coral was the Rosens&#x27; sales office. It was built where George&#x27;s Auto now stands, at Cape Coral and Coronado Parkways. Cape Coral&#x27;s first permanent resident was Kenny Schwartz, the Rosens&#x27; general manager. Cape Coral&#x27;s first four homes were completed in May 1958, on Riverside and Flamingo Drives.

Development continued through the early 1960s, mostly on Redfish Point, south of Cape Coral Parkway. By 1963, the population was 2,850; 1,300 buildings had been finished or were under construction; of road had been built, and of canals had been dug. The public yacht club, a golf course, medical clinic and shopping center were up and running. A major addition for Cape Coral was the construction of the long Cape Coral Bridge across the Caloosahatchee River, which opened in early 1964. Before the bridge, a trip to Fort Myers was more than via Del Prado Boulevard and over the Edison Bridge to cross the river.

The city incorporated on August 18, 1970, and its population continued to grow rapidly until the real estate slowdown that gripped the region beginning in 2008. On September 28, 2022, Cape Coral suffered major damage when Hurricane Ian made landfall nearby.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9%) is water. Cape Coral is a large peninsula and is bordered in the south and east by the Caloosahatchee River and in the west by Matlacha Pass. Fort Myers lies across the Caloosahatchee River to the east, and Matlacha and Pine Island lie across Matlacha Pass to the west. Matlacha Pass is home to Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge and the Matlacha Pass Aquatic Preserve.

===Flora and fauna===
The area supports waterfowl, wading birds, migrant songbirds, gopher tortoises, dolphins and reptiles. Rotary Park is home to wading birds, raptors, butterflies, foxes and other wildlife. Nature enthusiasts can track exotic birds and native fish from the boardwalk at Lake Kennedy and watch the West Indian manatees at Sirenia Vista Park. Cape Coral is home to the largest population of burrowing owls in Florida.

===Invasive species===
Cape Coral is home to three invasive species, the green iguana, the spiny-tailed iguana, and the Nile monitor, which was discovered in 2009. The iguanas are found throughout southern Florida and generally do not pose a threat. The Nile monitor is however a large (3–7 feet), fast traveling, fast swimming carnivore with a wide diet, which can include fish, fowl, and small mammals. The city&#x27;s many waterways work against its capture and provide an easy transportation route around the city.

===Climate===
The city features a borderline tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: Aw), bordering on a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am). The area averages 355 days of sunshine per year and experiences precipitation on 145 days per year. While the wet season (May to October) is hot and humid with rather erratic tropical downpours, dry seasons (November to April) tend to be pleasantly warm and see only sporadic precipitation. The city receives about 56 inches of rain each year, the majority of which falls from June to September. During the summer months, afternoon thunderstorms are heavy yet brief. The city is affected by the annual hurricane season, which begins officially on June 1 and continues through November.

The municipal charter schools are available exclusively to children who live in Cape Coral.

The main campus of Florida SouthWestern State College is located immediately east of Cape Coral in Fort Myers. The college offers associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees, plus technical training in fields such as allied health programs, computer networking &amp; programming, business administration, paralegal, criminal justice and fire science. 2009 enrollment was more than 16,000 students on four campuses. One of Florida&#x27;s youngest state universities, Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU), opened in 1997 in nearby Fort Myers and now serves more than 12,000 students. FGCU has established a Cape Coral satellite facility, which provides Cape students with a growing offering of core courses. The university offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees, including an executive master&#x27;s program, a college of business and engineering and biotechnology programs. Other colleges and universities serving the area are Hodges University, Southwest Florida College and Rasmussen College.

Cape Coral Technical College is a postsecondary educational institution operated by the Lee County public school system. It provides training in medical, computer and food-science fields. Employer-specific training, both on and off-site, is available through Business and Industry Services of Lee County which maintains an office in Cape Coral.

==Infrastructure==
===Canals===
The city has over of canals. Most of the canals are navigable, and some have access to the Gulf of Mexico. Cape Coral&#x27;s canal system is so extensive that local ecology and tides have been affected. The system provides many residents with waterfront living with access to the Gulf of Mexico via the broad Caloosahatchee River and Matlacha Pass. The Parks and Recreation Department maintains three public boat launching facilities. The Gulf of Mexico provides access to smaller tropical islands, rookeries, and sports fishing grounds.

===Roadways and bridges===
Interstate 75 passes within of Cape Coral and connects northward to Tampa; and southeastward to Miami. Cape Coral borders on U.S. Highway 41. U.S. 41 and I-75 can be accessed from State Route 78 (Pine Island Road). Within the city a network of arterial roadways are established. Cape Coral has approximately of roadways. In general, the north–south routes are evenly spaced apart every one or , and most of them have at least four lanes.

Cape Coral is connected to the south side of the Caloosahatchee River by two bridges. The long Cape Coral Bridge connects Cape Coral Parkway to College Parkway in McGregor. The Midpoint Memorial Bridge connects Veterans Parkway to Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers. Several other bridges span the Caloosahatchee River east of Cape Coral in adjoining North Fort Myers. In 2026, the Lee County Department of Transportation and the City of Cape Coral plan on constructing a new westbound span for the Cape Coral Bridge. The westbound span, which was built in 1964, does not meet requirements set forth by Lee County. The $185 million project will include a new pedestrian bridge, an expansion to 6 lanes on both spans, removal of the toll booth on the Fort Myers side, and an expansion of the Cape Coral Parkway and Del Prado Boulevard intersection.

===Transportation===
Public transit services in Cape Coral are provided by LeeTran. LeeTran operates 18 fixed-route bus services, including six within Cape Coral.

Cape Coral is from Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), which serves nearly 10 million passengers annually. In 2010, eighteen national and two international airlines, as well as the two major cargo companies, served the airport. Cape Coral is also served by Page Field, a general aviation airport in Fort Myers from Cape Coral. Punta Gorda Airport (PGD) is located in Punta Gorda, north of Cape Coral.

===Utilities===

In 1977, Cape Coral became the first municipality in the United States to use the reverse osmosis process on a large scale with an initial operating capacity of per day. By 1985, the city had the largest low pressure reverse osmosis plant in the world, capable of producing 15 MGD (56,780 m3/day).

Sewage is collected and highly treated to produce reclaimed water, locally known as &quot;rescued water&quot;. Reclaimed water is distributed throughout the city through a dual water pipe system and used for irrigation. Alternatively, reclaimed water can be discharged into the Caloosahatchee River.

The Cape was among the first in Florida to deploy the new 4.9 GHz pre-WiMax wireless channel authorized by the FCC in 2003 for exclusive public safety use.

<text>Captiva is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lee County, Florida, United States. It is located on Captiva Island. As of the 2020 census, the population was 318, down from 583 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Located just offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, the island is just north of Sanibel Island. Captiva is accessed by a small bridge that crosses Blind Pass from Sanibel Island. There is a toll to use the causeway that goes from the mainland to Sanibel Island.

Many of Captiva&#x27;s homes, condominiums, and businesses were destroyed during Hurricane Charley in 2004, but the island recovered shortly thereafter. In September 2022, Hurricane Ian caused significant damage to the causeway and to the infrastructure of the island.

==Geography==

Captiva is located in western Lee County at (26.518028, -82.191057). The CDP comprises the entire island, bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico and to the east by Pine Island Sound. Captiva Drive is the main road on the island, running from the town center south to the Blind Pass bridge to Sanibel. It is a drive from Captiva to the Sanibel Causeway and a total of by road from Captiva to the center of Fort Myers.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Captiva CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 28.15%, are water.

Originally part of neighboring Sanibel Island to the southeast, it was severed in 1926 when a hurricane&#x27;s storm surge created a new channel, Blind Pass. The channel filled in over subsequent years, but was reopened by dredging in the summer of 2009. Like Sanibel, Captiva is a barrier island to Pine Island (to the east of Captiva and north of Sanibel), however it is much narrower. The only automobile access to Captiva is via the Sanibel Causeway and Sanibel-Captiva Road, which ends in the CDP of Captiva, the island&#x27;s only CDP. Captiva was homesteaded in 1888 and a tiny cemetery next to The Chapel by the Sea has the grave of the original resident, William Herbert Binder (1850–1932), an Austrian. Half the island is in private ownership, with &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot;, luxury homes on the gulf and bay sides of Captiva Drive. The South Seas Island Resort entry gate is at the end of this road. Roosevelt Channel on the east side of the island, is named for Theodore Roosevelt who fished there.

North Captiva Island or Upper Captiva is another island, in turn severed from Captiva in a 1921 hurricane, creating Redfish Pass. North Captiva has power from lines that originate on the north end of Captiva, and is privately owned. The island can only be accessed via boat or small plane.

Captiva was seriously damaged in August 2004 when the eastern eyewall of Hurricane Charley struck North Captiva, immediately before hitting Charlotte Harbor to the north-northeast. Initial reports indicated that 160 buildings were destroyed and another 160 seriously damaged. Reports indicate that the storm surge cut a path wide across the narrowest part of North Captiva, separating the island. The separation of the two halves of the island began three years earlier during a series of tornadoes caused by Tropical Storm Gabrielle that passed through the area in September 2001. The new pass filled in within a few years and is now back to its pre-Charley state. Most of the invasive Australian pines on the island blew over in the hurricane, making room for native mangroves and sabal palms.

In September 2022, Category 4 Hurricane Ian made landfall in Upper Captiva with sustained winds of 150 mph. The Sanibel Causeway was heavily damaged by the hurricane.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 379 people, 194 households, and 130 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 1,150 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.42% White, 0.79% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 0.53% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.79% of the population.

There were 194 households, out of which 10.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.9% were married couples living together, 1.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.5% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.95 and the average family size was 2.25.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 8.2% under the age of 18, 1.1% from 18 to 24, 14.2% from 25 to 44, 44.1% from 45 to 64, and 32.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 58 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.6 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $64,821, and the median income for a family was $120,488. Males had a median income of $31,875 versus $44,861 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $76,139. None of the population or families were below the poverty line.
==Economy==

Travel, tourism and hospitality rank as the number one industry on Captiva Island (and its sister island immediately to the south, Sanibel). Noted guests to Captiva include Teddy Roosevelt, Charles Lindbergh (who regularly landed his plane on the beach in front of &#x27;Tween Waters Inn), Anne Morrow Lindbergh and J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling. Both the Old Captiva House restaurant and a number of guest cottages have been designated historically-significant sites by Lee County, Florida.

The Bubble Room was built on Captiva Island in 1979 by the Farquharson family. It is a multi-themed restaurant featuring old toys from the 1930s and 1940s and the collection continues to grow each day. The Bubble Room plays music from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. The Bubble Room was one of the first establishments on Captiva Island to originate the bright pastel colors now widely used there.

South Seas Island Resort and Yacht Harbor, a resort, occupies the northern two miles (3 km) of Captiva Island.

Pepperidge Farm created a cookie in honor of the island. It is a Dark Chocolate Brownie cookie called Captiva.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; selected Sanibel and Captiva Islands as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes in 2010.

==History==

According to local folklore, Captiva got its name because the pirate captain José Gaspar (Gasparilla) held his female prisoners on the island for ransom. However, the supposed existence of José Gaspar is sourced from an advertising brochure of an early 20th-century developer, and may be a fabrication.

Around 3000 B.C., the sands of Captiva started to erode, resulting in the eventual formation of Sanibel Island. The Gulf of Mexico waters were eight feet lower than they are today. It is said that the first inhabitants of Captiva were the Calusa Indians. The population of the Calusa is believed to have reached as many as 50,000 people. &quot;Calusa&quot; means &quot;fierce people&quot;, and they were described as a war-like people. The Calusa Indians were resistant to colonization and attacked any explorers who came into their territory. Calusa Indians built their houses on stilts without walls. They wove palmetto leaves together to build roves (twisted strands of fibers). The Calusa Indians fished for food on the coast, bays, rivers, and waterways. They did not farm. &quot;The Calusa Indians did not farm like the other Indian tribes in Florida. Instead, they fished for food on the coast, bays, rivers, and waterways. The men and boys of the tribe made nets from palm tree webbing to catch mullet, pinfish, pigfish, and catfish. They used spears to catch eels and turtles. They made fish bone arrowheads to hunt for animals such as deer. The women and children learned to catch shellfish like conchs, crabs, clams, lobsters, and oysters.&quot; The Calusa Indians used the shells on the island for utensils, jewelry, tools, weapons, and ornaments.

By the late 1700s most of the Calusa Indians had died out. Many were captured and sold as slaves while others died from diseases such as smallpox and measles.

An Austrian named Binder (b. 1850) was on a German freighter headed to New Orleans when the ship crashed and he was shipwrecked off Boca Grande. He then washed up to shore on what has been since 1921, Upper Captiva. &quot;He lived for several weeks on what the unoccupied island had to offer, built a makeshift raft, and got himself to Pine Island, where he was helped to return to his home. By 1888, due to his having fought with the U.S. Army, he became naturalized, and was allowed to homestead on Captiva in 1888, when he was 38 years old. For 10 years he was Captiva&#x27;s first and only modern-era inhabitant. He died in 1932.&quot;

==Notable residents==
Captiva was the full-time home of artist Robert Rauschenberg. His home still stands there.

Roy Lichtenstein, American pop artist, also had a home on Captiva.

==In media==
In the 1997 movie &quot;G.I. Jane&quot;, Captiva Island is the location for the S.E.R.E. (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) training for the fictional U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team.

In the 1986 movie &quot;Manhunter&quot;, Captiva Island is where FBI psychologist Will Graham has retired to.

<text>Estero (Spanish for &quot;estuary&quot;) is an incorporated village in Lee County, Florida, United States, located directly beside the first aquatic nature preserve established in Florida: The Estero Bay Aquatic Preserve, otherwise referred to as Estero Bay Preserve State Park which is within Estero Bay, Florida. At the time of the 2010 census, Estero was an unincorporated community and census-designated place, but incorporated as a village on the last calendar date of 2014. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 36,939.

Sandwiched along Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast between Naples to the south and Fort Myers to the north, Estero is known as a popular destination for high-end shopping and dining as well as for exploring history and wildlife at its two state parks: Mound Key Archaeological State Park, which is only attainable by boat, canoe, or kayak and the Koreshan State Historic Site. Estero is also known for its many golfing opportunities as there are 11 golf courses within its borders consisting of 5 public and 6 private courses. There are also another 89 golf courses within 20 miles of Estero, including 23 public, 1 municipal, and 65 private courses. Estero encompasses some 35 gated communities and is recognized as one of the safest places in Florida.

Estero is the home of Hertz Arena, which hosts the home games for the Florida Everblades ECHL ice hockey team. Florida Gulf Coast University borders the Estero village limits and the Southwest Florida International Airport is located less than 5 miles to the north of Estero. The corporate headquarters of Hertz Corporation is located in Estero.

In 2019, Estero was ranked #8 by USA Today for cities where the most people own their homes for having a homeownership rate of 85.5%.

==History==
Mound Key, located in Estero Bay, is believed to have been the ceremonial center of the Calusa Indians when they were encountered by the Spanish in the early 1500s. German homesteader Gustave Damkohler began planting mulberry trees in 1882 along the Estero River, followed by others who established fish camps and the region&#x27;s first citrus groves. In 1894, Damkohler donated property to the followers of Cyrus Teed, who proposed a theory that people live on the inside of the Earth&#x27;s outer skin, and that celestial bodies are all contained inside the hollow Earth. This theory, which he called Koreshan Unity, drew followers to occupy and develop Damkohler&#x27;s original tract. They were business-oriented and lived communally, prospering enough to found their own political party (&quot;The Progressive Liberty Party&quot;) and incorporate the town on September 1, 1904, as Estero. At the behest of other local officials, the Florida legislature abolished the municipality of Estero in 1907.

During the 1910 US census, the population was 299. By the 1920 US census, it increased to 340 residents.

The 1908 death of Teed (who claimed to be immortal) was a critical blow to the group&#x27;s faith, whose membership dwindled into the 1960s. The foundation remains as &quot;The College of Life Foundation&quot;, which contributed (for example) at least $25,000 to the Gulf Shore Playhouse in or around 2007. The Koreshans&#x27; original tract is now owned by Florida as the Koreshan State Historic Site.

Access to Estero was greatly improved in the 1920s when Tamiami Trail, a highway linking Tampa and Miami, and two railroads were built through the area. Tamiami Trail was fully complete in 1928. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (via its Fort Myers Southern Railroad subsidiary) began service through Estero in 1925. A competing railroad, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad also built a rail line through Estero in 1927. Today, the former Atlantic Coast Line tracks are still in place east of US 41 and have been owned by Seminole Gulf Railway since 1987. The former Seaboard tracks were removed in the 1940s and its former route west of US 41 is now an FPL power line corridor.

Estero incorporated as a village on December 31, 2014.

==Geography==

The Village of Estero is located in southern Lee County at (26.432237, –81.809447). It is bordered to the south by the city of Bonita Springs and to the north by unincorporated San Carlos Park and Three Oaks.

Historically and culturally, the heart of Estero is the spring-fed Estero River, which flows to Estero Bay. Some of the earliest settlers of the area (notably the Alvarez, Fernandez, Johnson, and Soto families) were fishing families that lived on Mound Key, a mangrove-ringed island that dominates Estero Bay. During the early 20th century, these families moved upriver to the settlement which came to be known as Estero. Estero is also the location of a utopian community called the Koreshan Unity, which is now preserved as the Koreshan State Historic Site. Until the 1970s, most settlement and development in Estero was near the river.

<doc id="109328" wikidata="Q506451" url="?curid=109328" title="Fort Myers, Florida">
<text>Fort Myers (or Ft. Myers) is a city in and the county seat of Lee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 86,395; it was estimated to have grown to 95,949 in 2022, making it the 25th-most populous city in Florida. Together with the larger and more residential city of Cape Coral, it anchors the Cape Coral–Fort Myers metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses Lee County and has a population of 834,573 as of 2023.

Fort Myers is a gateway to the Southwest Florida region and a major tourist destination within the state. The winter estates of Thomas Edison (&quot;Seminole Lodge&quot;) and Henry Ford (&quot;The Mangoes&quot;) are major attractions. The city takes its name from a local former fort that was built during the Seminole Wars. The fort in turn took its name from Colonel Abraham Myers in 1850; Myers served in the United States Army, mostly the Quartermaster Department, in various posts from 1833 to 1861 and was the quartermaster general of the Confederate States Army from 1861 to 1864.

Fort Myers has substantial African American and Latin American populations. Centennial Park downtown along the Caloosahatchee River, the IMAG History &amp; Science Center, Calusa Nature Center and Planetarium, and other historical sites are among the attractions.

==History==
According to some historians, the Calusa capital was located near Fort Myers. Following European contact, Spain had colonial influence in Florida, succeeded by Great Britain and lastly the United States.

===Seminole Wars===

During the Second Seminole War, between 1835 and 1842, the U.S. Army operated Fort Dulaney at Punta Rassa, at the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River. When a hurricane destroyed Fort Dulaney in October 1841, army operations were moved up the Caloosahatchee River to a site named Fort Harvie. Fort Harvie was abandoned in 1842, as the Second Seminole War wound down. After a white trader was killed by Seminoles on the Peace River in 1849, the Army returned to the Caloosahatchee River in 1850.

Major David E. Twiggs, then stationed at Fort Brooke (present day-Tampa), gave orders for two companies of artillery to &quot;select a suitable place for the establishment of a post and immediately throw up such light works as may secure [their] stores, and remove from the Indians any temptation to which [their] isolated position may give rise.&quot; The new Fort Myers was built on the burned ruins of Fort Harvie.

The fort was named for Brevet Colonel Abraham Charles Myers, quartermaster for the Army&#x27;s Department of Florida and future son-in-law of Major Twiggs. It covered about , and soon had 57 buildings, including a two-story blockhouse that was pictured in &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;, and a wharf at which ships could dock. Irvin Solomon notes that Fort Myers was described &quot;as &#x27;one of the finest and largest&#x27; forts of the Seminole Wars&quot;. It was abandoned in 1858, at the end of the Third Seminole War.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Confederate blockade runners and cattle ranchers were based in Fort Myers. These settlers prospered through trading with the Seminole and Union soldiers.

The United States Army set up a camp on Useppa Island, near the entrance to Charlotte Harbor, in December 1863. It was intended as a place from which to recruit Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters and conscription-evaders and to raid into the interior and interfere with Confederate efforts to round up cattle for supply to the Confederate Army. After some probes along the Peace and Myakka rivers, which had mixed results, operations were moved to the mainland. Troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of Florida Rangers, later reorganized as the 2nd Florida Cavalry Regiment, left Key West, Florida for Fort Myers early in January 1864. The Union soldiers reached Fort Myers quickly enough to capture three Confederate sympathizers before they could act on orders to burn the fort to keep it out of Union hands. Beyond the principal cause for occupying the fort of providing support for Union sympathizers and local residents disaffected with Confederate taxation and conscription, the fort provided access to the large cattle herds in southern Florida, support for the blockade of the southwest Florida coast being conducted by the U.S. Navy, and a haven for any escaped slaves in the area.

In April 1864, after the troops from the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment had been transferred to Louisiana, Companies D and I of the 2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment were transferred from Key West to Fort Myers, and remained at the fort until it was abandoned. Company G of the regiment had also been sent to Fort Myers by early May. Solomon argues that Brevet Brigadier General Daniel Phineas Woodbury, commandant of the District of Key West and the Tortugas, intended that action to be an irritant to the Confederacy. The presence of the black soldiers, who made up the majority of troops used in raids into Confederate territory, played on Confederate fears of armed blacks. It was reported that Woodbury took pleasure in placing a &quot;prickly pear cactus under the Confederate saddle&quot;.

By the spring of 1864, Fort Myers was protected by a breastwork, high and wide, extending in an arc around the land side of the fort. The Seminole War-era blockhouse had been repaired and another two-story blockhouse built. The fort was soon harboring more than 400 civilians and Confederate army deserters. Many of the white men enlisted in the 2nd Florida Union Cavalry. Although designated as cavalry, the members of the regiment stationed at Fort Myers were never mounted. Escaped slaves that came to the fort were recruited into the 2nd United States Colored Infantry Regiment.

The Union achieved control of the full length of the Mississippi River after the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863. The Confederate Army then became dependent on Florida for most of its supply of beef. By the end of 1863 between 1,000 and 2,000 head of cattle were being shipped to the Confederate Army from Florida every week.

As 1864 progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to build a barracks and a wharf there. By one Confederate estimate, the Union shipped 4,500 head of cattle from Punta Rassa.

The Battle of Fort Myers was fought on February 20, 1865, in Lee County, Florida, during the last months of the American Civil War. This small engagement is known as the &quot;southernmost land battle of the Civil War.&quot; However, see Battle of Palmito Ranch.

===Settlement and founding===
The Fort Myers community was founded after the American Civil War by Captain Manuel A. Gonzalez on February 21, 1866. Captain Gonzalez was familiar with the area as a result of his years of service delivering mail and supplies to the Union Army at the fort during the Seminole Indian Wars and Civil War.

When the U.S. government abandoned the fort following the Civil War, Gonzalez sailed from Key West to found the community. Three weeks later, Joseph Vivas and his wife, Christianna Stirrup Vivas, arrived with Gonzalez&#x27;s wife, Evalina, and daughter Mary.

Gonzalez settled his family near the abandoned Fort Myers, where he began the area&#x27;s first trading post. He traded tobacco, beads, and gunpowder, and sold otter, bobcat, and gator hide to the neighboring Seminole. A small community began to form around the trading post.

In the late 19th century, northerners began to travel to Florida in the winter. Some saw development opportunities. In 1881, the wealthy industrialist Hamilton Disston of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to the Caloosahatchee Valley. He planned to dredge and drain the Everglades for development. Diston connected Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee River; this allowed steamboats to run from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Okeechobee and up the Kissimmee River.

On August 12, 1885, the small town of Fort Myers—all 349 residents—was incorporated. At that time, it was the second-largest town on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast south of Cedar Key.

In 1885, inventor Thomas Alva Edison was cruising Florida&#x27;s west coast and stopped to visit Fort Myers. He soon bought 13 acres along the Caloosahatchee River in town. There he built his home &quot;Seminole Lodge&quot;, as a winter retreat. It included a laboratory for his continuing work. After the lodge was completed in 1886, Edison and his wife, Mina, spent many winters in Fort Myers. Edison also enjoyed local recreational fishing, for which Fort Myers had gained a national reputation.

Despite an initial offer by Edison to light the town, on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1898 Fort Myers was first electrified by the Seminole Canning Company, a local company that canned and preserved fruit.

In 1898, the Royal Palm Hotel was constructed. This luxury hotel attracted tourists and established Fort Myers nationally as a winter resort destination.

===20th century===
On May 10, 1904, access to the Fort Myers area was greatly improved with the opening of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, connecting Punta Gorda to Fort Myers. This route provided Lee County both passenger and freight railroad service. The arrival of the railroad, however, also led to greater segregation in Fort Myers. With the railroad came the need for more unskilled labor and the arrival of a more uneducated workforce, compared to many African Americans who had already resided in town, some of whom had been tradespersons, vendors, and landowners. These more middle-class black citizens, as well as the new African-American laborers, were increasingly pressured to move to the segregated area that would become known as Safety Hill. This area of town, as can be seen by contemporary photographs, had a lower quality of houses and street surfaces. The area, now known as Dunbar, is still highly segregated from the rest of Fort Myers.

In 1907, the Seminole tribes&#x27; Federal Agency headquarters was relocated to Fort Myers. It remained there until 1913.

In 1908, the Arcade Theater was constructed in Downtown Fort Myers. Originally a vaudeville house, Edison viewed films here for the first time with friends Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. With the growth of the film industry, the Arcade Theatre was converted into a full movie house. A wall divided the stage in order to form two screening rooms. Changes in moviegoing habits since the late 20th century have led to the renovation of the theater for use again in live performance. It is now host to the Florida Repertory Theatre, a performing arts hall.

During World War I, Edison became concerned about America&#x27;s reliance on foreign supplies of rubber. He partnered with tire producer Harvey Firestone (of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company) and Henry Ford (of the Ford Motor Company) to try to find a rubber tree or plant that could grow quickly in the United States. He sought one that would contain enough latex to support his research endeavor. In 1927, the three men contributed $25,000 each, and created the Edison Botanic Research Corporation in an attempt to find a solution to this problem. In 1928, the Edison Botanic Research Corporation laboratory was constructed. It was in Fort Myers that Edison conducted the majority of his research and planted exotic plants and trees. He sent results and sample rubber residues to West Orange, New Jersey, for further work at his large Thomas A. Edison &quot;Invention Factory&quot; (now preserved in the Thomas Edison National Historical Park). Through Edison&#x27;s efforts, the royal palms lining Riverside Avenue (now McGregor Boulevard) were imported and planted. They inspired Fort Myers&#x27; nickname as &quot;City of Palms&quot;.

After testing around 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually discovered a source in the goldenrod plant (&quot;Solidago leavenworthii&quot;). The rubber project was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture five years later.
In 1916, automobile magnate Ford purchased the home next to Edison&#x27;s from Robert Smith of New York. Ford named his estate &quot;the Mangoes&quot;. Ford&#x27;s craftsman-style &quot;bungalow&quot; was built in 1911 by Smith. Ford, Firestone, and Edison were leaders in American industry and part of an exclusive group titled &quot;the Millionaires&#x27; Club&quot;. The three men have been memorialized in statues in downtown Fort Myers&#x27; Centennial Park.

In 1924, with the beginning of construction of the Edison Bridge, named for Edison, the city&#x27;s population steadily grew. The bridge was opened on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake. Edison dedicated the bridge, and was the first to drive across it.
In the decade following the bridge&#x27;s construction, the city had a real estate boom. Several new residential subdivisions were built beyond downtown, including Dean Park, Edison Park, and Seminole Park. Edison Park, located across McGregor Boulevard from the Edison and Ford properties, includes a number of Fort Myers&#x27; most stately homes. The population of Fort Myers City had been 575 citizens in 1890. By 1930, it had climbed to 9,082.

In 1947, Mina Edison deeded Seminole Lodge to the city of Fort Myers, in memory of her late husband and for the enjoyment of the public. By 1988, the adjacent Henry Ford winter estate was purchased by the city and opened for public tours in 1990. The combined properties today are known as the Edison and Ford Winter Estates.

<text>Fort Myers Beach is a town located on the north end of Estero Island in Lee County, Florida, United States. The town is on the Gulf of Mexico and is accessed from the mainland by a bridge over Estero Bay. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was officially incorporated on December 31, 1995. The population was 5,582 at the 2020 census, down from 6,277 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Calusa Indians first inhabited Estero Island, the island that Fort Myers Beach occupies, 2,000 years ago. The Calusa Indians resisted Spanish colonization attempts successfully including those by Ponce de León in 1513 and 1521. The Calusa met their demise 150 years later due to disease, hostilities, and political and economic upheaval. In the mid to late 1700s, Cuban fishermen then began to settle a small fishing village known as a Ranchero. This effectively displaced the remaining Calusa. In 1845, Florida became the 27th state.

=== American settlement ===
The Homestead Act of 1862 initiated American settlements on Estero Island. In 1862, Robert Gilbert received a homestead grant at the end of Connecticut Street, the highest point on Fort Myers Beach. In 1911, William Case developed the first subdivision and cottage rental industry. By 1914, all the property on the island was homesteaded with little industry beyond a hotel, fishing, gardening, and a sawmill operated by the Koreshan Unity (a communal society based on mainland Estero). At this point, Estero Island was named Crescent Beach.

Development on Crescent Beach was slow until the 1920s when Florida gained national attention as a vacation destination. In 1921, a toll bridge was opened connecting the beach to the mainland, followed closely by the construction of two casinos, hotels, a pier and the island&#x27;s first canal. The land boom ended with the hurricanes of 1921 and 1926 that challenged the paradise appeal of southwest Florida. Despite entering a depression, Crescent Beach continued to gain small businesses, restaurants, subdivisions, and a school. In the 1950s, Crescent Beach continued to modernize. Many hotels were built including the Rancho del Mar, which boasted the first swimming pool. Additionally, the swing bridge was electrified to facilitate traffic. During this time, &quot;pink gold&quot; or pink shrimp were discovered igniting the shrimping industry and ancillary businesses to support it as the population increased by 50 percent. During this second land boom, numerous civic organizations, churches, local newspapers, weather and US Coast Guard stations, and the Beach Library were added to the island. The library became the first free public library in Lee County and opened in 1955 in a one-room cottage with a single librarian.

On December 31, 1995, legislation was passed to incorporate the town of Fort Myers Beach. The island has year-round and seasonal residents, and a tourism industry.

===Hurricane Ian===
On September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall north of Fort Myers Beach as a Category 4 hurricane, causing damage and loss of life in the city due to high winds and destructive storm surge, which damaged the majority of homes and businesses along the coastline, including the Times Square. Almost all infrastructure in the area was damaged leaving the island with a continual rebuilding project.

<text>Lehigh Acres is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lee County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 Census the population was 114,287, up from 86,784 at the 2010 census. Lehigh Acres is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is one of the fastest growing communities in Lee County.

==Geography==
Lehigh Acres is located in eastern Lee County at (26.608333, -81.639167). It is bordered to the north by Alva, to the northwest by Buckingham, and to the southwest by Gateway, all unincorporated. It is bordered on the west by the city of Fort Myers, the Lee county seat, and extends east to the Hendry County line.

Florida State Road 82 forms the southern border of the community; the highway leads west to the center of Fort Myers and southeast to Immokalee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Lehigh Acres CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.61%, are water.

==History==
Lehigh Acres was developed in the mid-1950s by Chicago businessman Lee Ratner. Seeking a tax shelter, Ratner had sold his pest control business and faced the possibility of losing most of his earnings to the high capital gains tax of that era. Ratner heard that cattle was a good investment for people in his predicament, and he bought of land in eastern Lee County and named it the Lucky Lee Ranch. After ranching for a while, and despite having no prior development experience, Ratner joined with Gerald H. Gould, a Florida advertising executive, Manuel Riskin, a Chicago CPA, and Edward Shapiro, a former Chicagoan who was in the real estate business in California, and began land sales at Lehigh Acres.

Gerald Gould was the president of the corporation that developed Lehigh Acres, which began in 1954. He remained as president until the company was sold in 1972.

Since the days of the Lucky Lee Ranch, the boundaries of Lehigh Acres have stretched to cover , including the runways of the former Buckingham Army Airfield, a major Army Air Forces training base that was closed at the end of World War II. The pasture land where Ratner&#x27;s cattle roamed and the since broken up runways where military flight crews trained has been divided into some 152,000 lots for housing, along over of roads. Strips of land along major thoroughfares, such as Homestead Road and Lee Boulevard, were set aside for commerce. In 1997, nearly 90% of Lehigh Acres&#x27; lots remained vacant.

In 1992, Lee County, with the cooperation of a new developer, declared Lehigh Acres to be blighted, and authorized its Community Redevelopment Agency to take steps towards improving infrastructure and planning elements neglected by the original developer. It is estimated that nearly $11 million would be needed to repave the development&#x27;s roads.

A surge in housing prices led to a boom in Lehigh Acres new-housing construction from 2003 to 2007, peaking at more than 7,500 new homes constructed in 2006. The number of homes built during this period exceeded the total number of homes constructed during the preceding 50 years.

But as in much of the United States, the real-estate boom of the 2000s went bust. The median house price in the Fort Myers area peaked in late 2005 at $322,300. Three years later, it had plummeted to $106,900. A reliance on construction jobs no longer available pushed the unemployment rate in the area of Lehigh Acres and Fort Myers to 14% by the summer of 2009. Property values reached a low in 2008 of $106,900. By late 2014, property values averaged $169,200.

<doc id="109347" wikidata="Q2049822" url="?curid=109347" title="Punta Rassa, Florida">
<text>Punta Rassa is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lee County, Florida, United States. The population was 1,620 at the 2020 census, down from 1,750 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Punta Rassa is located in southwestern Lee County at (26.5104, -81.9988), at the west end of a peninsula bordered to the north by the Caloosahatchee River, to the west by San Carlos Bay, and to the south by the Gulf of Mexico. The community sits at the east end of the Sanibel Causeway, which crosses San Carlos Bay to Sanibel Island. McGregor Boulevard (County Road 867) forms the southern edge of the community; the highway leads northeast to Fort Myers, the Lee county seat. Punta Rassa is bordered to the east by the unincorporated community of Iona.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Punta Rassa CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 46.55%, are water.

==History==
The location was named &quot;Punta Rasca&quot; (Spanish for &quot;smooth or flat point&quot; and later corrupted to &quot;Punta Rassa&quot;) by the Spanish Conquistadors in the mid-16th century, who unloaded cattle in the area.

By the middle of the 18th century, fishermen from Cuba had established permanent fishing stations, called &quot;ranchos&quot;, along the southwest Florida coast from Tampa Bay to San Carlos Bay. The Spanish Cubans would stay in Florida from September until March drying and salting fish caught along the coast to supply Havana. Indians living in the area, possibly Calusa at first, and later Seminole, worked seasonally at the &quot;ranchos&quot;, staying on in the area during the off-season. Dr. Benjamin Strobel visited a &quot;rancho&quot; at Punta Rassa in 1833, where he found ten or so wood-framed houses. &quot;Ponte Rasa&quot; was named as a &quot;rancho&quot; in an 1835 letter from William Buner (presumably William Bunce) to Wiley Thompson.

===Seminole Wars===
Between 1835 and 1842, and again between 1855 and 1858, Punta Rassa was in the theater of war during the Seminole Wars. As a result, Fort Dulany (also spelled &quot;Dulaney&quot;, &quot;Delany&quot; and &quot;Delaney&quot;) was built there in 1837 as an army supply depot, with a hospital. The fort was abandoned the next year, and then re-occupied in 1841, when it was used to hold Seminole prisoners before they were sent west to the Indian Territory. A hurricane destroyed Fort Dulany in October 1841. Army operations were moved up the Caloosahatchee River to a site named Fort Harvie. Fort Harvie was abandoned in 1842. After a white trader was killed by Seminoles on the Peace River in 1849, the Army returned to the Caloosahatchee River in 1850. The new Fort Myers was built on the burned ruins of Fort Harvie. Fort Dulany was reopened during the Third Seminole War, in 1856, and then closed again in 1858.

===Civil War===
Southwest Florida was relatively quiet in the early part of the Civil War. Union troops and refugee Union sympathizers occupied Useppa Island in December 1863 and mounted a small raid into Charlotte Harbor and up the Myakka River, which resulted in some skirmishes with Confederate troops and irregulars. In January 1864, Union troops landed at Punta Rassa and marched overland to Fort Myers, which they were able to seize before Confederate sympathizers could burn it. The troops on Useppa Island then moved to Fort Myers. As the year progressed, Union troops and sympathizers began driving cattle to Punta Rassa to supply Union ships on blockade duty and Union-held Key West, reducing the supply of cattle available to Confederate forces. The increased shipping from Punta Rassa led the Union Army to build a barracks and a wharf there. The barracks was , set on pilings to place the building above storm surges. At the end of the Civil War, the U.S. military withdrew from the area.

===Telegraph===
In 1866, the newly formed International Ocean Telegraph Company (IOTC) received from the U.S. government, the state of Florida and the government of Spain the exclusive right to operate an underseas telegraph cable between Florida and Cuba. In 1867, the IOTC constructed a telegraph line from Lake City, where it connected with the national telegraph network via Western Union, to Punta Rassa, where the underwater cable would come ashore. The underwater cable was laid from Havana to Key West, and then on to Punta Rassa, and the line opened to public use on September 11, 1867. The U.S. Congress had, in 1866, authorized telegraph companies to run their lines across, take supplies from, and place stations on federal public domain lands without charge. The IOTC placed its office in one room of the now abandoned barracks at Fort Dulaney, while the station agent lived in another room.

===Cattle port===

Punta Rassa became a thriving cattle shipping town in the later 1800s. The first cattle drive to Punta Rassa had been in 1833, when P. B. Prior purchased ten cattle and some calves from Seminoles living near the Peace River in what is now Hardee County, and drove them to Punta Rassa, possibly for transport to Sanibel Island. Florida cattlemen began shipping cattle to Cuba after the end of the Third Seminole War. Shipments at first were made from Tampa, and then from Fort Ogden and Punta Gorda on the Peace River. Cattle shipments to Cuba were curtailed, but not completely stopped, by the Union blockade of Florida during the Civil War. After the war ended, shipments of cattle from the Peace River ports resumed to Cuba, to Savannah, Georgia, and to Charleston, South Carolina. Some of the cattle shipments to Cuba were made out of Punta Rassa starting in 1869, and by 1872, 18,000 out of a little more than 21,000 cattle shipped from Florida to Cuba went through Punta Rassa.

Most cattle drives in Florida were relatively small and short. Three or four hundred steers would be driven by three to five cowboys for or so from the open range of central Florida to Punta Rassa. A few cattle drives were larger, up to 1,500 cattle moved by ten or so cowboys. The longest drives were , from Fernandina, by the Georgia border, to Punta Rassa. Water was a problem; too much during the wet season, not enough in the dry season. In the dry season, the cowboys might have to rope alligators to pull them out of water holes so that the cattle could safely drink.

The International Ocean Telegraph Company controlled the wharf that had been part of Fort Dulaney, and for many years, charged 15 cents a head for cattle loaded on ships from the wharf. Francis A. Hendry later built pens and a wharf at Punta Rassa and charged 10 cents a head for cattle shipped from his wharf. Another cattleman, Jake Summerlin, who had owned holding pens at Punta Rassa since 1868, built a hotel (the Summerlin House) in 1874. When the hotel was full, cowboys would camp out under the building. Summerlin bought Hendry&#x27;s pens and wharf for $10,000 in 1878.

Cattle would be loaded at the port onto ships destined for Cuba. It was one of the home bases for the &quot;King of the Cracker Cowboys&quot; Jake Summerlin, who by the time he was 40, was one of the wealthiest of the Florida cattle barons. The town of Punta Rassa was lined with wooden buildings, including a hotel and several bars, which were frequented by the many merchants and cattle sellers.

===Sport fishing and tourism===
In the 1880s, the area became known as a great sport fishing area and was frequented by the wealthy, who came in search of the prized tarpon sport fish. Soon, however, visitors relocated to Boca Grande, north of Punta Rassa by land after the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway was completed to that destination. Although the distance seems great, these areas are only separated by approximately of water.

A railroad line was built towards Punta Rassa in the early 1920s by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad as part of an effort by Seaboard president S. Davies Warfield to reestablish a deepwater port at Punta Rassa. The rail line branched off the Seaboard&#x27;s main line at Punta Rassa Junction in South Fort Myers (located at Six Mile Cypress Parkway&#x27;s crossing of the Ten Mile Canal). It ran through where Lakes Park currently sits, and then roughly paralleled what is now Summerlin Road, terminating just east of Punta Rassa at Truckland. Due to their financial state, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad discontinued all operations in the Fort Myers area in 1952. Despite never fully reaching Punta Rassa, the abandoned line is still referred to as Seaboard&#x27;s Punta Rassa Subdivision. An FPL transmission line currently sits on a portion of the rail line&#x27;s former right of way just south of Summerlin Road.

The area figured prominently in the 1984 historical novel &quot;A Land Remembered&quot;, by Patrick D. Smith.

== History ==
Brothers Jules &amp; Jack Freeman established San Carlos Park in 1953 in hopes of providing low cost homes for the middle class.

The Freeman group purchased their land from the Koreshan Unity who gave them almost 250 acres for just under $3,000. When they acquired the land in Estero, Florida, they found that it was in the middle of nowhere, with the county seat, Fort Myers, Florida, being over 20 miles away.

In the 1970s, the Freeman&#x27;s drilled down into the ground and hit a spring, this spring would become a local attraction located at the San Carlos Park arches

Later on in the mid-1970s the Freeman group would go on to begin construction of their next community Three Oaks, Florida.

<doc id="109349" wikidata="Q284242" url="?curid=109349" title="Sanibel, Florida">
<text>Sanibel is an island and city in Lee County, Florida, United States. The population was 6,382 at the 2020 census, down from 6,469 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The island, also known as Sanibel Island, constitutes the entire city. It is a barrier island—a collection of sand on the leeward side of the more solid coral-rock of Pine Island.

Most of the city proper is at the island&#x27;s eastern end. After the Sanibel causeway was built to replace the ferry in 1963, the city was incorporated in 1974, and the residents asserted control over development by establishing the Sanibel Comprehensive Land Use Plan, helping maintain a balance between development and preservation of the island&#x27;s ecology. In September 2022, the causeway was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian.

Due to easy causeway access, Sanibel is a popular tourist destination known for its shell beaches and wildlife refuges. More than half the island is made up of wildlife refuges, the largest being J. N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge. The Island hosts the Sanibel Historical Village and a variety of other museums, including the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum.

==History==

Sanibel and Captiva formed as one island about 6,000 years ago. The first known humans in the area were the Calusa, who arrived about 2,500 years ago. The Calusa were a powerful Indian nation who came to dominate most of Southwest Florida through trade via their elaborate system of canals and waterways. Sanibel remained an important Calusa settlement until the collapse of their empire, soon after the arrival of the Europeans.

During the 1700s, Cuban fishermen seasonally traveled from their homes and set up fishing camps along the Gulf Coast, called &quot;ranchos&quot;, including on Sanibel Island.

In 1765, the first known appearance of a harbor on Sanibel is shown on a map as &quot;Puerto de S. Nibel&quot; (the &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; being interchangeable); thus, the name may have evolved from &quot;San Nibel&quot;. Alternatively, the name may derive, as many believe, from &quot;(Santa) Ybel&quot;, which survives in the old placename &quot;Point Ybel&quot;, where the Sanibel Island Light is. How it would have gotten this name, however, is a matter of conjecture. One story says it was named by Juan Ponce de León for Queen Isabella I of Castile or the saint whose name she shares. Another attributes the name to Roderigo Lopez, the first mate of José Gaspar (Gasparilla), after his beautiful lover Sanibel whom he had left behind in Spain. But like most of the lore surrounding Gasparilla, this story is apocryphal, as the above references to recognizable variants of the name predate the buccaneer&#x27;s supposed reign.

Sanibel is not the only island in the area to figure prominently in the legends of Gaspar; Captiva, Useppa, and Gasparilla are also connected. Sanibel also appears in another tale, involving Gaspar&#x27;s ally-turned-rival Black Caesar, said to have been a former Haitian slave who escaped during the Haitian Revolution to become a pirate. According to folklore, Black Caesar came to the Gulf of Mexico during the War of 1812 to avoid interference from the British. In the Gulf he befriended Gasparilla, who allowed him to establish himself on Sanibel Island. Eventually the old Spaniard discovered Caesar had been stealing from him and chased him off, but not before his loot had been buried.

In 1832, the Florida Peninsular Land Company established a settlement on Sanibel (then spelled &quot;Sanybel&quot;), but the colony never took off, and was abandoned by 1849. It was this group that initially petitioned for a lighthouse on the island. The island was repopulated after the implementation of the Homestead Act in 1862, and again a lighthouse was petitioned. Construction of the Sanibel Island Lighthouse was completed in 1884, but the community remained small.

In May 1963, a causeway linking Sanibel and Captiva to the mainland opened, resulting in an explosion of growth. The City of Sanibel passed new restrictions on development after it was incorporated; developers challenged them to no avail. The island&#x27;s only buildings taller than two stories predate 1974, and no fast food or chain restaurants are allowed on the island except for two that were there before the laws were enacted. A new causeway was completed in 2007; it replaced the worn-out 1963 spans, which were not designed to carry heavy loads or large numbers of vehicles. The new bridge features a &quot;flyover&quot; span tall enough for sailboats to pass under, replacing the old bridge&#x27;s bascule drawbridge span. The original bridge was demolished and its remains were sunk into the water to create artificial reefs in the Gulf of Mexico.

===Development===
The main town is on the island&#x27;s eastern end. The city was formed in 1974, as a direct result of the main causeway being built in 1963 to replace the ferry, and the rampant construction and development that followed. Developers sued over the new restrictions, but the city and citizens prevailed in their quest to protect the island. The only buildings above two to three stories on the island were built during that period.

A short bridge over Blind Pass links Sanibel to Captiva Island. More than half of the two islands are preserved in its natural state as wildlife refuges. Visitors can drive, walk, bike, or kayak through the J. N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge The island&#x27;s most famous landmark, the Sanibel Lighthouse, is at its eastern end, adjacent to the fishing pier. The main thoroughfare, Periwinkle Way, is where most of Sanibel&#x27;s stores and restaurants are, while the Gulf Drives (East, Middle and West) have most of the accommodations.

The Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization, has been a key player in curbing commercial growth and development on the island. Since 1967, SCCF has been dedicated to preserving natural resources on and around Sanibel and Captiva and has led efforts to acquire and preserve environmentally sensitive land on the islands, including critical wildlife habitats, rare and unique subtropical plant communities, tidal wetlands, and freshwater wetlands along the Sanibel River.

The Wall Street Journal selected Sanibel and Captiva Islands as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes in 2010.

==Geography==

Sanibel is located at (26.439608, –82.080456). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and (48.13%) is water.

==Climate==
Sanibel Island, in southern Florida, has a tropical climate, with daily high temperatures ranging from in midwinter to around in the summer. The months of January through April (peak tourist season on the island) have the coolest temperatures, ranging from during the day to a cool at night, and there is very little rainfall on the island during those months. The island&#x27;s summer heat and humidity, which has been recorded as high as , is cooled by the seabreezes from the Gulf of Mexico, and by almost daily afternoon and evening rain showers, which are responsible for much of the island&#x27;s rainfall. June is when the Island gets most of its rain. The area is prone to being hit by tropical cyclones and hurricanes; the hurricane season starts in June, but most of the activity occurs in September and October. Local communities have &quot;adapted to cope with these occasional storm threats.&quot;

===Hurricanes===

Southwest Florida rarely suffers direct strikes by hurricanes, but every 20 or so years it takes a significant hit, and about every 40 years a major one. Most of these have affected Sanibel. On August 13, 2004, it was hit hard by Hurricane Charley, a category four hurricane with winds. It was the strongest to hit Southwest Florida since Hurricane Donna in September 1960. While much of the native vegetation survived, the non-indigenous Australian Pines suffered serious damage, blocking nearly every road. Wildlife officials reported that the nests of birds and sea turtles were destroyed. The Sanibel Lighthouse suffered little damage, the Sanibel Causeway suffered relatively minor damage except for a tollbooth being tilted partly over, and a small seawall was eroded. Blind Pass was again cut through, but it refilled less than a month later. Residents who left before the August 13 storm were not allowed back by the city government until August 18, due to hundreds of downed trees and electric power lines, and the lack of potable water and sanitary sewerage. A temporary city hall for Sanibel was set up in a Fort Myers hotel until utilities and transport could be restored to the island.

On September 28, 2022, the island suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Ian, which made landfall just to the north of the island as a strong category 4 storm. The Sanibel Causeway partially collapsed during the storm, leaving no road access to the island or nearby Captiva, Florida.

==Ecology==
===Flora and fauna===

The island&#x27;s curved shrimp-like shape forms Tarpon Bay on the north side of the island. It is linked to the mainland by the Sanibel Causeway, which runs across two small manmade islets and the Intracoastal Waterway. A short bridge links Sanibel Island to Captiva Island over Blind Pass. 
The Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum on Sanibel is the only museum in the world dedicated entirely to the study of shells. The Gulf-side beaches are excellent on both Sanibel and Captiva, and are world-renowned for their variety of seashells, which include coquinas, scallops, whelks, sand dollars, and many other species of both shallow-water and deeper-water mollusks, primarily bivalves and gastropods.
Sanibel Island is home to a significant variety of birds, including the roseate spoonbill and several nesting pairs of bald eagles. Birds can be seen on the beaches, the causeway islands, and the reserves, including J. N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Common sights include pelicans, herons, egrets, and anhingas, as well as the more common birds like terns, sandpipers, and seagulls.

There is a population of American alligators on Sanibel Island. A lone rare American crocodile had been seen at the Wildlife Refuge for over 30 years, but she died in 2010 of unseasonably cold winters or old age. A memorial was set up at J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge honoring &quot;Wilma&quot;, as she was known by the residents. A new crocodile was introduced in May 2010 when she was found on a private property and relocated to J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Plants on the island include the native sea grape, sea oats, mangroves, and several types of palm trees. The Australian pine is an introduced species that has spread throughout the island, to some extent overpowering native vegetation and trees. Once mature, the pine blocks sunlight and drops a thick bed of pine needles that affect the soil&#x27;s pH and prevents new native growth. The ground is very soft under these pines.

The local form of the marsh rice rat has been recognized in some classifications as a separate subspecies, &quot;Oryzomys palustris sanibeli&quot;.

===Wildlife refuges===

Preserving the island&#x27;s natural ecology has always been important to its citizens and visitors alike. A driving force in the preservation of the island is the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation which was founded in 1967 with a mission to &quot;preserve natural resources and wildlife habitat on and around the islands of Sanibel and Captiva.&quot; of land on Sanibel are under the supervision of the Foundation; included in this land there is a &quot;Marine Laboratory which actively conducts research in areas including seagrasses, mangroves, harmful algal blooms, fish populations and shellfish restoration.&quot; Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation also has a project called RECON (River, Estuary and Coastal Observing Network) which includes a &quot;network of eight in-water sensors that provide real-time, hourly readings of key water quality parameters.&quot; The foundation also serves to protect the wildlife on the island and has a variety of education programs designed to instruct people about the island&#x27;s unique ecology.

The biggest wildlife refuge on the island is the J.N. &quot;Ding&quot; Darling National Wildlife Refuge, Covering more than of land, the refuge strives to ensure that these lands are &quot;preserved, restored and maintained as a haven for indigenous and migratory wildlife as part of a nation-wide network of Refuges administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&quot; The lands also serve to provide a home for many endangered and threatened species. Currently the refuge provides a home for over 220 species of birds native to the island. Visitors to the refuge can walk, bike, drive, or kayak though the wildlife drive which takes you through of mangrove tree forests and tidal flats, this drive is perfect for watching the island&#x27;s wildlife and looking at the island&#x27;s native vegetation. To show that preserving the wildlife really is important, the drive is closed one day every week, Friday, so that the wildlife can have a day to themselves where they can scavenge for food closer to the drive and not have to be bothered by or fearful of humans. There is also an education center which features &quot;interactive exhibits on refuge ecosystems, the life and work of &quot;Ding&quot; Darling, migratory flyways, and the National Wildlife Refuge System.&quot;

===Beaches and seashells===

Sanibel&#x27;s beaches attract visitors from all around the world, partly because of the large quantities of seashells that wash up there. Many sand dollars can be found as well. One of the reasons for these large accumulations of shells is that Sanibel is a barrier island that is &quot;part of a large plateau that extends out into the Gulf of Mexico for miles. It is this plateau that acts like a shelf for seashells to gather.&quot; Sanibel also has an &quot;east-west orientation when most islands are north-south. Hence, the island is gifted with great sandy beaches and an abundance of shells.&quot;

People lucky enough to find the elegant brown-spotted shell of a Junonia on a Sanibel beach often get their picture in the local newspapers. Junonia volutes are reasonably common living in deep water but only rarely wash up; a beach find of a whole shell is greatly prized. Junonia shells can be purchased at local shell shops and are displayed at the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum, in some of the glass display tables at the Sanibel Cafe, and at the Sanibel Shell Fair in early March.

Throughout the year, people come to Sanibel&#x27;s beaches to gather shells. People are often seen bending down as they look for seashells, and this posture is known as the &quot;Sanibel Stoop.&quot; There are beaches almost all around the island. There are even beaches along the Sanibel causeway that are great for fishing and windsurfing. Beach parking is very limited, and in high season finding a convenient parking space can be a challenge.

Lighthouse Beach is named after Sanibel Lighthouse, which includes a popular fishing pier and nature trails. The island&#x27;s most secluded beach is Bowman&#x27;s Beach; no hotels are in sight and the beach has a &quot;pristine and quiet&quot; atmosphere.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
A new three-section causeway bridge to Sanibel was completed in 2007, with a high-span section replacing the original drawbridge. Many sections of the causeway were destroyed in September 2022 by Hurricane Ian, rendering it unusable.

==Library==
Sanibel Public Library was built in 1994 and expanded in 2004. It has more than 60,000 titles.

==Notable people==
The city&#x27;s best-known resident is former CIA Director Porter Goss, who spearheaded the island&#x27;s incorporation, became its first mayor, and represented the area in Congress from 1989 until his appointment as CIA Director in 2004.

Other notable people who reside or used to reside on Sanibel include:
*R. Tucker Abbott, leading 20th century malacologist/conchologist
*Horace William Baden Donegan, Bishop of New York, Episcopal Church in the United States of America 
*Clifton Fadiman, author and radio/TV personality
*Helaine Fendelman, appraiser
*Jean Shepherd, author, screenwriter and radio raconteur
*Willard Scott, TV personality
*Randy Wayne White, writer of crime fiction and nonfiction adventure tales

==In literature==
Sanibel Island is the main setting for crime novels by local author Randy Wayne White. Popular locales are referenced throughout his novels. White&#x27;s main fictional character is Doc Ford and due to his popularity, White opened a restaurant called Doc Ford&#x27;s Sanibel Rum Bar &amp; Grill. Sanibel Island is the setting in the prologue of the book &quot;People&quot; &quot;We Meet on Vacation&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==In film==
Parts of George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; were shot on Sanibel Island. Romero had a second home on Sanibel, where he rewrote &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; in 1984.

&quot;Night Moves&quot; was filmed on the Island in 1975, directed by Arthur Penn. It stars Gene Hackman, Jennifer Warren, Susan Clark and features early career appearances by James Woods and Melanie Griffith.
