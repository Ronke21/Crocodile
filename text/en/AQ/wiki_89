Sibley is named after Henry Hastings Sibley, a prominent general during the Dakota War of 1862, who eventually became the first governor of Minnesota. William L. Harding, governor of Iowa from 1917 to 1921, was born in Sibley in 1877.

In March 2018, the city of Sibley lost a lawsuit brought against it by the ACLU. Local resident Josh Harms had criticized local officials for failing to stop the &quot;rancid dog food&quot; smell coming from a local pork blood processing plant, which he believed would dissuade people from moving to the town. The city of Sibley threatened to sue him and instructed him not to speak to the media about the issue. The ACLU successfully argued that this violated Harms&#x27; First Amendment rights to free speech. An injunction was granted, preventing Sibley&#x27;s officials from &quot;directing Harms not to speak with reporters, threatening to bring a lawsuit, or actually bringing a lawsuit against&quot; Harms.

In September 2018, the city of Sibley was featured in an Esquire article by Ryan Lizza on dairy farms in the region that employ undocumented immigrants. Dairy farmers and their workers expressed concern that they might be raided by ICE. Indeed, the fear of such a raid was so acute that &quot;[o]ne dairy farmer said . . . that [Western Iowa Dairy Alliance] members have discussed forming a NATO-like pact that would treat a raid on one dairy as a raid on all of them.&quot; Lizza&#x27;s reporting received national attention and has been discussed in regional and national news outlets such as Mother Jones, The Des Moines Register, The Washington Post, The Daily Beast, Bloomberg, and Salon.

<text>Clarinda is a city in and the county seat of Page County, Iowa, United States. It is located in Nodaway Township. The population was 5,369 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Clarinda was founded in 1851, and incorporated on December 8, 1866. Many stories are told of such notables as Jesse James frequently passing through.

The town is named for Clarinda Buck, who according to legend carried water to the surveyors while Page County was first being surveyed.

The best known national firm in Clarinda for many decades was Berry&#x27;s Seed Company, a mail order farm seed distribution business founded in 1885 at Clarinda by A. A. Berry. Berry&#x27;s Seed Company diversified into retail stores in the 1950s, but the stores were sold off over the following decade, and today the company, known as Berry&#x27;s Garden Center, operates from its one remaining retail outlet in Danville, Illinois.

In 1943, during World War II, an internment camp designed for 3,000 prisoners of war with sixty barracks and a 150-bed hospital was built in Clarinda. German prisoners were the first to arrive at Camp Clarinda, followed in 1945 by Italian and Japanese POWs.

The southeast area of Clarinda was once dubbed &quot;Gun Town&quot; and remains known by that name today. A noted author wrote, &quot;In the twenties and thirties, Clarinda seemed to be two separate towns: Guntown and Uptown. In the middle of the square was, and remains, the courthouse. The four blocks surrounding the square are filled with businesses. Guntown was a town all its own. The 700 block of East Garfield was a solid block of businesses--grocery stores, barber, a Chinese restaurant, another restaurant on a corner, a rug factory, a large grocery, the Swifts packing plant, and railroad tracks with freight depot and roundhouse to turn trains around.&quot;

==Transportation==
Road Network

Clarinda is located on US Highway 71 and Iowa Highway 2. In the past, both of these highways came through the center of town, but there is now a bypass that takes both highways to the south and east of Clarinda proper. There is also a good network of “farm to market” or county roads servicing the area.

Railroad Service

Early in its history, Clarinda was served by railroads from seven different directions - 5 of which were predecessors to the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q). The short westbound leg of track connecting Clarinda to Shenandoah was torn up in 1936 due to a washout of the track. In 1946, service was lost on the eastbound leg to Humeston and the line southwest to Tarkio, Missouri, through Coin, Iowa. Service was maintained south of Clarinda until the 1950s and was then trimmed back to a branch serving Clarinda from the main line to the north at Villisca, Iowa. This line survived a merger into the Burlington Northern but was abandoned in the 1980s. The beautiful brick depot in Clarinda still survives and is now the Student Union of the Iowa Western Community College-Clarinda campus.

There were two additional shortline railroads that ran to Clarinda. One was the Iowa &amp; Southwestern which connected Clarinda southwest through College Springs to the Iowa-Missouri border town of Blanchard. The I&amp;SW had its own depot very close to the Clarinda CB&amp;Q Depot. It was abandoned before 1914. The second route was the Clarinda and St. Louis Railroad which ran south out of Clarinda roughly paralleling the CB&amp;Q line to the east and terminating in Rosenberry, Missouri. This line joined with the Wabash Railroad just a few miles east of the CB&amp;Q line also from Clarinda interchanged with the Wabash in the town of Burlington Junction, Missouri. The Clarinda and St. Louis Railroad was abandoned in the 1899 after only a few years of operation.

Clarinda now joins a growing list of county seats in Iowa without rail service.[12]

Air Service

Camp Clarinda was located by what today is the town&#x27;s municipal airport, Schenck Field (named for aviator/farmer Ray Schenck, who built the original Clarinda Airport on the location).

==Geography==
Clarinda is located along the West Nodaway River, just north of its confluence with the East Nodaway River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The public school mascot was the Ayrshire Beavers.

In 1972, the town drew national attention for having the youngest mayor in America. Jody Smith was nineteen when he was elected mayor.

The rail line, by then part of the Chicago and North Western Railway, was abandoned in the 1980s, and torn up.

The town celebrated its Quasquicentennial in 2007.

<doc id="114136" wikidata="Q1925352" url="?curid=114136" title="Kingsley, Iowa">
<text>Kingsley is a city in Plymouth County, Iowa, United States, which is located within Garfield Township. The population was 1,396 at the time of the 2020 census. The city was originally known as the village Quorn, which was founded by two brothers, Frederick and William B. Close. Quorn was named after the Quorn Hunt in England. The village was later relocated to a different part of Iowa and named Kingsley due to a railroad not running through the original area. The railroad was designed by the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. Kingsley was founded on January 15, 1884, and the centennial celebration was held in June 1984. Kingsley includes organizations, recreational activities, and a local government consisting of a mayor and a city council. The schools are an elementary school and a high school, with the middle school being located in Pierson.

Recreational additions include a golf course and a public swimming pool. The city has a public library and published a newspaper titled &quot;The Kingsley News-Times&quot;, now combined with other newspapers to form &quot;The Record&quot;. There are many businesses and houses within the city limits. United States President Herbert Hoover lived in Kingsley as a child and Cincinnati Reds baseball player Harry Gaspar was born in Kingsley.

==History==
===Quorn===
The city later known as Kingsley was once a village in a different location named Quorn, being named after the Quorn Hunt in England. Quorn was founded by two brothers, Frederick and William B. Close on September 18, 1880. It started with William&#x27;s and W. Roylance Court Jr.&#x27;s 2,000 acre farm, which contained buildings, sheds, and hundreds of livestock. The livestock included sheep, bucks, ewes, cattle, and hogs. Quorn, through investments by the Close brothers, later included a post office, country store, and social center. Quorn continued to grow to include a population of 300 to 400 people and multiple buildings on Main Street.

A railroad was being built and the population of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village on its way to Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the residents had no choice but to relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.

===Current site===
Founded on January 15, 1884, Kingsley was named after Nahum P. Kingsley who had laid out the city on June 4, 1883. A centennial celebration was held on three days in June 1984. Former United States President Ronald Reagan wrote of the centennial, &quot;The spirit which has built and sustained your community reflects the energy which has forged America into a land of wonder. As a community held by fellowship and goodwill, Kingsley has become home to many who love it dearly&quot;. In June 1894, a 1,500 gallon water tower was used to pump water. In October 1905, the water tower collapsed so a new steel tower was built in January 1906. In 1915, yet another new water tower was built to replace the 1906 water tower. In 1912, a sewer system and 2,775 feet of pipe were laid. The sewer system was expanded on in 1968.

In June 1990, a public swimming pool named the Loring Aquatic Center was opened. The 1893 grain elevator was burned down in 1996 and used as practice by firefighters. In June 2000, new playground equipment was added to Kingsley&#x27;s park. Kingsley received high speed internet in May 2002. In December 2003, a final water tower was built and was completed on May 24, 2004. In 2005 through 2006, a walking trail was completed. In June 2008, a new water main was built. On August 17, 2009, it was reported that Kingsley had 80 businesses. From 2001 to 2009, almost 70 houses have been built.

===Organizations===
Shortly after Quorn was founded, an anonymous organization calling themselves The Spooks was started. Each Christmas, the members provided free food and clothing to the needy in Quorn and then in Kingsley. Their membership was small and only the members themselves knew who was a part of the organization. All members wear masks and they are still in operation in Kingsley. The Women&#x27;s Kingsley Community Action Club was founded in June 1980 as a splinter group of the Men&#x27;s KCAC. It was started with the plan to help summer programs for Kingsley&#x27;s youth. The city once published the newspaper &quot;The Kingsley-News Times&quot; that began publication in 1887. The local newspaper was founded by J. H. Strief, who later became president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor. &quot;The Kingsley-News Times&quot; was later combined with two other newspapers to form &quot;The Record&quot;, spreading its coverage to include multiple nearby cities.

<text>Le Mars is a city and the county seat of Plymouth County, Iowa, United States. It is located on the Floyd River northeast of Sioux City. The population was 10,571 at the time of the 2020 census. Le Mars is located within America Township and is part of the Sioux City metropolitan area.

==History==
Le Mars is the home of Wells Enterprises, Inc., world&#x27;s largest producer of ice cream novelties in one location and so claims to be the &quot;Ice Cream Capital of the World&quot; although it would probably be more accurate to claim to be the “Ice Cream Novelties Capital of the World”. 

In 1866, Benjamin F. Betsworth was the first settler in the town which came to be known as Le Mars; he homesteaded on the Floyd River and built the town&#x27;s first schoolhouse.
Le Mars was platted three years later but no lots were sold until the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company, a subsidiary of the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad (later part of the Illinois Central Railroad), completed its trackage from Le Mars southwardly to Sioux City in 1870.

Railroad magnate John I. Blair hosted an excursion to the new town, which was then called St. Paul Junction because of its 1871 connection to St. Paul on the nascent Sioux City &amp; St. Paul Railroad. Blair asked the women in the party to name the town, and they submitted an acronym based upon their first names&#x27; initials: Lucy Ford and Laura Walker, Ellen Cleghorn or Elizabeth Underhill, Martha Weare and Mary Weare, Adeline Swain, Rebecca Smith and Sarah Reynolds. (Note that some letters represent more than one person.) There was some subsequent uncertainty about who the women of the acronym actually were. For example, the city&#x27;s web page contains a somewhat different list.

In 1885, Frederick Brooke Close, a young Englishman who had passed up attending Cambridge University to live in Iowa, founded the Northwestern Polo League in Le Mars.

During the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when banks were foreclosing on many farmers, Le Mars caught the attention of the nation when &quot;over five hundred farmers crowded the court room in Le Mars&quot;, according to an account by historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The farmers were there to demand that Judge Charles C. Bradley suspend foreclosure proceedings until recently passed laws could be considered. Judge Bradley refused. One farmer remarked that the court room wasn&#x27;t his alone, that farmers had paid for it with their taxes. The crowd rushed the judge, slapped him, and placed a rope around his neck and a hub cap on his head. They did not, however lynch him.

President George W. Bush came to Le Mars on November 3, 2006, to campaign for Jim Nussle, then candidate for Iowa governor, as well as Rep. Steve King. He spoke at Le Mars Community High School to a crowd of over 2500 people. Le Mars is a popular stop for presidential candidates as they make their way across caucus-famous Iowa, and has been visited by nearly every presidential candidate over the past several elections including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney, John McCain, etc.

=== Wells Enterprises ===
In 1925, Fred H. Wells Jr. and his sons had opened an ice cream manufacturing plant there. However, the plant (and the Wells name) was purchased by Fairmount Ice Cream in 1928. In 1935, Fred and his sons sought to begin selling ice cream again, but could no longer use their name. They, therefore, sponsored a “Name That Ice Cream” contest in the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot;. The winner of the $25 prize suggested &quot;Blue Bunny&quot; because his son had enjoyed seeing blue bunnies in department store windows at Easter. In 2022, the company Ferrero Rocher purchased Wells Enterprise. 

Dominating the skyline of present-day Le Mars is Wells&#x27; Blue Bunny Dairy&#x27;s plant with a 12-story tall refrigeration tower called the &quot;South Ice Cream Plant&quot; – so-named because it is on the south side of town. As of 2005, the plant employed 1,000 and produces 75 million gallons of frozen treats, the milk coming mainly coming from three large Iowa dairy farms. The size of this plant has led to speculation that the company is the world&#x27;s largest family-owned and managed dairy processor and the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of ice cream in one location, with Le Mars claiming to be the &quot;Ice Cream Capital of the World&quot;.

Wells is best known for its various sweet products, including Blue Bunny, Bomb Pop, Blue Ribbon, and Chilly Cow. To showcase its sweet treats, Le Mars has an ice cream parlor, which was remodeled in 2019, and includes an old-fashioned ice cream serving station, museum displays, roof-top seating, and gift shop. The ice cream parlor in Le Mars is one of the largest tourist attractions in the state of Iowa. Le Mars hosts an annual celebration &quot;Ice Cream Days&quot; every year in late June which includes many activities such as ice cream socials, concerts, art exhibitions, parades, and more.

<text>Remsen is a city in Plymouth County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,678 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Remsen was named for Dr. William Remsen Smith. Smith had a good friend who suggested the name Smithville, but Smith thought that there were too many Smiths in the world, so she chose to give the town his middle name.

Remsen was platted by the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Town Land and Lot Company on August 28, 1876, and was incorporated in the spring of 1889. The population in 1885 was given at 650, of whom 400 were American born.

Remsen was settled mostly by German and Luxembourg immigrants. Plagued by religious persecution, unwelcome Prussian military conscription and economic limitations, the early immigrants left their native land to start a new life in the land of opportunity now called Remsen.

Remsen citizens retained their Luxembourg traditions of deep religious faith and loyal, energetic, hard working and fun loving style. At the same time they contributed to their share in the building and development of America and were quick to respond whenever Uncle Sam called on his citizens for a service, always eager to do something for the land which gave them the opportunity to raise their families as free and independent American citizens.

During Prohibition, Remsen was a major player in the brewing, transporting and sale of illegal alcohol. Its location adjacent to larger midwestern cities and the amount of farmland between homes made it a perfect area to make moonshine. Much of the moonshine produced ended up in one of two other Iowa cities: Sioux City or Pocahontas.

On July 4, 1936, a massive fire destroyed 15 homes and 18 buildings that housed 38 businesses. The fire started when a couple young kids, never identified, were playing with fireworks when a nearby tent caught fire. With the winds and extreme heat, the fire was out of control within minutes. This resulted in an all-night battle for nearby fire departments. This led to the 84 year long ban of fireworks in Iowa.

==Geography==
Remsen is located at (42.813118, -95.971673).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Fonda is a city in Pocahontas County, Iowa, United States. The population is estimated at 632 (2024).

==History==
The city of Fonda was originally called Marvin. Marvin, however, was deemed too similar to Manson, Iowa and due to mail being mixed up, town officials changed the name to Fonda in 1874. The nearest municipality sharing the name, &quot;Fonda&quot;, is Fonda, New York.

==Geography==


Fonda is located at (42.582819, -94.845810).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The town is located at the western edge of the Des Moines Lobe, the most recently glaciated section of Iowa. The Des Moines Lobe is part of the prairie pothole region of the Midwest. The topography is irregular in its gently rolling terrain. Wetlands, glacial erratics, concentric bands of ridges, and large flat areas characterize the land surrounding Fonda. In its natural state, the land is poorly drained, although humans have added an extensive network of tiles to move water from the potholes to local tributaries. The tiles surrounding Fonda empty into Big Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Raccoon River. This waterway, which underwent channelization in the early 1900s, flows past the town on its west end. Evidence of its winding original path still exists, particularly in the Fonda Golf Course and in the schoolyard behind Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church.

Four miles (6  km) northwest of town, Sunken Grove Wildlife Management Area (WMA) exists as a reminder of the past. Large undrained wetlands are surrounded by forests and prairies. The area is home to large populations of migrating birds and permanent populations of wildlife. This public parcel has recently expanded and is adjacent to the Leo Shimon WMA. Together, the two areas comprise of land, a total of slightly less than two square miles.

The remainder of the area surrounding Fonda is agricultural. Vast corn and soybean fields are interspersed by acreages and hog confinements (also known as a concentrated animal feeding operation). The vitality of the town and of the region have been influenced by the shift from a sustenance way of farming to an industrial model. Fewer farmers, less diversity in agricultural products, more agrochemicals, and more tillage have upset the economic system of the town and surrounding countryside. Fonda&#x27;s AgPartners elevator is partially owned by Cargill. Many of the hog confinements around town are owned by corporations, such as New Fashion Pork, based in Jackson, Minnesota.

Pocahontas County has seen a large decrease in the number of farms. In 1969, there were 1,369 farms. By 1997 the number had dropped to 778. The average farm size has increased from 265 to 459 acres (107 to 186 hectares) in that same time period. In 1969, 844 farms sold 176,705 hogs. In 1997, 162 farms sold 248,666 hogs.

In 1982, 14 poultry farms housed 69,911 layers. By 1997, no farms and no layers existed. In 1982, there were of pastures and acreages in the county. By 1997, that amount had decreased to .

Des Moines, which lies south and east of Fonda, receives a large portion of its drinking water from the Raccoon River (and thus Big Cedar Creek). From 1978 to 2004, contamination at its water intake plant due to nitrates (an agrichemical) has increased from 4.5 mg/L to 7.7 mg/L. Nitrate consumption is linked to blue baby syndrome.

==Economy==

The Heartland Cooperative grain storage facility is located in Alleman, with a capacity of .

==Education==
The community is within the North Polk Community School District. Alleman is the home of North Polk High School, North Polk Middle School, North Polk Central Elementary School, North Polk bus barn, and the North Polk District Office. A new high school and outdoor activities facility were opened in 2013.

==Media==

Because of its central location and relatively high altitude for central Iowa, two Doppler weather radar stations are located in Alleman: WHO-TV 13&#x27;s First Alert Mega Doppler, and KCCI-TV 8&#x27;s Super Doppler 8. A storm in July 2011 resulted in the radome from the Mega Doppler being torn from the structure and landing in a nearby yard.

Because Alleman is located about midway between Des Moines and Ames, many radio and television stations transmit from towers located in the town. These towers include some of the world&#x27;s tallest structures, reaching over . Along with the towers, a large portion of the Alleman low-altitude airspace is obstructed by the many guy-wires supporting the structures, making the area extremely hazardous for small, low-altitude aircraft. The specific antennas are:
*Local TV Iowa Tower Alleman, , constructed in 1972.
*Des Moines Hearst-Argyle Television Tower Alleman, , constructed in 1974.
*Saga Communications Tower Alleman, , constructed in 1982.
*American Towers Tower Alleman, , constructed in 2001.

<text>Altoona is a city in Polk County, Iowa, United States, and part of the Des Moines metropolitan area. The population was 19,565 at the 2020 census. It is home to the Adventureland amusement park and Prairie Meadows horse racing track and casino.

==History==
Anthony Yant first settled in what is now Altoona in 1854, the same year Gilbert T. Taylor settled there. The land was originally surveyed in 1847 and put up for sale by the US government in 1848, but it took six years to sell. After many sales between different families, the Davis family ended up with the land on February 1, 1868.

The Davises hired surveyor Julian B. Bausman to lay out the city. He is also credited for giving the city the current name. Altoona is named for the Latin word for &quot;high,&quot; &quot;altus&quot;, after surveyor Julian B. Bausman discovered Altoona was the highest point on the Des Moines Valley Railroad between Des Moines and Keokuk.

The plot was recorded on July 30, 1868, and the Post office opened the next day. When the Rock Island Railroad came to Altoona in September of that year, they referred to Altoona as Yant, the city&#x27;s original name.

Altoona was incorporated as a city on March 11, 1876.

In addition to serving as Altoona&#x27;s first mayor, Francis English was the town doctor. After the great train crash of 1877, English rushed to the scene.

Altoona&#x27;s second mayor was Thomas Haines, who operated the T.E. Haines tile and brick company. Haines donated land to the city of Altoona to be used as a park, now known as Haines Park.

The only other mayor of Altoona to have a park dedicated to him is Sam Wise, noted for paving the streets of Altoona, and building a sewer system that was advanced for its time and allowed for future expansion. His dedication to Altoona&#x27;s parks led to the city&#x27;s sports complex being named the &quot;Sam Wise Youth Complex.&quot;

By the turn of the 20th century, Altoona could almost be classified as a coal camp. United Mine Workers of America Local 407 was organized in Altoona in 1897, and by 1902, it had 61 members. This was close to 20 percent of the town&#x27;s population at the time.

On May 5, 2003, the Altoona City Council recognized the Altoona Area Historical Society as the city&#x27;s official organization to collect, secure, and preserve the artifacts and records of the city of Altoona and surrounding areas. In 2011 the Altoona Area Historical Society started major renovation work on the interior of Altoona&#x27;s oldest building. The building is now a museum.

In 2013, construction began for a new Facebook data center. Facebook asked local company RPM Access to build and operate a wind farm that will put more energy into the system than the data center will consume.

In February 2016, the Cinemark Altoona theater was opened.

<doc id="114153" wikidata="Q556989" url="?curid=114153" title="Ankeny, Iowa">
<text>Ankeny (, ) is a city in Polk County, Iowa, United States and a suburb of the state capital of Des Moines, as part of the Des Moines-West Des Moines, IA metropolitan statistical area. 
As of the 2020 census, the population of Ankeny was 67,887, making it the seventh most populous city in the state. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Iowa. Currently, the city&#x27;s incorporated area totals 29.14 square miles.

== History ==
Ankeny was founded as an agrarian community on April 22, 1875, by John Fletcher Ankeny and Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Ankeny ( Wolgamot) on eighty acres purchased on July 11, 1874, for US$1,600. The town, a single square mile, was formally incorporated on February 28, 1903.

The railroad was eventually laid from Des Moines to Ames, via Ankeny. This rail was completed in 1874 and passenger service established on July 11, 1880, for 33 cents. In the 19th century, the city&#x27;s industry was primarily agriculture — specifically sorghum and swine production. The former was processed at a nearby mill, while the latter were driven to the market at Keokuk, Iowa.

=== 20th century ===
A local newspaper, the &quot;Ankeny Times&quot;, began publication on May 17, 1902. Utilities continued to slowly develop with telephone service in 1903 and sparse electricity in 1907. Standard residential electricity only became widespread in 1919 after the Central Light and Power Company was authorized to construct a power plant and operate in the city.

Ankeny&#x27;s first fire department, a volunteer department, was established in 1907 and sparsely outfitted. Four significant fires ravaged the business district (locally known as &quot;uptown&quot;) between 1932 and 1940, but businesses rebuilt.

In the early 20th century, coal mining became significant as many companies opened shafts and mines near the city in 1903, 1907, and 1908. The Enterprise Coal Company utilized Ankeny as a company town and went on to produce over 100,000 tons of coal in 1914, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state. In 1912, United Mine Workers Local 2476 in Ankeny had 246 members, over half of the total population at the time, and Local 2511 in Enterprise had 395 members.

==== World War II and Post-War ====
Prior to the 1930s, most of the land in Ankeny found agricultural use: however, manufacturing became increasingly significant. In the 1940s, amidst World War II, the US federal government vacated and seized farms via eminent domain in 1941 for the construction of a military ordnance plant. The plant was fully operational from 1942 until being put on standby on V.E. Day, 1945 and officially closed immediately prior to VP day.

<text>Johnston is a city in Polk County, Iowa, United States. The population was 24,064 in the 2020 census, a large increase from the 8,649 population in 2000. It is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Johnston was established in 1905 as a station on the Des Moines &amp; Central Iowa Railway between Des Moines and Perry known as Johnston Station. It was named for the railway&#x27;s freight supervisor, John F. Johnston. Passenger service along the railroad ended in 1949, and the track has subsequently been removed within city limits.

Voters passed a resolution to incorporate on June 23, 1969. On September 8, the first Mayor and Council were sworn in. Incorporation papers were signed by the Clerk of the District Court on December 11, 1969.

At the time, the Johnston Station area did not become part of the incorporated city because of a state law that prevented a town within three miles (5 km) of another city from incorporating. The neighboring cities of Des Moines and Urbandale were also interested in that land, but in April 1970, Johnston and Urbandale reached an agreement that allowed Johnston to annex the Johnston Station area.

<doc id="114164" wikidata="Q1944958" url="?curid=114164" title="Carter Lake, Iowa">
<text>Carter Lake is a city in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. A suburb of Omaha, Nebraska, it sits surrounding the south and west sides of the region&#x27;s major airport, Eppley Airfield. It is separated from the rest of Iowa by the Missouri River, effectively making it an exclave. The population was 3,791 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Carter Lake is an example of the border irregularities of the United States, being the only city in Iowa located west of the Missouri River. In March 1877, a flood redirected the course of the river 1.25 mi (2 km) to the southeast. The remnants of the old river course, called Saratoga Bend, became an oxbow lake, named Carter Lake. Soon after the formation of the lake, the site became a flourishing recreational area. It included &quot;a boathouse at the foot of Locust street, hotels and club houses were numerous and the lake was the scene of many a pleasant rowing and fishing party.&quot;

In 1892, after extensive litigation between Iowa and Nebraska, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Carter Lake belonged to Iowa in &quot;Nebraska v. Iowa&quot;, 143 U.S. 359 (1892). Although the general rule is that state boundaries follow gradual changes in the course of a river, the Court ruled that an exception exists when a river avulses one of its bends. In 1972, the Supreme Court made another ruling on the circumstances of Carter Lake when it ruled on a boundary dispute between the two states in &quot;Nebraska v. Iowa&quot;, 406 U.S. 117 (1972).

Although Carter Lake was legally considered part of Council Bluffs, residents paid city taxes but lacked the basic city services enjoyed by residents east of the Missouri River. The community successfully seceded from Council Bluffs in the 1920s, intending to become part of Omaha, Nebraska, but Omaha did not want to pay to extend sewers or water lines.

On July 2, 1930, Carter Lake was incorporated as a city, in the state of Iowa.

Two early, separate amusement parks were located in Carter Lake: from 1905 to 1917, there was the Courtland Beach Amusement Park, and from 1917 to 1933, the Lakeview Amusement Park. The Munchoff Brothers, who were the original operators of Omaha&#x27;s Krug Park, ran both parks; in 1917, they moved rides from Courtland to Lakeview. In 1945, one of the brothers donated the rides from the old parks to the World War II metal drives.

In the 1930s and &#x27;40s, Carter Lake became a gambling hot spot, as law enforcement was limited and because of its important location. At The Chez Paree, you &quot;could listen to Sophie Tucker, have the best prime rib in town and enjoy a gambling raid or two.&quot; Patrons could &quot;bet on any horse race in the United States,&quot; and the business was described as &quot;the most active casino between Chicago and the West Coast.&quot;

The mistaken belief that a defendant corporation located in Carter Lake was a legal resident of Nebraska resulted in another U.S. Supreme Court case, &quot;Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger&quot;, 437 U.S. 365 (1978). The case clarified the law regarding ancillary jurisdiction, which allows claims based on state law to be heard in a federal court when related to a claim based on federal law.

==Geography==
The city is surrounded on three sides by Omaha, Nebraska, and on the fourth by the Missouri River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Carter Lake creates a geographic oddity for travelers going to Eppley Airfield, which it surrounds on the south and west. Consequently, travelers going to Eppley Airfield from anywhere except North Omaha will go through Carter Lake, Iowa. It is reported to have caused confusion when travelers not used to the area go through and see a &quot;Welcome to Iowa&quot; sign on their way to and from the airport.

<text>Treynor is a city in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,032 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Treynor began east of Council Bluffs, IA in the late 1880s with the establishment of Fritz Eyberg&#x27;s General Store, August Olderog&#x27;s dance hall and saloon, and St Paul&#x27;s German Evangelical Church. The vicinity east of Middle Silver Creek had previously been known for its number of wolves. Local German immigrant farmers referred to the settlement as Four Corners or High Five, a popular card name, until the post office opened in the early 1890s as Treynor, named after the recently deceased Council Bluffs postmaster. By the time the town was incorporated in 1905, it included two general stores, two saloons, a furniture/implement house, a livery stable, several blacksmith shops, and the Treynor State Bank. In 1911, the community got its own railroad with the opening of the Iowa &amp; Omaha Shortline which ran 12 miles to Neoga, a small depot on the Wabash Railroad line southeast of Council Bluffs. The line was unprofitable and ended operations after five years. The Great Depression closed down the Treynor State Bank while improvements began on the &quot;Short-line&quot; Road from Treynor to Council Bluffs that is now Iowa Highway 92. An Air Force radar base operated just outside town during the early years of the Cold War.

<text>Underwood is a town in Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The population was 954 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Underwood is located in Norwalk Township, so the early history of the township is also of the town. The historical information provided here was taken from a book on Pottawattamie County&#x27;s past. The principal early settlers of the area arrived during the period from 1845 to 1850. In 1847, a flour mill and a saw mill were built on Mosquito Creek, southwest of the present site of Underwood. In 1850, the flour mill was destroyed by a flood. The first school was built in 1863, and soon more homes were built near the school and saw mill. It became known as Downsville. A post office was established there.

With the coming of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1869, the town of Underwood was established three miles northeast of Downsville, which was later abandoned and has entirely disappeared (with the exception of a cemetery). In 1882, the other railroad that crossed through Norwalk Township, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, built a station house, erected a water tank and laid a switch. These improvements were on portions of the farms owned by two men and their farms were to be surveyed and divided into town lots. The name Underwood comes from the name of the first engineer to run a train over the Milwaukee tracks. Two farmers cut the corn stalks off to make a road to the Milwaukee tracks so the depot could be built. This path later became &quot;Main Street&quot;.

In 1902, the town was incorporated, a town marshal appointed, sidewalks constructed and a jail built at the cost of $140. The first addition to the town was presented to the town council in 1903. The old school house was moved onto town property and made into a town hall. In 1905, five street lamps were purchased, sidewalks and streets were extended. From 1907 to 1910 the telephone came to town, a water works system was installed and cement sidewalks constructed. By 1917 a fire department was organized. In 1926 a new consolidated school was built at the cost of approximately $75,000. There were 62 students in high school and 116 in the grades with seven teachers in charge.

In 1965, sewer mains were installed. The new Western Electric plant was finished in 1974 and they helped bring the town&#x27;s sewer plant up to date.

In 2012, Jack Links opened a distribution center in Underwood, providing a $15,000 donation to the community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Underwood, Iowa is located in the Loess Hills, a prairie made of windblown soil deposited following the last Ice Age.

<doc id="114176" wikidata="Q1901319" url="?curid=114176" title="Deep River, Iowa">
<text>Deep River is a city in Poweshiek County, Iowa, United States. It is also the name of the township which includes the city. The city population was 249 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Deep River is located at (41.580395, -92.374249).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Brief history and etymology==

In 1856 the town of Dresden, approximately one mile east of the present town of Deep River, was platted. The Whitney brothers operated a store there for about 20 years. When the Chicago and North Western Railway was built, the residents of Dresden moved to be near the railroad, and thus the town of Deep River was established in 1884. The Dresden Cemetery lies about a mile and a half south of the current county road, locally known as the Diamond Trail, just about a quarter mile east of Iowa Highway 21. The town of Tilton was established at the southern border of the township in 1884 as well, although this largely lay in Keokuk County.

===Deep River Township===
Deep River Township was organized March 7, 1857. It was, at first, a part of Jackson Township. It derived its name from the stream flowing through its northern part, but not because the water was so deep, but rather it was so far down to the water. The first settlers to live in Deep River Township were Robert Taylor and family from Ohio; John Sargood, whose father was from England; Albert Morgan and family from Ohio; and the Lights, who came from Virginia in 1849. The first post office was established in 1852, and called Deep River. The first marriage was that of Nancy Taylor to Rev. W. H. Palmer in 1849. James Light and James Rundle settled in that same year.

The first township election was held in 1857 with the following officers: Ephraim Cox, Asa Cohoe and John Morgan, trustees; Myron Whitney, clerk; L. Mayo, C. M. Wolcott, justices of the peace; H. Armstrong and C. Barber, constables; and James Hillman, road supervisor.

===Town of Deep River===
The town of Deep River was incorporated in the summer of 1887 after the Northwestern Railroad spur from Belle Plaine to Muchakinock in southern Iowa was built. Horace Phelps built a depot and gave the railroad $1,500 to secure the location there. The citizens of Dresden then soon followed and the new town of Deep River grew, leaving Dresden largely uninhabited. The first town election resulted in the following officers: J. S. Potter, Mayor; S. S. Jenkins, recorder; J. C. Sanders, treasurer; C. F. Cutler, assessor; James Sargood, marshal; A. C. Converse, Charles Lacher, N. M. Valentine, J. P. Sargood, E. T. Whitney and James Light, councilmen.

The Deep River flows nearby; it is a minor tributary of the English River. The town and its namesake river were named not for the depth of the water in the Deep River, but for the depth of the ravine through which it flows.
At some places the banks are above the normal water level.

On May 14, 1970, the local area was subjected to a significant flood on the Deep River which was assessed as having a greater than 50 year recurrence interval. The stream gauge on the Deep River station measured a record stage of and with a stream flow of

==Education==
Deep River is mostly within the Montezuma Community School District and partially in the English Valleys Community School District.

The community was previously located within the Deep River–Millersburg Community School District (DR-M), which was established in 1958 as a consolidation of the Deep River and Millersburg school districts. In 1992 the district closed its secondary school and began a joint whole grade-sharing program with the English Valleys district and that of the Montezuma, in which it sent its junior and senior high school students to both districts; each student chose which secondary school to attend. The Deep River grade school was closed that year, with elementary school students moved to Millersburg, as the district found the layout of the latter more useful. On July 1, 2009, the DR-M district was consolidated into the English Valleys district, although a portion of it was given to the Montezuma district.

<text>Grinnell ( ) is a city in Poweshiek County, Iowa, United States. The population was 9,564 at the time of the 2020 census. It is best known for being the home of Grinnell College, as well as being the location of the Merchants&#x27; National Bank building, designed by famous architect Louis Sullivan.

== History ==
Grinnell was founded by settlers from New England who were descended from English Puritans of the 1600s. Grinnell was founded in 1854 by four men: Josiah B. Grinnell, a Congregationalist from Vermont; Homer Hamlin, a minister; Henry Hamilton, a surveyor; and Dr. Thomas Holyoke. The city was to be named &quot;Stella,&quot; but J. B. Grinnell convinced the others to adopt his name, describing it as rare and concise. Grinnell was incorporated on April 28, 1865, and by 1880, Grinnell had a population of around 2,000. Located at the junction of two railway lines (east–west line of the Rock Island Railroad and the north–south Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway), it is the largest community in Poweshiek County.

Grinnell was a stop on the Underground Railroad from its founding. One of the most famous events occurred in February 1859, when abolitionist John Brown, and 12 slaves he was helping escape to freedom, were hosted by J. B. Grinnell and several other community residents. Because of J. B. Grinnell&#x27;s efforts to help slaves and end slavery, in 2013, the National Park Service included his gravesite at Hazelwood Cemetery on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom listings.

The Mormon Trail ran along the southern edge of Grinnell. The trail was traveled by an estimated 100,000 plus travelers from 1846 to 1869, including some 70,000 Mormons escaping religious persecution. The Pioneer Company of 1846–1847 established the first route; from Nauvoo, Illinois, to Salt Lake City. A stone marker memorializes the Mormon Handcart Trail and the grave of a child who died along the trail near Grinnell.

Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, a private liberal arts college, which was established in 1846.

Two major events marked the early years of the community. On June 17, 1882, a violent, estimated, F5 tornado destroyed most of the college campus and much of the community with a death toll of 68, causing up to $1.3 million in total damages (in 1882 USD). In June 1889, fire destroyed most of the downtown area.

Grinnell was home to the Spaulding Manufacturing Company. H. W. Spaulding began making carriages and spring wagons in Grinnell in 1876. In 1909, Spaulding Manufacturing added automobiles to its production line. At one time, the factory was the largest employer in the county. Automobile production ceased at the Spaulding factory in 1916 when it could no longer compete with the cheaper Ford automobile. The Spaulding factory site became home to the Spaulding Center for Transportation/Iowa Transportation Museum, as well as a 77 unit loft apartment complex which opened in 2017.

The kitchen holds an electric refrigerator made by the Grinnell Washing Machine Company, one of the first 50 made in 1932. There is a Military exhibit with uniforms from the Civil War to the Vietnam war. The Carriage House holds several horse-drawn vehicles built by the Spaulding Carriage Factory in Grinnell.

The Grinnell Area Arts Council (GAAC) building, formerly Stewart Library, includes the Stewart Gallery and features works of local and regional artists. The gallery space includes high ceilings and nice light. The GAAC also includes the Loft Theater and is home to the Grinnell Community Theater. In 2008, the GAAC expanded to space across the street and opened The Stew Makerspace. The Stew Makerspace is a collaboration between the Grinnell Area Arts Council and the Wilson Center for Innovation and Leadership at Grinnell College. Located at 927 Broad Street, the Stew houses spaces for ceramics, woodworking, 3D printing, metal working, laser engraving, and much more.

The Faulconer Gallery (now called the Grinnell College Museum of Art) on the Grinnell College campus features year-round exhibits of regional, national and international artists. The space is inside the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts.

<text>Malcom is a city in Poweshiek County, Iowa, United States. The population was 270 at the time of the 2020 census. The city was named for an early Scotch settler. The town&#x27;s major businesses include BASF, The Pour House Bar and Grill, and Dayton Meat Products.

==History==
Prior to the treaty of May 1, 1843, the area of what is now Malcom was Sauk and Meskwaki lands. Though there were a few settlers earlier, by 1858, the population justified the formation of a township. The railroad was extended from Iowa City in 1863, and the village was laid out on the Little Bear Creek. The town was incorporated on April 23, 1872. The town was badly damaged in the 2020 derecho, when a resident died and several grain silos were toppled.

==Education==
The first school in Malcom was established in 1855, consisting of six students. In 1864, the Malcom Independent School was established. By 1880, there were 136 pupils in the school. The first high school was started in 1885, though only three years were offered, and many students went to Grinnell to complete their work. The first graduating class of seven students, all girls, was in 1888. A modern two-story brick schoolhouse was dedicated in November 1903. In 1923–24, a new addition was built at a cost of $38,000. During this time, there were also nine rural one room schools in the township. The last class to graduate from Malcom High School was in 1960, as the school merged with schools in Brooklyn and Guernsey to form the BGM Community School District. The Malcom school was then converted to an elementary school.

==Geography==
Malcom is located at (41.707486, -92.555373).

<text>Ellston is a city in Ringgold County, Iowa, United States. The population was 19 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1881, anticipating the railroad, Cochran &amp; Le Fever built a general store, giving birth to the village of Wirt. The business failed and was sold six months later, but in March 1882 the Humeston &amp; Shenandoah Railroad established a station here. In 1895 the town&#x27;s name of Wirt was changed to Ellston so mail would be correctly received, rather than confused with the nearby northeasterly town of Van Wert.

The westerly border of Ellston is county road P-64. This road was originally part of the Dragoon Trace.

<doc id="114198" wikidata="Q1903425" url="?curid=114198" title="Sac City, Iowa">
<text>Sac City is a city in and the county seat of Sac County, Iowa, United States, located just southwest of the eastern intersection of U.S. Routes 20 and 71 in the rolling hills along the valley of the North Raccoon River. The city is one of 45 designated Main Street Iowa communities through the Main Street Iowa development program. The population was 2,063 in the 2020 census, a decline from the population of 2,368 in 2000.

==History==
Sac City was first platted in 1855 by Joshua Keith Powell of Fort Dodge, Iowa. The town was so named because the Sac and Meskwaki peoples were in possession of the land at the time of the Louisiana Purchase. The City of Sac City was incorporated 19 years later, in 1874.

Judge Eugene Criss, credited with being the father of Sac City, left Wisconsin and crossed the Mississippi River in the early months of 1855 by covered wagon. He was in search of waterpower and had the desire to establish a settlement in a new and untried country. Deciding upon the North Raccoon River to begin his settlement, Judge Criss proceeded to erect the first log cabin in Sac City, establish himself in the hotel business, as well as keep a stage station and general store for nearby settlers.

As early as 1859, there was talk of building a railroad through Sac County, but the first railroad did not come through Sac City until 1879. The railroad companies refused to lay tracks through undeveloped or mildly developed areas, and Sac City did not meet the requirements. The railroad companies demanded communities be far enough advanced to provide a quick return to capital before they would construct a steam and iron highway through the area. When it came, the railroad benefited Sac City incredibly. The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company connected Sac City, Wall Lake, Auburn, Odebolt, Lake View, Early, and Schaller as well as the cities where crops were sold.

The first Sac County Fair was held in 1871 on of ground east of Sac City that had been purchased by the Sac County Agricultural Society the same year. The fair was one of the biggest events of the year and brought people in wagons and buggies from miles around to see the harness races, livestock exhibits, produce, needlework, and art goods.

The Sac City Chautauqua Association was organized in December 1904 with 120 members. The Association brought many fine programs to the community, and because transportation was still slow and laborious, many families stayed in tents on the grounds for the entire Chautauqua session, about eight or nine days. At first the meetings were held in a tent, but by 1908, the citizens of Sac City built a Chautauqua Building in which to hold their meetings, and which is now the only one left of its kind in the state of Iowa.

===Modern-day===
In May 2017 lifelong Sac City resident and businessman John Criss donated US$5.7 million of his estate to the city for beautification projects.

==Geography==
Sac City&#x27;s longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal form are 42.421154, -94.995083.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Humid continental climate is a climatic region typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Precipitation is relatively well distributed year-round in many areas with this climate. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Dfa&quot; (Hot Summer Continental Climate).

The railroad ceased operations and pulled up tracks in the 1970s. Transportation connections are by U.S. Route 20 and Iowa Highway 110.

<text>Bettendorf is a city in Scott County, Iowa, United States. It is the 15th largest city of Iowa and the third-largest city in the &quot;Quad Cities&quot;. It is part of the Davenport–Moline–Rock Island, IA-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 39,102 at the 2020 census.

Bettendorf is one of the Quad Cities, along with neighboring Davenport and the Illinois cities of Moline, East Moline and Rock Island. The Quad Cities were population 379,374 at the 2022 estimate.

==History==
Bettendorf lies in the original Wisconsin Territory, which the United States bought from the Sac and Fox Indians after defeating them in the Black Hawk War. The territory was ceded in the Black Hawk Purchase of 1832. The first European-American settlers established a village they called Lilienthal, after an early tavern and dance hall. The village of Gilbert developed alongside Lilienthal in 1858, honoring Elias Gilbert, who platted the original site. At that time, the residents were predominantly German immigrants and worked as farmers, skilled laborers, and small business owners. The two villages eventually combined to become the town of Gilbert.

 1900, the town gave William and Joseph Bettendorf of riverfront land on the condition that they move their iron wagon business from Davenport to Gilbert. In 1903, the town of 440 citizens petitioned for incorporation, requesting to change the town&#x27;s name in honor of the brothers whose factory was a major economic influence in the early development of the city.

In the late 1940s, Aluminum Company of America (A.L.C.O.A.) chose Riverdale, an enclave of Bettendorf, for construction of the world&#x27;s largest aluminum mill. The huge mill, and the attendant developments from it, created thousands of jobs and greatly increased growth in Bettendorf&#x27;s population, which has continued to the present day.

The first modern-day riverboat casinos in the United States were launched in Bettendorf on April 1, 1991 by local businessman Bernard Goldstein. He went on to found the Isle of Capri Casinos. Goldstein and his family members also operate Alter Companies, which is a scrap metal, barge and towboat company operating on the river waterfront. The Quad Cities Waterfront Convention Center opened by the casino and hotel in 2009. It is owned by the city and operated by the Isle of Capri.

The city of Bettendorf is located along the banks of the Mississippi River. Because of this the city of Bettendorf goes through a great deal of flooding and deals annually with storm water run off. In 2000, Missman, Stanley &amp; Associates prepared a Comprehensive Storm Water study on all 14 of the city&#x27;s drainage ways. This study included future Capital Improvement Projects. The City of Bettendorf&#x27;s Stormwater Section will be the organization to implement this comprehensive plan. There are 169 inlets that have found to be insufficient and not working to proper code for handling rainfall over 1.25 inches and in handling of rainfall into all city creeks. Due to this, several creeks such as Crow Creek, Pigeon Creek, Spencer Creek, and others are continuing to flow and destroy personal property because of not handling the water being put into the creek properly and having the creek banks secured. The City of Bettendorf has been collecting storm water fees on water bills to maintain and resolve these issues.

Efforts are focused on improving surface water quality which will in turn improve the quality of drinking water, increase viability for fish and decrease flooding. The plan includes the repair and cleaning of roadside pipes and ditches, replacing small culverts with larger ones and maintaining the system on a regular basis. Routine inspections are performed during dry weather to detect and address illicit discharges.

Beginning in 2012, a portion of downtown Bettendorf&#x27;s buildings were torn down to make way for the new I-74 Bridge project and as part of a corresponding downtown Bettendorf redevelopment. The original I-74 twin bridge span was built in 1935 and the second in 1959. The I-74 Bridge project will demolish the original twin spans and construct a new I-74 bridge over the Mississippi River. The 1.2 billion dollar bridge project began construction in July 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021. The project converted Grant Street, in the vicinity of I-74, to a two-way street with three lanes in each direction. New commercial and residential construction in downtown Bettendorf has occurred in the redesigned corridor. The I-74 bridge connects Bettendorf and Moline, Illinois.

== History ==
Steamship captain Benjamin W. Clarke settled the area of Buffalo in 1833. It was claimed following the 1833 Black Hawk Purchase which opened the region to non-native settlers. In 1836, Clarke sold a 2/3 interest in 90 acres of land to Captain E.A. Mix and Dr. Pillsbury and collectively the three men platted the town of Buffalo after Buffalo, New York. This was the first town to be platted in Scott County. The town was hopeful for a county seat but found itself on the Western edge of Scott County after its districting in 1837. This made the town unsuitable for the county seat compared to the centrally located Davenport.

The Buffalo County Public School District #1 opened in the town in 1836. Coal deposits were discovered in 1834 and sold to passing steamboats. A post office was opened in the town in 1836. The first criminal trial in Scott County was held in Buffalo in 1836 for petty theft.

<text>Eldridge is a city in Scott County, Iowa, United States. The population was 6,726 in the 2020 Census; Eldridge is a rural community and part of the Quad Cities metropolitan area.

==History==
Jacob M. Eldridge, the city&#x27;s namesake, arrived in central Scott County in 1846, having purchased land for $1.25 per acre. Immigrants from Germany soon followed, and northern Scott County slowly began to develop. Railroads were developed during the 1860s, bringing more settlers. Eldridge Junction, built on land donated by Jacob Eldridge, was incorporated on July 2, 1871. A post office and a Presbyterian church were soon built.

Eldridge faced several challenges during its early years. The railroad faltered financially during the 1880s and was re-located to Oxford Junction, while a smallpox epidemic several years later was said to have totally isolated the city. A fire heavily damaged the city&#x27;s business district in 1904, and in 1918 a tornado of unknown strength heavily damaged or destroyed several residences and the church, and killed three people. Each time, the city recovered, and the farming community maintained its status as a grain and livestock shipping center.

The city began growing in population during the 1950s, starting with the formation of the Scott County Library System (a countywide network of libraries serving smaller communities in the area) in 1950, and the North Scott Community School District in 1956. By the late 1960s, the population had grown to more than 1,000 residents, and with the creation of several industrial parks to encourage new business development, the city continued to grow.

Eldridge is located at (41.648697, −90.581492). It is located north of Davenport along U.S. Route 61.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
