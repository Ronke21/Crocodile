<text>Clinton is a city in and the county seat of Clinton County, Iowa, United States. It borders the Mississippi River. The population was 24,469 as of 2020. 

Clinton, along with DeWitt (also located in Clinton County), was named in honor of the sixth governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton. Incorporated on January 26, 1857, Clinton is the principal city of the Clinton Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is coterminous with Clinton County. 

==History==
Elijah Buell, among the first European-American settlers in the Clinton area, established the town of Lyons in 1837. It was named after the French city Lyon. It grew with the lumber and railroad industry through the century, and merged in 1895 with the City of Clinton. 

Clinton was platted as the Town of New York in 1836 by Joseph Bartlett. He was looking for gold deposits in the area.

In 1855, the Chicago, Iowa, Nebraska Railroad announced it would build a bridge across the Mississippi River at Little Rock Island. The Iowa Land Company named the town as Clinton, in honor of DeWitt Clinton, governor of New York State. A general city charter was adopted in 1857. Lyons Female College was established in 1858.

Clinton&#x27;s population grew to more than 1,000 as construction of the bridge continued. In 1859, the railroad line was completed to Cedar Rapids. Fifty years later, the single-track railroad bridge was replaced by a double-track bridge that was completed in 1909. 

Between the 1850s and 1900, Lyons and Clinton quickly became centers of the lumber industry and together were regarded as the &quot;Lumber Capital of the World.&quot; In the 1880s and 1890s, Clinton boasted more millionaires per capita than any other city in the nation.
In 1895, the town of Lyons officially merged with the city of Clinton.

By the end of 1900, the northern forests were depleted and the sawmills closed. The railroad and river, providing economical transportation in all directions, attracted manufacturing and heavy industry. The city still boasts a number of magnificent Victorian mansions built during that time. Among these is the George M. Curtis House.

In 1925, Clinton acquired Eagle Point Park as part of its park system. 

In 1956, the Gateway Bridge (Illinois-Iowa) was opened.

In 1965, the Mississippi River crested at 24.85 feet, effectively flooding the city of Clinton as well as many other cities along the Mississippi. The US Army Corps of Engineers began a seven-year, $28.9 million levee project. An 8.1-mile dyke, 4,330 feet of concrete flood wall, six pumping stations, seven closure structures, five major street crossings; 17,320 feet of new sewer; and 23 gate wells were completed and dedicated in June 1981.

In 2005, Clinton was awarded one of the inaugural Iowa Great Places designations. Under this award, Clinton received a $1 million state budget allocation for cultural and landscape improvements along the city&#x27;s riverfront.

In 2009, Archer Daniels Midland began construction of a new cogeneration plant to Clinton. This has brought more jobs and workers to Clinton.

In 2016, the city obtained the certification for Lincolnway Industrial Rail and Air Park. The park is located adjacent to US Highway 30 and the Clinton Municipal Airport. The Union Pacific East-West Mainline runs to the south, with a dedicated spur running into the park. Targeted industries for the Clinton Region included chemicals processing, metal fabrication, and value-added agriculture. Rail.One, HeroBX, and Atlas Roofing Corporation were expected to occupy the Rail Park in 2025.

In the 2010s-2020s, many businesses expanded, adding hundreds of new jobs to the area. These businesses include Big River Packaging, Nestle Purina, and Archer Daniels Midland. They invested millions of dollars into the community. This catalyzed the development of new suburban housing developments, restaurants, and recreational attractions. 

In 2020, Clinton received a grant from ‘Iowa Great Places’. It dedicated to a project known as ‘Even More Things to Do with a River View.’ Funds were used to improve the city&#x27;s riverfront and improve public access. 

In 2023, the historic Clinton High School was torn down. The newly built Clinton High was opened for student use. Additionally, the &#x27;Tailgate N&#x27; Tallboys&#x27; concert brought nearly 9,000 people to Clinton for a 3-day concert series.

<text>Grand Mound is a city in Clinton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 615 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad was built through the town site in 1858, and a train station was built. Grand Mound was platted in 1866. Grand Mound was named for nearby Sand Mound; a recording error accounts for the error in spelling, which was never corrected. Legend has it, that it is the grandest of all mounds.

==Education==
Grand Mound is part of the Central DeWitt Community School District, based in DeWitt, known as the Central Clinton Community School District until July 1, 2014.

Until 2001, elementary-aged students attended Grand Mound Elementary School with older students being bused to DeWitt.

Grand Mound Elementary was on a property of about (35 rods, 10 feet by 18 rods). The first school building was built in 1917. Another school building, from 1954, had a cafeteria, a gymnasium, and two classrooms. In 1995 the district closed the original building because it was deemed to be structurally unsafe and its roof was in a poor condition. Circa 1999 that building was demolished. After the demolition the cafeteria began serving as an office, a school nurse area, and a reading and speech therapy instruction area. By 2001 Grand Mound Elementary served Kindergarten and the first grade. Grand Mound Elementary had 38 students in the 1998–1999 school year, and by 2001 the enrollment was down to 35. Grand Mound students used the library, media and computer facilities at Welton Elementary.

Circa 2001 there was a bond proposal to expand the elementary schools in DeWitt, which would have centralized services and facilities for the handicapped, and close the schools in Grand Mound and Welton. By 2002 the school closed, and was sold to God&#x27;s Family Baptist Church. After the closure of Grand Mound (due to declining enrollment and concerns about the building&#x27;s structural condition), students were bused to elementary schools in Welton and DeWitt; today (with Welton also closed), all elementary-aged students attend school in DeWitt.

Prior to the formation of the Central Clinton School District, Grand Mound had its own junior-senior high school, which operated in the same school building as the elementary school. Sports teams were known as the Cardinals. The last graduating senior class was in 1961, when Grand Mound—along with the Welton and DeWitt school districts—consolidated to form the Central Community School District.

==Geography==
Grand Mound is located at (41.824275, -90.646815).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="112932" wikidata="Q741611" url="?curid=112932" title="Welton, Iowa">
<text>Welton is a city in Clinton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 121 at the time of the 2020 census.

The community is located adjacent to U.S. Route 61, which bypasses Welton just to the east of the city. Prior to the expansion of Highway 61 to a four-lane highway, it passed directly through the city. Following reconstruction of U.S. 61, a new truck stop was built adjacent to U.S. 61 near the southern edge of the city.

==History==
Welton got its start in the year 1871, following construction of the Davenport and St. Paul Railroad through the territory.

==Education==
Welton is one of the communities in the Central DeWitt Community School District, which spans a large portion of central Clinton County; it was known as the Central Clinton Community School District until July 1, 2014.

For more than 40 years, the district operated Welton Elementary School to serve students in the north-central part of the district, with junior high and high school students being bused to DeWitt. According to the &quot;Quad City Times&quot;, &quot;the 85-year-old school closed in 2005 because of budget constraints and declining enrollment,&quot; and on April 5, 2006 the 85-year-old Welton School building was demolished. Until 1961, the school building also housed junior high and high school students as part of the Welton Independent School District; sports teams were known as the Wolverines. The junior-senior high school was closed in 1961, when Welton, along with the former Grand Mound and DeWitt school districts, consolidated to form the Central Community School District.

Welton Elementary had three buildings. The third floor of the main building had a computer laboratory, a library, and a media center. In addition to the main building, there was an art room and teacher&#x27;s lounge facility, and a modular facility with two classrooms. Welton Elementary had 217 students in the 1998–1999 school year. Grand Mound Elementary students used the library, media and computer facilities at Welton Elementary. The district at one time considered expanding Welton Elementary to upper elementary levels but decided against it since it deemed the building too out of date and architecturally difficult to renovate, citing narrow staircases which would have difficulty accommodating chairlifts and the multi-story design. Welton was not fully accessible to handicapped students.

Circa 2001 there was a bond proposal to expand the elementary schools in DeWitt, which would have centralized services and facilities for the handicapped, and close the schools in Grand Mound and Welton. Welton Elementary closed in the summer of 2005, and was demolished in 2006. A historic newspaper was found inside the cornerstone, and the City of Welton government received the school memorabilia.

==Geography==
Welton is located at (41.912283, -90.601152).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Wheatland is a city in Clinton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 775 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Wheatland was platted in 1858 under the leadership of John Bennett. The town was named for President James Buchanan&#x27;s estate Wheatland in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The entire township (Spring Rock) had a white population of only 101 in 1850, but that number rose to 756 in 1860. A significant body of early settlers all came from the village of Wunderthausen in central Germany. The Germans founded the first church in town in 1857 with a Presbyterian affiliation. This relationship was dissolved in 1861 with the incorporation of St. Paul&#x27;s German Reformed Church (now St. Paul&#x27;s United Church of Christ). The First Presbyterian Church was organized in 1858, though no longer functions. Wheatland was legally incorporated on July 13, 1869.

<text>Adel ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Dallas County, Iowa. It is located along the North Raccoon River. Its population was 6,153 at the time of the 2020 Census.

==History==

Adel is the oldest town within Dallas County. Originally called Penoach, Adel was incorporated in 1847, and changed to its current name in 1849. In 1855, there were about twenty-five houses in Adel and three stores. From that time onward, the city began to grow at a faster rate.

Situated along the river, Adel had a good supply of water-power for a flour mill. It was to be situated on a section of property owned by Noeingerl Cantrel &amp; Co. J. H. Strong of Des Moines, and H. H. Moffatt built the mill in 1856–57 at a cost of $20,000. The dam was constructed with about eight feet of head water. The mill was kept in good repair, able to average from twelve to fifteen bushels per hour, with a capability of thirty per hour, but was destroyed in 1913.

The railroad reached other towns in Dallas County before Adel, and the town was threatened with losing the county seat. Adel business owners backed the Des Moines Western Railroad Company, which was soon renamed as the Des Moines, Adel, and Western. A narrow gauge railroad was built in the 1870s. The line was rebuilt as standard gauge after the Milwaukee Road purchased the line in the 1890s. Passenger service to Adel was discontinued in 1952, and the line was abandoned in 1987. The line has been repurposed into the popular Raccoon River Valley Trail.
The Adel bank was robbed on March 6, 1895. Two men entered in a buggy and shot a teller, who, though wounded, managed to close the vault and turn the tumblers, preventing the thieves from taking off with a substantial amount. Future Governor of Iowa George W. Clarke had a law office on the second floor. As Clarke descended the stairs, a robber fired his gun. However, the weapon misfired, sparing Clarke&#x27;s life.

The Dallas County Courthouse, was completed in 1902 at a cost of about $109,000, is located at the center of downtown Adel.

After incorporation in 1956, Clive has served as a mostly residential suburb of Des Moines, and the city has grown in both land area and population since that time. Most of Clive&#x27;s businesses are along 86th Street, Hickman Road (which forms most of the boundary with Urbandale), and University Avenue (which forms the boundary with West Des Moines).

Clarence Dunn, one of the witnesses, had even made a plaster cast of three-toed footprints it left behind. A smaller, similar being sometimes accompanied it. After a community-led confrontation, the being disappeared after about four days, supposedly into the nearby coal mine.

<text>West Des Moines is a city in Iowa, United States. Most of the city is in Polk County, some of it is in Dallas County, and small portions extend into Warren and Madison Counties.

As of the 2020 census, the city population was 68,723. West Des Moines is the third-most populous city in the Des Moines metropolitan area and the sixth-most populous city in Iowa.

==History==

===Settlement and early history===
The West Des Moines area used to be home to the Sac and Meskwaki peoples. Near the stroke of midnight on October 11, 1845, a gunshot was fired by a cattle farmer, James Cunningham Jordan (1813–1893) to declare that the area was open for Anglo-European settlement. His residence, the Jordan House, has been restored and is now home to the West Des Moines Historical Society. The Jordan House was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and abolitionist John Brown stayed on Jordan property multiple times, at least once while escorting a group of freedom-seeking slaves to Canada. In West Des Moines&#x27; early years, the town was a trading and shipping junction. West Des Moines incorporated as the city of Valley Junction on October 9, 1893.

In its early days, Valley Junction was home to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad&#x27;s switching facilities and repair shops due to its location at the junction of several railroad lines. The Rock Island&#x27;s facilities moved out of Valley Junction and back into Des Moines in 1936.

The speed limit of an hour had existed for all automobiles Valley Junction since 1911. However, 1915 an Englishman named Jack Prince built a one-mile (1.6 km) oval race track, designed to let race cars break that speed limit ten times over. The wooden track was made of of 2x4&#x27;s laid on edge. It was one of 24 such tracks nationwide; it had seating for over 10,000 people. On August 7, 1915, the eyes of the auto world were on Valley Junction in anticipation of the fastest auto race in history. Ralph DePalma, winner of the Indianapolis 500 that year, was one of at least a dozen drivers vying for the $10,000 purse. Before a crowd of 7,000 people, a tire blew, lunging Joe Cooper&#x27;s car over the rail. Cooper was killed and his mechanic was injured. Later while rounding a curb, a wheel of Billy Chandler&#x27;s Duesenberg failed, cartwheeling the car into the infield and fatally injuring his mechanic, Maurice Keeler. Chandler was seriously injured. Smiling Ralph Mulford won the race with DePalma a close 2nd. This baptism by blood left a bad taste in the mouth of the locals, and the track was closed two years later. The wood was salvaged and then used to construct buildings in Valley Junction.

The serious dilemma of school overcrowding was partially addressed in 1916. The bond issue to build a new high school for $50,000 was approved by a two-to-one vote. The similar new grade school issue was defeated soundly. Building commenced and by September of the following year, the doors of the new Valley High School were opened at 8th and Hillside. As a part of the school board policy, only first-class college-educated teachers were hired. By 1919, the rooms of the new high school were filled. A new junior high school was proposed, approved, and completed by the fall of 1923.

The new school was the only bright spot in the otherwise uncertain dreary years of 1922 and 1923. The foundations of the city were shaken by a 22-month-machinist strike at the Rock Island shops. Starting 1922-07-01, 600 workers were idled. The railroad company reacted by bringing replacement workers into town to break the strike. The replacements were mostly Mexican and African-American laborers brought up from Oklahoma by R. C. Hyde, the master mechanic at the shops. For their own protection, they lived in boxcars and tiny houses in an area south of Railroad Avenue and west of the main rail yards. The area was dubbed &quot;Hyde Park&quot; by the strikers. The resulting hardships suffered by the idled workers led the most desperate to choose between breaking the strike or letting their family starve. It was a time which pitted neighbor against neighbor, tearing at the fabric of the community. Two men shot themselves in desperation before the strike ended.

Valley Junction officially become a dry town in 1915. The Des Moines Golf and Country Club left Des Moines in 1923 and moved to White Pole Road auto trail. By the late 1920s, workers of Valley Junction were suffering from the Depression because the railroads were abandoning track there (completed in 1936), and the Keystone Coal Factory closed due to flooding in the tunnels.

===New name===
By 1937, only two trains stopped daily; the sagging business climate needed a boost. Members of the commercial club believed the only way to attract new industries would be to change the name of the city. They thought the name &quot;Valley Junction&quot; conveyed the image of an old-fashioned and backward town to prospective employers and residents. The name of &quot;West Des Moines&quot; would give it the respectability and prestige the town desperately needed. There was a precedent by way of an editorial in the Valley Junction Express in 1905 that suggested dropping &quot;Junction&quot; from the name, but nothing came of it. The opposition feared the change to West Des Moines would cause property owners to be taxed the same as Des Moines. It was also declared as a step toward annexation by Des Moines. A third and final election was held on December 7, 1937.

On January 1, 1938, the name &quot;Valley Junction&quot; was relegated to the past, and the new city of West Des Moines took the first steps to a new identity. Helping to establish this new identity, the most identifiable trait was the suspension of all property taxes between 1936 and 1938. This was due to the profits of the water department. Today the original business district of West Des Moines has been preserved as Historic Valley Junction. It features many locally owned specialty shops and restaurants as well as a weekly farmers&#x27; market.

Though the name was changed, the community&#x27;s commitment to education was bolstered by funds from the Public Works Administration. Despite the Depression, a new elementary school and the Old Valley Football Stadium were built and dedicated on May 24, 1939, at 8th and Hillside. The venerable Lincoln School was razed in 1938 to make way for the new building. Longfellow was retired in 1939 and then sold in 1940 for $1000. In 1955, West Des Moines Elementary School at Walnut and 6th was renamed &quot;Nellie Phenix Elementary&quot; in honor of the former principal. The late 1930s were very good years in the school&#x27;s athletic teams, producing memorable names: True, Gavin, Swink, and Sherbo. Charles Swink was a multi-record holder in track and field. His record at the Drake Relays stood for twenty years.

An overgrown concrete eyesore on Ashworth Road soon became the musical mecca for the surrounding area on June 6, 1939, when Tom Archer opened the Val Air Ballroom. The site was originally the location of the stillborn Wilson Rubber company factory. Intended to bolster World War I tire production, the end of the war in 1918 left only a large concrete slab. Patrons of the Val Air could dance under a canopy of stars to the melodious sounds of Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, and other big bands. The war years brought new vitality to the community without a cost.

Then and now, flooding frequently dampens, but has not broken the residents&#x27; spirits. Unpredictable waters of the Raccoon River and Walnut Creek have often exceeded their banks due to large amounts of rain in the summer and snowmelt in the spring, filling the streets and damaging homes and businesses.

===1950 to the present===
In 1950, West Des Moines had a population of 5,615, but the city grew as many new housing subdivisions were built. West Des Moines annexed the neighboring community of Clover Hills in 1950, the town of Ashawa, a former Rock Island railroad stop, in 1957, and the town of Commerce, along the Raccoon River, in 1960. City government also grew, and when the venerable city hall could not keep up with the city&#x27;s expansion, the city opened a new municipal building in 1954. With the influx of students, the school district&#x27;s ever-expanding borders continually compromised classroom capacity. Children attended school in former homes near Phenix, with classes in hallways and living rooms. Space was even rented from the new Catholic grade school. In 1959 alone, 150–200 new homes were built, adding to the population&#x27;s growth. The construction of Interstate 35, Interstate 80, and Interstate 235 in the 1960s brought more people and businesses to West Des Moines. This construction also caused the Des Moines Golf and Country Club to sell its location along Ashworth Road and 8th Street and then move to its current location in Dallas County. In 1966, Dowling Catholic High School/St. Joseph Educational Center purchased from the Des Moines Golf and Country Club and, subsequently, moved from Des Moines and opened at its current location, 1400 Buffalo Road, in the fall of 1972. Several retail and office complexes opened along the I-235 corridor after the freeway&#x27;s completion, including Valley West Mall, which opened in 1975. West Des Moines&#x27; population jumped from 11,964 in 1960 to 31,702 in 1990.

West Des Moines expanded into Dallas County during the 1990s and 2000s, once again placing the premier golf courses of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club in its city limits and punctuated by the opening of one of the best golf courses in Iowa at the Glen Oaks Country Club along with the West Glen Town Center and the largest in the state of Iowa, Jordan Creek Town Center and shopping mall in 2004. Major commercial construction is underway around the area, including the opening of many additional hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings, including a new Wells Fargo corporate campus. In 2005, West Des Moines annexed land in Warren County for the first time. Seeing the land to the south of Des Moines as extremely valuable, especially with the completion of a major &quot;South-Belt Freeway&quot; system, the cities of Norwalk and West Des Moines are actively competing for land in the northern part of Warren County. From 1990 to 2015, West Des Moines is the fastest growing city in Iowa according to the landmass.

During the 1990s, a new city/school campus opened near the intersection of South 35th Street and Mills Civic Parkway. West Des Moines&#x27; new police station opened in April 1992. This was followed by the opening of a new public library in 1996; the library served as a temporary home for West Des Moines&#x27; city hall until a new building was dedicated in late 2002. The campus also features a new stadium for Valley High School that also opened in 2002. On the same property, the West Des Moines School district operates Valley Southwoods, a freshman high school with over 600 students that opened in 1996. Turning the West Des Moines Community Schools into a two high school district was not acceptable. In 2004, August Hillside Elementary opened on the former site of Hillside Junior High and Old Valley Stadium, which was demolished in 2001. In 2012, Clegg Park Elementary was renovated and opened as the new Walnut Creek Campus which is the district&#x27;s alternative high school. Major renovation and additions were completed at Valley High in 2007 and again in 2015.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. West Des Moines&#x27;s location in the Raccoon River valley has left parts of it, particularly the Valley Junction area, prone to flooding. After the Great Flood of 1993, a floodwall was constructed along Walnut Creek (near the boundary with Des Moines) to protect that area.

===Climate===
West Des Moines has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;).

===Street numbering===
While nearby Clive, Urbandale, and Windsor Heights use the same street numbers for north–south streets that Des Moines uses, West Des Moines has its own street numbering system. Thus, 86th Street in Clive and Urbandale becomes 22nd Street in West Des Moines. Iowa Highway 28, which forms most of the boundary between Des Moines and West Des Moines, is 63rd Street in Des Moines but 1st Street in West Des Moines. Many of the east–west streets share the same name with Des Moines, although the numbering of these east–west streets starts over in West Des Moines.

==Davis County Courthouse==

The Davis County Courthouse was designed by Thomas J. Tolan &amp; Son, Architects, of Fort Wayne Indiana and is situated on the Bloomfield townsquare. In November 1876, the center of the square was cleared of trees and the following June, Larkworthy &amp; Menke, of Quincy, Illinois, was awarded the contract to supply stone. The bell was made by the Meneely &amp; Kimberly Bell Company of Troy, New York. The clock was made by the Seth Thomas Company and still resides within the clock tower. The building was completed in 1879. A chain surrounding the courthouse was added in 1879 and an iron fence, by the Cleveland Wrought Iron Fence Company, was added in 1881.

On August 27, 1924, Henry &quot;Dare-Devil&quot; Roland, &quot;The Human Fly,&quot; attempted to climb the northwest corner of the courthouse. He fell to the ground from about 25 feet, breaking his hip. He was hospitalized in Bloomfield for six weeks, before returning east with his wife and daughter. On June 28, 1932, Roland made a return trip to Bloomfield to remove the blot from his record of successful climbs. This time, in just eleven minutes, he was sitting perched astride the statue of Blind Justice. Roland died October 7, 1937, as a result of a trapeze fall at Ottway, Tennessee.

The Davis County Court House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 3, 1974. The courthouse was photographed by Bob Thall as part of the Bicentennial project commissioned by Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. to document more than 1,100 American courthouses. One of the results of this project was the 1978 book &quot;Court House,&quot; edited by Richard Pare. Thall&#x27;s photo was part of the project&#x27;s traveling exhibition and also appeared in &quot;The New York Times Book Review,&quot; &quot;American Heritage&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines.

The Bloomfield Square Historic District, which surrounds the courthouse, was added to the National Register&#x27;s listings on November 7, 1976.

<text>Garden Grove is a small town in Decatur County, Iowa, United States. The population was 174 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
On April 24, 1846, emigrants affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints under the direction of Brigham Young established a way station halfway into their trek across Iowa. This semi-permanent settlement was named Garden Grove because the entire grove was covered with wild onions as far as the eye could see. Within three weeks of their arrival, the pioneers enclosed and planted . They founded the village to assist those who did not have sufficient means to continue their journey, as well as to support and supply future companies of pioneers.

When Brigham Young and the main company left Garden Grove on May 12, 1846, the poorest and least prepared were left behind. After the Saints arrived in Winter Quarters, Captain James Allen brought orders from President James Polk to enlist a battalion of Mormons for the War with Mexico. Brigham Young and other leaders rode back as far as Mt. Pisgah to encourage the men to enlist, and a letter was sent to the Saints in Garden Grove. Only one man from the Garden Grove settlement, Edward Bunker, enlisted and served in the Mormon Battalion.

In the fall of 1846, when the last of the Mormons were driven out of Nauvoo, Illinois, the exiles camped on the west shore of the Mississippi River. Two rescue parties were sent from Winter Quarters and Council Bluffs, and an additional group was requested from Garden Grove. Luman Shurtliff led the third rescue party and brought the poorest of the exiles to the settlement at Garden Grove.

Through the winter of 1846/47, about 600 Latter-day Saints resided in Garden Grove. By 1852, the Mormon settlers had moved on to Utah, selling the property and improvements to other American frontiersmen. Garden Grove is a site on the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail. A marker just west of the city, overlooking a wooded ravine, marks the site of the former Mormon Cemetery.

Garden Grove was a shipping point on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

A strong EF2 tornado struck the town on March 5, 2022, causing major damage to several structures.

<text>Lamoni is a city in Decatur County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,969 at the time of the 2020 Census. Lamoni is the home of Graceland University, affiliated with the Community of Christ, a denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement. The city was the church&#x27;s headquarters from 1880 to 1920, after which it moved to Independence, Missouri.

The town is host to KNSL, a public radio station which rebroadcasts programming from Iowa Public Radio, National Public Radio, and adult album alternative music to South Central Iowa and North Central Missouri.

==History==
The Lamoni area was first settled in 1834 to 1840 by people who thought they were settling in slave-owning Missouri. It was only after the Sullivan Line separating Missouri and Iowa was formally surveyed when Iowa became a state in 1846 that they realized they were in non-slave-owning Iowa.

In 1851, refugees from the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 sought to settle the area and form the community of New Buda (named for a neighborhood of Budapest). Their efforts did not result in a significant settlement.

In 1870, Joseph Smith III authorized the Order of Enoch to purchase over 3,000 acres (12 km) to form a community of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). Smith lived in Liberty Hall, now a museum.

The city was named after Lamoni, a king mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

Lamoni, just north of the Missouri border, was chosen because of its good farmland and because it is about 100 miles north of Temple Lot, an important location in church teachings. The Mormons were evicted from Temple Lot and Missouri in the 1838 Mormon War.

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, led by Brigham Young, passed through the community in 1846, staying at nearby Garden Grove, Iowa, while en route from Nauvoo, Illinois (where they had settled after being forced to leave Missouri), to the Salt Lake Valley.
Lamoni was formally platted adjacent to newly laid tracks of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1879. By 1900, its population had grown to 1,500.

In 1880, Smith moved to Lamoni (as did the RLDS Church headquarters) from Plano, Illinois.

In 1895, the church founded Graceland University in Lamoni.

After the Smith family moved to Independence to the area near Temple Lot in 1916, Liberty Hall served as a home for the aged, a farmhouse, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, and a private residence before becoming a museum.

Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg, members of the church affiliated with the church-owned General Supply Company, which owned Lamoni mills, hardware and grocery stores, started a grocery store chain called the Supply Store in 1930, which in turn became Hy-Vee (from their two names). Lamoni remained the company&#x27;s headquarters until 1945, when it moved to Chariton, Iowa.

==History==
Center Township was organized as part of the formation of the county on 1 April 1850. Because Decatur City was inaccessible to the rest of the county during the area&#x27;s periodic floods, a majority of the county voted to move the county seat to a nearby location east of the Little River. Because the residents of Decatur City refused to respect the results of the vote, the county records were stolen and moved by ox-drawn wagon under cover of darkness. The new settlement was originally named Independence, but that name was soon discovered to have already been taken by another town in Buchanan County. It was then renamed before the state legislator and veteran W.H. Cheevers successfully argued for renaming it Leon in honor of the Jewish &quot;Fighting Doctor&quot; David Camden de Leon in 1855.

It was formally incorporated as a city in 1858. It was a shipping point on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

At a second meeting, the committee recommended that an association be formed at once under the name of the Leon Board of Trade. The shares of stock were fixed at $5 each, and each member of the board was required to take not less than one share of the stock. The constitution and by-laws were at once circulated for signatures, and within 15 minutes thirty of the business men of the town had signified their intention of becoming members of the board. The Board of Trade existed successfully and helpfully for a number of years.

<text>Burlington is a city in, and the county seat of, Des Moines County, Iowa, United States. The population was 23,982 in the 2020 census, a decline from the 26,839 population in 2000. Burlington is the center of a micropolitan area, which includes West Burlington and Middletown, Iowa, and Gulfport, Illinois. Burlington is the home of Snake Alley, the crookedest street in the world.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the area was neutral territory for the Sac and Fox Native American tribes, who called it Shoquoquon (&quot;Shok-ko-kon&quot;), meaning Flint Hills.

In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson organized two parties of explorers to map the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition followed the Missouri River, while Lt. Zebulon Pike followed the Mississippi River. In 1805, Pike landed at the bluffs below Burlington and raised the United States Flag for the first time on what would become Iowa soil and recommended construction of a fort. The recommendation went unheeded.
The American Fur Company of John Jacob Astor established a post in the area in 1829. Settlement began in 1833, shortly after the Black Hawk Purchase, when Samuel (aka Simpson) White, Amzi Doolitle, and Morton M. McCarver crossed the Mississippi River from Big Island and staked claims there. According to an account A.T. Andreas wrote in 1875, White erected a cabin in the area, later platted to be Front Street between Court and High streets. Andreas called White and Doolittle the Romulus and Remus of their settlement, referring to the mythic heroes who founded Rome, a city surrounded by hills. A few weeks later, William R. Ross joined them and established a general store. In November and December, he surveyed the settlement for White and Doolittle.

In the spring of 1834 they allowed John Gray, who purchased the first lot with his wife Eliza Jane, to rename the town for $50. Gray chose to name it Burlington in honor of his hometown in Vermont. The Grays&#x27; daughter Abigail was born in Burlington that same year, the first European-descended American settler child born on Iowa soil.

In 1837, Burlington was designated the second territorial capital of the Wisconsin Territory. The Iowa Territory was organized in the following year, and Burlington was named as its first territorial capital. The government used &quot;Old Zion&quot;, the first Methodist Church in Iowa (located near what is now Third and Washington streets), to conduct its business. A historical marker commemorates the site of the church and early territorial government.

On May 22, 1849, Maj. William Williams visited Burlington, writing a brief description in his journal:


In April 1885, economist Henry George gave a speech titled &quot;The Crime of Poverty&quot; at the Burlington Knights of Labor local advocating for a citizen&#x27;s dividend paid for by a land value tax.

Iowa&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Hawkeye State&quot;, has its roots in Burlington. At Judge David Rorer&#x27;s suggestion, publisher James G. Edwards changed &quot;The Iowa Patriot&quot; newspaper&#x27;s name to &quot;The Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot&quot; in tribute to his friend, Chief Black Hawk. Rorer is said to have found the name in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; but Edwards proposed the nickname to &quot;...rescue from oblivion a momento , at least of the name of the old chief.&quot;

Burlington was a bustling river port in the steamboat era and a central city to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The &quot;Burlington Route&quot; (1848–1970) merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad (1970–1996), which in turn merged into the BNSF Railway (1997–present). The &quot;Burlington&quot; name has been given to one of the United States&#x27; largest railroads. One of BNSF&#x27;s main east-west lines, the Ottumwa subdivision, still crosses the Mississippi at Burlington.

In 1970, the community had its highest ever population.
In the late twentieth century, retail expanded with suburbanization of the population. After purchasing Benner Tea, Aldi opened its first store in the United States at Burlington in 1976. Westland Mall opened in nearby West Burlington in 1977.

== Economy ==
Burlington&#x27;s roots are in transportation and manufacturing. Manufacturing plants are among the largest employers in the area, including companies such as American Ordnance LLC, Case Corporation, ABB (formerly General Electric), Champion Spark Plugs, Shearer&#x27;s Foods and Winegard Company. The largest employer in the area is the Great River Medical Center. Among the oldest businesses in Burlington, the Murray factory (now Murray Turbomachinery and owned by Dresser-Rand) which has been in operation in Burlington since before 1900, the original building on Central St. and Washington St. which was divided by the local train tracks, was recently razed. Another long-lived business is Case Corporation, which has been at its current location on Des Moines Avenue, approximately a quarter-mile from the Mississippi River, since 1937. The first backhoes rolled off the assembly line at the Burlington plant in 1957, which is now the only plant in the United States that produces the Case Loader/Backhoe, giving Burlington the nickname &quot;Backhoe Capital of the World&quot;. Case is now a division of the Italian holding group CNH Industrial. Employment at Case peaked in the 1980s, according to the Des Moines Register, then declined after &quot;Case initiated a wave of buyouts and early retirements in the 1990s and early 2000s, and ended the contract with the union in 2004&quot;; but in May 2010, the &quot;Register&quot; reports, Case announced that &quot;it will open a new line that builds corn-picker heads for combines, as early as [Spring, 2012]&quot; and that by mid-2013 it will add more than 200 positions.

Over the last several years, several businesses have either left the area or relocated elsewhere. These businesses include Exide, makers of vehicle batteries, CAT, Case Corporation&#x27;s closest competitor in American made construction equipment, and Lehigh-Leopold, makers of office furniture. This has left some former manufacturing plants around the city empty, but other businesses have moved into them; PPG, maker of auto safety glass has moved into the former CAT plant, and a warehouse has moved into the former Leopold building. In March 2012, the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; reported that &quot;Unemployment here is 7.6 percent, compared with the 5.4 percent state average&quot;.

In 2022 Ben Jacobs of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that the area&#x27;s economy had more problems related to late 20th century globalization compared to that of Dubuque, Iowa.

=== Downtown Burlington ===

The downtown area holds a number of buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, among them the Burlington Apartments (listed as the Hotel Burlington), the Burlington Railroad Depot, the Des Moines County Courthouse, the Burlington Fire Department central station, the Port of Burlington building, Memorial Auditorium, River Park Place (as Burlington Mercy Hospital), the former Burlington Police Department building. It is perhaps best known for Snake Alley, the most crooked street in the US. (as Burlington Paper Company), The Capitol Theater, First Congregational Church, St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church and several others. The downtown skyline is noted for its several church spires.

== Sports ==
Burlington is the home of the Burlington Bees baseball team, a member of the Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league. They were previously members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Class A Midwest League until Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season. The Bees play at Community Field, which underwent extensive renovation in 2005.

Burlington hosts the Snake Alley Criterium, one of the most physically challenging races in the Midwest. The annual event is held on a 15-block course, with differences in elevation from 555 feet to 678 feet. The course is entirely on city streets, mostly in the downtown commercial area. A one-block-long climb is on the historic brick street named Snake Alley. The 276-foot-long Snake Alley has five switchbacks in a 60-foot climb. The average grade is 12.5 percent in that one block.

Burlington has been the finishing point for RAGBRAI twice. the annual bicycle ride that starts at the Missouri River in western Iowa and ends in eastern Iowa at the Mississippi River.

Burlington is also the home of the Burlington High School and Notre Dame High School sports teams. Also in the Burlington area are the sports teams of Southeastern Community College, which have had a successful history, including three men&#x27;s basketball national championships.

Many people living in the area support athletic teams from Saint Louis, Missouri, differing from other parts of Iowa, which support other sports teams.

== Education ==
Burlington is served by the Burlington Community School District, which consists of five elementary schools, one intermediate school, one middle school, one high school and one alternative high school. Private education is also available for kindergarten through 12th grade at Notre Dame Catholic School and Great River Christian School (GRCS).

In 1833 the first school facility for Burlington opened in a log cabin. School District No. 2 of the Township of Burlington was established on March 29, 1849.

The Burlington School District has five elementary schools: North Hill, Sunnyside, Grimes, Corse and Black Hawk. All are new buildings or have been recently completely rehabilitated, the newest, North Hill Elementary, received its first students in 2009, there are no elementary school buildings within the school district that are over 40 years old. The district has two middle schools: Edward Stone and Aldo Leopold. Beginning with the 2010–11 school year, students who had attended Oak Street Middle School (an aging building that was completed around 1907) began attending Aldo Leopold (named in honor of ecologist, and environmentalist, Aldo Leopold, a former resident of Burlington, and author of &quot;&quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;), the new school building is located near the corner of Sunnyside Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue. Edward Stone, which opened at the start of the 2012–13 school year, is located near the corner of Lawrence Drive and Mason Road. The middle school was named in honor of former JPL head, and Burlington educated Dr. Edward Stone. This building replaced the James Madison Middle School building, which has only been in the system since the mid-1960s. These two new middle schools were built to accommodate more students after a third building, Horace Mann, was gutted by fire in 2005.

Burlington Community High School was constructed in 1968, and occupied the following year, with the first graduating class in June 1970. Prior to that, the high school students were educated at the former Apollo High School building located near the downtown business district; the building is still standing and for a time served as Burlington Alternative High School, but has been unoccupied since 1996. Notre Dame High School and Elementary schools occupy a building near the Burlington high school. Great River Christian Schools occupies the old Prospect Hill Elementary School building, 426 Harrison St. A third middle school building once existed on the edge of Perkins Park, named Horace Mann, that building was gutted by fire in 2005, and later razed. The school district offices are located near the corner of West Avenue, and White Street, in a large mansion once owned by Railroad tycoon Charles Elliott Perkins, and is nicknamed &quot;The White House&quot;&quot;, due to the whitewashed facade. The original High School building (which now serves as the School District Maintenance shops) is noted as being the first high school built west of the Mississippi River.

Burlington is also served by Southeastern Community College.

; TV
Burlington previously had a local TV station, KJMH. It signed on August 2, 1984, from a tower on Winegard Drive. It also had studios in Burlington. Initially an independent station, it became a charter FOX affiliate in 1986, but suffered from duplication from KLJB in the Quad Cities. In 1996, the station became a full-time satellite of KLJB, marking the end of local broadcast TV in Burlington. Today, those in the Burlington-Oquawka area receive local over-the-air programming from stations in the Quad Cities (the city&#x27;s main television market), Quincy, and Ottumwa, including the stations listed below.

The town is served by U.S. Route 34, which is the freeway that bisects the city, and U.S. Route 61. Iowa Highways 99 and 406 served the town before they were decommissioned in 2003. The two still exist as county roads.

===Transit===
Burlington Urban Service (B.U.S.) is a transportation system owned and operated by the City of Burlington.

Burlington Trailways provides daily intercity bus service from its West Burlington hub.

===Rail service===
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Burlington, operating its &quot;California Zephyr&quot; daily in both directions between Chicago, Illinois, and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. The older Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Passenger Station exists nearby and is also listed on the NRHP.

<text>Mediapolis is a city in Des Moines County, Iowa, United States. Its population was 1,688 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Burlington, IA–IL Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Mediapolis was founded in the year 1869. It was first a train station for the city of Kossuth, Iowa at a point on the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railway (later part of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific) between Burlington and Wapello. &quot;Media,&quot; meaning &quot;middle,&quot; was appended to &quot;polis,&quot; meaning &quot;village,&quot; as Mediapolis is halfway between Wapello and Burlington.

From 1875 to the mid 20th century, Mediapolis was a railroad junction where the Burlington and Northwestern Railway to Washington (later a branch of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy) met the original north–south line.

The Rock Island Railroad ceased operation in 1980, leading to the abandonment of the north–south line through Mediapolis. One heavy industry remains two miles southwest of town, the United States Gypsum Sperry mine. This is a shaft mine 620 feet deep, opened in 1961 and employing approximately 200 people as of 2010. Of these, only 25 to 50 actually work in the mine. Underground, the mine extends 1.5 miles west and 1.75 miles south of the shaft. This is a room and pillar mine with 37-foot pillars separating roads 37 feet wide on a square grid.

On August 10, 1998, former NFL running back Tony Baker was killed on U.S. Route 61, just south of Mediapolis.

==Arts and culture==

===Arnolds Park Amusement Park===

Arnolds Park is in the center of the Iowa Great Lakes resort region. It is home to a historic amusement park, also called Arnolds Park, which features Legend, An ACE Coaster Landmark. Legend, which carried its first riders in 1927, is believed to be the 13th oldest wooden roller coaster in the U.S. In 2012 the amusement park was selected as one of the fifteen best in the Midwest region by &quot;Midwest Living&quot; magazine.

===Other landmarks===
Other major landmarks of the city include the Central Emporium shopping mall and the Iowa Great Lakes Maritime Museum and the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame.

Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll has a storied history in the area. The old Roof Garden Ballroom in Arnolds Park, on West Lake Okoboji, for example, once attracted the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, the Everly Brothers, the Guess Who and even country music legend, Johnny Cash, according to The Daily Globe, a Worthington, Minnesota-based newspaper. The Coney Island-style dance hall was housed on the second floor of a two-story wooden structure (the first floor housed a gift shop and a funhouse, the latter extending into an adjoining structure). The original Roof Garden / Funhouse / theater was razed in 1987, during a transition of ownership.

One musician who played The Roof Garden said BJ Thomas, during a pre-show rehearsal, tossed sheet music in Burt Bacharach&#x27;s own handwriting to the band so they could rehearse, &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.&quot; &quot;Musical magic seemed to happen all the time in Arnolds Park&quot;, says one article. A new Roof Garden debuted in 2019 near its original location in the amusement park and closely resembles the iconic original, including the name in letters large enough to be seen across the lake.

Located in Arnolds Park is the Abbie Gardner Sharp Cabin Museum, a site of the 1857 &quot;Spirit Lake Massacre&quot;, a violent conflict between European settlers and Native Americans. Next to the cabin is the small Pillsbury Point State Park.

==Education==
The community is served by the Okoboji Community School District. The district was established on July 1, 1988, by the merger of the Arnolds Park and Milford school districts. Okoboji High School in Milford is the local high school.

<text>Milford is a city in Dickinson County, Iowa, United States. The population was 3,321 at the time of the 2020 census. The town includes many businesses related to its location in the Iowa Great Lakes region and is often referred to as the southern gateway to the Iowa Great Lakes.

== History ==

The Iowa Great Lakes Area was settled in the 1850s. It attracted many colonists because of the rich black soil, water from the lakes, and an abundance of wild game and fish. As the population increased at these times, there was a need for a good flouring mill because the nearest mills were those in Mankato, Minnesota and Fort Dodge, Iowa. In 1861, there was an attempt to build one on Mill Creek, at the outlet of the Great Lakes but the attempt was abandoned after the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862 and the extremely low water level that year. In 1868 one was successfully built, and sawmill was built and put into operation in 1869. The mills began to attract many customers, and the small community began to grow around Old Town. In 1870, the company that operated the mill bought a section of land northwest of Old Town and laid out a plan for the town of Milford.

On March 14, 1892, the first Town Council meeting was held. Some buildings were moved from Old Town to New Town and many more businesses and residences were constructed. In 1921, the U.S. flag was flown at the new city hall for the first time and that year a vote approved to pave Okoboji Avenue (Main Street of Milford). The Milwaukee rail line which ran through Milford supplied the town with mail, groceries, clothing, lumber, coal, and machinery before automobiles could get to the Great Lakes. Two passenger trains made daily trips from Des Moines to Spirit Lake, as well as another from Spencer. Until 1910, excursion trains came to the Lakes Area from Des Moines, Algona, and other towns on weekends and holidays. The last passenger train left Milford for Spencer in 1951. The last freight train left Milford for Spencer in 1976. The tracks were dismantled in 1978 and later became a part of the Iowa Great Lakes Recreational Trail.

==Geography==
Milford is located at (43.327006, -95.150701).

<text>Asbury is a city in Dubuque County, Iowa, United States, and adjacent to the westside of the city of Dubuque. It is part of the Dubuque, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,943 at the 2020 census. Asbury is the second-largest city in Dubuque County, surpassing Dyersville to become the second-largest in the 2010 U.S. Census count. The city is largely a bedroom community, made up of subdivisions whose residents work in Dubuque or Peosta.

==History==
Asbury was settled beginning in the 1830s, at first by Methodists. The city is named after British-born Bishop Francis Asbury, one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. The city was incorporated in 1933, following the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, which ended prohibition. The city incorporated to gain the legal standing necessary to sell alcohol, as liquor licenses were still forbidden in rural areas.

For most of its history, Asbury was very small, much like hundreds of other towns in rural Iowa. In the 1960 census, Asbury still had only 71 residents. During this time, the City of Dubuque grew immensely, and the sprawl reached the Asbury area beginning in the 1960s. By 1970, Asbury had 410 residents and had grown fast enough to become the fastest growing city in the state of Iowa.

==Law and government==
Asbury has a mayor–council form of government, employing a full-time city administrator, and part-time city council (mayor and 5 at-large city council members). The city administrator is Beth Bonz, the current mayor is Jim Adams, and the council members are: Bob Reisch, Craig Miller, John Richey, Curt Kiessling and Larry Nagle. The city council meets at 7 P.M. on the second and fourth Tuesdays of every month at Asbury City Hall.

The city council works on the advice of a number of citizen committees, including the following: Building Code Commission, Park &amp; Recreation Board, Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the Water Board. In addition, Asbury sends commissioners to the Eastern Iowa Housing Authority.

Asbury has 3 city departments: Public Safety (police &amp; fire), Public Works, and Parks.

In the Iowa General Assembly, Asbury is represented by Senator Carrie Koelker (Republican), and Representative Shannon Lundgren (Republican) in the Iowa House of Representatives. At the federal level, it is within Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Ashley Hinson (R) in the U.S. House of Representatives. Asbury, and all of Iowa, are represented by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R) and Joni Ernst (R).

At the federal level, it is within Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Ashley Hinson (R) in the U.S. House of Representatives. Cascade, and all of Iowa, are represented by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R) and Joni Ernst (R).

==Education==

All public school students living in Cascade are zoned to schools in the Western Dubuque Community School District. Students first attend Cascade Elementary School for grades K-5, then the consolidated Cascade Junior-Senior High School for grades 6-12 (both in Cascade).

The Cascade Elementary building, on Highway 151, has a capacity of 420 students, and houses them in 14 general classrooms and two special education classrooms. In 1961, the school was constructed. In 1993 and 2002, it received additional space. In 2017, it had 282 students.

Cascade has a private school. Parochial school students attend Aquin Elementary School (in Cascade) for grades K-8, then Beckman High School (in Dyersville) for grades 9-12. These schools are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, and are a part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque.

<doc id="113010" wikidata="Q960876" url="?curid=113010" title="Maxtor">
<text>Maxtor Corporation was an American computer hard disk drive manufacturer. Founded in 1982, it was the third largest hard disk drive manufacturer in the world before being purchased by Seagate in 2006.

Maxtor is a portmanteau of maximum and storage.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
In 1981, three former IBM employees began searching for funding, and Maxtor was founded the following year. In 1983, Maxtor shipped its first product, the Maxtor XT-1140. In 1985, Maxtor filed its initial public offering and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange as &quot;MXO.&quot; Maxtor bought hard drive manufacturer MiniScribe in 1990. Maxtor was getting close to bankruptcy in 1992 and closed its engineering operations in San Jose, California, in 1993. In 1996, Maxtor introduced its DiamondMax line of hard drives with DSP-based architecture. In 2000, Maxtor acquired Quantum&#x27;s hard drive division, which gave Maxtor the ATA/133 hard drive interface and helped Maxtor revive its server hard drive market. In 2006, Maxtor was acquired by Seagate.

=== Early financing ===
The Maxtor founders, James McCoy, Jack Swartz, and Raymond Niedzwiecki—graduates of the San Jose State University School of Engineering and former employees of IBM—began the search for funding in 1981. In early 1982, B.J. Cassin and Chuck Hazel (Bay Partners) provided the initial $3 million funding and the company officially began operations on July 1, 1982. In February 1983, it shipped its first product to Convergent Technology and immediately received an additional $5.5 million in its second round of funding. The company also began negotiations with the EDB (Economic Development Board) of Singapore for favorable terms before committing to Singapore as its offshore manufacturing location. The DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) agreed to provide financing to help grow the company in Singapore. In 1983, the company established a liaison and procurement office in Tokyo, headed by Tatsuya Yamamoto.

Maxtor&#x27;s product architecture used eight disks; 15 surfaces recorded data and the final surface was where the servo track information was located. The company developed its own spindle motor, which was fitted within the casting containing the disks. This was a major departure as the spindle motor was usually mounted external to the disks. The first product was designed to provide 190 MB of storage, but delays in getting magnetic heads to the Maxtor design resulted in the company taking what was available, and the first drive—the XT-1140—was shipped with a capacity of only 140 MB. The company received an additional round of financing of approximately $37 million in 1984 before going public in 1986, with Goldman Sachs as the prime underwriter.

=== Expansion ===
In December 1986, Maxtor acquired U.S. Design Corporation, a loss-making manufacturer of data storage subsystems for microcomputers, for $16.1 million in a stock swap. The acquisition was finalized in January 1987. In June 1987, Maxtor purchased Storage Dimensions, a maker of high-performance, high-capacity HDD subsystems for the IBM PC (which chiefly made use of Maxtor&#x27;s own drives), for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition was a success story for Maxtor, and the subsidiary had grown to generate $80 million in sales by 1992. That year, Maxtor sold off Storage Dimensions to private investors.

In 1990, Maxtor entered the mass market with its purchase of the assets (but not the liabilities) of bankrupt MiniScribe in Longmont, Colorado. The transition was a tough one as the early products of this union (notably the 7120AT 3.5-inch 120 MB drive) had many quality and design problems. Later products managed to sell well despite the initial problems. In 1996, the company completely redesigned its hard drive product line by introducing its DiamondMax series with a Texas Instruments digital signal processor.

=== Financial troubles ===
After nine years of development, the original XT-series of drives had achieved a capacity of 1 GB. Maxtor sold the rights to the series to Sequel of Santa Clara, California in the mid-1990s, and the company exited the server drive market. Sequel, a spin-off of Unisys, was not a disk drive manufacturer; rather, they specialized in refurbishing drives for the existing customer base. Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in 1992, Maxtor&#x27;s exit from the high-capacity 5.25-inch SCSI market temporarily left a product void in the industry. Around this time, SCSI versions of the 7000 series drives were also discontinued, and all engineering operations in San Jose were shut down in late 1993, leaving only the former MiniScribe design engineering staff. After turnover in the executive staff, Maxtor decided it had made a mistake, and when Maxtor moved its headquarters to Milpitas, California, it gradually began to rebuild its engineering staff.

=== Acquisition of the Quantum hard drive division ===
In late 2000, Maxtor acquired the hard drive business of Quantum. The merger, which was completed on April 1, 2001, made Maxtor larger than its rivals, notably Seagate, and returned it to the server hard drive market and also implemented the ATA/133 interface into its hard drives.

=== Focus on external drives ===
Like many other hard drive manufacturers, Maxtor had been expanding in recent years into the external hard drive market. Its &quot;Maxtor One-Touch II&quot; external hard drive was marketed as convenient storage for the home user. Maxtor entered and became dominant in consumer business as result of a marketing strategy for the OneTouch line. The OneTouch is a high-capacity (500 GB to 1 TB) USB drive with a single-press button to back up and mirror the computer&#x27;s hard drive. The line became the best-selling consumer device in the computer segment with several million devices distributed globally.

Maxtor had initially made efforts to get into the 2.5-inch hard drive market, but in the beginning of 2005, new management made the surprising decision to discontinue development in this field. This was considered by many industry watchers to be a particularly peculiar move, since the market for such hard drives (mainly notebook computers and MP3 players) was already experiencing rapid growth, with no signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future.

=== Acquisition by Seagate ===
In a deal worth nearly US$2 billion, Maxtor was acquired by its rival Seagate in 2006. The Maxtor brand was revived by Seagate in later 2016.

<doc id="113012" wikidata="Q220898" url="?curid=113012" title="Original video animation">
<text>, abbreviated as OVA and sometimes as OAV (original animation video), are Japanese animated films and special episodes of a series made specially for release in home video formats without prior showings on television or in theaters, though the first part of an OVA series may be broadcast for promotional purposes. OVA titles were originally made available on VHS, later becoming more popular on LaserDisc and eventually DVD. Starting in 2008, the term OAD (original animation DVD) began to refer to DVD releases published bundled with their source-material manga.

==Format==
Like anime made for television broadcast, OVAs are divided into episodes. OVA media (tapes, laserdiscs or DVDs) usually contain just one episode each. Episode length varies from title to title: each episode may run from a few minutes to two hours or more. An episode length of 30 minutes is common, but no standard length exists. An OVA series can run anywhere from a single episode to dozens of episodes in length.

Many anime series first appeared as OVAs, and later grow to become television series or movies. Producers sometimes make other OVA releases as sequels, side stories, music-video collections, or bonus episodes that continue existing as television series or films.

Much OVA-production aims at an audience of male anime enthusiasts. Bandai Visual said in a 2004 news release (for their new OVAs aimed at women) that about 50% of the customers who had bought their anime DVDs in the past fell into the category of 25 to 40-year-old men, with only 13% of purchasers women, even with all ages included. (However, these statistics cover Bandai Visual anime DVDs in general.) Nikkei Business Publications also said in a news-release that mainly 25 to 40-year-old adults bought anime DVDs. Few OVAs target female audiences.

Some OVAs based on television series (and especially those based on manga) may provide closure to the plot – closure not present in the original series.

==History==
OVAs originated during the early 1980s. As the VCR became a fixture in Japanese homes, the anime industry grew. Demand for anime became massive, so much so that consumers would go to video stores to buy new animation outright. While people in the United States used the phrase &quot;direct-to-video&quot; as a pejorative for works that could not make it onto television or movie screens, in Japan direct-to-video became a necessity.

The earliest known attempt to release an OVA was &quot;The Green Cat&quot; in 1983, although it cannot count as the first OVA: there is no evidence that the VHS tape became available immediately and the series remained incomplete. The first OVA to be billed as such was 1983&#x27;s &quot;Dallos&quot;, released by Bandai. Other companies were quick to pick up on the idea, and the mid-to-late 1980s saw the market flooded with OVAs. During this time, most OVA series were new, stand-alone titles.

During Japan&#x27;s economic bubble, production companies were more than willing to spontaneously decide to make a one- or two-part OVA in the 1980s. They paid money to anime studios, who then haphazardly created an OVA to be released to rental shops. Judging from sales, should a longer series be deemed feasible, TV networks paid for most of the production costs of the entire series.

As the Japanese economy worsened in the 1990s, the flood of new OVA titles diminished to a trickle. Production of OVAs continued, but in smaller numbers. Many anime TV series ran 13 episodes rather than the traditional 26-episodes per season. Studios often designed new titles to be released to TV if they approached these lengths. In addition, the rising popularity of cable and satellite TV networks (with their typically less strict censorship) allowed the public to see direct broadcasts of many new titles. Therefore, many violent and risque series became regular TV series, when previously those titles would have been OVAs. During this time, most OVA content was limited to that related to existing and established titles.

In 2000 and later, a new OVA trend began. Producers released many TV series without normal broadcasts of all of the episodes—but releasing some episodes on the DVD release of the series.

<text>Stand and Deliver is a 1988 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Ramón Menéndez, written by Menéndez and Tom Musca, based on the true story of a high school mathematics teacher, Jaime Escalante. For portraying Escalante, Edward James Olmos was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 61st Academy Awards. The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature in 1988. The film&#x27;s title refers to the 1987 Mr. Mister song of the same name, which is also featured in the film&#x27;s ending credits.

In 2011, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

In the early 1980s, Jaime Escalante becomes a mathematics teacher at James A. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. The school is full of Latino students from working-class families whose academic achievement is far below their grade level. Two students, Angel and another gangster, arrive late and question Escalante&#x27;s authority. Escalante demonstrates how to multiply numbers using one&#x27;s fingers and appeals to the students&#x27; sense of humor. After class, some gangsters threaten Escalante. After school, he stops the gangsters from fighting. He then introduces himself as a &quot;one-man gang&quot; with the classroom as his domain. Escalante tells the students that he has decided to teach them algebra.

At a meeting, Escalante learns that the school&#x27;s accreditation is under threat, as test scores are not high enough. Escalante says that students will rise to the level that is expected of them. Escalante gives the students a quiz every morning and a new student joins the class. He instructs his class under the philosophy of &quot;ganas&quot;, roughly translating to &quot;desire&quot;.

Escalante tells other faculty that he wants to teach the students calculus. He seeks to change the school culture to help the students excel in academics, as he has seen the untapped potential of his class. Other teachers ridicule him, as the students have not taken the prerequisites. Escalante states that the students can take the prerequisites over the summer. He sets a goal of having the students take Advanced Placement Calculus by their senior year.

The students sign up for the prerequisites over the summer. There is no air conditioning, but Escalante is able to teach the class, giving them oranges and telling them to focus so they can get good jobs and take vacations. In the fall, he gives the students contracts to be signed by the parents; they must come in on Saturdays, show up an hour early to school, and stay until 5pm in order to prepare for the AP Calculus exam.

Two weeks before the students&#x27; calculus exam, Escalante is teaching an ESL class to some adults. He suddenly clutches at his torso in pain, stumbles into the hallway, and falls. A substitute teacher is found for the students while Escalante recovers in the hospital, but the substitute teacher is a music teacher. Soon after, Escalante escapes from the hospital and shows up at school to continue teaching. After taking the AP calculus exam, the students head to the beach and celebrate. All 18 students who took the exam pass it. At a meeting to congratulate the students, a plaque of appreciation is presented to Escalante.

To the dismay of both Escalante and the students, the Educational Testing Service questions the students&#x27; exam scores. Escalante finds an anonymous letter of resignation in his school mail and has to walk home that evening, as his car has been stolen from the school parking lot. Dismayed, he confides in his wife that he regrets having taught the students calculus, because they did well but nothing changed for them. Fabiola reassures him stating that his students appreciate his efforts regardless; this is confirmed when some of them show up at his house with a surprise: they have fixed up his car as a way to thank him. Escalante meets with the investigators from Educational Testing Service, argues with them, but ultimately offers to have the students retake the test. Despite having only one day to prepare, all the students pass, and Escalante demands that the original scores be reinstated.

The film ends with captions indicating that in the summer of 1982 Escalante&#x27;s entire class was able to pass AP Calculus and in subsequent years, his program became even more successful.

== Historical accuracy ==
The film accurately portrays that students had to retake the AP exam, and that all who retook it passed.

The movie gives the impression that the incident occurred in the second year Escalante was teaching, after students from his first year took a summer session for the calculus prerequisites. In fact, Escalante first began teaching at Garfield High School in 1974 and taught his first Advanced Placement Calculus course in 1978 with a group of 14 students, and it was in 1982 that the exam incident occurred. In the first year (1978), only five students remained in the course at the end of the year, only two of whom passed the AP Calculus exam. Writing in &quot;Reason&quot;, Jerry Jesness stated, &quot;Unlike the students in the movie, the real Garfield students required years of solid preparation before they could take calculus. So Escalante established a program at East Los Angeles College where students could take those classes in intensive seven-week summer sessions. Escalante and [principal Henry] Gradillas were also instrumental in getting the feeder schools to offer algebra in the eighth and ninth grades.&quot; In 1987, 27 percent of all Mexican Americans who scored three or higher on the AP Calculus exam were students at Garfield High.

Escalante himself described the film as &quot;90 percent truth, 10 percent drama&quot;. He said that several points were left out of the film. He pointed out that no student who did not know multiplication tables or fractions was ever taught calculus in a single year. Also, he suffered inflammation of the gall bladder, not a heart attack.

Ten of the 1982 students signed waivers to allow the College Board to show their exams to Jay Mathews, the author of &quot;Escalante: The Best Teacher in America&quot;. Mathews found that nine of them had made &quot;identical silly mistakes&quot; on free response question six. Mathews heard from two of the students that during the exam, a piece of paper had been passed around with that flawed solution. Twelve students, including the nine with the identical mistakes, retook the exam, and most of them received the top scores of four and five. Mathews concluded that nine of the students did cheat, but they knew the material and did not need to.

Mathews wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the Ana Delgado character &quot;was the only teenage character in the film based on a real person&quot; and that her name had been changed.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the movie holds a score of 89% from 63 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; pulls off the unlikely feat of making math class the stuff of underdog drama – and pays rousing tribute to a real-life inspirational figure in the bargain.&quot; Metacritic has given the film a score of 77 out of 100 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Legacy==
In December 2011, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The Registry said the film was &quot;one of the most popular of a new wave of narrative feature films produced in the 1980s by Latino filmmakers&quot; and that it &quot;celebrates in a direct, approachable, and impactful way, values of self-betterment through hard work and power through knowledge.&quot;

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute as #86 on its 2006 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers list.

In 2013, Rand Paul was accused of - and subsequently admitted to - plagiarizing the Wikipedia page of the movie in one of his speeches.

In 2016, the United States Postal Service issued a 1st Class Forever &quot;Jaime Escalante&quot; stamp to honor &quot;the East Los Angeles teacher whose inspirational methods led supposedly &#x27;unteachable&#x27; high school students to master calculus.&quot;

<text>Autodesk Maya, commonly shortened to just Maya (; ), is a 3D computer graphics application that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, originally developed by Alias and currently owned and developed by Autodesk. It is used to create assets for interactive 3D applications (including video games), animated films, TV series, and visual effects.

==History==
Maya was originally an animation product based on codebase from The Advanced Visualizer by Wavefront Technologies, Thomson Digital Image (TDI) Explore, PowerAnimator by Alias, and &quot;Alias Sketch!&quot;. The IRIX-based projects were combined and animation features were added; the project codename was Maya. Walt Disney Feature Animation collaborated closely with Maya&#x27;s development during its production of &quot;Dinosaur&quot;. Disney requested that the user interface of the application be customizable to allow for a personalized workflow. This was a particular influence in the open architecture of Maya, and partly responsible for its popularity in the animation industry.

After Silicon Graphics Inc. had acquired both Alias and Wavefront Technologies, Inc. in 1995, Wavefront&#x27;s technology (then under development) was merged into Maya. SGI&#x27;s acquisition was a response to Microsoft Corporation acquiring Softimage 3D in 1994. The new wholly-owned subsidiary was named &quot;Aliasformula_1Wavefront&quot;.

In the early days of development Maya started with Tcl as the scripting language, in order to leverage its similarity to a Unix shell script language, but after the merger with Wavefront it was replaced with Maya Embedded Language (MEL). Sophia, the scripting language in Wavefront&#x27;s Dynamation, was chosen as the basis of MEL.

Maya 1.0 was released in February 1998. Following a series of acquisitions, Maya was bought by Autodesk in October 2005. Under the name of the new parent company, Maya was renamed Autodesk Maya. However, the name &quot;Maya&quot; continues to be the dominant name used for the product.

== Release history ==
==Overview==
Maya is an application used to generate 3D assets for use in the film, television, video game, and advertising industries. The software was initially released for the IRIX operating system. However, this support was discontinued in August 2005 after the release of version 6.5. Maya was available in both &quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Unlimited&quot; editions until August 2008, when it was turned into a single suite.

Users define a virtual workspace (&quot;scene&quot;) to implement and edit media of a particular project. Scenes can be saved in a variety of formats, the default being &quot;.mb&quot; (Maya Binary). Maya exposes a node graph architecture. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. As a result, the visual representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of interconnecting nodes, depending on each other&#x27;s information. For the convenience of viewing these networks, there is a dependency and a directed acyclic graph.

Assets created with Maya can be imported to game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity.

==Industry usage==
The widespread use of Maya in the film industry is usually associated with its development on the film &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, released by Disney and The Secret Lab on May 19, 2000. In 2003, when Alias|Wavefront received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement, it was noted to be used in films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ice Age&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, all of which were released in 2002. By 2015, VentureBeat Magazine stated that all ten films in consideration for the Best Visual Effects Academy Award had used Autodesk Maya and that it had been &quot;used on every winning film since 1997.&quot; The film studio Illumination Studios Paris uses Autodesk Maya for their animated films. Walt Disney Animation Studios also utilizes the software for character rigging and animation, being used in their films such as Frozen II.

==Awards==
On March 1, 2003, Alias was given an Academy Award for Technical Achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for scientific and technical achievement for their development of Maya software.

In 2005, while working for Alias|Wavefront, Jos Stam shared an Academy Award for Technical Achievement with Edwin Catmull and Tony DeRose for their invention and application of subdivision surfaces.

On February 8, 2008, Duncan Brinsmead, Jos Stam, Julia Pakalns and Martin Werner received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the design and implementation of the Maya Fluid Effects system.

<text>Alias Systems Corporation (formerly Alias Research, Alias|Wavefront), headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was a software company that produced high-end 3D graphics software. Alias was eventually bought by Autodesk.

== History ==
Alias Systems Corporation was founded by Stephen Bingham, Nigel McGrath, Susan McKenna, and David Springer in 1983. The company was initially funded by a $61,000 grant from the National Research Council, scientific research tax credits, and the founders personal funds.

In 1984, while sitting in a Detroit restaurant during the SIGGRAPH conference, the founders decided to name the company Alias because its only revenue came from Springer&#x27;s work on an anti-aliasing program for Silicon Graphics, Inc.
In 1985, at SIGGRAPH the company released Alias 1, which used cardinal splines instead of polygon meshes with straight lines.
In 1989, Alias 2 was used to produce &quot;The Abyss&quot; which would later win the 1990 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.
In 1990, Alias raised about $35 million (equivalent to $ million in ) through an initial public offering. That year, Alias also released new products named Studio, PowerAnimator, UpFront and purchased Spacemaker, separate and distinct to Spacemaker AI, which was purchased by Autodesk in 2020. PowerAnimator was used to produce &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), which won the 1992 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

In October 1990, the company purchased Full Color Computing, Inc., a provider of high-end photo retouch and color prepress software.

In 1995, Alias begins developing Maya. Maya would later become the world&#x27;s premier 3D animation software.

On February 7, 1995, Wavefront, SGI, and Alias merged to become Alias|Wavefront as a division of SGI. What partially motivated this merger was Microsoft&#x27;s purchase of Alias and Wavefront&#x27;s competitor Softimage. SGI saw Microsoft&#x27;s entrance into the market as a threat and merged Alias and Wavefront to compete with Microsoft. In 1998, Alias|Wavefront released Maya 1.0.

On March 1, 2003, the company was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with an Academy Award (Oscar) for scientific and technical achievement for their development of Maya software. Wavefront Technologies founders Bill Kovacs and Roy A. Hall previously received a 1997 Academy Award for the creative leadership (Kovacs) and the principal engineering (Hall) efforts which led to the Wavefront Advanced Visualizer computer graphics system.

Later, in July 2003, the company&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Alias|Wavefront&quot; to &quot;Alias Systems Corporation&quot;. In June 2004, Silicon Graphics sold Alias to 
the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan and Accel-KKR, a technology-focused private equity investment firm, for US$57.1 million.

In September 2004, Alias acquired Kaydara, adding the company&#x27;s character animation and motion editing products to Alias&#x27; line of software. 

On October 4, 2005, Autodesk, announced plans to acquire Alias. On January 10, 2006, Autodesk completed the acquisition for US$197 million in cash.

== Products ==
Alias&#x27; best-known product, the 3D modeling and animation package Maya, was delivered in 1998 and has released a major upgrade every 9–12 months. The last release made by Alias was Maya 7.0. Since the purchase by Autodesk all versions after 8.5 use a year-based naming convention, such as Maya2008.

Other products include; the industrial design package StudioTools (formerly known as Studio, or just &quot;Alias&quot;), which is used extensively in the automotive, aerospace and industrial design industries, a 2D drawing and sketching application called SketchBook Pro, and in 1992, an early Macintosh based 3D modelling and rendering package called Sketch! which was the precursor of Alias Maya. Sketch provided the basis of the core non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) editing tools, which in turn was based on a product that the company bought, and its key developer went to work for Alias.

<doc id="113017" wikidata="Q4051134" url="?curid=113017" title="The Inquirer">
<text>The Inquirer (stylized as TheINQUIRER) was a British technology tabloid website founded by Mike Magee after his departure from &quot;The Register&quot; (of which he was one of the founding members) in 2001. In 2006 the site was acquired by Dutch publisher &quot;Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen&quot; (VNU). Mike Magee later left The Inquirer in February 2008 to work on the &quot;IT Examiner&quot;.

Historically, the magazine was entirely Internet-based with its journalists living all over the world and filing copy online, though in recent years it has been edited from Incisive Media&#x27;s offices in London.

Although traditionally a &#x27;red top&#x27;, under &quot;Incisive Media&quot; it has put more weight behind its journalism, reducing the number of jibes at companies, and moved instead towards sponsored online debates in association with high-profile organisations, most recently, Intel.

&quot;The Inquirer&quot; ceased publishing on 19 December 2019, partly due to declining digital advertising revenues.

==Scoops==
===Sony laptop battery scandal===
In 2006 &quot;The Inquirer&quot; reported laptop battery problems that affected Dell, Sony and Apple as of September 2006, with rumours of problems at Toshiba and Lenovo. In June 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; published photographs of a Dell notebook PC bursting into flames at a conference in Japan; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reprinted &quot;The Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s photographs. &quot;The Inquirer&quot; was also the first publication to report Dell&#x27;s subsequent decision to recall faulty batteries, according to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;.

&quot;The Inquirer&#x27;s&quot; successful reporting of the story relied on information supplied by readers and later by a confidential source at Dell. &quot;I attribute being on top of the story to old-fashioned print journalism standards – cultivating, and, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, not burning such contacts,&quot; &quot;The Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s founder, Mike Magee, told BusinessWeek.

===Rydermark===
In July 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; posted images to show cheating by Nvidia Windows device drivers in &quot;Rydermark 2006&quot;. The images were alleged to be fake by a number of sources. &quot;The Inquirer&quot; denied any wrongdoing and quoted the maker of Rydermark calling the allegations against them &quot;irresponsible&quot;. About 8 months after the original Rydermark article, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; ran another article claiming that Rydermark was still being developed, but was near release. In response, one of its critics offered $1,000 to a charity of the Rydermark articles author&#x27;s choosing if he could produce (breaching his NDA) a version of Rydermark that showed the alleged screenshots in full-motion video before a set deadline (which gave the author 10 and a half hours, beginning at 6:30PM UK time). No one produced the program before the deadline passed.

Independent verification that RyderMark was genuine, first appeared in TweakTown in May 2007. RyderMark developer Ajith Ram denied ever sending the Inquirer Nvidia cheating allegations.

===ATI Intel front side bus license revocation===
On 24 July 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; wrote that, in response to AMD&#x27;s announced intent to purchase ATI, &quot;ATI had its chipset license pulled, or at least not renewed by Intel.&quot; ATI responded by stating that its license had not been revoked and that they continue to ship Intel chipsets under license. On 23 August 2006, ATI showed its chipset roadmap to motherboard vendors which showed that next-generation chipsets for the Intel platform are cancelled. On 1 March 2007, AMD said that they would continue developing chipsets for Intel platforms.

===Windows 10 Technical Preview eavesdropping===
On 3 October 2014, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; reported on the privacy policy for the Technical Preview the upcoming Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. In the report, it pointed out that the permissions included the ability for Microsoft to monitor individual keystrokes as well as file content from users. The story was picked up by news media around the world causing Microsoft to admit that monitoring was a necessary part of the process, but denying use of a keylogger.

Ed Bott, writing for ZDNet, accused the site of being &quot;a tech tabloid known for its breathless headlines and factually challenged prose&quot; and said of writer Chris Merriman, &quot;there&#x27;s little evidence that the author has enough background in computer science or security to tell a keylogger from a key lime pie.&quot;
