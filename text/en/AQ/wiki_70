<text>Princeton is the largest city in and the county seat of Patoka Township, Gibson County, Indiana, United States. The population was 8,301 at the 2020 United States Census, and it is part of the greater Evansville, Indiana, Metropolitan Area.

== History ==
In 1800, the Indiana Territory was created with Vincennes (Knox County) as its capital. The rich farmlands in the southwest of the territory with access to the Ohio River attracted many pioneers and settlers to the area, one of whom was an Irish immigrant named William Prince. Born in 1772, he immigrated to America at the age of 22. He later became a Gibson County Commissioner and the county seat of Princeton is named after him.

The year 1813 saw the move of the territorial capital east from Vincennes to Corydon and the creation of Gibson County. Gibson had previously been part of the vast Knox County which covered all the land of southwestern Indiana, bordered by the Wabash and Ohio Rivers. By early 1814, settlers to this area were asking for a &quot;seat of justice,&quot; or county seat. Captain William Prince was one of four commissioners who located the seat at the half-way stand on the Evansville and Vincennes stage line. By drawing of lots, commissioners decided to name the town after Captain Prince.

The iconic symbol of Princeton is the Gibson County Courthouse, a structure built in the Second Empire style. It has been featured as a collectible figurine by the Department 56 Original Snow Village. A post office was established in Princeton as early as 1816. The local newspaper, the Princeton Daily Clarion, was first published in 1846. Lyles Station, a small community just west of Princeton, was founded by freed Tennessee slave Joshua Lyles in 1849. It served as a haven for runaway slaves who braved the Ohio River on a northern trek towards freedom.

The Wabash and Erie Canal ran through the nearby towns of Francisco and Port Gibson, providing a means of reaching distant markets with goods from Princeton. The 1850s saw the advance of the railway system through Indiana, spelling doom for the canal system. The Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad line was run through town in 1852 and the Princeton Depot was constructed in 1875. The railroad became a boon to Princeton&#x27;s industry as the Southern Railway Shops were constructed on the edge of town in 1892. Other industry included the Heinz plant (because of the area&#x27;s famed tomatoes being good for ketchup making) and the Princeton Coal Mine.

In 1925, the Tri-State Tornado left its mark on the town. After hitting Griffin and narrowly missing Owensville to the southwest, the tornado devastated the southern side of Princeton, killing 44 people, injuring another 146 and leaving hundreds homeless. Princeton was the historic storm&#x27;s final victim, as the tornado dissipated about 10 miles to the northeast near Petersburg. The deadliest tornado in US history claimed 95 lives in Indiana with almost half of those in Princeton.
On 9 December 1926, twenty-nine people were killed in a mine explosion in or near Princeton.

Toyota Motor Company opened a truck manufacturing plant between Princeton and Fort Branch in 1998 to build a new full-size pickup and SUV. Toyota significantly increased production at the plant in 2000. As of 2016, the plant builds two SUVs and a van.

On April 18, 2008, Princeton was shaken by the 2008 Illinois earthquake, epicentered approximately away near West Salem, Illinois.

The Gibson County Courthouse and Welborn-Ross House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Economy ==

Major employers in Princeton include Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana (TMMI), located 3 miles to the south, nearly halfway between Princeton and Fort Branch, where the Toyota Sequoia, Sienna and Highlander are manufactured; and Hansen Corporation. Many Toyota suppliers have facilities between the plant site and the city. These suppliers include EnovaPremier, Vuteq, TBIN, Millennium Steel, DXE, SMC, Global SQ, and Trigo. All of these facilities were either built or converted from other uses to furnish supplies, part and services to TMMI. Siemens at one point had research and manufacturing facilities in Princeton, but the manufacturing plant was closed in the early 1990s and the research facility was closed soon after. A large hardware store currently occupies the former Siemens site.

Toyota&#x27;s announcement in late 1995 that it would be building a $1 billion manufacturing facility in Princeton created an economic boom, as many of Toyota&#x27;s suppliers also built plants in or near Princeton to minimize shipping and logistical expenses. Additionally, many service businesses located in town to satisfy the needs of the employees, many of whom would be relocating to the Princeton area from elsewhere. However, the arrival of Toyota was not without controversy. Many objected to the ten-year tax abatement offered as part of the incentive package to induce Toyota to locate in the area, and others were worried by the fact that it would likely not be unionized (as of 2023, it is not).

More recently, many retail and restaurant chains have opened locations in Princeton. Analysts attribute much of this to the planned extension of Interstate 69—at the time many of these businesses were sited in Princeton, the leading proposal for the project was to upgrade U.S. 41 (it was later decided to build Interstate 69 over a new-terrain route, which would travel between nearby Oakland City and Francisco).

Princeton is served by two freight rail lines: CSX and Norfolk Southern. For people who enjoy watching trains online, Virtual Railfan, via YouTube, provides northbound and southbound cams along the tracks at W. Broadway St. for 24-hour viewing when the cameras are in operation. The cams are hosted by the Gibson County Visitors and Tourism Bureau. Greyhound Bus Lines stops at curbside to pick up and discharge passengers outside a Burger King restaurant at 2740 W. Broadway St.

== Government ==

Princeton is governed by a mayor and a five-member city council, all of whom are elected for four-year terms. The current mayor is Greg Wright, Republican as of January 1, 2020. City functions are divided among the Police Department, Sanitation Department, Parks and Recreation Department, Street Department, Sewer Department, Water Department, Water Treatment Plant, and the Princeton Fire Territory (formed from a merger between the Princeton Fire Department and the Patoka Township Fire Department in early 2006).

== Parks and recreation ==

Princeton has three main city parks, administered by the Department of Parks and Recreation. Lafayette Park, on the city&#x27;s north side, is the largest. It features a fishing pond, shelter houses, a playground, an open general-purpose recreation area, and a stage for public performances. The city swimming pool is adjacent to Lafayette Park, as is Kiddie Land, a playground for very young children. Gil Hodges field, where the Princeton Community High School baseball team plays its home games, is also located on the park property.
The other two city parks are South Side Park and East End Park

==Highways==
* U.S. Route 41 Evansville – Terre Haute
* State Road 64 Known as Broadway Avenue for its entire length in Princeton. Mount Carmel – .
* State Road 65 Known as Broadway Avenue for first two thirds of its length up to the Courthouse Square, then turns onto Main Street for the remaining third. Heads for Petersburg or Owensville via Indiana 64.

==Major roads==
* Broadway Avenue State Road 64 for east half, State Road 64/65 for west half where it becomes a four-lane road. Because Broadway Avenue does not have an overpass, it is often blocked as over 80 trains pass through town on a daily basis, sometimes with two trains passing each other over the intersection.
* Brumfield Avenue Runs parallel to Broadway one to four blocks north, depending on location. Site of one of the two railroad overpasses over the CSX/Norfolk Southern junction running through Princeton. 
* Embree Street Though obscure at its beginning at Broadway, Embree Street is one of the major thoroughfares used in reaching Princeton Community High School, now known as Princeton Community Middle School. At the junction of Embree and Brumfield there is a roundabout, completed in 2009 to ease flow through the intersection as trains pass through town. Embree is also frequently used to bypass the railroad to get to the Brumfield Ave. Overpass from the square. The Gibson County Fairgrounds are also located along Embree Street immediately before the high school/middle school complex.
* Main Street Signed as State Road 65 north of the Gibson County Courthouse Square, Main Street is the main north-south thoroughfare in Princeton. Main Street was also once signed as U.S. Route 41 for nearly all of its length through Princeton. A two-year widening and rehabilitation project was completed in 2008, making what was once one of the most unpleasant-looking streets in Princeton the most presentable. Main Street is the site of the other railroad overpass in Princeton. The current campus of Princeton Community High School, opened in 2012, is located along Main Street, north of town.
* Mulberry/Spring Street Bypass often used to get to Princeton&#x27;s South Side while avoiding the stoplights on the Courthouse Square. An overpass was considered for Mulberry in 2007, but was rejected due to the costs involved. Mulberry and Spring Streets meet on a sometimes hazardous curve that sits almost 15 feet over surrounding terrain.
* Richland Creek Drive Around a newly installed roundabout, the third in Princeton, are two new townhouse projects and a new Deaconess Hospital Clinic as well as a possible new strip mall. Richland Creek meets U.S. Route 41 about 200 feet south of the Broadway (State Roads 64/65) – US 41 Cloverleaf. At the northern end of Richland Creek Drive is Sherman Drive and the Gibson General Hospital campus. The aforementioned roundabout is joined by a new unamed road connecting it to Second Avenue.
* North Prince Street The street runs parallel with Main Street, but has a number of 4-way stops near the center of town.
* State Street Similar to Prince street, State Street runs parallel to Broadway, forming the north end of the square. State street is often used to bypass the light at Main and Brumfield, or to reach Embree Street to bypass the trains. Like Prince Street, State Street also has a number of 4-way stops near the center of town, one of which is with Prince. It forks with Broadway on the far east end of town, near the old middle school.
*Second Avenue Previously a short dead end street along with the other short avenues on Princeton&#x27;s west end, it was extended in 2018, to meet up with what was called McCarty Road. The entire road is now called Second Avenue all the way to US 41, and now provides a bypass for workers at Toyota and other suppliers to reach the numerous restaurants along West Broadway while avoiding US-41/IN-64-65 cloverleaf during lunch rush. The area along the extension has also seen extensive housing and apartment construction since 2022, and now features a complete roundabout with a short unamed road linking it with Richland Creek Drive, opened in October, 2024.

<text>The Blitz was a German bombing campaign against the United Kingdom, for eight months, from 7 September 1940 to 11 May 1941, during the Second World War.

The Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns, and cities, beginning with raids on London, towards the end of the Battle of Britain in 1940 (a battle for daylight air superiority, between the and the Royal Air Force, over the United Kingdom). By September 1940, the Luftwaffe had lost the Battle of Britain, and the German air fleets () were ordered to attack London, to draw RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation. Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring, commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 of the following 57 days and nights. Notable attacks included a large daylight attack against London on 15 September, a large raid on 29 December 1940 against London -- resulting in a firestorm known as the Second Great Fire of London, and a large raid on the night of 10–11 May 1941.

The gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of night attacks, to evade attacks by the RAF, and the Blitz became a night bombing campaign after October 1940. The attacked the main Atlantic seaport of Liverpool in the Liverpool Blitz. The North Sea port of Hull, a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets, suffered the Hull Blitz. The port cities of Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton, Sunderland, Swansea, Belfast, and Glasgow also were bombed, as were the industrial centres of Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester, and Sheffield. More than 40,000 civilians were killed by Luftwaffe bombing during the war, almost half of them in the capital, where more than a million houses were destroyed or damaged.

In early July 1940, the German High Command began planning Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender, or to do much damage to the war economy; eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British war production, which continued to increase. The greatest effect was to force the British to disperse the production of aircraft and spare parts. British wartime studies concluded that most cities took 10 to 15 days to recover when hit severely, but some, such as Birmingham, took three months.

The German air offensive failed because the Luftwaffe High Command (, OKL) did not develop a methodical strategy for destroying British war industry. Poor intelligence about British industry and economic efficiency led to OKL concentrating on tactics, rather than strategy. The bombing effort was diluted, by attacks against several sets of industries, instead of constant pressure on the most vital.

==Background information ==

=== and strategic bombing===

In the 1920s and 1930s, airpower theorists such as Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating the need for land and sea combat. It was thought that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;, and could not be resisted, particularly at night. Industry, seats of government and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale, and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.

The took a cautious view of strategic bombing, but the OKL did not oppose the strategic bombardment of industries or cities. It believed it could greatly affect the balance of power on the battlefield by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale. OKL did not believe air power alone could be decisive, and the did not adopt an official policy of the deliberate bombing of civilians until 1942.

The vital industries and transport centres that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. It could be claimed civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as &quot;terror bombing&quot;, the concept of attacking vital war industries—and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale—was ruled as acceptable.

From the beginning of the National Socialist regime until 1939, there was a debate in German military journals over the role of strategic bombardment, with some contributors arguing along the lines of the British and Americans. General Walther Wever (Chief of the General Staff
1 March 1935 – 3 June 1936) championed strategic bombing, and the building of suitable aircraft, although he emphasised the importance of aviation in operational and tactical terms. Wever outlined five points of air strategy:
# To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeat enemy air forces that attacked German targets.
# To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas, by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces
# To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e., armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy&#x27;s advance, and participating directly in ground operations.
# To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting German naval bases and participating directly in naval battles
# To paralyse the enemy armed forces, by stopping production in armaments factories.

Wever argued that OKL should not be solely educated in tactical and operational matters, but also in grand strategy, war economics, armament production, and the mentality of potential opponents (also known as intelligence analysis). Wever&#x27;s vision was not realised, staff studies in those subjects fell by the wayside, and the Air Academies focused on tactics, technology and operational planning, rather than on independent strategic air offensives.

In 1936, Wever was killed in an air crash, and the failure to implement his vision for the new was largely attributable to his successors. Ex-army personnel, and his successors as Chief of the General Staff, Albert Kesselring (3 June 1936 – 31 May 1937) and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff (1 June 1937 – 31 January 1939), are usually blamed for abandoning strategic planning for close air support.

Two prominent enthusiasts for ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were Hugo Sperrle, the commander of 3 (1 February 1939 – 23 August 1944), and Hans Jeschonnek, Chief of the General Staff (1 February 1939 – 19 August 1943). The was not pressed into ground support operations, either because of pressure from the army, or because it was led by ex-soldiers; indeed, the favoured a model of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns.

===Hitler, Göring, and air power===
Hitler paid less attention to the bombing of opponents than to air defence, although he promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s , and understood it was possible to use bombers for strategic purposes. He told OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the against the heart of the British will to resist, would follow when the moment was right. Hitler quickly developed scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the &#x27;s inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, &quot;The munitions industry cannot be impeded effectively by air raids ... usually, the prescribed targets are not hit&quot;.

While the war was being planned, Hitler never insisted upon the planning a strategic bombing campaign, and did not even give ample warning to the air staff that war with Britain (or even Russia) was a possibility. The amount of firm operational and tactical preparation for a bombing campaign was minimal, largely because of the failure by Hitler, as supreme commander, to insist upon such a commitment.

Ultimately, Hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon (formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting German rule, rather than suffering air bombardment). This had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler mistook &quot;Allied&quot; strategy for one of morale breaking, instead of one of economic warfare --and any damage to morale as a bonus.

Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. As the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that the threat of German retaliation would persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation, and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was—for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself—that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and redoubled efforts to mount a similar &quot;terror offensive&quot; against Britain, in order to produce a stalemate, in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at all.

A major problem in the management of the was Göring. Hitler believed the was &quot;the most effective strategic weapon&quot;, and in reply to repeated requests from the , for control over naval aircraft, he insisted, &quot;We should never have been able to hold our own in this war, if we had not had an undivided &quot;. Such principles / made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in Göring a jealous and damaging defense of his &quot;empire&quot; while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the at either the strategic or operational level.

When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making, between himself and Göring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over. In 1940 and 1941, Göring&#x27;s refusal to co-operate with the denied the entire military forces of the the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had a strategic, or decisive, effect in the war against the British Empire.

The deliberate separation of the from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major &quot;communications gap&quot; between Hitler and the ; other factors helped to exacerbate this. For one thing, Göring&#x27;s fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When Göring decided against continuing Wever&#x27;s original heavy bomber programme, in 1937, the &#x27;s own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, and not how many engines each had. In July 1939, Göring arranged a display of the &#x27;s most advanced equipment at Rechlin, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.

===Battle of Britain===

Although not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the &quot;was&quot; expected to do this over Britain. From July until September 1940 the attacked Fighter Command, to gain air superiority as a prelude to invasion. This involved the bombing of English Channel convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command was thought to allow the Germans control of the skies over the invasion area. It was supposed Bomber Command, Coastal Command, and the Royal Navy could not operate under conditions of German air superiority.

The weakness of the &#x27;s intelligence meant that their aircraft were too often unable to locate their targets, so that attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results. British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany&#x27;s, during the Battle of Britain, by 2 to 1. The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany&#x27;s 8,000. The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and struggled to replace manpower losses (though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew).

The circumstances hampered the Germans more than the British: Operating over home territory, British aircrew could fly again, if they survived being shot down. German crews (even if they survived) faced capture. Moreover, the Reich&#x27;s bombers carried four to five crew, representing a greater loss of manpower. On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF&#x27;s supporting structures. German intelligence suggested Fighter Command was weakening, and that an attack on London would force it into a final battle of annihilation, while compelling the British Government into surrender.

The decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed to have been a major mistake by OKL, argued that persisting with attacks on RAF &quot;airfields &quot; might have won air superiority for the . Others argue that the made little impression on Fighter Command, in the last week of August and first week of September, and that the shift in strategy was not decisive. It also has been argued that it was doubtful the could have won air superiority, before the &quot;weather window&quot; began to deteriorate (in October).

It also was possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the would have made the projected German invasion, (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster, with or without German air superiority.

===Change in strategy===
Regardless of the ability of the to win air superiority, Hitler was frustrated by its slow advance.. With no sign of the RAF weakening, and the suffering many losses, OKL was keen for a change in strategy. To reduce losses further, strategy changed to prefer night raids, darkness offering the bombers greater protection.

It was decided to focus on bombing Britain&#x27;s industrial cities, in daylight, to begin with. The main focus was London. The first major raid took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss without any no lasting gain. Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight, later in the month and into October, the switched its main effort to night attacks, official policy starting 7 October. The air campaign against London and other British cities soon got underway.

However, the faced limitations. Its aircraft—Dornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 88, and Heinkel He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic missions but the damage they were capable of doing was limited due to their small bomb loads. The &#x27;s decision, in the interwar period, to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons: 
* Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939.
* The OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force.
* Germany did not possess the resources, nor technical ability, to produce four-engined bombers, before the war.

Although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the also had an unclear strategy, and poor intelligence. The OKL had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent, until early 1938; it had too little time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain&#x27;s industries. 

Moreover, the OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry (such as aircraft factories), or against a system of interrelated industries (such as Britain&#x27;s import and distribution network -- or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British population. The &#x27;s strategy became increasingly aimless, over the winter of 1940–1941. Disputes among OKL staff revolved more around tactics, than strategy. This lack of clarity condemned the offensive over Britain to failure, well before it had begun.

In an operational capacity, limitations in weapons technology, and quick British reactions, were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect. Attacking ports, shipping and imports, as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas (especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War) would net a positive result. However, the use of delayed-action bombs, while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to detonate. The British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities, making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack. Regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications, and to organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving.

==Civil defence==

===Pre-war preparations and fears===
London had nine million people—a fifth of the British population—living in an area of , which was difficult to defend because of its size. Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated that 50 casualties—with about one-third killed—would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937.

In 1937 the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1.2 million wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938, experts generally expected that Germany would try to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks.

In addition to high-explosive and incendiary bombs, the Germans could use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy. In 1939, military theorist Basil Liddell-Hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war. London hospitals prepared for 300,000 casualties in the first week of war.

British air raid sirens sounded for the first time 22 minutes after Neville Chamberlain declared war on Germany. Although bombing attacks unexpectedly did not begin immediately during the Phoney War, civilians were aware of the deadly power of aerial attacks through newsreels of Barcelona, the Bombing of Guernica and the Bombing of Shanghai. Many popular works of fiction during the 1920s and 1930s portrayed aerial bombing, such as H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; and its 1936 film adaptation, and others such as &quot;The Air War of 1936&quot; and &quot;The Poison War&quot;. Harold Macmillan wrote in 1956 that he and others around him &quot;thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear war today&quot;.

Based in part on the experience of German bombing in the First World War, politicians feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attacks and the collapse of civil society. In 1938, a committee of psychiatrists predicted three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing, implying three to four million psychiatric patients. Winston Churchill told Parliament in 1934, &quot;We must expect that, under the pressure of continuous attack upon London, at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the metropolis&quot;. Panic during the Munich crisis, such as the migration by 150,000 people to Wales, contributed to fear of social chaos.

The government planned the evacuation of four million people—mostly women and children—from urban areas, including 1.4 million from London. It expected about 90% of evacuees to stay in private homes, conducted an extensive survey to determine the amount of space available and made detailed preparations for transporting evacuees. A trial blackout was held on 10 August 1939 and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September, a blackout began at sunset. Lights were not allowed after dark for almost six years, and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians, even more than rationing. The relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale. Not only was there evacuation over land, but also by ship. The Children&#x27;s Overseas Reception Board was organised by the government to help parents send their children overseas to four British Dominions—Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The programme evacuated 2,664 boys and girls (ages 5–15) until its ending in October after the sinking of the with the loss of 81 children out of 100 on board.

Much civil defence preparation in the form of shelters was left in the hands of local authorities and many areas such as Birmingham, Coventry, Belfast, and the East End of London did not have enough shelters. The unexpected delay to civilian bombing during the Phoney War meant that the shelter programme finished in June 1940, before the Blitz. The programme favoured back garden Anderson shelters and small brick surface shelters. Many of the latter were abandoned in 1940 as unsafe. Authorities expected that the raids would be brief and in daylight, rather than attacks by night, which forced Londoners to sleep in shelters.

===Communal shelters===
Deep shelters provided most protection against a direct hit. The government did not build them for large populations before the war because of cost, time to build and fears that their safety would cause occupants to refuse to leave to return to work or that anti-war sentiment would develop in large congregations of civilians. The government saw the leading role taken by the Communist Party in advocating the building of deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939.

The most important existing communal shelters were the London Underground stations. Although many civilians had used them for shelter during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids but by the second week of heavy bombing, the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened.

Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940, about 150,000 people a night slept in the Underground, although by winter and spring the numbers declined to 100,000 or less. Battle noises were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations, but many people were killed from direct hits on stations. In March 1943, 173 men, women and children were crushed to death at Bethnal Green tube station in a crowd surge after a woman fell down the steps as she entered the station. A single direct hit on a shelter in Stoke Newington in October 1940 killed 160 civilians.
Communal shelters never housed more than one seventh of Greater London residents. Peak use of the Underground as shelter was 177,000 on 27 September 1940 and a November 1940 census of London found that about 4% of residents used the Tube and other large shelters, 9% in public surface shelters and 27% in private home shelters, implying that the remaining 60% of the city stayed at home. The government distributed Anderson shelters until 1941 and that year began distributing the Morrison shelter, which could be used inside homes.

Public demand caused the government in October 1940 to build new deep shelters within the Underground to hold 80,000 people but the period of heaviest bombing had passed before they were finished. By the end of 1940 improvements had been made in the Underground and in many other large shelters. Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters, to reduce the amount of time spent queuing. Committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments, and organisations such as the British Red Cross and the Salvation Army worked to improve conditions. Entertainment included concerts, films, plays and books from local libraries.

Although only a small number of Londoners used the mass shelters, when journalists, celebrities and foreigners visited they became part of the Beveridge Report, part of a national debate on social and class division. Most residents found that such divisions continued within the shelters and many arguments and fights occurred over noise, space and other matters. Anti-Jewish sentiment was reported, particularly around the East End of London, with anti-Semitic graffiti and anti-Semitic rumours, such as that Jewish people were &quot;hogging&quot; air raid shelters. Contrary to pre-war fears of anti-Semitic violence in the East End, one observer found that the &quot;Cockney and the Jew [worked] together, against the Indian&quot;.

===&quot;Blitz Spirit&quot;===

Although the intensity of the bombing was not as great as pre-war expectations, thus making an equal comparison impossible, no psychiatric crisis occurred because of the Blitz even during the period of greatest bombing of September 1940. An American witness wrote, &quot;By every test and measure I am able to apply, these people are staunch to the bone and won&#x27;t quit ... the British are stronger and in a better position than they were at its beginning&quot;. People referred to raids as if they were weather, stating that a day was &quot;very blitzy&quot;.

According to Anna Freud and Edward Glover, London civilians surprisingly did not suffer from widespread shell shock, unlike the soldiers in the Dunkirk evacuation. The psychoanalysts were correct, and the special network of psychiatric clinics opened to receive mental casualties of the attacks closed due to lack of need. Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of &quot;bomb neurosis&quot; per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing, avoidance of the evacuation programmes grew.

The cheerful crowds visiting bomb sites were so large they interfered with rescue work. Pub visits increased in number (beer was never rationed), and 13,000 attended cricket at Lord&#x27;s. People left shelters when told instead of refusing to leave, although many housewives reportedly enjoyed the break from housework. Some people even told government surveyors that they enjoyed air raids if they occurred occasionally, perhaps once a week.

Despite the attacks, defeat in Norway and France, and the threat of invasion, overall morale remained high. A Gallup poll found only 3% of Britons expected to lose the war in May 1940. Another poll found an 88% approval rating for Churchill in July. A third poll found 89% support for his leadership in October. Support for peace negotiations declined from 29% in February. Each setback caused more civilians to volunteer to become unpaid Local Defence Volunteers. Workers worked longer shifts and over weekends. Contributions rose to the £5,000 &quot;Spitfire Funds&quot; to build fighters and the number of work days lost to strikes in 1940 was the lowest in history.

===Civilian mobilisation===
Civilians of London played an enormous role in protecting their city. Many civilians who were unwilling or unable to join the military joined the Home Guard, the Air Raid Precautions service (ARP), the Auxiliary Fire Service and many other civilian organisations. The AFS had 138,000 personnel by July 1939. Only one year earlier, there had only been 6,600 full-time and 13,800 part-time firemen in the entire country. Before the war, civilians were issued with 50 million respirators (gas masks) in case bombardment with gas began before evacuation.

During the Blitz, The Scout Association guided fire engines to where they were most needed and became known as the &quot;Blitz Scouts&quot;. Many unemployed people were drafted into the Royal Army Pay Corps; and, together with the Pioneer Corps, were tasked with salvaging and clean-up. The Women&#x27;s Voluntary Services for Civil Defence (WVS) was established in 1938 by the Home Secretary, Samuel Hoare, who considered it the female branch of the ARP. The WVS organised the evacuation of children, established centres for those displaced by bombing and operated canteens, salvage and recycling schemes. By the end of 1941, the WVS had one million members.

Pre-war dire predictions of mass air-raid neurosis were not borne out. Predictions had underestimated civilian adaptability and resourcefulness. There were also many new civil defence roles that gave a sense of fighting back rather than despair. Official histories concluded that the mental health of the nation may have actually improved, while panic was rare.

==Pre-war RAF night defence==
British air doctrine, since Hugh Trenchard had commanded the Royal Flying Corps (1915–1917), stressed offence as the best means of defence, which became known as the cult of the offensive. To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, Bomber Command would destroy Luftwaffe aircraft on their bases, aircraft in their factories and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy proved impractical, as Bomber Command lacked the technology and equipment for mass night operations, since resources were diverted to Fighter Command in the mid-1930s and it took until 1943 to catch up. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action and that fighters could not defend Britain alone. Until September 1939, the RAF lacked specialist night-fighting aircraft and relied on anti-aircraft units, which were poorly equipped and lacking in numbers.

The attitude of the Air Ministry was in contrast to the experiences of the First World War when German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to their numbers. Around 250 tons (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Many people over 35 remembered the bombing and were afraid of more. From 1916 to 1918, German raids had diminished against countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was possible. Although night air defence was causing greater concern before the war, it was not at the forefront of RAF planning after 1935, when funds were directed into the new ground-based radar day fighter interception system. The difficulty of RAF bombers in night navigation and target finding led the British to believe that it would be the same for German bomber crews. There was also a mentality in all air forces that flying by day would obviate the need for night operations and their inherent disadvantages.

Hugh Dowding, Air Officer Commanding Fighter Command, defeated the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, but preparing day fighter defences left little for night air defence. When the Luftwaffe struck at British cities for the first time on 7 September 1940, a number of civic and political leaders were worried by Dowding&#x27;s apparent lack of reaction to the new crisis. Dowding accepted that as AOC, he was responsible for the day and night defence of Britain but seemed reluctant to act quickly and his critics in the Air Staff felt that this was due to his stubborn nature. Dowding was summoned on 17 October, to explain the poor state of the night defences and the supposed (but ultimately successful) &quot;failure&quot; of his daytime strategy. The Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill distanced themselves. The failure to prepare adequate night air defences was undeniable but it was not the responsibility of the AOC Fighter Command to dictate the disposal of resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938, left few resources for night air defence and the Government, through the Air Ministry and other civil and military institutions was responsible for policy. Before the war, the Chamberlain government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort.

==Technology==

===German night navigation devices===

Because of the inaccuracy of celestial navigation for night navigation and target finding in a fast-moving aircraft, the developed radio navigation devices and relied on three systems: (Crooked Leg), (X-Device), and (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which became known as the Battle of the Beams. Bomber crews already had some experience with the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into , a 30–33 MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.

 was in general use but the was reserved for specially trained pathfinder crews. receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the fuselage. The system worked on 66–77 MHz, a higher frequency than Knickebein. Ground transmitters sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute. received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot visual and aural directions. Three cross-beams intersected the beam along which the He 111 was flying. The first cross-beam alerted the bomb aimer, who activated a bombing clock when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bombs were released.

 was an automatic beam-tracking system and the most complex of the three devices, which was operated through autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber&#x27;s equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to be measured precisely. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a code word from the ground controller or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.

===British countermeasures===
In June 1940, a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the , even though it was under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started a search which discovered that Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30 MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. The counter-operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as meaconing using masking beacons (). Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened their paths, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets; confidence in the device was diminished by the time the was ready to conduct big raids.

German beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the crews to determine the signal&#x27;s bearing. The meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were closer. In general, German bombers were likely to get through to their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night-fighter force would be ready, and anti-aircraft defences only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. An unknown number of bombs fell on these diversionary (&quot;Starfish&quot;) targets.

For industrial areas, fires and lighting were simulated. It was decided to recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, carbon arc lamps were used to simulate flashes at tram overhead wires. Red lamps were used to simulate blast furnaces and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels. The use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were similar to those of the German C-250 and C-500 . The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.

==First phase==

===Loge and Seeschlange===
The first deliberate air raids on London were mainly aimed at the Port of London, causing severe damage. Late in the afternoon of 7 September 1940, the Germans began Operation London (, where was the codename for London) and Operation Sea Snake (), the air offensives against London and other industrial cities. continued for 57 nights. A total of 348 bombers and 617 fighters took part in the attack.

Initially, the change in strategy caught the RAF off guard and caused extensive damage and civilian casualties. Some 107,400 gross tons () of shipping was damaged in the Thames Estuary and 1,600 civilians were casualties. Of this total around 400 were killed. The fighting in the air was more intense in daylight. had cost the 41 aircraft: 14 bombers, 16 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, seven Messerschmitt Bf 110s, and four reconnaissance aircraft. Fighter Command lost 23 fighters, with six pilots killed and another seven wounded. Another 247 bombers from 3 (Air Fleet 3) attacked that night. On 8 September the returned; 412 people were killed and 747 severely wounded.

On 9 September the OKL appeared to be backing two strategies. Its round-the-clock bombing of London was an immediate attempt to force the British government to capitulate, but it was also striking at Britain&#x27;s vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege. Although the weather was poor, heavy raids took place that afternoon on the London suburbs and the airfield at Farnborough. The day&#x27;s fighting cost Kesselring and 2 (Air Fleet 2) 24 aircraft, including 13 Bf 109s. Fighter Command lost 17 fighters and six pilots. Over the next few days weather was poor and the next main effort would not be made until 15 September 1940.

On 15 September the made two large daylight attacks on London along the Thames Estuary, targeting the docks and rail communications in the city. Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them, allowing the to destroy their fighters in large numbers, thereby achieving air superiority. Large air battles broke out, lasting for most of the day. The first attack merely damaged the rail network for three days, and the second attack failed altogether. The air battle was later commemorated by Battle of Britain Day. The lost 18 percent of the bombers sent on the operations that day and failed to gain air superiority.

While Göring was optimistic the could prevail, Hitler was not. On 17 September he postponed Operation Sea Lion (as it turned out, indefinitely) rather than gamble Germany&#x27;s newly gained military prestige on a risky cross-Channel operation, particularly in the face of a sceptical Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union. In the last days of the battle, the bombers became lures in an attempt to draw the RAF into combat with German fighters. But their operations were to no avail; the worsening weather and unsustainable attrition in daylight gave the OKL an excuse to switch to night attacks on 7 October.

On 14 October, the heaviest night attack to date saw 380 German bombers from 3 hit London. Around 200 people were killed and another 2,000 injured. British anti-aircraft defences (led by General Frederick Alfred Pile) fired 8,326 rounds and shot down only 2 bombers. On 15 October, the bombers returned and about 900 fires were started by the mix of 376 tons () of high explosive and 10 tons of incendiaries dropped. Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.

 continued during October. 8200 tons () of bombs were dropped that month, about 10 percent in daylight, over 5400 tons () on London during the night. Birmingham and Coventry were subject to of bombs between them in the last 10 days of October. Liverpool suffered of bombs dropped. Hull and Glasgow were attacked but of bombs were spread out all over Britain. The Metropolitan-Vickers works in Manchester was hit by of bombs. Little tonnage was dropped on Fighter Command airfields; Bomber Command airfields were hit instead.

 policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on London, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the West Midlands, again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of fighter-bombers.

Kesselring, commanding 2, was ordered to send 50 sorties per night against London and attack eastern harbours in daylight. Sperrle, commanding 3, was ordered to dispatch 250 sorties per night including 100 against the West Midlands. would be carried out by Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) which concentrated on mining operations against shipping. It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped 3,984 mines, of the total dropped. The mines&#x27; ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping campaign.

By mid-November 1940, when the Germans adopted a changed plan, more than of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids. The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding, and much damage had been done to the railway system outside. In September, there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain, and at one period, between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs. But the great bulk of the traffic went on, and Londoners—though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station, or made strange detours round back streets in the buses—still got to work. For all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale. More than 13,000 civilians had been killed, and almost 20,000 injured, in September and October alone, but the death toll was much less than expected. In late 1940, Churchill credited the shelters.

Wartime observers perceived the bombing as indiscriminate. American observer Ralph Ingersoll reported the bombing was inaccurate and did not hit targets of military value, but destroyed the surrounding areas. He wrote that Battersea Power Station, one of the largest landmarks in London, received only a minor hit. In fact, on 8 September 1940 both Battersea and West Ham Power Station were both shut down after the 7 September daylight attack on London. In the case of Battersea power station, an unused extension was hit and destroyed during November but the station was not put out of action during the night attacks. It is not clear whether the power station or any specific structure was targeted during the German offensive as the could not accurately bomb select targets during night operations. In the initial operations against London, it did appear as if rail targets and the bridges over the Thames had been singled out: Victoria Station was hit by four bombs and suffered extensive damage. The bombing disrupted rail traffic through London without destroying any of the crossings. On 7 November, St Pancras, Kensal and Bricklayers Arms stations were hit and several lines of Southern Rail were cut on 10 November. The British government grew anxious about the delays and disruption of supplies during the month. Reports suggested the attacks blocked the movement of coal to the Greater London regions and urgent repairs were required. Attacks against East End docks were effective and many Thames barges were destroyed. The London Underground rail system was also affected; high explosive bombs damaged the tunnels rendering some unsafe. The London Docklands, in particular, the Royal Victoria Dock, received many hits and Port of London trade was disrupted. In some cases, the concentration of the bombing and resulting conflagration created firestorms of 1,000 °C. The Ministry of Home Security reported that although the damage caused was &quot;serious&quot; it was not &quot;crippling&quot; and the quays, basins, railways and equipment remained operational.

===Improvements in British defences===

British night air defences were in a poor state. Few anti-aircraft guns had fire-control systems, and the underpowered searchlights were usually ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above . In July 1940, only 1,200 heavy and 549 light guns were deployed in the whole of Britain. Of the &quot;heavies&quot;, some 200 were of the obsolescent type; the remainder were the effective  and guns, with a theoretical ceiling of over but a practical limit of because the predictor in use could not accept greater heights. The light guns, about half of which were of the excellent Bofors 40 mm, dealt with aircraft only up to . Although the use of the guns improved civilian morale, with the knowledge the German bomber crews were facing the barrage, it is now believed that the anti-aircraft guns achieved little and in fact the falling shell fragments caused more British casualties on the ground.

Few fighter aircraft were able to operate at night. Ground-based radar was limited, and airborne radar and RAF night fighters were generally ineffective. RAF day fighters were converting to night operations and the interim Bristol Blenheim night fighter conversion of the light bomber was being replaced by the powerful Beaufighter, but this was only available in very small numbers. By the second month of the Blitz the defences were not performing well. London&#x27;s defences were rapidly reorganised by General Pile, the Commander-in-Chief of Anti-Aircraft Command. The difference this made to the effectiveness of air defences is questionable. The British were still one-third below the establishment of heavy anti-aircraft artillery AAA (or ack-ack) in May 1941, with only 2,631 weapons available. Dowding had to rely on night fighters. From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Boulton Paul Defiant; its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other type. AA defences improved by better use of radar and searchlights. Over several months, the 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, was reduced to 4,087 in January 1941 and to 2,963 shells in February 1941.

Aircraft interception radar (AI) then available was unreliable. The heavy fighting in the Battle of Britain had eaten up most of Fighter Command&#x27;s resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with airborne search lights out of desperation but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (gun-laying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control (No. 10 Group RAF, No. 11 Group RAF and No. 12 Group RAF). Whitehall&#x27;s disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67 percent of the sorties were visual cat&#x27;s-eye missions. Curiously, while 43 percent of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61 percent of the combats. Yet when compared with daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to one percent. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance of evading it.

Nevertheless, it was radar that proved to be the critical weapon in the night battles over Britain from this point onward. Dowding had introduced the concept of aircraft interception radar and encouraged its usage. Eventually, it would become a success. On the night of 22/23 July 1940, Flying Officer Cyril Ashfield (pilot), Pilot Officer Geoffrey Morris (air observer) and Flight Sergeant Reginald Leyland (aircraft intercept radar operator) of the Fighter Interception Unit became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using onboard radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off Sussex. On 19 November 1940 the RAF night fighter ace John Cunningham shot down a Ju 88 bomber using aircraft interception radar, just as Dowding had predicted. By mid-November, nine squadrons were available, but only one was equipped with Beaufighters (No. 219 Squadron RAF at RAF Kenley). By 16 February 1941, this had grown to 12; with 5 equipped, or partially equipped with Beaufighters spread over 5 Groups.

===Italian Air Corps===

The (literally, &quot;Italian Air Corps&quot;), or CAI, was an expeditionary force from the Italian (Italian Royal Air Force) that participated in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz during the final months of 1940. The Air Corps was created by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to assist his German ally during the Battle of Britain. On 10 September 1940, the CAI was formed, under the command of Rino Corso-Fougier.

The corps comprised 50 Fiat CR.42 biplane fighter, 45 Fiat G.50 Freccia monoplane fighters and a squadron of Fiat BR.20 twin engined bombers.

The first raid was a night time bombing mission when 18 BR.20s attacked Harwich and Felixstowe on 24/25 October. On 29 October 15 bombers with a heavy fighter escort attacked Ramsgate during the daytime. There were 8 further night time bomber attacks on Harwich and Ipswich and one daylight bomber raid of Harwich with an escort of 40 fighters. The last raid was by 5 bombers against Ipswich on the night of 2 January.

In total 54.3 tons () of bombs were dropped in 102 sorties.

==Second phase==

===Night attacks===
From November 1940 to February 1941, the shifted its strategy and attacked other industrial cities. In particular, the West Midlands were targeted. On the night of 13/14 November, 77 He 111s of 26 (26th 
Combat Wing, or KG 26) bombed London, while 63 from KG 55 hit Birmingham. The next night, a large force hit Coventry. &quot;Pathfinders&quot; from 12 100 (Combat Group 100 or KGr 100) led 437 bombers from KG 1, KG 3, KG 26, KG 27, KG 55 and 1 (1st Training Wing, or LG 1) which dropped of high explosive, of incendiaries, and 127 parachute mines. Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of of bombs were dropped. The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase &quot;to coventrate&quot;. Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped. Around 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and loss of public utilities stopped work at nine others, disrupting industrial output for several months. The historic cathedral was all but destroyed together with most of the city centre in the massive firestorm. Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow-up raids were made, as OKL underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943 to 1945). The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack. The strategic effect of the raid was a brief 20 percent dip in aircraft production.

Five nights later, Birmingham was hit by 369 bombers from KG 54, KG 26, and KG 55. By the end of November, 1,100 bombers were available for night raids. An average of 200 were able to strike per night. This weight of attack went on for two months, with the dropping of bombs. In November 1940, 6,000 sorties and 23 major attacks (more than 100 tons [] of bombs dropped) were flown. Two heavy attacks ( of bombs) were also flown. In December, only 11 major and five heavy attacks were made.

Probably the most devastating attack occurred on the evening of 29 December, when German aircraft attacked the City of London itself with incendiary and high explosive bombs, causing a firestorm that has been called the Second Great Fire of London. The first group to use these incendiaries was 100 which despatched 10 &quot;pathfinder&quot; He 111s. At 18:17, it released the first of 10,000 firebombs, eventually amounting to 300 dropped per minute. Altogether, 130 German bombers destroyed the historical centre of London. Civilian casualties on London throughout the Blitz amounted to 28,556 killed, and 25,578 wounded. The had dropped of bombs.

Not all of the effort was made against inland cities. Port cities were also attacked to try to disrupt trade and sea communications. In January 1941 Swansea was bombed four times, on 17 January very heavily, when around 100 bombers dropped a high concentration of incendiaries, some 32,000 in all. The main damage was inflicted on the commercial and domestic areas. Heavy and sustained bombing occurred in February in the &#x27;Three Nights&#x27; Blitz&#x27; from 19 to 21 February. A total of 230 people were killed and 397 were injured. Swansea was selected by the Germans as a legitimate strategic target due to its importance as a port and docks and the oil refinery just beyond, and its destruction was key to Nazi German war efforts as part of their strategic bombing campaign aimed at crippling coal export and demoralizing civilians and emergency services. Waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swaths of Southsea (Portsmouth) and Gosport with 40,000 incendiaries. Warehouses, rail lines and houses were destroyed and damaged, but the docks were largely untouched. In January and February 1941, serviceability rates declined until just 551 of 1,214 bombers were combat-worthy. Seven major and eight heavy attacks were flown, but the weather made it difficult to keep up the pressure. Still, at Southampton, attacks were so effective morale did give way briefly with civilian authorities leading people &quot;en masse&quot; out of the city.

===Strategic or &quot;terror&quot; bombing===

Although official German air doctrine did target civilian morale, it did not espouse the attacking of civilians directly. It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy&#x27;s factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant the target area needed to be illuminated and hit &quot;without regard for the civilian population&quot;. Special units, such as KGr 100, became the (Firelighter Group), which used incendiaries and high explosives to mark the target area. The tactic was expanded into (Blaze Control) with the creation of (Incendiary Fields) to mark targets. These were marked out by parachute flares. Then bombers carrying SC 1000 (), SC 1400 (), and SC 1800 () &quot;Satan&quot; bombs were used to level streets and residential areas. By December, the SC 2500 () &quot;Max&quot; bomb was used.

These decisions, apparently taken at the or level, meant attacks on individual targets were gradually replaced by what was, for all intents and purposes, an unrestricted area attack or (terror attack). Part of the reason for this was inaccuracy of navigation. The effectiveness of British countermeasures against caused the to prefer fire light instead for target marking and navigation. The shift from precision bombing to area attack is indicated in the tactical methods and weapons dropped. KGr 100 increased its use of incendiaries from 13 to 28 percent. By December, this had increased to 92 percent. Use of incendiaries, which were inherently inaccurate, indicated much less care was taken to avoid civilian property close to industrial sites. Other units ceased using parachute flares and opted for explosive target markers. Captured German aircrews also indicated the homes of industrial workers were deliberately targeted.

==Final attacks==

===Directive 23: Göring and the ===
In 1941, the shifted strategy again. Erich Raeder—commander-in-chief of the —had long argued the should support the German submarine force () in the Battle of the Atlantic by attacking shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and attacking British ports. Eventually, he convinced Hitler of the need to attack British port facilities. At Raeder&#x27;s prompting, Hitler correctly noted that the greatest damage to the British war economy had been done through the destruction of merchant shipping by submarines and air attacks by small numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 naval aircraft and ordered the German air arm to focus its efforts against British convoys. This meant that British coastal centres and shipping at sea west of Ireland were the prime targets.

Hitler&#x27;s interest in this strategy forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to their agreeing to Hitler&#x27;s Directive 23, &quot;Directions for operations against the British War Economy&quot;, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain&#x27;s sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries.

Directive 23 was the only concession made by Göring to the over the strategic bombing strategy of the against Britain. Thereafter, he would refuse to make available any air units to destroy British dockyards, ports, port facilities, or shipping in dock or at sea, lest the gain control of more units. Raeder&#x27;s successor—Karl Dönitz—would—on the intervention of Hitler—gain control of one unit (KG 40), but Göring would soon regain it. Göring&#x27;s lack of co-operation was detrimental to the one air strategy with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain. Instead, he wasted aircraft of (Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against convoys. For Göring, his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain, and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone. He was always reluctant to co-operate with Raeder.

Even so, the decision by the OKL to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by two considerations, both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy Britain&#x27;s sea communications in conjunction with the . First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led the OKL to adopt the naval option. The indifference displayed by the OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions.

A further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible, but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations. Airfields became waterlogged and the 18 (bomber groups) of the &#x27;s (bomber wings) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment.

===British ports===
From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for , whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of .

By now, the imminent threat of invasion had all but passed as the had failed to gain the prerequisite air superiority. The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued with the objective of breaking the morale of the civilian population. The attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the &#x27;s effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen moved to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. The shortage of bombers caused OKL to improvise. Some 50 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as (&quot;light bombers&quot;) and sometimes called (&quot;Light Kesselrings&quot;). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their targets.

The diversion of heavier bombers to the Balkans meant that the crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of KG 30 was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and dextro-energen amphetamine tablets, then completed the mission.

The could still inflict much damage and after the German conquest of Western Europe, the air and submarine offensive against British sea communications became much more dangerous than the German offensive during the First World War. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the Western Approaches from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the country. Air attacks sank of shipping, with another damaged. Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by civilians. Other sources point out that half of the 144 berths in the port were rendered unusable and cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75 percent. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged, amounting to . Around 66,000 houses were destroyed and 77,000 people made homeless (&quot;bombed out&quot;), with 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one night. Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became &quot;trekkers&quot;, people who made a mass exodus from cities before, during and after attacks. The attacks failed to knock out railways or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many attacks. The Port of London, in particular, was an important target, bringing in one-third of overseas trade.

On 13 March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed (Clydebank Blitz). All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were attacked. Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights; Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing loss was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons () of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons () of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the port installations, but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons () of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by KG 26. The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying two Ju 88s. By the end of the air campaign over Britain, only eight percent of the German effort against British ports was made using mines.

In the north, substantial efforts were made against Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland, which were large ports on the English east coast. On 9 April 1941, 2 dropped 150 tons () of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack. Sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations were damaged. In Sunderland on 25 April, 2 sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons () of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. Much damage was done. A further attack on the Clyde, this time at Greenock, took place on 6 and 7 May. However, as with the attacks in the south, the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the regions.

The last major attack on London was on 10/11 May 1941, on which the flew 571 sorties and dropped of bombs. This caused more than 2,000 fires; 1,436 people were killed and 1,792 seriously injured, which affected morale badly. Another raid was carried out on 11/12 May 1941. Westminster Abbey and the Law Courts were damaged, while the Chamber of the House of Commons was destroyed. One-third of London&#x27;s streets were impassable. All but one railway station line was blocked for several weeks. This raid was significant, as 63 German fighters were sent with the bombers, indicating the growing effectiveness of RAF night fighter defences.

===RAF night fighters===
German air supremacy at night was also now under threat. British night-fighter operations out over the Channel were proving successful. This was not immediately apparent. The Bristol Blenheim F.1 carried four machine guns which lacked the firepower to easily shoot down a Do 17, Ju 88 or Heinkel He 111. The Blenheim had only a small speed advantage to overtake a German bomber in a stern-chase. Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting, a kill was most unlikely even in the conditions of a moonlit sky. The Boulton Paul Defiant, despite its poor performance during daylight engagements, was a much better night fighter. It was faster, able to catch the bombers and its configuration of four machine guns in a turret could (much like German night fighters in 1943–1945 with ) engage the German bomber from beneath. Attacks from below offered a larger target, compared to attacking tail-on, as well as a better chance of not being seen by the crew (so less chance of evasion), as well as greater likelihood of detonating its bomb load. In subsequent months a steady number of German bombers would fall to night fighters.

Improved aircraft designs were in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter, then under development. It would prove formidable but its development was slow. The Beaufighter had a maximum speed of , an operational ceiling of , a climb rate of per minute, and its battery of four Hispano cannon and six .303 in Browning machine guns was much more lethal. On 19 November, John Cunningham of No. 604 Squadron RAF shot down a bomber flying an AI-equipped Beaufighter, the first air victory for the airborne radar. In November and December 1940, the flew 9,000 sorties against British targets and RAF night fighters claimed only six shot down. In January 1941, Fighter Command flew 486 sorties against 1,965 made by the Germans. Just three and twelve were claimed by the RAF and AA defences respectively. In the bad weather of February 1941, Fighter Command flew 568 sorties to counter the which flew 1,644 sorties. Night fighters could claim only four bombers for four losses.

By April and May 1941, the was still getting through to their targets, taking no more than one- to two-percent losses per mission. On 19/20 April 1941, in honour of Hitler&#x27;s 52nd birthday, 712 bombers hit Plymouth with a record 1,000 tons () of bombs. Losses were minimal. In the following month, 22 German bombers were lost with 13 confirmed to have been shot down by night fighters. On 3/4 May, nine were shot down in one night. On 10/11 May, London suffered severe damage, but 10 German bombers were downed. In May 1941, RAF night fighters shot down 38 German bombers. By the end of May, Kesselring&#x27;s 2 had been withdrawn, leaving Hugo Sperrle&#x27;s 3 as a token force to maintain the illusion of strategic bombing. Hitler now had his sights set on attacking the USSR with Operation Barbarossa, and the Blitz came to an end.

==Aftermath==

=== losses===
Between 20 June 1940, when the first German air operations began over Britain, and 31 March 1941, OKL recorded the loss of 2,265 aircraft over the British Isles, a quarter of them fighters and one-third bombers. At least 3,363 aircrew were killed, 2,641 missing and 2,117 wounded. Total losses could have been as high as 600 bombers, just 1.5 percent of the sorties flown. A significant number of the aircraft not shot down after the resort to night bombing were wrecked during landings or crashed in bad weather.

===Effectiveness of bombing===
The military effectiveness of bombing varied. The dropped around of bombs during the Blitz, which disrupted production and transport, reduced food supplies, and shook British morale. The bombing also helped to support the U-boat blockade by sinking some of shipping and damaging more. Despite the bombing, British production rose steadily throughout this period, although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers for Easter Holidays, according to the British official history. The official history volume &quot;British War Production&quot; (Postan, 1952) noted that the greatest effect on output of warlike stores was on the supply of components and dispersal of production rather than complete equipment.

In aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of the industry, at first because of damage to aircraft factories and then by a policy of precautionary dispersal. In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, rifle production fell by 25 percent, filled-shell production by 4.6 percent and in small-arms production 4.5 percent. The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10 to 15 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an attack.

The air offensive against the RAF and British industry failed to have the desired effect. More might have been achieved had OKL exploited the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the United States Army Air Forces targeted oil, but that would have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the Luftwaffe was incapable. OKL instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently), and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy. Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz cost around 41,000 lives, may have injured another 139,000 people and did enormous damage to British infrastructure and housing stock.

===RAF evaluation===
The British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command&#x27;s offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.
Some writers claim the Air Staff ignored a critical lesson, that British morale did not break and that attacking German morale was not sufficient to induce a collapse. Aviation strategists dispute that morale was ever a major consideration for Bomber Command. Throughout 1933–1939 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September 1940. The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name but industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather prevented raids on oil targets.

The AOC Bomber Command, Arthur Harris, who did see German morale as an objective, did not believe that the morale collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command was to destroy the German industrial base (economic warfare) and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the Battle of Berlin, Harris declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve &quot;a state of devastation in which surrender is inevitable&quot;. A summary of Harris&#x27; strategic intentions was clear:

In comparison to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany, casualties due to the Blitz were relatively low; the bombing of Hamburg alone inflicted about 40,000 civilian casualties.

==Legacy, propaganda and memory==
A popular image arose of British people in the Second World War: a collection of people locked in national solidarity. This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of Angus Calder&#x27;s book &quot;The Myth of the Blitz&quot; (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain in 1982, during the Falklands War when it was portrayed in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented patriotism actively and successfully acting as a defender of democracy. This imagery of people in the Blitz was embedded via being in film, radio, newspapers and magazines. At the time it was seen as a useful propaganda tool for domestic and foreign consumption. Historians&#x27; critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as overemphasised claims of patriotic nationalism and national unity. In &quot;The Myth of the Blitz&quot;, Calder exposed some of the counter-evidences of anti-social and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the myth—serene national unity—became &quot;historical truth&quot;. In particular, class division was most evident during the Blitz.

Raids during the Blitz produced the greatest divisions and morale effects in the working-class areas, with lack of sleep, insufficient shelters and inefficiency of warning systems being major causes. The loss of sleep was a particular factor, with many not bothering to attend inconvenient shelters. The Communist Party made political capital out of these difficulties. In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night. So worried were the government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the police were sent to seize their production facilities. The government up until November 1940 was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying Neville Chamberlain resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters was made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the Labour Party, itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941. The &quot;Communist threat&quot; was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the cessation of activities of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, the Communist newspaper.

The brief success of the Communists also fed into the hands of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Antisemitic attitudes became widespread, particularly in London. Rumours that Jewish support was underpinning the Communist surge were frequent. Rumours that Jews were inflating prices, were responsible for the black market, were the first to panic under attack (or even the cause of the panic), and secured the best shelters via underhanded methods, were also widespread. There was also minor ethnic antagonism between the small Black, Indian and Jewish communities, but despite this these tensions quietly and quickly subsided. In other cities, class divisions became more evident. Over a quarter of London&#x27;s population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population in south Wales and Gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. Other factors, including industry dispersal, may have been important. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees and hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments, although these factors did not appear to threaten social order. The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation&#x27;s unity in times of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88 percent of evacuated mothers, 86 percent of small children, and 43 percent of schoolchildren had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the Phoney War contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect again.

On the other hand, some historians have recently contended that this revisionism of the &quot;Blitz spirit&quot; narrative may have been an over-correction. These include Peter Hennessy, Andrew Thorpe, and Philip Ziegler, who while admitting serious exceptions, argue that the population largely behaved well during the Blitz.

===Bomb site rubble===
In one 6-month period, 750,000 tons () of bomb site rubble from London was transported by railway on 1,700 freight trains to make runways on Bomber Command airfields in East Anglia. Bomb site rubble from Birmingham was used to make runways on US Air Force bases in Kent and Essex in southeast England. Many sites of bombed buildings, when cleared of rubble, were cultivated to grow vegetables to ease wartime food shortages and were known as victory gardens.

===Novels===
According to Edward Quinn, Elizabeth Bowen&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Heat of the Day&quot; (1948) takes place during the &quot;first heady autumn of the London air raids&quot;. The protagonist, Stella Rodney, meets her lover Robert, and their relationship is shaped by the historical context in which it takes place. The novel&#x27;s powerful depiction of this era, marked by the camaraderie that arose during the Blitz and the constant threat of death, adds depth to its exploration of the theme of treason. Bowen&#x27;s writing captures the poignant moments of strangers bidding each other farewell on street corners, as they hope to survive the night and not be forgotten. Overall, the novel&#x27;s strength lies in its ability to transport readers to a specific time and place and make them feel the weight of historical events on the characters&#x27; lives.

===Poetry===
The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas  had first-hand experience of the Blitz whilst working in London for Strand Films on morale-boosting documentary films for the Ministry of Information. His lived experience of bombing raids and fire storms were given powerful expression in poems he wrote at the time, notably elegies for an elderly man - &quot;Among Those Killed in a Dawn Raid Was a Man Aged a Hundred&quot; (1941) - and for child victims of incendiary bombing raids in &quot;Ceremony After a Fire Raid&quot; (1944) and &quot;A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London&quot; (1945). They were collected in Deaths and Entrances, a volume of his poetry published in 1946. The sentiments expressed in his war poems were, according to Professor Walford Davies, representative of “the real temper of the British people of the time - the resilience and the guts”.

The poet T.S.Eliot served as an air raid warden on night-watch during the London Blitz. Passages in his 1942 poem &quot;Little Gidding&quot;, (subsequently published as the last poem in &quot;Four Quartets&quot;) derive from his experiences of the devastation caused by civilian bombardment. Hilda Doolittle, who wrote poetry as H.D., conveyed her experiences of the London Blitz in the poem &quot;The Walls Do Not Fall&quot; (1944) where they are set alongside historical examples of besieged cities.

===Film===
&quot;Blitz&quot; is a 2024 film produced and directed by Steve McQueen. In a graphic representation of the Blitz on London, set over a period of three nights in September 1940, the themes of patriotism, communal solidarity and resilience as well as moments of mental terror across gender, race and class are all explored in a manner which questions the &quot;patriotic myth&quot; of the &quot;Blitz Spirit&quot; in the prevailing historical imagination.

===Archive audio recordings===
In recent years a large number of wartime recordings relating to the Blitz have been made available on audiobooks such as &quot;The Blitz&quot;, &quot;The Home Front&quot;, and &quot;British War Broadcasting&quot;. These collections include period interviews with civilians, servicemen, aircrew, politicians and Civil Defence personnel, as well as Blitz actuality recordings, news bulletins and public information broadcasts. Notable interviews include Thomas Alderson, the first recipient of the George Cross, John Cormack, who survived eight days trapped beneath rubble on Clydeside, and Herbert Morrison&#x27;s famous &quot;Britain shall not burn&quot; appeal for more fireguards in December 1940.

<doc id="112280" wikidata="Q286068" url="?curid=112280" title="Marion, Indiana">
<text>Marion is a city in and the county seat of Grant County, Indiana, United States, along the Mississinewa River. The population was 28,310 as of the 2020 census. It is named for Francis Marion, a brigadier general from South Carolina in the American Revolutionary War.

The city is home to Indiana Wesleyan University, the largest evangelical Christian university in the Midwest and Indiana&#x27;s largest private university, when online and regional campuses in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois are included. The traditional campus enrolls about 2,800 students. Marion is the birthplace of actor James Dean and cartoonist Jim Davis, and was the location of the wedding of actress Julia Roberts and singer Lyle Lovett in 1993. Ronald Douglas Morrell Jr. is the city&#x27;s first African American mayor and has been mayor since 2024.

==History==
===Founding===
The Battle of the Mississinewa was fought in December 1812, north of the current city of Marion, as an expeditionary force sent by William Henry Harrison against the Miami villages. Today, the battle is reenacted every fall by residents of Grant County and many reenactors and enthusiasts from throughout the United States and Canada during the annual &quot;Mississinewa 1812&quot; festival, the largest War of 1812 reenactment in the United States. When Martin Boots and David Branson each donated of land in 1831 for the site of Marion, they chose a location on the left bank of the swift, scenic river which the Miami Indians had named &quot;Mississinewa,&quot; meaning &quot;Falling water.&quot; So rapid had been the tide of settlement that it followed by only 19 years the Battle of Mississinewa, downstream, where federal troops and Indians had fought a bloody, pre-dawn encounter in 1812.

With the formation of Grant County in 1831, Marion was established as the county seat and its future was assured. The river provided water supply, power, and drainage as it flowed at the base of the nearby hills. Along with at least 36 other communities in the nation, Marion was named for the Revolutionary War General Francis Marion, the &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; of South Carolina.

===Industrial growth===

Marion grew slowly for more than 50 years as an agricultural trading center supported by a sprinkling of small farm- and forest-related industries. Native Americans were a common sight as they traveled there from Indiana&#x27;s last reservation, with its Indian school, Baptist Church, and cemetery, away. In the 1880s, fields of natural gas were discovered across much of east-central Indiana, and Grant County began to grow at a dizzying pace during the Indiana gas boom. Gas City and Matthews were carved out of raw farmland and launched as speculative boom towns, each absorbing existing tiny villages. They attracted several thousand residents before the gas reserves were tapped and most industries left. As late as the 1940s, Matthews resembled a Western ghost town, before it attracted eleven glass factories and drew the professional baseball team away from Indianapolis. Grant County&#x27;s only covered bridge remains there as a link to the past. However, the gas boom left its legacy. A few industries remained, particularly glass manufacturers.

On July 23, 1888, with increasing number of residents at the six HDVS, Congress established a seventh home in Grant County (and ultimately three more). It is known as the Marion Branch. Congress allotted an appropriation of $200,000 for construction, while Grant County residents provided a natural gas supply for heating and lighting. Marion was selected as a site for the new branch due to the availability of natural gas and the political support of Colonel George Washington Steele, US Congressman serving from 1880 to 1890. This facility is now a part of the Veterans Administration (VA) Northern Indiana Health Care System, a dual-campus facility associated with the former VA Medical Center Fort Wayne. In the early 21st century, the original treatment hospital, built in 1889, the greenhouse, and cadet quarters are scheduled for demolition. There has been a lack of public support for funding restoration of these buildings. As they do not meet current standards, the Veterans Administration plans to demolish the buildings and replace them.

===1930 lynching===
Two African-American men were lynched in Marion on August 7, 1930. A large, mostly white mob estimated at 5,000 gathered at the county jail where three young black men were held on charges of killing a white man and raping his girlfriend. Before they could be tried, the three, Thomas Shipp, Abram Smith, and James Cameron, were dragged from the jail and severely beaten. Shipp and Smith were hanged to death. Cameron was saved when an unidentified woman said he had nothing to do with the crimes.

The woman retracted her accusation of rape. In 1931 Cameron was convicted as an accessory to murder and served four years before being paroled. He became educated and worked as a civil rights activist, later serving as the Indiana State Director of Civil Liberties from 1942 to 1950. He also founded three local chapters of the NAACP, and served as the first president of the Madison County, Indiana chapter. In 1988 he founded America’s Black Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee to preserve the history of African Americans who had faced the terror and violence of lynching. In 1993, James Cameron received an official apology and a full pardon from the state of Indiana. Cameron later said, &quot;Since the state of Indiana forgave me, I forgive the state of Indiana.&quot; In 2005, the US Senate also officially apologized to Cameron and families of the victims of lynchings. The event in Marion was notable as the last confirmed lynching of African Americans in Indiana and the Northern United States.

===Modern history===
Marion&#x27;s prosperity plateaued between the end of the gas boom, just prior to World War I, and 1955. But construction of a General Motors stamping and tool plant created many new jobs. The city grew rapidly. Except for bedroom communities near metropolitan centers, Marion&#x27;s growth during the 1950s exceeded all but one Indiana city with populations of 10,000-100,000.

In the late 20th century, Marion surveyed its significant properties and defined the main buildings and grounds of the hospital as the Marion Branch Historic District. It is located at the intersection of 38th Street and Lincoln Boulevard, approximately miles southeast of the center of Marion. The boundaries are 38th Street on the north, the railroad right-of-way on the east, the Mississinewa River on the southeast, Chambers Park on the south and southeast, and Lincoln Boulevard to the west. The site is roughly square in form with diagonal boundary lines on the southeast and the southwest eliminating those corners of the square. Originally, farming operations on the home grounds included the area that is now Chambers Park. In 1981, a Determination of Eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places for Federal Properties was made under Criteria A and C. As a result, since 1981, various projects have been reviewed by the Indiana State Preservation Office for compliance under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. In 1992, the historic district was surveyed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources as a component of the Grant County inventory of historic sites and structures.

One of Marion&#x27;s more notable architectural landmarks is the extensive Marion High School campus, which includes a 1,468-seat community auditorium, home of the Marion Philharmonic Orchestra, the Community School for the Arts, and the Mississinewa Valley Community Band. The city has a lending library, the Marion Public Library.
The eight-time state basketball champions, Marion Giants, play in the 7,500 seat Bill Green Athletic Arena. The city operates a Riverwalk from downtown to Matter Park, and there is a newly renovated $9,000,000 YMCA Memorial Coliseum to honor war veterans. This was the previous home of the Giants, which was built after their first State Basketball Title in 1926.
A publicly owned mansion, the Hostess House, is used for social functions, and Marion General Hospital has been nationally accredited for approximately a half-century. Marion General was recently named a magnet hospital.

===Christmas City U.S.A.===
Christmas City U.S.A. is a local non-profit organization promoting the Christmas season in Marion and Grant County. It organizes and sponsors the Annual Christmas Parade on the Saturday before Thanksgiving to kick off the Holiday season.

It began in 1965 when the organization had a vision to expand the holiday season beyond the traditional cards and private parties. Directors wanted to foster human relations among residents of all ages and public relations toward nonresidents. In 1970, Christmas City and the Chamber of Commerce joined forces to promote a new look for the city. Postcards, bumper stickers, billboards were designed to establish the city as Christmas City U.S.A. The name was even trademarked to preserve the city&#x27;s identity. In 1991, Mayor Ron Mowery, Mark Erlewine, and a group of interested citizens decided to make Marion live up to its name. By combining the Mississinewa Riverwalk—the walkway which is used year around for jogging, walking and more—and holiday lights and lighted displays, the Christmas City Walkway of Lights was established in 1992. The first year, the walkway was home to nearly 56,000 lights and lighted displays; the walkway has grown to include more than 2,000,000 lights and is nearly long.

<doc id="112282" wikidata="Q76725" url="?curid=112282" title="Max Stirner">
<text>Johann Kaspar Schmidt (25 October 1806 – 26 June 1856), known professionally as Max Stirner (; ), was a German post-Hegelian philosopher, dealing mainly with the Hegelian notion of social alienation and self-consciousness. Stirner is often seen as one of the forerunners of nihilism, existentialism, psychoanalytic theory, postmodernism and individualist anarchism.

Stirner&#x27;s main work, &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; (), was first published in 1844 in Leipzig and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

== Biography ==

Stirner was born in Bayreuth, Bavaria. What little is known of his life is mostly due to the Scottish-born German writer John Henry Mackay, who wrote a biography of Stirner (&quot;Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk&quot;), published in German in 1898 (enlarged 1910, 1914) and translated into English in 2005. Stirner was the only child of Albert Christian Heinrich Schmidt (1769–1807) and Sophia Elenora Reinlein (1778–1839), who were Lutherans. His father died of tuberculosis on 19 April 1807 at the age of 37. In 1809, his mother remarried to Heinrich Ballerstedt (a pharmacist) and settled in West Prussian Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland). When Stirner turned 20, he attended the University of Berlin, where he studied philology. He attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who was to become a source of inspiration for his thinking. He attended Hegel&#x27;s lectures on the history of philosophy, the philosophy of religion and the subjective spirit. Stirner then moved to the University of Erlangen, which he attended at the same time as Ludwig Feuerbach.

Stirner returned to Berlin and obtained a teaching certificate, but he was unable to obtain a full-time teaching post from the Prussian government. While in Berlin in 1841, Stirner participated in discussions with a group of young philosophers called &quot;Die Freien&quot; (The Free Ones), whom historians have subsequently categorized as the Young Hegelians. Some of the best known names in 19th-century literature and philosophy were involved with this group, including Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Bruno Bauer and Arnold Ruge. While some of the Young Hegelians were eager subscribers to Hegel&#x27;s dialectical method and attempted to apply dialectical approaches to Hegel&#x27;s conclusions, the left-wing members of the group broke with Hegel. Feuerbach and Bauer led this charge.

Frequently the debates would take place at Hippel&#x27;s, a wine bar in Friedrichstraße, attended by among others Marx and Engels, who were both adherents of Feuerbach at the time. Stirner met with Engels many times and Engels even recalled that they were &quot;great friends,&quot; but it is still unclear whether Marx and Stirner ever met. It does not appear that Stirner contributed much to the discussions, but he was a faithful member of the club and an attentive listener. The most-often reproduced portrait of Stirner is a cartoon by Engels, drawn forty years later from memory at biographer Mackay&#x27;s request. It is highly likely that this and the group sketch of &quot;Die Freien&quot; at Hippel&#x27;s are the only firsthand images of Stirner. Stirner worked as a teacher in a school for young girls owned by Madame Gropius when he wrote his major work, &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;.

Stirner married twice. His first wife was Agnes Burtz (1815–1838), the daughter of his landlady, whom he married on 12 December 1837. However, she died from complications with pregnancy in 1838. In 1843, he married Marie Dähnhardt, an intellectual associated with &quot;Die Freien&quot;. Their &quot;ad hoc&quot; wedding took place at Stirner&#x27;s apartment, during which the participants were notably dressed casually, used copper rings as they had forgotten to buy wedding rings, and needed to search the whole neighborhood for a Bible as they did not have their own. In 1844, &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; was dedicated &quot;to my sweetheart Marie Dähnhardt.&quot; Afterward, using Marie&#x27;s inheritance, Stirner opened a dairy shop that handled the distribution of milk from dairy farmers into the city, but was unable to solicit the customers needed to keep the business afloat. It quickly failed and drove a wedge between him and Marie, leading to their separation in 1847. Marie later converted to Catholicism and died in 1902 in London.

After &quot;The Ego and Its Own&quot;, Stirner wrote &quot;Stirner&#x27;s Critics&quot; and translated Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and Jean-Baptiste Say&#x27;s &quot;Traité d&#x27;economie politique&quot; into German to little financial gain. He also wrote a compilation of texts titled &quot;History of Reaction&quot; in 1852. Stirner died in 1856 in Berlin from a tumor, alleged to be due to an infected insect bite. Only Bruno Bauer and Ludwig Buhl represented the Young Hegelians present at his funeral, held at the Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin.

== Philosophy ==

Stirner, whose main philosophical work was &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;, is credited as a major influence in the development of nihilism, existentialism and post-modernism as well as individualist anarchism, post-anarchism and post-left anarchy. He also influenced illegalists, feminists, nihilists and bohemians, as well as fascists, right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists. Stirner was opposed to communism for the same reasons he opposed christianity, capitalism, humanism, liberalism, property rights and nationalism, seeing them as forms of unacceptable authority over the individual. Stirner influenced also anarcho-communists and post-left anarchists. The writers of &quot;An Anarchist FAQ&quot; report that &quot;many in the anarchist movement in Glasgow, Scotland, took Stirner&#x27;s &#x27;Union of egoists&#x27; literally as the basis for their anarcho-syndicalist organising in the 1940s and beyond.&quot; Similarly, the noted anarchist historian Max Nettlau states that &quot;[o]n reading Stirner, I maintain that he cannot be interpreted except in a socialist sense.&quot; Stirner was anti-capitalist and pro-labour, attacking &quot;the division of labour resulting from private property for its deadening effects on the ego and individuality of the worker&quot; and writing that free competition &quot;is not &#x27;free,&#x27; because I lack the things for competition. [...] Under the regime of the commonality the labourers always fall into the hands of the possessors of the capitalists [...]. The labourer cannot realise on his labour to the extent of the value that it has for the customer. [...] The state rests on the slavery of labour. If labour becomes free, the state is lost.&quot; For Stirner, &quot;Labor has an egoistic character; the laborer is the egoist.&quot;

=== Egoism ===

Stirner&#x27;s egoism argues that individuals are impossible to fully comprehend, as no understanding of the self can adequately describe the fullness of experience. Stirner has been broadly understood as containing traits of both psychological egoism and rational egoism. Unlike the self-interest described by Ayn Rand, Stirner did not address individual self-interest, selfishness, or prescriptions for how one should act. He urged individuals to decide for themselves and fulfill their own egoism.

He believed that everyone was propelled by their own egoism and desires and that those who accepted this—as willing egoists—could freely live their individual desires, while those who did not—as unwilling egoists—will falsely believe they are fulfilling another cause while they are secretly fulfilling their own desires for happiness and security. The willing egoist would see that they could act freely, unbound from obedience to sacred but artificial truths like law, rights, morality, and religion. Power is the method of Stirner&#x27;s egoism and the only justified method of gaining philosophical property. Stirner did not believe in the one-track pursuit of greed, which as only one aspect of the ego would lead to being possessed by a cause other than the full ego. He did not believe in natural rights to property and encouraged insurrection against all forms of authority, including disrespect for property.

=== Anarchism ===
 Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very notion of society—were mere illusions, &quot;spooks&quot; or ghosts in the mind. He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in Unions of egoists only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might, saying: &quot;Whoever knows how to take and to defend the thing, to him belongs [property]. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot; He adds that &quot;I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!&quot; Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one&#x27;s taking or use without moral constraint and that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one&#x27;s self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity, calling society a &quot;spook&quot; and that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot;

Despite being labeled as anarchist, Stirner was not necessarily one. Separation of Stirner and egoism from anarchism was first done in 1914 by Dora Marsden in her debate with Benjamin Tucker in her journals &quot;The New Freewoman&quot; and &quot;The Egoist&quot;.

==== Communism ====
Stirner suggested that communism was tainted with the same idealism as Christianity and infused with superstitious ideas like morality and justice. Stirner&#x27;s principal critique of socialism and communism was that they ignored the individual; they aimed to hand ownership over to the abstraction society, which meant that no existing person actually owned anything.

The Anarchist FAQ writes that &quot;[w]hile some may object to our attempt to place egoism and communism together, it is worth pointing out that Stirner rejected &#x27;communism&#x27;. Stirner did not subscribe to libertarian communism, because it did not exist when he was writing and so he was directing his critique against the various forms of state communism which did. Moreover, this does not mean that anarcho-communists and others may not find his work of use to them. And Stirner would have approved, for nothing could be more foreign to his ideas than to limit what an individual considers to be in their best interest.&quot; In summarizing Stirner&#x27;s main arguments, the writers &quot;indicate why social anarchists have been, and should be, interested in his ideas, saying that, John P. Clark presents a sympathetic and useful social anarchist critique of his work in &quot;Max Stirner&#x27;s Egoism&quot;.&quot;

Daniel Guérin wrote that &quot;Stirner accepted many of the premises of communism but with the following qualification: the profession of communist faith is a first step toward total emancipation of the victims of our society, but they will become completely &#x27;disalienated,&#x27; and truly able to develop their individuality, only by advancing beyond communism.&quot;

==== Revolution ====
Stirner criticizes conventional notions of revolution, arguing that social movements aimed at overturning established ideals are tacitly idealist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new ideal thereafter. &quot;Revolution and insurrection must not be looked upon as synonymous. The former consists in an overturning of conditions, of the established condition or status, the State or society, and is accordingly a political or social act; the latter has indeed for its unavoidable consequence a transformation of circumstances, yet does not start from it but from men&#x27;s discontent with themselves, is not an armed rising, but a rising of individuals, a getting up, without regard to the arrangements that spring from it. The Revolution aimed at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets no glittering hopes on &#x27;institutions&#x27;. It is not a fight against the established, since, if it prospers, the established collapses of itself; it is only a working forth of me out of the established. If I leave the established, it is dead and passes into decay.&quot;

==== Union of egoists ====

Stirner&#x27;s idea of the Union of egoists was first expounded in &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the state. Unlike a &quot;community&quot; in which individuals are obliged to participate, Stirner&#x27;s suggested Union would be voluntary and instrumental under which individuals would freely associate insofar as others within the Union remain useful to each constituent individual. The Union relation between egoists is continually renewed by all parties&#x27; support through an act of will. Some such as Svein Olav Nyberg argue that the Union requires that all parties participate out of a conscious egoism while others such as Sydney E. Parker regard the union as a &quot;change of attitude,&quot; rejecting its previous conception as an institution.

=== Response to Hegelianism ===

Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich states that G. W. F. Hegel was a major influence on &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;. While the latter has an &quot;un-Hegelian structure and tone&quot; on the whole and is hostile to Hegel&#x27;s conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich states that Stirner&#x27;s work is best understood as answering Hegel&#x27;s question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated &quot;untrue knowledge&quot; and become &quot;absolute knowledge.&quot; Stepelevich concludes that Stirner presents the consequences of the rediscovering one&#x27;s self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.

Scholars such as Douglas Moggach and Widukind De Ridder have stated that Stirner was obviously a student of Hegel, like his contemporaries Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, but this does not necessarily make him an Hegelian. Contrary to the Young Hegelians, Stirner scorned all attempts at an immanent critique of Hegel and the Enlightenment and renounced Bauer and Feuerbach&#x27;s emancipatory claims as well. Contrary to Hegel, who considered the given as an inadequate embodiment of rational, Stirner leaves the given intact by considering it a mere object, not of transformation, but of enjoyment and consumption (&quot;His Own&quot;).

According to Moggach, Stirner does not go beyond Hegel, but he in fact leaves the domain of philosophy in its entirety, stating:
== Works ==
=== &quot;The False Principle of Our Education&quot; ===
In 1842, &quot;The False Principle of Our Education&quot; (&quot;Das unwahre Prinzip unserer Erziehung&quot;) was published in &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot;, which was edited by Marx at the time. Written as a reaction to the treatise &quot;Humanism vs. Realism&quot;, written by . Stirner explains that education in either the classical humanist method or the practical realist method still lacks true value. He states that &quot;the final goal of education can no longer be knowledge&quot;. Asserting that &quot;only the spirit which understands itself is eternal&quot;, Stirner calls for a shift in the principle of education from making us &quot;masters of things&quot; to making us &quot;free natures&quot;, naming his educational principle &quot;personalist&quot;.

=== &quot;Art and Religion&quot; ===
&quot;Art and Religion&quot; (&quot;Kunst und Religion&quot;) was also published in &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; on 14 June 1842. It addresses Bruno Bauer and his publication against Hegel called &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Doctrine of Religion and Art Judged From the Standpoint of Faith&quot;. Bauer had inverted Hegel&#x27;s relation between &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Religion&quot; by claiming that &quot;Art&quot; was much more closely related to &quot;Philosophy&quot; than to &quot;Religion&quot;, based on their shared determinacy and clarity, and a common ethical root. However, Stirner went beyond both Hegel and Bauer&#x27;s criticism by asserting that &quot;Art&quot; rather created an object for &quot;Religion&quot; and could thus by no means be related to what Stirner considered—in opposition with Hegel and Bauer—to be &quot;Philosophy&quot;, stating:
Stirner deliberately left &quot;Philosophy&quot; out of the dialectical triad (Art–Religion–Philosophy) by claiming that &quot;Philosophy&quot; does not &quot;bother itself with objects&quot; (Religion), nor does it &quot;make an object&quot; (Art). In Stirner&#x27;s account, &quot;Philosophy&quot; was in fact indifferent towards both &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;Religion.&quot; Stirner thus mocked and radicalised Bauer&#x27;s criticism of religion.

=== &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; ===

Stirner&#x27;s main work, &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; (&quot;Der Einzige und sein Eigentum&quot;), appeared in Leipzig in October 1844, with as year of publication mentioned 1845. In &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;, Stirner launches a radical anti-authoritarian and individualist critique of contemporary Prussian society and modern western society as such. He offers an approach to human existence in which he depicts himself as &quot;the unique one&quot;, a &quot;creative nothing&quot;, beyond the ability of language to fully express, stating that &quot;[i]f I concern myself for myself, the unique one, then my concern rests on its transitory, mortal creator, who consumes himself, and I may say: All things are nothing to me&quot;.

The book proclaims that all religions and ideologies rest on empty concepts. The same holds true for society&#x27;s institutions that claim authority over the individual, be it the state, legislation, the church, or the systems of education such as universities. Stirner&#x27;s argument explores and extends the limits of criticism, aiming his critique especially at those of his contemporaries, particularly Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, also at popular ideologies, including communism, humanism (which he regarded as analogous to religion with the abstract Man or humanity as the supreme being), liberalism, and nationalism as well as capitalism, religion and statism, arguing:
=== &quot;Stirner&#x27;s Critics&quot; ===
&quot;Stirner&#x27;s Critics&quot; (&quot;Recensenten Stirners&quot;) was published in September 1845 in &quot;Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift&quot;. It is a response, in which Stirner refers to himself in the third-person, to three critical reviews of &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; by Moses Hess in &quot;Die letzten Philosophen&quot; (&quot;The Last Philosophers&quot;), by a certain Szeliga (alias of an adherent of Bruno Bauer) in an article in the journal &quot;Norddeutsche Blätter&quot;, and by Ludwig Feuerbach anonymously in an article called &quot;On &#x27;The Essence of Christianity&#x27; in Relation to Stirner&#x27;s &#x27;The Unique and Its Property&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Über &#x27;Das Wesen des Christentums&#x27; in Beziehung auf Stirners &#x27;Der Einzige und sein Eigentum″&quot;) in &quot;Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift&quot;.

=== &quot;The Philosophical Reactionaries&quot; ===
&quot;The Philosophical Reactionaries&quot; (&quot;Die Philosophischen Reactionäre&quot;) was published in 1847 in &quot;Die Epigonen&quot;, a journal edited by Otto Wigand from Leipzig. At the time, Wigand had already published &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; and was about to finish the publication of Stirner&#x27;s translations of Adam Smith and Jean-Baptiste Say. As the subtitle indicates, &quot;The Philosophical Reactionaries&quot; was written in response to a 1847 article by Kuno Fischer (1824–1907) entitled &quot;The Modern Sophists&quot; (&quot;Die Moderne Sophisten&quot;). The article was signed G. Edward and its authorship has been disputed ever since John Henry Mackay &quot;cautiously&quot; attributed it to Stirner and included it in his collection of Stirner&#x27;s lesser writings. It was first translated into English in 2011 by Widukind De Ridder and the introductory note explains:
The majority of the text deals with Kuno Fischer&#x27;s definition of sophism. With much wit, the self-contradictory nature of Fischer&#x27;s criticism of sophism is exposed. Fischer had made a sharp distinction between sophism and philosophy while at the same time considering it as the &quot;mirror image of philosophy&quot;. The sophists breathe &quot;philosophical air&quot; and were &quot;dialectically inspired to a formal volubility&quot;. Stirner&#x27;s answer is striking:
Looking back on &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;, Stirner claims that &quot;Stirner himself has described his book as, in part, a clumsy expression of what he wanted to say. It is the arduous work of the best years of his life, and yet he calls it, in part, &#x27;clumsy&#x27;. That is how hard he struggled with a language that was ruined by philosophers, abused by state-, religious- and other believers, and enabled a boundless confusion of ideas&quot;.

=== &quot;History of Reaction&quot; ===
&quot;History of Reaction&quot; (&quot;Geschichte der Reaktion&quot;) was published in two volumes in 1851 by Allgemeine Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt and immediately banned in Austria. It was written in the context of the recent 1848 revolutions in German states and is mainly a collection of the works of others selected and translated by Stirner. The introduction and some additional passages were Stirner&#x27;s work. Edmund Burke and Auguste Comte are quoted to show two opposing views of revolution.

== Critical reception ==
Stirner&#x27;s work did not go unnoticed among his contemporaries. Stirner&#x27;s attacks on ideology—in particular Feuerbach&#x27;s humanism—forced Feuerbach into print. Moses Hess (at that time close to Marx) and Szeliga (pseudonym of Franz Zychlin von Zychlinski, an adherent of Bruno Bauer) also replied to Stirner, who answered the criticism in a German periodical in the September 1845 article &quot;Stirner&#x27;s Critics&quot; (&quot;Recensenten Stirners&quot;), which clarifies several points of interest to readers of the book—especially in relation to Feuerbach.

While Marx&#x27;s &quot;Saint Max&quot; (&quot;Sankt Max&quot;), a large part of &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (&quot;Die Deutsche Ideologie&quot;), was not published until 1932 and thus assured &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; a place of curious interest among Marxist readers, Marx&#x27;s ridicule of Stirner has played a significant role in the preservation of Stirner&#x27;s work in popular and academic discourse despite lacking mainstream popularity.

=== Comments by contemporaries ===
Twenty years after the appearance of Stirner&#x27;s book, the author Friedrich Albert Lange wrote the following:
Some people believe that in a sense a &quot;second positive part&quot; was soon to be added, though not by Stirner, but by Friedrich Nietzsche. The relationship between Nietzsche and Stirner seems to be much more complicated. According to George J. Stack&#x27;s &quot;Lange and Nietzsche&quot;, Nietzsche read Lange&#x27;s &quot;History of Materialism&quot; &quot;again and again&quot; and was therefore very familiar with the passage regarding Stirner.

== Influence ==
While &quot;Der Einzige&quot; was a critical success and attracted much reaction from famous philosophers after publication, it was out of print and the notoriety that it had provoked had faded many years before Stirner&#x27;s death. However, since his death, it has seen a revival in publication in multiple languages. Stirner had a destructive impact on left-Hegelianism, but his philosophy was a significant influence on Marx and his magnum opus became a founding text of individualist anarchism. Edmund Husserl once warned a small audience about the &quot;seducing power&quot; of &quot;Der Einzige&quot;, but he never mentioned it in his writing. As the art critic and Stirner admirer Herbert Read observed, the book has remained &quot;stuck in the gizzard&quot; of Western culture since it first appeared.

Many thinkers have read and been affected by &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot; in their youth including Rudolf Steiner, Gustav Landauer, Victor Serge, Carl Schmitt and Jürgen Habermas. Few openly admit any influence on their own thinking. Ernst Jünger&#x27;s book &quot;Eumeswil&quot;, had the character of the Anarch, based on Stirner&#x27;s Einzige. Some have tried to use Stirner’s ideas to defend capitalism while others have used them to argue for anarcho-syndicalism.

Several other authors, philosophers and artists have cited, quoted or otherwise referred to Max Stirner. They include Albert Camus in &quot;The Rebel&quot; (the section on Stirner is omitted from the majority of English editions including Penguin&#x27;s), Benjamin Tucker, James Huneker, Dora Marsden, Renzo Novatore, Emma Goldman, Georg Brandes, John Cowper Powys, Martin Buber, Sidney Hook, Robert Anton Wilson, Horst Matthai, Frank Brand, Marcel Duchamp, several writers of the Situationist International including Raoul Vaneigem and Max Ernst. Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot; has caused some historians to speculate that Wilde (who could read German) was familiar with the book.

=== Anarchist movement ===
Stirner&#x27;s philosophy was important in the development of modern anarchist thought, particularly individualist anarchism and egoist anarchism. Although Stirner is usually associated with individualist anarchism, he was influential to many social anarchists such as anarcha-feminists Emma Goldman and Federica Montseny. In European individualist anarchism, he influenced its major proponents after him such as Émile Armand, Han Ryner, Renzo Novatore, John Henry Mackay, Miguel Giménez Igualada and Lev Chernyi.

In American individualist anarchism, he found adherence in Benjamin Tucker and his magazine &quot;Liberty&quot; while these abandoned natural rights positions for egoism. Several periodicals &quot;were undoubtedly influenced by &quot;Liberty&quot;&#x27;s presentation of egoism&quot;. They included &quot;I&quot;, published by Clarence Lee Swartz and edited by William Walstein Gordak and J. William Lloyd (all associates of &quot;Liberty&quot;); and &quot;The Ego and The Egoist&quot;, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed, there were the German &quot;Der Eigene&quot;, edited by Adolf Brand; and &quot;The Eagle and The Serpent&quot;, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle &quot;A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology&quot;. Other American egoist anarchists around the early 20th century include James L. Walker, George Schumm, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington.

In the United Kingdom, Herbert Read was influenced by Stirner and noted the closeness of Stirner&#x27;s egoism to existentialism (see existentialist anarchism). Later in the 1960s, Daniel Guérin says in &quot;Anarchism: From Theory to Practice&quot; that Stirner &quot;rehabilitated the individual at a time when the philosophical field was dominated by Hegelian anti-individualism and most reformers in the social field had been led by the misdeeds of bourgeois egotism to stress its opposite&quot; and pointed to &quot;the boldness and scope of his thought&quot;. In the 1970s, an American Situationist collective called For Ourselves published a book called &quot;The Right To Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything&quot; in which they advocate a &quot;communist egoism&quot; basing themselves on Stirner.

Later in the United States, it emerged the tendency of post-left anarchy which was influenced profoundly by Stirner in aspects such as the critique of ideology. Jason McQuinn says that &quot;when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner&quot;. Bob Black and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher strongly adhere to Stirnerist egoism. In the hybrid of post-structuralism and anarchism called post-anarchism, Saul Newman has written on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. Insurrectionary anarchism also has an important relationship with Stirner as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher and Alfredo Bonanno who has also written on him in works such as &quot;Max Stirner&quot; and &quot;Max Stirner and Anarchism&quot;.

==== Free love, homosexuals and feminists ====

German Stirnerist Adolf Brand produced the homosexual periodical &quot;Der Eigene&quot; in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world and ran until 1931. The name was taken from the writings of Stirner (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner&#x27;s concept of &quot;self-ownership&quot; of the individual. Another early homosexual activist influenced by Stirner was John Henry Mackay. Feminists influenced by Stirner include anarchist Emma Goldman, as well as Dora Marsden who founded the journals &quot;The Freewoman, The New Freewoman&quot;, and &quot;The Egoist&quot;. Stirner also influenced free love and polyamory propagandist Émile Armand in the context of French individualist anarchism of the early 20th century which is known for &quot;[t]he call of nudist naturism, the strong defense of birth control methods, the idea of &quot;unions of egoists&quot; with the sole justification of sexual practices&quot;.

==== Post-structuralism ====

In his book &quot;Specters of Marx&quot;, influential French poststructuralist thinker Jacques Derrida dealt with Stirner and his relationship with Marx while also analysing Stirner&#x27;s concept of &quot;specters&quot; or &quot;spooks&quot;. Gilles Deleuze, another key thinker associated with post-structuralism, mentions Stirner briefly in his book &quot;The Logic of Sense&quot;. Saul Newman calls Stirner a proto-poststructuralist who on the one hand had essentially anticipated modern post-structuralists such as Foucault, Lacan, Deleuze and Derrida, but on the other had already transcended them, thus providing what they were unable to—i.e. a ground for a non-essentialist critique of present liberal capitalist society. This is particularly evident in Stirner&#x27;s identification of the self with a &quot;creative nothing&quot;, a thing that cannot be bound by ideology, inaccessible to representation in language.

=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===

Friedrich Engels commented on Stirner in poetry at the time of &quot;Die Freien&quot;:
Engels once even recalled at how they were &quot;great friends&quot; (&quot;Duzbrüder&quot;). In November 1844, Engels wrote a letter to Karl Marx in which he first reported a visit to Moses Hess in Cologne and then went on to note that during this visit Hess had given him a press copy of a new book by Stirner, &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;. In his letter to Marx, Engels promised to send a copy of the book to him, for it certainly deserved their attention as Stirner &quot;had obviously, among the &#x27;Free Ones&#x27;, the most talent, independence and diligence.&quot; To begin with, Engels was enthusiastic about the book and expressed his opinions freely in letters to Marx:
Later, Marx and Engels wrote a major criticism of Stirner&#x27;s work. The number of pages Marx and Engels devote to attacking Stirner in the unexpurgated text of &quot;The German Ideology&quot; exceeds the total of Stirner&#x27;s written works. In the book Stirner is derided as &quot;Sankt Max&quot; (Saint Max) and as &quot;Sancho&quot; (a reference to Cervantes&#x27; Sancho Panza). As Isaiah Berlin has described it, Stirner &quot;is pursued through five hundred pages of heavy-handed mockery and insult.&quot; The book was written in 1845–1846, but it was not published until 1932. Marx&#x27;s lengthy ferocious polemic against Stirner has since been considered an important turning point in Marx&#x27;s intellectual development from idealism to materialism. It has been argued that historical materialism was Marx&#x27;s method of reconciling communism with a Stirnerite rejection of morality.

=== Possible influence on Friedrich Nietzsche ===

The ideas of Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche have often been compared and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence. During the early years of Nietzsche&#x27;s emergence as a well-known figure in Germany, the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Arthur Schopenhauer. It is certain that Nietzsche read about &quot;The Unique and Its Property&quot;, which was mentioned in Friedrich Albert Lange&#x27;s &quot;History of Materialism&quot; and Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of the Unconscious&quot;, both of which Nietzsche knew well. However, there is no indication that he actually read it as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche&#x27;s publications, papers or correspondence. In 2002, a biographical discovery revealed it is probable that Nietzsche had encountered Stirner&#x27;s ideas before he read Hartmann and Lange in October 1865, when he met with Eduard Mushacke, an old friend of Stirner&#x27;s during the 1840s.

As soon as Nietzsche&#x27;s work began to reach a wider audience, the question of whether he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 when Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness, Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner. By the turn of the century, the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 that &quot;Stirner&#x27;s influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy.&quot;

From the beginning of what was characterized as &quot;great debate&quot; regarding Stirner&#x27;s possible positive influence on Nietzsche, serious problems with the idea were nonetheless noted. By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable. However, the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain the oft-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings. In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in determining if Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.

=== Rudolf Steiner ===
The individualist anarchist orientation of Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s early philosophy—before he turned to theosophy around 1900—has strong parallels to and was admittedly influenced by Stirner&#x27;s conception of the ego, for which Steiner claimed to have provided a philosophical foundation.

<text>Matthews is a town in Jefferson Township, Grant County, Indiana, United States, along the Mississinewa River. The population was 494 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Matthews was founded in 1895 and named in honor of then-governor Claude Matthews. Founders located the town near the center of the Trenton Gas Field, and it was hoped that this geographically central location could become the future capital of Indiana, moving it from Indianapolis, which had been laid out for that specific reason less than one hundred years earlier in 1825. The plan was abandoned in 1903 when the gas field was depleted, leaving the town with a main street unusually wide for its size.

Matthews was placed near an older village called New Cumberland, founded in 1833. Now the &quot;old town&quot; of Matthews, the village has a wooden covered bridge, the Cumberland Covered Bridge, built in 1877 which crosses the Mississinewa River. This bridge is the centerpiece of the town&#x27;s annual festival and draws thousands of people every year.

=== Historic sites ===
The Cumberland Covered Bridge was built in 1877, and is long. It was originally named the New Cumberland Bridge and was built by a man named William Parks. It was flooded down the Mississinewa River in the 1913 flood. It was brought back on logs rolled by horses. The foundation was raised and has been stable since. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<text>Sweetser is a town in Franklin, Pleasant and Richland townships, Grant County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,229 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad was built through the area in 1867. Around 1869, a half-mile long switch was built to haul wood to a train refueling station. This switch would become the nucleus of the town. Railroadmen began calling it &quot;Switch&quot; and soon thereafter, the area was known as &quot;Switzer&quot; and then &quot;Sweetser&quot;.

The original plat of town of Sweetser was entered on October 14, 1871, by Sanford Prater, John Hubert, James H. Vinson, Urich Mars and H.B. Bragg with the Grant County Recorder&#x27;s office. The land which formed the original plat of Sweetser had been entered in the District Land Office in Fort Wayne, Indiana on May 22, 1848, by Samuel Blinn.

Additional plats to the town were Nuzum&#x27;s in 1873, and the Wilcut&#x27;s, McGee&#x27;s, Bishop&#x27;s and Nuzum&#x27;s 2nd, all platted in 1874.

The early business section was north of the railroad on the west side of Main Street. A sawmill was located at what is now the site of the Methodist church (413 N. Main). Sweetser had several dry goods stores, a blacksmith shop, a jeweler and a saloon.

As the population grew, the sawmill was torn down and a new schoolhouse was built where it once stood. The old schoolhouse by the railroad (104 N. Meridian) was replaced by a grain elevator built by Gilbert and William Baum.

When natural gas was struck around Sweetser in 1885, the town was ready for development. The Brickner Window Glass Company, established in 1893, attracted many people not only living nearby but from other states to come to work and live here. The glass factory was located on the west side of town, being situated just west of what is now 319 W. Hubert Street. The factory was also known as Schick &amp; Hawkins Window Glass Company.

From 1884 to 1894 there were five additions platted to Sweetser, namely Thompson&#x27;s, Sherron&#x27;s, Sherron&#x27;s 2nd, Sherron&#x27;s 3rd and Hawkins.

A hotel, known as the Vardaman Hotel, was located at 103 Main Street in lots number 27-29 of the original plat. This hotel was built to accommodate the number of persons working at the glass factory.

The Friermood Tile Factory was started in 1888 and was located at the end of Walnut Street. It made tile for draining the lands around Sweetser into Pipe Creek.
==Geography==
Sweetser is located on State Road 18 between the town of Converse and the city of Marion. According to the 2010 census, Sweetser has a total area of , of which (or 99.7%) is land and (or 0.3%) is water.

Running through the edge of Sweetser is a small body of water, or creek, known as Pipe Creek. Pipe Creek is one of the sites that can be seen from the Sweetser Switch Trail. Known as one of Sweetser&#x27;s main attractions, the trail is a walking trail that stretches throughout the whole town and is expanded three miles outside of the town&#x27;s outer limits. Although this trail is intended for walking, there are signs posted that allow bicyclists, cross country skiers, runners, wheelchairs and various other ways of exercise permitted on the trail. A new addition to the trail is a statue of one of Grant County&#x27;s celebrities, Garfield.

<doc id="112286" wikidata="Q1974836" url="?curid=112286" title="Upland, Indiana">
<text>Upland (pronounced as &quot;up-land&quot;) is a town in Jefferson Township, Grant County, Indiana, United States. The population was 3,821 at the 2020 census. It is the home of Taylor University, a Christian college.

==History==
Most of the land that is now part of Upland was purchased by John Oswalt in the 1830s. He was a speculator, and believed that a canal connecting Indianapolis and Fort Wayne might pass through the area. The town was formed in the late 1860s by Jacob Bugher, who planned for it to be a depot point on the Indiana Central Railroad. The town&#x27;s name comes from the fact it was believed to be the highest point on the rail line between Columbus and Chicago. By 1880, the town had a population of around 150 and included a school, two churches, several stores, a blacksmith shop, and a sawmill.

Upland benefited from the gas boom in central Indiana which started in 1886 and carried on until around 1900 when the gas supply began to decline. Gas was discovered in Upland in 1888, and this new resource allowed the town to flourish and grow. By the 1890s, the town had a population of over 1000, street lights, water and gas lines, and a glass manufacturing plant.

Taylor University moved to Upland in the summer of 1893. The school had been struggling financially in Fort Wayne, and the gas boom allowed the town to provide the university with $10,000 in cash and of land.

==Geography==
Upland is between Fort Wayne (one hour north by car) and Indianapolis ( hours south). It is about 30 minutes from Muncie where Ball State University is located. It is about 15 minutes from Marion and Indiana Wesleyan University.

According to the 2010 census, Upland has an area of , of which (or 99.62%) is land and (or 0.38%) is water.

<text>Bloomfield is a town within Richland Township and the county seat of Greene County, Indiana, United States. The population was 2,405 at the 2010 census.

Bloomfield is part of the Bloomington, Indiana metropolitan area.

== History ==
The area where Bloomfield is located has been inhabited by Native Americans since prehistory. Tribes that have lived in the area include the Miami tribe, Kickapoo, Piankeshaw and Wea. A settlement of Woodland period people has been excavated by Indiana and Ball State Universities research teams near the confluence of Richland Creek and the White River south of Bloomfield.

The town of Bloomfield was laid out in 1824 when Greene County needed a new county seat due to the lack of a reliable water source for the town of Burlington. Burlington was located west of Bloomfield near the west fork of the White River.

The Greene County Courthouse, a log building in the town&#x27;s center, was the town&#x27;s first building. The current Greene County Courthouse, a brick structure built in the late 19th century, stands at the same location. An expansion and renovation project was completed in 2008. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

In 1824, Peter Cornelius Van Slyke donated land to Greene County for the purpose of establishing a new county seat.
Van Slyke was born on the Mohawk River in Schenectady County, New York, on April 5, 1766. He migrated to southern Indiana in 1816. Van Slyke was a veteran of the War of 1812 and died on September 25, 1834.

The well-known Rousseau brothers, Lovell H. Rousseau and Richard H. Rousseau, both located in Bloomfield in 1841 to practice law. They served as Greene County State Representatives and Lovell as State Senator until returning to Kentucky in 1849. During that period, Lovell raised a company of Greene County men (Co. E, 2nd Indiana Infantry) to fight in the Mexican War, who were conspicuous at the Battle of Buena Vista (1847). Following their return to Kentucky, Lovell became nationally famous/distinguished, and the local Bloomfield Chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic was named for him (Post #326).

Bloomfield Jr./Sr. High School has also been home to Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Guy Glover (1954-1977) and Steve Brett (1978-1993).

<doc id="112290" wikidata="Q2805787" url="?curid=112290" title="Linton, Indiana">
<text>Linton is a city in Stockton Township, Greene County, Indiana, United States. The population was 5,133 at the 2020 census. A coal mining city, it is located southeast of Terre Haute.

Linton is part of the Bloomington, Indiana, metropolitan area.

== History ==
Linton was essentially founded around the entrepreneuring of John W. Wines, who first sold goods in the Linton area, briefly in 1831. Although he would later relocate to Fairplay, Indiana, he returned and opened a general store in Linton in 1837. He would later build a small horse mill as well as a tannery. The city itself was officially chartered and named in June 1850, laid out by Hannah E. Osborn and Isaac V. Coddington. In the late 19th century, small underground coal mines began to appear near and almost inside the city and the population expanded rapidly. At the turn of the 20th century, the population was larger than it is today. At one point in the 1920s, there were at least 35 drinking establishments and an equal number of churches.

In 1896, Linton drove 300 African-American strikebreakers from town and became a sundown town, prohibiting African-Americans from living there. In 1903, union miners drove black waiters from town, and the ban expanded to all of Greene County. Violence against African-Americans continued into the 1940s. Historian James W. Loewen cites Linton as an example of a town where strikebreakers were used as pretext for more general discriminatory practices.

In the 1920s, small surface mines began to predominate, and their small, unreclaimed hills and strip-pit lakes still surround the city. The lakes have provided a regular, if limited, amount of fishing tourism for decades. Signs of the underground mines remain as well, including tipples on private land and sinkholes that appear regularly on private property, roads and even within the city limits. By the 1940s, the underground mines were gone and the small surface mines had moved on or been consumed by large corporations such as Peabody Coal Company. These mines were the primary employers well into the 1980s.

On April 24, 1919, telephone operators at the New Home Telephone Company, all women, started a strike, demanding higher wages, shorter hours, and recognition of their union by the company. The next day, New Home brought in strikebreakers to continue telephone service for the town. The presence of strike breakers agitated Linton locals, the vast majority of whom were union members themselves. In protest, a general strike was called for all union workers in the town. As tensions rose, Linton Mayor Andrew Miller asked Indiana Governor James P. Goodrich to send in the Indiana National Guard and declare martial law. The presence of the National Guard heightened tensions even further, resulting in violence. The National Guard was ordered to fire upon citizens, but instead fired over the heads of the protestors and only minor injuries were sustained. The strike ended with New Home agreeing to raise wages and lower working hours but refusing to recognize the telephone operators&#x27; union. 

In 1952, General Electric built a factory on the southeast side of the city. This factory employed several hundred until the mid-1980s, when GE phased out most of their small motors production in the U.S. The factory building remained empty due to Environmental Protection Agency regulations until GE tore it down beginning in 2014. The company plans to sell the land directly to buyers rather than to the city.

On April 29, 1963, an F3 tornado struck Hoosier, north of Linton. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Greene County.

The Linton Commercial Historic District and Linton Public Library are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Arcadia is a town in Jackson Township, Hamilton County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,666 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Settlers began to move into the area as early as 1833, when Hencil Bartholomew bought property near present day Arcadia, and other settlers quickly followed. On December 12, 1836, John and Harriet Shaffer bought 160 acres of land adjacent to a plot owned by Daniel and Matilda Waltz, which was later to become the heart of downtown Arcadia.

===Railroad===
On January 18, 1846, the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad (P&amp;I) was incorporated to construct and operate a line from Peru, Indiana, to Indianapolis to connect with the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad (JMI). By 1849 the town was laid out when the railroad had surveyed a route across the land owned by Shaffer and Waltz, and a year later in 1850, the two men donated the land on which the town was founded, which was plotted the next year by Isaac Martz. According to tradition, the town was originally to be named &quot;Shaltz&quot;, combining the names of the two men Shaffer and Waltz, but the official naming was left up to Judge Jeremiah Smith, who called it Arcadia, after the ancient region of Greece. The Arcadia post office opened in 1852. At this time, the site was heavily wooded, and described as &quot;low&quot; and marshy. After the town was laid out, the woods were cleared and streets paved with gravel, and their upkeep was paid for by a toll of 10 cents for a horse and buggy and 12 cents for a horse and wagon. The land was drained by two large open ditches, later spanned by crude log bridges. Early sidewalks were raised wooden platforms, later replaced by gravel and sawdust.

===Manufacturing and Industry===
By 1852, the railroad was complete, which included a north and south road constructed by the railroad which ran from Indianapolis to Peru, Indiana. Immediately Arcadia enjoyed steady growth as a farming community, and attracted a wide variety of businesses, which in the early years included a cigar factory, a cabinet shop, a flour and sawmill, and a planing mill to manufacture building materials.

The town continued to attract new businesses through the end of the century. By the 1880s the town included a wagon shop, a drug store, a butcher shop, a hardware store, and a number of dry goods and grocery stores, a furniture store, an undertaker, and two grain elevators. In 1888, the Frankfort Oil and Gas Company drilled for natural gas and struck a vein which ran from Arcadia and to the southwest for some six miles, which caused a small boom in industry. By 1880, eastern factories had used most of the timber they needed for fuel, and were moving west where coal was plentiful, but natural gas allowed them to fire kilns used in glass and brick manufacturing. A brick plant was opened by George Walters and B. P. Hollett, which supplied brick for miles up and down the Erie Railroad, using clay from nearby land. The Baker Glass Company moved operations from Findley, Ohio in 1894, using gas donated by the town, and later the Flint House Glass Company set up a factory to manufacture lamp chimneys. In 1898, the Arcadia Cheese Factory was opened by E. Wiles and John Burris, manufacturing an average of 200 lbs. of cheese a day. In about 1890, the first creamery was established in Arcadia by Toll Driver.

===Education===
As early as 1840, a school of hewed logs was built on wooded property donated by Moses Martz. School terms lasted three months, financed by private subscriptions of $1.50 per pupil.

According to the 2010 census, Arcadia has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="112297" wikidata="Q537853" url="?curid=112297" title="Carmel, Indiana">
<text>Carmel () is a suburban city in Hamilton County, Indiana, United States, immediately north of Indianapolis. With a population of 99,757 as of the 2020 census, the city spans across Clay Township and is bordered by the White River to the east and the Boone County line to the west. Carmel was home to one of the first electronic automated traffic signals in the country, and has now constructed 141 roundabouts between 1989 and 2022.

==History==
In the 1820s, the government put the lands in the area on sale, leading many farmers to settle on the west bank of White River. The original settlers were predominantly Quakers.

Carmel was originally called &quot;Bethlehem&quot;. It was platted and recorded in 1837 by Daniel Warren, Alexander Mills, John Phelps, and Seth Green, who donated their adjoining properties of equal size to create the town. The donated parcels were situated along the Indianapolis-Peru Road (now Westfield Boulevard). The Carmel Clay Historical Society also started its first activities in 1837.

The plot first established in Bethlehem, located at the intersection of Rangeline Road and Main Street, was marked by a clock tower donated by the local Rotary Club in 2002.

A post office was established as &quot;Carmel&quot; in 1846 because Indiana already had a post office called Bethlehem. The name Carmel is a reference to 1 Samuel 25:2 mentioning the biblical settlement Carmel. The town of Bethlehem was renamed &quot;Carmel&quot; and incorporated in 1874.

The Monon Railroad started operations in the city in 1883. Electricity and telephone lines arrived during the first decade of the 20th century. The city&#x27;s first library was started by the local Wednesday Literary Club and schoolteacher Mahlon Luther Hains in 1904. With a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, the library was built at 40 East Main Streett in 1913. During the first half of the 20th century, the city was the host on and off of the Carmel Horse Show. The town&#x27;s only bank closed in 1930.

In 1924, one of the first automatic traffic signals in the U.S. was installed at the intersection of Main Street and Rangeline Road. The signal was the invention of Leslie Haines and is currently in the old train station on the Monon Trail.

The Carmel Monon Depot, John Kinzer House, and Thornhurst Addition are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the city anticipated a demographic boom and built large new public schools, leading to the creation of the Carmel Clay School District in 1964 (and the Carmel Clay Educational Foundation in 1967). Six churches were built during the 1950s. The urban expansion was so fast that a 1958 &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; article tagged it a &quot;bedroom community&quot;, but one that could contribute to sustain the growth of Indianapolis. Construction of Interstate 465 started in 1967 and created the proper conditions for a rapid demographic growth. A new $330,000 library was built and opened in 1971.

The first Chamber of Commerce opened in 1960 but closed two years later. With the demographic boom of the 1970s, it reopened in 1970.

The Carmel Symphony was launched by Latvian immigrant Viktors Ziedonis in 1976.

By the end of the 20th century, Carmel was one of Indiana&#x27;s fastest growing cities. Suburban districts quickly replaced agricultural lands. The last farm operating within the city limits closed in 1993.

==Geography==
Carmel occupies the southwestern part of Hamilton County, adjacent to Indianapolis and, with the annexation of Home Place in 2018, is now entirely coextensive with Clay Township. It is bordered to the north by Westfield, to the northeast by Noblesville, to the east by Fishers, to the south by Indianapolis in Marion County, and to the west by Zionsville in Boone County. The center of Carmel is north of the center of Indianapolis.

According to the 2010 census, Carmel has a total area of , of which (or 97.76%) is land and (or 2.24%) is water.

Major east–west streets in Carmel generally end in a 6 and include 96th Street (the southern border), 106th, 116th, 126th, 131st, 136th, and 146th (which marks the northern border). The numbering system is aligned to that of Marion and Hamilton counties. Main Street (131st) runs east–west through Carmel&#x27;s Art &amp; Design District; Carmel Drive runs generally east–west through the main shopping area, and City Center Drive runs east–west near Carmel&#x27;s City Center project.

North–south streets are not numbered and include (west to east) Michigan, Shelborne, Towne, Ditch, Spring Mill, Meridian, Guilford, Rangeline, Keystone, Carey, Gray, Hazel Dell, and River. Some of these roads are continuations of corresponding streets in Indianapolis. Towne Road replaces the name Township Line Road at 96th Street, while Westfield Boulevard becomes Rangeline north of 116th Street. Meridian Street (US 31) and Keystone Parkway (formerly Keystone Avenue/SR 431) are the major thoroughfares, extending from 96th Street in the south and merging just south of 146th Street. The City of Carmel is noted for having well over 100 roundabouts within its borders.

<text>Fishers is a city in the Fall Creek and Delaware townships in Hamilton County, Indiana, United States. With a population of 104,094 as of 2025, it is the fourth-most-populous community in Indiana. A northside suburb of Indianapolis, Fishers has grown rapidly in recent decades: about 350 people lived there in 1963, 2,000 in 1980, and only 7,500 as recently as 1990.

After the passage of a referendum on its status in 2012, Fishers transitioned from a town to a city on January 1, 2015. The first mayor of Fishers, Scott Fadness, and with the city&#x27;s first clerk and city council were sworn in on December 21, 2014.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1802, William Conner settled what is now Fishers. Conner built a log cabin and a trading post along the White River. The land that Conner settled is now known as Conner Prairie and is preserved as a living history museum.

Settlers started moving to the area after Indiana became a state in 1816 and the Delaware Indians gave up their claims in Indiana and Ohio to the United States government in 1818 in the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s. At the treaty William Conner served as an interpreter for Chief William Anderson, his father-in-law. At the time William Conner was married to Mekinges Conner, daughter of Chief William Anderson. In 1823, Hamilton County was chartered by the Indiana General Assembly and Delaware Township was established and surveyed. After the state of Indiana moved its capital to Indianapolis from Corydon in 1825, the community started to grow. After the move, John Finch established a horse-powered grinding mill, a blacksmith shop, and the area&#x27;s first school. The next year the area&#x27;s first water mill was constructed.

During 1826 the West-Harris House, later nicknamed Ambassador House, was built near the White River at present-day 96th Street and Allisonville Road in Fishers. The home was moved to its present-day site at 106th Street and Eller Road in 1996. Addison C. Harris (1840–1916), a prominent Indianapolis lawyer and former member of the Indiana Senate (1876 to 1880), acquired the property in 1880 and had the home remodeled and enlarged around 1895. Harris and wife, India Crago Harris (1848–1948), used the home as a summer residence. Its nickname of Ambassador House relates to Addison Harris&#x27;s diplomatic service (1899 to 1901) as U.S. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Austria-Hungary during President William McKinley&#x27;s administration. The restored Ambassador House is located on the grounds of Heritage Park at White River in Fishers and is operated as a local history museum and a site for community events and private rentals.

In 1849, construction began on the Peru &amp; Indianapolis Railroad, extending from Indianapolis to Chicago. The railroad brought several people to the area then known as &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Switch&quot;. In 1872, Fisher&#x27;s Switch, also known as &quot;Fishers Station&quot;, was platted by Salathial Fisher at the present-day intersection of 116th Street and the railroad. Indiana&#x27;s General Assembly incorporated Fisher&#x27;s Station in 1891.

The William Conner House and West-Harris House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===20th century===
In 1908, the post office changed the name of Fishers Switch to &quot;Fishers&quot; by dropping &quot;Switch.&quot;

After William Conner&#x27;s death in 1855, his family farm became a place of interest. The Hamilton County Historical Society placed a marker on the site of the William Conner farm in 1927. Eli Lilly, then head of Eli Lilly and Company, purchased William Conner&#x27;s farm in 1934 and began restoring it. In 1964, Lilly asked Earlham College to oversee the Conner farm, now known as Conner Prairie.

In 1943, the Indianapolis Water Company constructed Geist Reservoir in order to prevent a deficit in Indianapolis&#x27;s water supply. They believed that Fall Creek and the White River would not keep up with the demand for water in Indianapolis. In the 1970s, the company wanted to triple the size of the lake, but the plan was rejected in 1978 and homes began to spring up around the reservoir. Germantown, a small settlement, currently resides at the bottom of the reservoir.

The Fishers population grew slowly to 344 by the 1960 census when rail shipment declined. Per township referendums in 1961, the town provided planning services for Delaware and Fall Creek Townships and approved residential zoning for most of the undeveloped area in the two townships.

The relocation of State Road 37 to the east side of town and the connection with Interstate 69 ensured the future growth of Fishers as a commercial and residential center. The town of Fishers would soon become a fast-growing suburb of Indianapolis. Fall Creek Township became the site of a consolidation of area schools when Hamilton Southeastern High School was formed in the 1960s. In 1989 the town&#x27;s population reached 7,000 and the first Freedom Festival was held. The festival has been held every year since then.

The Thomas A. Weaver Municipal Complex opened as Fishers&#x27; civic and government center in 1992. The complex is home to the Fishers City Hall, the police and fire department headquarters buildings, the Fishers Post Office, the Hamilton County Convention and Visitor&#x27;s Bureau, and the Fishers Chamber of Commerce. Eventually, a library and an office of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles were added. This is still the center of government in Fishers.

===21st century===
The 2000 census reported the population of Fishers at almost 38,000. With the town&#x27;s affordable homes, growing economy, and proximity to Indianapolis and Interstate 69, the growth in Fishers was tremendous. In 2003 the town of Fishers requested a special census from the U.S. Census Bureau to accurately measure the rapid population growth since 2000. This census would put the town&#x27;s population at 52,390, a 38 percent increase from the 2000 census. Since then much of the government&#x27;s resources have been devoted to building parks, maintaining roads, and managing the rapid growth of the town.

In 2005, after a controversy over alleged mismanagement, Conner Prairie formally split from Earlham College, becoming an independent corporation.

In January 2009, the Geist United Opposition conceded a four-year legal battle with Fishers over the involuntary annexation of the contiguous, unincorporated area around Geist Reservoir. This allowed Fishers to annex and incorporate this area of 2,200 homes on January 2, 2010, and to begin taxing it in 2011. This increased Fishers&#x27; population by about 5,500, making the town the eighth-largest community in Indiana.

In 2012, Fishers constructed a multipurpose trail in the downtown district and an amphitheater in the Thomas A. Weaver Municipal Complex. That November, the town announced the details of a major development project in the heart of downtown. The $33 million pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use development on the north side of 116th Street, just west of Municipal Drive, broke ground in mid-2013 and was scheduled to be completed in 2015.

====City controversy====
In 1998, a referendum to change Fishers from a town to a city was rejected by 75% of the town&#x27;s voters.

In 2008, a group named &quot;CityYes&quot; began collecting petition signatures for a voter referendum on the question of whether or not to become a city. The town appointed a 44-member citizen study committee to review the benefits and drawbacks of a change of government type.

In December 2010, the Fishers Town Council approved two referendum questions: whether or not to become a traditional city with an elected mayor and traditional city council or a modified city with a mayor elected by and from the expanded nine-member city council. The latter would have also merged the governments of Fishers and Fall Creek Township. In the referendum held November 6, 2012, voters rejected the merger with Fall Creek Township to become a modified city with an appointed mayor 62% to 37%, while approving a change to a traditional &quot;second-class city&quot;, with an elected mayor 55% to 44%.

In 2023, Indy Fuel owner, Jim Hallett, purchased the rights to an Indoor Football League (IFL) team. In December 2023, the team name was revealed to be the Fishers Freight. The team will compete in the upcoming 2025 season, playing eight home and eight away games.

=== Safety ===
Fishers consistently receives strong marks for safety. It was recognized as the fourth safest city in the U.S. in a 2024 study by MoneyGeek. The study based its selection on low crime costs, among other factors. The result aligns with findings of other studies. In June 2023, SmartAsset also listed Fishers as the fourth safest suburb in the country. Both studies used similar metrics to determine their rankings.

==Law and government==
Despite its large size, Fishers, unlike nearby Noblesville and Carmel, retained the status of a town for several years. Until 2012, Fishers used a council–manager government with a seven-member town council and a clerk-treasurer, all elected at-large for four years. The town council held both legislative and executive powers while the clerk-treasurer was responsible for financial matters. The council elected a council president (the final president being John Weingardt) and vice president yearly. The council employed and oversaw a town manager responsible for municipal personnel, budget, and day-to-day operations of the town government.

After the changes approved in the November 2012 referendum, the town became a &quot;second-class city&quot;, with an elected mayor, city clerk and nine-member city council. on January 1, 2015, following the election of the new officers in the 2014 general election.

==Education==

The city is part of the Hamilton Southeastern Schools, a district serving almost 21,000 students.

Fishers&#x27;s quickly growing population has created a need for a similar growth in the number of schools within the Hamilton Southeastern Schools district. In 1996, there were four elementary schools, one middle school, one junior high school, and one high school. With the openings of Riverside School and Fishers High School in the 2006–2007 school year and Thorpe Creek Elementary in the 2008–2009 school year, the district has twelve elementary schools, three intermediate schools, three junior high schools and two high schools.

The city&#x27;s two public high schools are Hamilton Southeastern High School and Fishers High School. An investment of $10,000,000 was made in Fishers High School and Hamilton Southeastern High School&#x27;s state-of-the-art College and Career Academy additions, allowing students to experience a more relaxed, college campus-like experience. The glass classroom walls located in the new addition slide open to extend the classroom into the common area.

The twelve elementary schools are Brooks School Elementary, Cumberland Road Elementary, Durbin Elementary, Fall Creek Elementary, Fishers Elementary, Geist Elementary, Harrison Parkway Elementary, Hoosier Road Elementary, Lantern Road Elementary, New Britton Elementary, Sand Creek Elementary, Thorpe Creek Elementary, and Southeastern Elementary. Each school averages about 1,000 students in attendance.

The four intermediate schools, which students attend through fifth and sixth grade are Fall Creek Intermediate, Riverside Intermediate, Sand Creek Intermediate, and Hamilton Southeastern Intermediate.

The four junior highs, which students attend through seventh and eighth grade, are Fishers Junior High, Hamilton Southeastern Junior High, Riverside Junior High, and Fall Creek Junior High.

Fishers also has several private schools, including Community Montessori School (PK-5), St. Louis de Montfort (PK-8), and Eman Schools (PK-12). Additional private schools are located in surrounding communities.

==Transportation==
Fishers is located along Interstate 69. The city currently has four exits off the interstate. Fishers is northeast of downtown Indianapolis and from the Interstate 465 loop which connects Interstate 69 with Interstate 65, which runs northwest to Chicago and southward to Louisville; Interstate 70, running east to Columbus and southwest to St. Louis; and Interstate 74, running northwest towards Danville, and southeast towards Cincinnati. State Road 37 runs directly through Fishers, connecting Fishers with several other Indiana cities and towns.

Fishers does not have direct service from IndyGo, the regional bus service. Fishers is featured in the first phase of the Indianapolis mass transit plan, featuring a light rail system that will run from downtown Indianapolis through Fishers to Noblesville.

The roads in Fishers are mostly new and well-maintained. 116th Street won the American Concrete Pavement Association Main Street Award in 2006. A number of the town&#x27;s four-way stops are being replaced by roundabouts.

On April 10, 2012, the town of Fishers announced a $20 million investment in the 2012 &quot;Drive Fishers&quot; initiative; an effort that will focus on areas in Fishers that have had a history of high-traffic volume, such as 96th Street and Allisonville Road, State Road 37, and Fall Creek Road in Geist.

<text>Noblesville is a city in and the county seat of Hamilton County, Indiana, United States, a part of the north Indianapolis suburbs along the White River. The population was 69,604 at the 2020 census, making it the state&#x27;s 10th most populous city, up from 14th in 2010. The city is part of Delaware, Fall Creek, Noblesville, and Wayne townships.

Noblesville is home to Ruoff Music Center (formerly Klipsch Music Center and Deer Creek Music Center), the Indianapolis metro area’s primary outdoor music venue. Since its opening in 1989, the nearly 25,000-seat amphitheater has been a popular stop for many touring musicians, consistently ranking first (or in the top three) among outdoor music venues in the world, for ticket sales, according to &quot;Pollstar&quot;.

==History==

Noblesville&#x27;s history dates to 1818 when the government purchased the land that is now Hamilton County from the Native Americans in this area. William Conner, the only settler living in the area at the time, and his wife Mekinges Conner, a Lenape woman, established the first trading post in central Indiana in 1802 and lived in the area&#x27;s first log cabin. William Conner and Josiah Polk laid out what is now downtown Noblesville in 1823, which was designated as the Hamilton County seat in 1824 and incorporated in 1851. Conner&#x27;s 1823 home is now one of a village of historic buildings that make up Conner Prairie Pioneer Settlement, a living history museum south of Noblesville in Fishers.

Noblesville was named either for James Noble, one of the first two U.S. senators from Indiana, or, according to legend, for Lavina Noble of Indianapolis, to whom Josiah Polk was engaged.

The Peru and Indianapolis Railroad was completed through town in 1851, strengthening the town economically and causing the population to increase. In 1875 work began on the town&#x27;s second railroad, the Anderson, Lebanon and St. Louis, later known as the Midland.
The city&#x27;s first large growth period occurred during the Indiana gas boom, with the discovery in 1888 of Noblesville&#x27;s first natural gas well near 11th and Pleasant streets. Many Victorian homes, as well as most of the downtown commercial district, were built during this time of prosperity. The city has undergone another increase recently as its population grew from 28,590 in 2000 to 51,969 in 2010. This growth echoes the increase in population of much of southern Hamilton County due to its proximity to Indianapolis.

Noblesville was once noted for its flour mills, the mostly widely known of which was the Noblesville Milling Company, producer of Diadem and Kismet flours. In 1925, the manager of the company offered to buy uniforms for the local high school athletic team in exchange for the school adopting the nickname &quot;Millers&quot;. The nickname persists to this day.

Other prominent businesses included the Union Sanitary Manufacturing Company, the American Strawboard Company and Firestone Industrial Products.

Among the notable disasters that have struck the town are the Great Flood of 1913, an interurban wreck on the courthouse square in 1919, and the Goeke fire of 1967. The fire, which began at the Paul Goeke auto dealership just off the square, destroyed two buildings and killed a firefighter&#x27;.

The old Hamilton County Sheriff&#x27;s Residence and Jail on the southwest corner of the courthouse square in downtown Noblesville is now the home of the Hamilton County Museum of History. As a working jail, it once housed Charles Manson as a teenager and D. C. Stephenson, former Grand Dragon of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan. The Stephenson trial, which took place in the adjoining Hamilton County courthouse in 1925, broke the power of the Klan in Indiana and drew national attention to Noblesville. Stephenson was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Madge Oberholtzer.

During the early 1920s, Noblesville was one of several Indiana towns where the Ku Klux Klan was active, but the Klan&#x27;s influence quickly faded after Stephenson&#x27;s conviction. In 1973 Klansmen staging a march in Noblesville were met by counter-demonstrators carrying anti-Klan placards.

In 1995, a local contractor stumbled across a trunk containing Klan paraphernalia and membership records from the 1920s. The debate over how to handle the sensitive issue again put Noblesville in the national spotlight. The Hamilton County Historical Society, which received donated materials, opted to keep the public from seeing the former members&#x27; names.

Noblesville also attracted national media attention in 1965 when &quot;Noblesville Daily Ledger&quot; editor James T. Neal was charged with contempt by Hamilton County Circuit Court judge Ed New. Neal&#x27;s fight for the First Amendment went before the Indiana Supreme Court. In May 2018, it drew national attention again as the Noblesville West Middle School was the site of a school shooting with a teacher and student injured.

<text>Sheridan is a town in Adams Township, Hamilton County, Indiana, United States. The population was 2,665 at the 2010 census. The center of population of Indiana is located just northwest of Sheridan.

== History ==

Sheridan, once the second largest town in Hamilton County, lies on the south edge of land originally owned by George Boxley, a merchant and miller in Virginia who had fled from there ahead of bounty hunters because he was also an abolitionist suspected of fomenting a failed slave rebellion in 1815. Considerable recent development has greatly increased the population of this historic town. The Sheridan Downtown Commercial Historic District encompasses approximately four blocks along Main Street from the former Monon railroad right-of-way north to Veteran&#x27;s Park and Pioneer Hill, the site of the George Boxley Cabin, listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

The origins of Sheridan, which started out as Millwood, are vague, owing partly to the loss of all the town&#x27;s records in 1913 when a disastrous fire destroyed the town hall and many other buildings. No documentation supports the popular contention that Egbert Higbee started the town in 1860. Higbee, born in Ohio and brought to Adams Township as a child, did, indeed, lay out a town he called Millwood on land adjacent to the district school (built 1851) on the state road. He had acquired his land in parcels and filed his town plat in April 1866. Only two-and-a-half blocks divided into twenty lots, it was oriented in an east–west direction along the south side of the Lafayette-Noblesville state road, which Higbee designated as Main Street (present day Second Street; his “West Street” became Main). Higbee immediately began to sell off lots to enterprising merchants and a few mill owners, and the little village got its start. Higbee himself built a mill and laid out additions to his original plat. Caswell Boxley, however, subdivided the south edge of his land, which adjoined Higbee&#x27;s plat across the state road and he laid out his own plat of Millwood immediately north and extending west of Higbee&#x27;s. The initial town orientation was succeeded by one that placed Main Street in a north–south direction. In a few years the hamlet of Millwood applied for a post office and was granted one on January 30, 1871. Since there was already an existing post office in a village of the same name in Kosciusko County, this Millwood was rechristened “Sheridan,” in honor of Civil War general Philip Sheridan. The town had something of an identity crisis for a few years as some people continued to call it Millwood while others used the new name of Sheridan—even in official records. Its location on the state road connecting Noblesville and Lafayette was a good site for an agricultural center. By this time other entrepreneurs had laid out additions to Millwood as well, but growth was slow until the coming of the Monon Railroad in 1882 which stimulated a commercial and industrial boom. Several significant buildings from that early period survive, including the H.J. Thistlethwaite Building, constructed in 1886 to boast an opera house, a lodge room and retail spaces.

Industry soon clustered along the railroad toward the south end of Main Street. The Monon passed through Sheridan at a sharp angle from northwest to southeast. In no time it was lined with various mills and factories. The buzzing Town of Sheridan incorporated in 1886. The subsequent discovery of natural gas on West 3rd Street in 1888 boosted the town&#x27;s growth even further as several additional industries chose to locate there. Sheridan&#x27;s movers and shakers eagerly expanded their holdings to take advantage of this inexpensive fuel, which, unfortunately, as in the several other “gas boom” counties of Indiana, soon ran out. But for a time, Sheridan even boasted both glass factory and a cannery along with a large brickworks, the Thistlethwaite Tile and Brick plant. Several smaller brick manufacturers, along with numerous other industries, including Indiana Condensed Milk—a company purchased by Wilson&#x27;s Milk, a leader in canned condensed milk. Despite the waning gas supply, many industries remained. Sheridan, around the turn of the twentieth century had become the second largest town in the county with a thriving commercial district along Main Street. Included were a large variety of stores, several hotels, banks, and lodges still sharing the street with a few dwellings. Many of these buildings survive, including the two large commercial buildings on Main—the Golden Rule general merchandise store and the dry goods store of Stanley Brothers. Both were constructed in the 1890s. The town applied to Andrew Carnegie for funds to build a library, a structure completed in 1912.

The great conflagration of 1913 started in a lumber company and destroyed much of the south end of downtown—mostly wood-frame structures. The Town Hall, which had stood on the east side of Main south of 5th Street, burned. After the fire, a new brick building was constructed at the southwest corner of Main and Cora (presently Jaycee) streets—previously the site of a livery stable that also burned. The aftermath of the fire resulted in considerable change downtown. Over the next 15 years, scattered houses on Main Street disappeared and were replaced by commercial buildings. Only the far north end of Main Street retained its original residential character. Several new businesses appeared, including several movie houses, although even before the fire, Sheridan had been proud that it possessed more than one nickelodeon. Another type of business that seemed to thrive downtown in the interwar years was the automobile dealership, but little evidence of any of these remain. The last bank of several institutions that had been established in town—the newly formed American State Bank of Sheridan—built its headquarters in 1914 at Main and Fourth. It remained to house a bank until 2006. Another beautiful former bank building built after the fire was the Farmers National Bank of Sheridan, now part of the adjacent hardware store. Sheridan&#x27;s post office had initially been established within a general store on Second Street (the state road) east of Main Street. There were a number of other locations, among them a building on the west side of Main north of the American State Bank, from which the post office moved into its beautiful New Deal-funded building in 1940.

In the decades after World War II, other commercial areas developed. Some were along State Road 38 as it entered Sheridan from the east, and later, along State Road 47 on the south edge of town. But downtown Sheridan retained its character, and a substantial number of the historic buildings constructed from the 1880s to the 1930s remain intact. They constitute a three-dimensional historic document of Sheridan&#x27;s boom years and stand at the heart of its new growth.

The George Boxley Cabin, Davenport-Bradfield House, and Sheridan Downtown Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Westfield is a city in Hamilton County, Indiana, United States. It is a northern suburb of Indianapolis. As of 2023, the population was 58,410. Westfield is in the Indianapolis metropolitan area.

== History ==
Westfield was founded on May 6, 1834, by North Carolina Quakers Asa Bales, Ambrose Osborne, and Simon Moon. It is believed that the town was planned as a stop on the Underground Railroad with many families of the Religious Society of Friends and the Wesleyan Methodist Church supporting the cause. When the laws against aiding escaped slaves were made harsher, part of the Westfield Quaker Friends Meeting House split off into the Anti-Slavery Friends meeting.

Westfield was incorporated as a town in 1849.

On January 1, 2008, Westfield was incorporated as a city, and Andy Cook was sworn in as mayor. With recent annexations in southern Washington Township and rapid population growth in areas previously within the town limits, the city population in 2010 (30,068) was more than triple that of 2000 (9,293). Because of the growing size of the city, officials are planning a major revitalization of city&#x27;s downtown. New additions to downtown Westfield are expected to include a new library and city hall.

The Union High Academy Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

In 2014, the city opened Grand Park Sports Complex which hosted the 2016 Big Ten Conference Men&#x27;s Soccer Tournament.

<text>Greenfield is a city in and the county seat of Hancock County, Indiana, United States It lies in Center Township and is part of the Indianapolis metropolitan area. The population was 23,488 at the 2020 census.

Greenfield was a stop along the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad that connected Pittsburgh to Chicago and St. Louis.

==History==
Hancock County was created on March 1, 1828, and named for John Hancock, the first person to sign the Declaration of Independence. The town of Greenfield was chosen as the county seat on April 11, 1828. The Commissioners announced, &quot;The seat of Justice of Hancock County shall be known and designated by the name and title of Greenfield.&quot; The population of the county at that time was 400.

Early settlers built along the two creeks which flow south through Center Township, which includes Greenfield. The first businesses were small gristmills for grinding corn and wheat for settlers.

U.S. Route 40, the National Road, was built through Hancock County around 1835. It was heavily traveled by wagon trains going west and livestock going to Cincinnati. In 1853, the first steam railroad was completed by the Indiana Central Railroad at the south edge of Greenfield. The railroad became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system and later the Penn-Central. These tracks were removed in the 1980s.

During this time, Greenfield&#x27;s population continued to grow. Greenfield was incorporated as a city in 1876 with a population of 2,023. The greatest single period of growth began in 1887 when natural gas was discovered in the area. Greenfield was a boomtown for 20 years, with the founding of manufacturing plants and other industries.

A statue of James Whitcomb Riley, which stands in front of the Hancock County Courthouse, was erected in 1918. It was purchased with money donated by school children from all over the United States. Each year, during the Riley Festival in October, the city&#x27;s school children parade to the statue to place flowers around it.

The Charles Barr House, Greenfield Courthouse Square Historic District, Greenfield Residential Historic District, Lilly Biological Laboratories, Lincoln Park School, and James Whitcomb Riley House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="112311" wikidata="Q1196479" url="?curid=112311" title="Corydon, Indiana">
<text>Corydon is a town in Harrison Township and the county seat of Harrison County, Indiana, located north of the Ohio River in the extreme southern part of the state. Corydon was founded in 1808 and served as the capital of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816. It was the site of Indiana&#x27;s first constitutional convention, which was held June 10–29, 1816. Forty-three delegates convened to consider statehood for Indiana and drafted its first state constitution. Under Article XI, Section 11, of the Indiana 1816 constitution, Corydon was designated as the capital of the state, which it remained until 1825, when the seat of state government was moved to Indianapolis. In 1863, during the American Civil War, Corydon was the site of the Battle of Corydon, the only official pitched battle waged in Indiana during the war. More recently, the town&#x27;s numerous historic sites have helped it become a tourist destination. A portion of its downtown area is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the Corydon Historic District. As of the 2010 census, Corydon had a population of 3,122.

==History==

===Early settlement===
During the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark captured the surrounding area of what became the town of Corydon from the British, bringing it under the control of the fledgling United States government. The first American settlers entered Harrison County in 1792 and included the families of Harvey Heth and Squire Boone, who settled south of Corydon, and Dennis Pennington and the Harbisons, who settled east of Corydon. The region was in the midst of the Northwest Indian War during that period and the families were forced by Native Americans to leave the region and return to Kentucky. The families returned to the area in 1800 following the creation of the Indiana territory.

The territorial government completed the land survey of what would become Corydon in 1807, and the first official land purchases occurred in April of that year. In 1803, Edward Smith and his family became the first Americans to settle in what would become Corydon. Following the completion of the 1807 land survey, he purchased the tract of land he had already been living on; at that time his family were the only recorded inhabitants of the future site of the town. He purchased land at the edge of a fertile valley near a large spring, which is the site of the present-day Harrison County fairgrounds. William Henry Harrison, the first governor of the Indiana Territory and a future president of the United States, often stopped to rest at the Smith&#x27;s home while travelling to and from Vincennes, the territorial capital.

In 1804 Harrison purchased a tract of land where Big Indian Creek and Little Indian Creek join to become Indian Creek and decided to build a town on the site. Harrison built a two-story home in the town, but sold it in 1809. The town gets its name from &quot;The Pastoral Elegy,&quot; a hymn that celebrates the death of a shepherd named Corydon. Tradition says that Harrison asked Edward Smith&#x27;s daughter, Jenny, to name the town and she chose the name from Harrison&#x27;s favorite hymn, &quot;The Pastoral Elegy.&quot;

Harrison sold the town site to Harvey Heth in 1807. Corydon&#x27;s official founding date of 1808 commemorates the year when Heth, a U.S. government surveyor and landowner, platted the town. Heth donated the town square for public use and sold individual lots to settlers and the territorial government. When Harrison County was established in 1808, Corydon became its county seat of government. The town originally consisted of 185 lots. In 1809 Corydon was connected by road to Doup&#x27;s Ferry, to the south at Mauck&#x27;s Port, providing access to the Ohio River for trade. The first county courthouse was built at the northwest corner of the town at the summit of High Street.

Corydon quickly grew into one of the most important early settlements in Indiana, in large part due to the political successes of its early inhabitants and as one of the main stops on the only land route to the territorial capital of Vincennes. During the War of 1812, Corydon sent a mounted militia company nicknamed the Yellow Jackets to support the territorial army. The company fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe, where it suffered more casualties than any other unit.

===Territorial capital (1813–1816)===

Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory on May 1, 1813, when it was relocated from Vincennes in Knox County. Opponents of William Henry Harrison, the former territorial governor, wanted to move the capital away from his political stronghold in Knox County. Supporters of the move felt that relocation of the territorial capital to the east would provide a more centralized location for its citizens, especially after its western portion was reorganized to form the Illinois Territory in 1809.

Corydon competed with Charlestown, Clarksville, Lawrenceburg, Madison, and Jeffersonville to become the new territorial capital. Dennis Pennington, a Harrison County representative and the speaker of the territorial legislature&#x27;s lower house, helped secure the town&#x27;s selection during the 1813 session of the Indiana Territory&#x27;s general assembly. Pennington pointed out that Corydon would be an ideal location. The Harrison County court had approved a design for a new county courthouse on Corydon&#x27;s public square in 1811 and it could be used as an assembly building for the territorial legislature. Pennington supervised construction of the limestone courthouse, which was nearly completed when Indiana&#x27;s first state legislature convened at Corydon in 1816. Prior to 1816, the territorial legislature met in the original county courthouse on High Street.

Paul and Susannah Mitchem became Quakers and immigrated to Harrison County from North Carolina in 1814, bringing with them 107 slaves whom they freed after arriving. Most of the former slaves then settled around the town of Corydon. Although some of the former slaves left, the group became one of the largest communities of free blacks in the state.

===Constitutional convention, 1816===

On April 19, 1816, President James Madison signed an Enabling Act that provided for the election of delegates to a convention at Corydon to consider statehood for Indiana. Forty-three delegates, including five men from Harrison County, convened June 10–29, 1816, to draft Indiana&#x27;s first state constitution. The preamble of the constitution acknowledges the site of the historic gathering: &quot;We the Representatives of the people of the Territory of Indiana, in Convention met, at Corydon, on Monday the tenth day of June in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixteen...&quot;

The delegates met in an unfinished log cabin near the Harrison County courthouse, which had not yet been completed; due to cramped conditions and the summer heat, the men often sought refuge outside under a giant elm tree, later named the Constitution Elm. Although the tree was lost to Dutch Elm Disease in 1825, a portion of its trunk has been preserved, surrounded by a sandstone memorial built by the WPA during the Great Depression in the 1930s. The delegates completed their work in nineteen days, adjourning on June 29, 1816, when the newly signed state constitution went into effect. As outlined in Article XI, Section 11, of the constitution of 1816: &quot;Corydon, in Harrison County shall be the seat of Government of the state of Indiana, until the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five, and until removed by law.&quot;

Corydon&#x27;s selection as the capital led to rapid growth of the town and a housing shortage. There were only three taverns for visitor lodging in 1813. A fourth and much larger tavern, the Kintner House Tavern, opened in 1819. Many officials, including three successive Governors, and their staff moved to Corydon and built large homes in the town. The town hosted meetings from national officials, including an 1819 visit by United States President James Monroe and Andrew Jackson.

===State capital (1816–1825)===

On November 4, 1816, the Indiana General Assembly met for the first time at Corydon under the new constitution and state government. President James Madison signed the congressional resolution admitting Indiana as the nineteenth state in the Union on December 11, 1816, and Corydon began a new era as the first state capital of Indiana.

The Harrison County courthouse, now known as the Old Capitol, served as Indiana&#x27;s first state capitol building. It housed state government offices from 1816 until 1825. Several other historic structures in Corydon date from the early statehood era, including the Governor&#x27;s Mansion and the Old Treasury Building (Indiana&#x27;s first state office building), which were built in 1817, and the Colonel Thomas Lloyd Posey home, among others. Corydon&#x27;s Grand Masonic Lodge, the first in the state, was built in 1819.

During the years Corydon served as a territorial and state capital, it was home to a number of politicians; notable residents during this time included Davis Floyd, a prominent local politician; two governors of Indiana, Jonathan Jennings and Ratliff Boon (the state&#x27;s first and second governors, respectively); Dennis Pennington, the first Speaker of the Indiana Senate; and William Hendricks, Indiana&#x27;s first U. S. Representative, its third governor, and a U.S. Senator.

The state constitution&#x27;s provision making Corydon the seat of state government was not a popular one, especially among the citizens of rival towns. Others expressed concern that the town&#x27;s geographic location in the extreme southern part of Indiana would become inconvenient as the state&#x27;s population center shifted northward; however, Dennis Pennington and other Harrison County representatives to the Indiana General Assembly successfully resisted attempts to move the seat of government from Corydon until 1825. Governor Hendricks signed a legislative bill in 1824 to move the state capital to Indianapolis, effective January 10, 1825.

===Post-capital period===
After the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis in 1825, Corydon continued its role as the seat of county government and a market town for the surrounding agricultural area. In 1826 a new County Clerk&#x27;s office was constructed which remained the principal county office until 1848. During the early days of the town, Big Indian Creek and Little Indian Creek were both used for drinking water, bathing, and sewage, which resulted in a cholera outbreak in 1832. Following the outbreak, the town only used the creeks for bathing and multiple wells were dug for drinking water. In 1836, the town began spreading gravel on the roads, which had been dirt roads before.

During 1848, a new two-story federal style brick office building was constructed on the east side of the county courthouse. This second office building remained in use until 1881. On September 11–14, 1860, the first annual county fair was held on Corydon&#x27;s fairgrounds. It has been an annual event since 1860, making it the longest consecutive-running annual county fair in the state. The fairgrounds, established in the southwest corner of town, are bordered on the south and west by a large ridge that served as a natural grandstand until the first grandstand was built, circa 1910.

===Battle of Corydon (1863)===

During the Civil War, Corydon was the site of the only &quot;official pitched battle&quot; fought in Indiana. On July 9, 1863, Confederate brigadier general John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s cavalry of more than 2,000 men crossed the Ohio River into Indiana to begin what is known as &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Raid&quot;. The Confederate troops opposed about 450 members of a hastily assembled home guard at the Battle of Corydon outside of town, but the Union forces were quickly defeated and the town surrendered.

Corydon was sacked in retaliation for Union looting in Kentucky, the town&#x27;s treasury of $690 was seized, and the inmates of the local jail were released. General Morgan demanded $600 to $700 in ransom from each mill and shop owner to keep their buildings from being burned. Tradition says one Corydon miller overpaid by $200; Morgan promptly returned it to him.

===Post-Civil War Period===
In 1871 local journalists began to bring the condition of the first Indiana statehouse to public attention. The building had become filthy and infested with fleas and other pests such that many people refused to enter it. Their campaign proved successful, and in 1873 the building was given a major renovation. The walls and ceilings were replastered, a new staircase and furnishings were installed, and the building was thoroughly cleaned.

In 1881 the county began construction of its third office building after demolishing the prior building. The building was completed in June 1882 and remained in use until 1929. The state of Indiana purchased the 1816 courthouse to preserve as a state historic site following the move. Beginning in 1882, the Louisville, New Albany and Corydon Railroad, an spur of the Southern Railway, connected Corydon to other towns in the region. Southern Railroad&#x27;s main line ran across northern Harrison County at Crandall, and remained open to passenger traffic until 1996. As of 2008, the line was owned by Lucas Oil. A major fire broke out in 1871, in which the Kintner House Tavern was destroyed, along with the entire block from Cherry to Beaver Streets. The county jail also burned in the blaze. A second major fire broke out in Corydon on April 20, 1883, in the west end of Corydon; seven businesses, stables, and multiple homes were destroyed. The fire would have spread further, but it slowed as it spread through a lumber yard containing only freshly cut timber that did not burn easily. This allowed the townspeople to get the upper hand and extinguish the fire, but most of the western portion of the town was burned. It was not until 1922 that all the lots were rebuilt.
In 1889 an attempted murder in Corydon resulted in a lynching. A mob of 150 mounted men, led by twenty masked Indiana white cap vigilantes, arrived at the county jail and demanded the release into their custody of two men (James Devin and Charles Tennyson) being held on charges of attempted murder. The leaders of the group demanded the keys to the jail, threatening to burn down the town if they were refused; after the sheriff refused to hand over the keys, the mob used hammers to knock down the jail doors and removed the two alleged assailants. The two men were dragged to the old Western Bridge, where they were hanged.

In 1917 the state of Indiana purchased the historic capitol building with the goal of restoring it. The Federal-style building opened as a state memorial in 1929–30; it is a part of the Corydon Capitol State Historic Site. The Harrison County government also used the former statehouse until a new, three-story county courthouse was completed in 1929, located on the north side of the original 1816 courthouse.

In 1960 a fire destroyed much of the Harrison County Fairgrounds, including its grandstand. A replacement grandstand was acquired from the minor league baseball team at Parkway Field in Louisville, Kentucky, is still in use.

In 1969 Corydon-born environmental historian Samuel P. Hays donated the Hayswood Nature Reserve to the county. Known as Hayswood Park, it is the county&#x27;s second largest nature reserve.

In 1973 a portion of Corydon&#x27;s downtown area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Corydon Historic District. Initially, the district included major sites dating from the period when Corydon was a territorial and state capital: the Old Capitol/Harrison County Courthouse building, the Governor Hendricks&#x27; Headquarters, Constitution Elm, the first state office building, the Kintner-McGrain House (Cedar Glade), and the Posey House, among others. In 1989 the historic district&#x27;s boundary was increased to include The Kintner House Inn, among other commercial and residential buildings.

In 2008 Corydon celebrated its bicentennial anniversary with a year-long series of events that included the unveiling of a $200,000 bronze statue of Honorable Frank O&#x27;Bannon, the late governor of Indiana and a former citizen of Corydon.

A local attraction in Corydon was Butt Drugs, a drugstore known for its unique name, service, and merchandise. The store opened in 1952 and closed in 2023.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name Crandall is derived from its founder Cornelius F. Crandall. It is often pronounced with the d belonging to the first syllable (e.g. Crand•all). The first syllable has a soft &#x27;a&#x27;. The second syllable is stressed with a soft &#x27;a&#x27; and a long &#x27;l&#x27;.

===Founding===
Crandall was laid out in 1872 by its namesake, Cornelius F. Crandall. Cornelius persuaded the builders of the Southern Railway (US) to move the planned route for their line through the area from its original surveyed path north of the present day State Highway 64 to its present path through the town of Crandall. Cornelius later moved to Texas where he founded Crandall, Texas
===The Great Fire===
In 1921 there was a great fire that destroyed a store and warehouse, the post office, and several houses on the east side of town; eleven buildings were destroyed in all. The town sprang back from the destruction, and by 1936 Al Gerdon of the Corydon Democrat writes of the businessmen of Crandall. He tells of an insurance salesman, the Crandall branch of the Harrison County Bank, the feed store, two general stores, the main office for the Harrison County Farm Bureau Corporation, Incorporated, and the well-known fox chasing conventions consisted of about seventy-five dogs that would chase the foxes on the outskirts of town.

===Early years===
During the 1930s Crandall became known for its saw mill and hatcheries that used the train to ship the baby chicks. Clarence A. Sims, the owner of the Thornwood Poultry Yards, introduced the world&#x27;s largest incubator at that time. It was fifty-eight by ten feet and took a carload of eggs to fill its 315,000-egg capacity that enabled the hatchery to set 105,000 eggs every week. Sixteen breeds of chickens were hatched and delivered to &quot;every state east of the Rocky Mountains.&quot; In June 1953 the passenger service ended thus leaving a freight line as the only rail service between Louisville and St. Louis.

<text>Laconia is a town in Boone Township, Harrison County, Indiana, United States. The population was 50 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Laconia is located at (38.032174, -86.085271).

According to the 2010 census, Laconia has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Laconia is a small farming community and was platted in 1816 by John Boone. The Boone family, prominent in the settlement of southern Harrison County, owned large tracts of land throughout the township which bears their name. The original town, consisting of 64 lots, was laid out on property of four owners: William Smith, William Winigar, William Williams, and William Madden Sr.

Because Laconia was the only town of any size in Boone Township, the settlement became the commercial center of the area. Laconia was the distribution center for mail and was served by the L&amp;N Railroad, which ran on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River.

Because of the proximity of an ample supply of lumber, the Elbert Brothers established a furniture factory near Laconia in 1868. The business burned in 1880 and was never rebuilt. Just south of town, John Ashton had a lumber mill which provided materials for many of Laconia&#x27;s structures.

Laconia at one time boasted three general stores, one on each corner of the town square, three hotels, several millinery stores, two doctors, a funeral parlor, and a saloon. The Laconia General Store, built in 1927, is the only remaining commercial building operating on the square.

Laconia is the home of an Odd Fellows Club first organized on May 20, 1875.

Two churches were established in Laconia. The Laconia Presbyterian Church was organized in 1874 and met in the town hall and private homes until 1880, when the present church was built on Cross St. The Laconia Methodist Church was organized in 1842. The minister traveled from Mauckport, about seven miles to the southwest, to conduct services. The present church was built in 1874 on Main St.

In March 1932, fire destroyed the frame two-story school known as Clay Hill College, and a new school was built of brick in 1932–1933 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Upon consolidation of the Harrison County Schools, the building was vacated in 1985. The late Bill Cook restored the structure and it now serves as a community center and apartments.

Another notable building in Laconia is on Main St, the Hurst House built in the Greek Revival style by Dr. Hurst in 1869.

<text>Mauckport is a town in Heth Township, Harrison County, Indiana, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 81 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In the earliest times Daniel Boone and his brothers, most notably Squire Boone, were regularly in the area of Mauckport. Squire Boone settled in the area in 1806. Squire Boone&#x27;s remains are just north of Mauckport in the Squire Boone Caverns.

The Mauckport area&#x27;s earliest permanent settlers came from the Shenandoah Valley and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The town was named after the Maucks, a German immigrant family who first settled in that area. The town itself is built upon land granted to John Peter Mauck in an 1811 land grant. It was his son, Fredrick, who filed the original plat for the town on May 7, 1827; the town was called Mauck&#x27;s Port. The original town had three streets running north to south and four streets running east to west. The original town was divided into 107 lots.

The first road from the state capital to the Ohio River, the region&#x27;s central means of transportation, was built in 1809 connecting the river at Mauckport with Corydon.

It was John Peter Mauck who started the state&#x27;s first ferry, a raft and tow line crossing from Mauckport to Brandenburg, Kentucky on the opposite side of the river. It was operating at least as early as 1808. In the early days of the state it was considered the best means of entering the region by immigrants. In the earliest days, packetboats hauled timber and farm products from the port to other stops along the river. Very early after the development of the steam ship, the town had a wharf and was a frequent stop for steam ships and river barges, as it being the closest river port to the original state capital of Corydon.

In 1847, the citizens of the town filed a petition to change the name of Mauckport to New Market. The petition was granted and it remained New Market until 1850, when it was changed back to Mauckport because of another New Market post office in Indiana. The town was first incorporated in 1853.

Mauckport was the site of a small skirmish in July 1863 during &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Raid&quot; in the American Civil War. Mauckport was where Morgan and his men, aided by the citizens of neighboring Brandenburg, Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River to start his raid in earnest. When he first attempted to cross, he was confronted by a small group of men from the Harrison County Legion, firing artillery from the shore and armed men aboard the riverboat Lady Pike. When Morgan returned fire with his own artillery the home guard quickly retreated back toward Corydon, leaving Mauckport undefended. Upon landing his army on the east side of Mauckport, Morgan burnt the steam boat Alice Dean. The citizens of Mauckport, having plenty of forewarning, abandoned the town and fled to the west until Morgan&#x27;s army passed.

In 1900, the Ohio River froze solid during the winter, destroying the town&#x27;s ships. In 1905 the river froze again, this time destroying the town&#x27;s wharf. This began the decline of the town, whose importance had been declining since the war.

The first car arrived in Mauckport in 1913, a &quot;Maxwell&quot; car, owned by Daniel Baker Beanblossom.

During the Ohio River flood of 1937, Mauckport was decimated. The largest part of the town was destroyed, leading to the majority of the population abandoning it. The Mauckport High School was discontinued in 1950 and in 1957, its use as an elementary school was also discontinued. The building was razed in 1958. Other factors contributing to the decline of the town&#x27;s population included the rise of the railroad, which led to less reliance on the river for transportation.

According to the US census, the population of Mauckport peaked in 1900 with a population of 290. It then decreased to 209 by 1930, and then declined following the 1937 flood to 154 in the 1940 census.

Today, Mauckport is the site of the Matthew E. Welsh Bridge, built in 1966, the only bridge crossing the Ohio River between New Albany, Indiana and Tell City, Indiana. Formerly a toll bridge, it is of through truss design and provides a link between Harrison County, Indiana and Meade County, Kentucky. Frederick Mauck is buried in an unmarked grave near the same bridge.

The oldest house in Mauckport now is owned by Mrs. Myrtle Fisher. It was built in 1850 by James H. Miller and is located on Back Street.

The town still celebrates &quot;Mauckport Days&quot; every spring with a parade, and weekend of activities, bazaar style booths, and competitions. It is attended by most of the townships residents and many from neighboring Washington and Posey Townships.

<text>New Amsterdam is a town located in Washington Township, Harrison County, Indiana, United States, along the Ohio River. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 12. As of the 2020 Census, New Amsterdam was the smallest city, town, or Census Designated Place in the state of Indiana. River Forest was the smallest in 2010 when it had 22, but had risen to 26. New Amsterdam now officially became the smallest town in Indiana with the population being 12, down from 27 in 2010.

==History==

The first settlers in what became New Amsterdam were James Riley and Jacob Youstler. Starting in 1815, they lived in New Amsterdam for several years before relocating further north. The town was formally platted on September 19, 1815, by Jacob Funk and Samuel McAdams.

The town relied on the Ohio River for its growth, as it was the main transportation route for migrating settlers as well as traders up and down river. Steamboats were active on the river during the 19th century and contributed to the growth of waterfront towns. In the 1860 census, New Amsterdam was the largest town in Harrison County.

Floods played a large part in the decline of the town. The Great Ohio River flood of 1937 destroyed 75% of the structures in the town. The only original building remaining in the town is the old country store. A marker on the second story of the building shows the height of the water in the 1937 Flood.

Today, the town has a general store, a Baptist church, a Methodist church, a town hall and a cemetery.

<text>Brownsburg is a town in Hendricks County, Indiana, United States. The population was recorded to be 21,285 residents at the 2010 Census. In 2020, the population was recorded as 28,973 residents.

==History==
Brownsburg was first settled in 1824 by James B. Brown. Delaware Indians lived in what is now called Lincoln Township, along White Lick Creek, which was then called &quot;Wa-pe-ke-way&quot; or &quot;White Salt&quot;.

Four years later, the first log schoolhouse was built in Brown Township. Brown and additional settlers arrived once a stagecoach line was established along a road built in 1820 connecting to Indianapolis. William Harris settled in the area north of what is now Main Street, selling sections of woods to incoming pioneers. This gave the town its original name of Harrisburg in 1835. A post office was established in 1836 under the name of Harrisburg but was later changed to Brownsburg, since the name Harrisburg was being used by a post office in another Indiana county.

From 1840 to 1870, Brownsburg tripled in size, increased from six to sixteen acres, and added its first church. The town&#x27;s first election was held in 1848. In 1863, it was divided into Brown Township and Lincoln Township.

In 1985, part of the movie &quot;Hoosiers&quot; was filmed in the former College Avenue Gym.
==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, Brownsburg has a total area of , of which (or 99.28%) is land and (or 0.72%) is water. White Lick Creek, a tributary of the White River, flows from north to south through the town, passing just west of the town center.

<text>Clayton is a small town in Liberty Township, Hendricks County, Indiana, United States. The population was 972 at the 2010 census, up from 693 at the 2000 census.

==History==
In 1829 a little town in Liberty Township was named &quot;Clayville&quot;, honoring Henry Clay, the Kentucky statesman. In 1835, Clayville consisted of ten houses and 43 people. The Town of Clayville was platted in 1851 by George W. Wills. The name was changed to &quot;Clayton&quot; in 1858 because another Clayville already existed in Dubois County.

The first two houses in Clayton were built by Thomas Potts and Lewis T. Pounds, and Parker &amp; Foote was the first store. George Wills built the first hotel, and John Miles and James Worrell developed the first flouring mill. The first train passed through in 1852. By the early 1900s, the town had electric service, supplied by the Danville Light, Heat and Power Co.

The first schoolhouse built in Clayton was erected in 1867. In the spring of 1868, Howard Mitchell started a subscription school in the new building. The first high school of the township was built in nearby Cartersburg in 1897. In the fall of 1901 the high school was transferred to Clayton, which made it nearer the middle of the township and the center of the school population.

In 1909 the town was incorporated and had a population of 497.

==Geography==
Clayton is located in southern Hendricks County. Indiana State Road 39 is the main road through the town, leading north to Danville, the county seat, and southeast to U.S. Route 40 at Belleville. Via US-40, Plainfield is east of Clayton. Interstate 70 passes south of Clayton, with access from State Road 39. Downtown Indianapolis is east of Clayton, depending on which highway is taken.

==Entertainment==

Clayton is known for its annual Fall Festival sponsored by the Clayton Community Association in September, featuring horse pulls, tractor pulls, live bands, food, kids&#x27; games, bingo, a parade and more. Clayton also sponsors the annual &quot;Triple F Ride&quot; in June which is a non-profit bike rally starting in Lambert Park. The park is also home to a &quot;Movies in the Park&quot; series on Friday evenings.

<text>Plainfield is a town in Guilford, Liberty, and Washington townships, Hendricks County, Indiana, United States. The population was 27,631 at the 2010 census, and in 2022 the estimated population was 36,074.

==History==

In 1822, a tract of land which included the area now known as Plainfield was obtained by Jeremiah Hadley of Preble County, Ohio. Ten years later he sold it to his son, Elias Hadley. Levi Jessup and Elias Hadley laid out the town in 1839. Plainfield was incorporated as a town in 1839. The town got its name from the early Friends (Quakers) who settled around the area and established several meetinghouses throughout the county, including the important Western Yearly Meeting of Friends in Plainfield. The Friends were &quot;plain&quot; people, and thus the name &quot;Plainfield&quot;. The high school continues to honor the Quakers, using the name for the school&#x27;s mascot.

Plainfield has long been associated with the National Road, U.S. Route 40, which goes through town as Main Street. One incident which brought Plainfield national attention occurred in 1842 when former President Martin Van Buren was spilled deliberately from his stagecoach into the thick mud of the highway. The practical joke came as a result of Van Buren&#x27;s vetoing a bill from Congress to improve the highway, a move which angered Western settlers. When Van Buren came through Plainfield on a swing to shore up his popularity for the 1844 election, a group of perpetrators set up the incident. The elm tree whose roots caused the president&#x27;s carriage to topple became known as the Van Buren Elm. An elementary school near this site is named Van Buren Elementary School.

<doc id="112346" wikidata="Q2183329" url="?curid=112346" title="Greentown, Indiana">
<text>Greentown is a town in Liberty Township, Howard County, Indiana, United States. Located approximately 9 miles east of Kokomo on State Road 22 / US 35; it is home to the Howard County Fair Grounds. The town was platted in 1848, and incorporated as a town in 1873. Known for its collectible glassware made for only a few years by a local factory destroyed in 1903, it is home to the Greentown Glass Museum. As of the 2010 census, the town&#x27;s population was 2,415.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Greentown has a total area of , all land. 
It was the nearest town to the epicenter of the magnitude 3.8 Indiana earthquake of December 30, 2010.

==History==
Greentown was laid out in 1848 on the site of a former Native American village. Its inception was largely due to the need for a nearby trading post by people living in the area. First was a merchant, L. W. Bacon who built a log house on the northeast corner of Main and Merdian. Next was C. O. Fry who built on the southwest corner of the intersection. Just prior to the establishment of these local stores, around 1840 the Miami tribe of the Algonquin native peoples had a population in Howard county of about two hundred. There was an established village where South Kokomo is located, as well as villages south of present-day Cassville and Greentown. The frequently traveled paths were from Kokomo to Peru by way of the village of Cassville, and from Kokomo to Meshingomesia by way of a village south of Greentown.

There are a few different versions of how Greentown received its name. One of the more obvious versions would be that Greentown was an area of luscious green grass. Another version deals with the fact that before the town was incorporated that land was a part of a former township named Green Township. Green Township formed into both Liberty and Union Townships in 1860, and so even though Greentown wasn&#x27;t incorporated until the 1870s people were still living there when it was Green Township, and may have possibly all opted to preserve Green Township in some way by naming their town after it. One other version is based on the idea of Greentown being an Indian settlement named after a Native American chief called Green.

Greentown was incorporated some time between 1870 and 1880 as it first appeared on the US census in 1880. The population started out at just over 200, and quickly reached a thousand. Over the years since, Greentown&#x27;s population numbers have seen notable gains every couple censuses followed by smaller drops between, which has enabled the town to slowly grow over time. The population has remained at nearly 2,500 since the 1990s. Greentown is expected to annex more area when the sewage treatment plant is updated, which is expected to bring another gain soon.

The Hy-Red Gasoline Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

In 2022, a large solar power plant was approved for development near Greentown. Some locals have contested this development, voicing concerns about noise and about the loss of farmland around a longtime farming community. Protesters have alleged that the County Administrators and company representatives violated the law by holding illegal closed-door meetings, locking the public out of deliberations.

==Notable people==

* Miriam Seegar, film actress
* Sara Seegar, film actress
* James A. Evans (1827–1887), civil engineer

==Glass industry==
Greentown&#x27;s first natural gas well came in 1877, and was located near the railroad on the west side of town. In years to come, D.C. Jenkins founded a glass manufacturing plant, Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Factory. The company was sold in 1899 to the National Glass Company. This company was fully operational until 1903 when a fire destroyed the building. The National Glass Company created glassware which is highly desirable today. The glass factory brought many jobs to the area and marked the town&#x27;s main period of industrial activity. After the factory burned down and the natural gas supply drastically declined, Greentown&#x27;s population dropped by about ten percent, and the town as a whole suffered severe loss of revenue. However, the town has since doubled in population from its industrial peak.

==Libraries==
Greentown is home to two public libraries, one in the elementary building and the other in the local high school. The libraries host many events in the community to get Greentown residents involved and interested in reading.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Following the passage of a law that permitted the seizure of lands for the purpose of building public roads, in 1869 the citizens undertook the building of two toll roads: the Kokomo and Greentown Gravel Road mostly on the south side of the Wildcat Creek finished in 1874 (today&#x27;s 50 North), and the Kokomo- Greentown- Jerome Gravel Road on the north finished in 1871 (today&#x27;s Sycamore Road). These two roads joined on 50 North and 780 East and came together into Greentown. By the early 1900s the toll gates were retired.

In modern times Main Street carries several highways; Meridian Street is the main north and south road. That is where historic downtown Greentown is centered, and the Howard County Fair is down Meridian Street just north of Greentown. The Elementary School is on Walnut Street, and Harrison Street is the location of Eastern Junior &amp; Senior High School. The football stadium is at the corner of Walnut and Harrison Streets.

===Rail===
The Interurban Railroad entered Greentown in 1902 and served the area until 1930. It offered rail transportation to the citizens of Kokomo, Greentown, and Marion in neighboring Grant County. While the Interurban was running, many workers from Kokomo and Marion settled in Greentown for more rural living with urban jobs, and transformed Greentown into a suburban &quot;bedroom&quot; community and small business center. However, following the departure of the Interurban Greentown has not again seen modern public transportation.

===Highways===
* US-35 to Logansport (North) and Muncie (South)
* IN-19 to Converse (North) and Tipton (South)
* IN-22 to Burlington and Kokomo (West) and Gas City and Hartford City (East)
* IN-213 from Greentown (North) to near Noblesville (South)

===Walking trails===
* Comet Trail – a trail that is a mile long. It is named after the local high school mascot.
* Historic Downtown Walking Trail – a trail that allows you to learn more about the area&#x27;s history.

==Demographics==

<text>Indian Heights is a neighborhood in Kokomo, Howard County, Indiana, United States. Indian Heights was a census-designated place (CDP) also before its annexation into Kokomo. The population was 3,011 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Kokomo, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. On January 1, 2012, the neighborhood of Indian Heights was legally annexed into the city of Kokomo&#x27;s corporate boundary. 

Mohawk Park is the only public park in the region; however, Taylor Elementary School has a playground in the back of the school. It also has some neighborhoods, the most famous being Ojibway, Miami, Algonquin, and Mohawk, which are named after Native American tribes.

==History==
Built in 1956 by Lusk Corporation and U.S. Steel, Indian Heights was long an unincorporated community and CDP outside Kokomo and grew rapidly. Kokomo annexed Indian Heights into the city in 2012, and Indian Heights now receives emergency first responder services from Kokomo rather than the county. Indian Heights still uses Taylor Schools though despite being in Kokomo since it is a part of Taylor Township.

By definition a CDP can not be an incorporated place, it can have no structured government, and has to be directly against another incorporated place, or have clearly defined natural boundaries. With that in mind Indian Heights is no longer eligible to be a CDP for Howard County. Instead it is possible for New London, Jerome, or Sycamore to take its place in the next election as they all fall under those guidelines.
