<text>Chicago Ridge is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 14,433. It is a suburb of Chicago.

==History==
Chicago Ridge takes its name from ridges left behind when trainloads of dirt were brought out by the Wabash Railroad during construction of the Columbian Exposition of 1893.

Incorporated on October 17, 1914, the village has an area of approximately and is located in the southwestern portion of Cook County, Illinois, about southwest of downtown Chicago.

The path of Stony Creek arcs through the village. It is not only an old creek but also the remnants of a feeder canal for the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal that reached from the Little Calumet River westward through the Saganash-kee Slough. Although the work on the feeder canal brought some settlers in the 1840s, German and Dutch farmers arrived after the 1850s.

Settlement increased with the coming of the Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railroad in 1882. Later, the Wabash would be crossed in the middle of Chicago Ridge by the Chicago and Calumet Terminal Railway, which also established rail yards in the village.

In 1898, the Paul E. Berger Company, manufacturers of cash registers and slot machines, located adjacent to the railroad. The Berger Company built housing for its employees, and a settlement emerged around the factory, with a tavern, rooming house, and grocery store. The first post office opened in 1900 in the Berger factory, and in 1902 the Wabash Railroad established a train station.

Both Chicago Ridge and Worth benefited from the activity and economic influences of a racetrack operating on 111th Street. Local residents proudly recall that a member of one of the founding families of the Chicago Ridge area, Fred Herbert, won the Kentucky Derby in 1910. The racetrack was torn down in 1911 and is now the site of Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

After Oak Lawn incorporated in 1909, Chicago Ridge considered the move. An incorporated government could replace wooden sidewalks, deal with the stagnant waters in the swampy areas, initiate local municipal services and provide locally elected and accountable officials. They accomplished those tasks and more. Their successors then built on those early improvements with paved streets, sewers, street lights, and sidewalks. They also brought Lake Michigan water to the area.

Chicago Ridge grew from 176 in 1920 to 888 in 1950. With the great demand for housing and the expansion of road networks to include expressways, Chicago Ridge was poised for growth. Along with a strong new industrial and commercial base, the population increased dramatically, to 5,748 in 1960 and 14,127 in 2000.

<doc id="110961" wikidata="Q578221" url="?curid=110961" title="Cicero, Illinois">
<text>Cicero is a town in Cook County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Chicago. As of the 2020 census, the population was 85,268, making it the 11th-most populous municipality in Illinois. The town is named after Marcus Tullius Cicero, a Roman statesman and orator. With over 89% of the town being of Hispanic descent, the town is the most Hispanic in the state of Illinois.

==History==
Originally, Cicero Township occupied an area six times the size of its current territory. The cities of Oak Park and Berwyn were incorporated from portions of Cicero Township, and other portions, such as Austin, were annexed into the city of Chicago.

By 1911, an aerodrome called the Cicero Flying Field had been established as the town&#x27;s first aircraft facility of any type, located on a roughly square plot of land about 800 meters (1/2-mile) per side, on then-open ground at by the Aero Club of Illinois, founded on February 10, 1910. Famous pilots like Hans-Joachim Buddecke, Lincoln Beachey, Chance M. Vought and others flew from there at various times during the &quot;pioneer era&quot; of aviation in the United States shortly before the nation&#x27;s involvement in World War I; the field closed in mid-April 1916.

After building his criminal empire in Chicago, Al Capone moved to Cicero to escape the reach of Chicago police. The 1924 Cicero municipal elections were particularly violent due to gang-related efforts to secure a favorable election result.

On July 11–12, 1951, a race riot erupted in Cicero when a white mob of around 4,000 attacked and burned an apartment building at 6139 W. 19th Street that housed the African-American family of Harvey Clark Jr., a Chicago Transit Authority bus driver who had relocated to the all-white city. Governor Adlai E. Stevenson was forced to call out the Illinois National Guard. The Clarks moved away and the building had to be boarded up. The Cicero riot received worldwide condemnation.

Cicero was taken up and abandoned several times as site for a civil rights march in the mid-1960s. Cicero had a sundown town policy prohibiting African Americans from living in the city. The American Friends Service Committee, Martin Luther King Jr., and many affiliated organizations, including churches, were conducting marches against housing and school &quot;de facto&quot; segregation and inequality in Chicago and several suburbs, but the leaders feared too violent a response in Chicago Lawn and Cicero. Eventually, a substantial march (met by catcalls, flying bottles and bricks) was conducted in Chicago Lawn, but only a splinter group, led by Jesse Jackson, marched in Cicero. The marches in the Chicago suburbs helped galvanize support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, extending federal prohibitions against discrimination to private housing. The act also created the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which enforces the law.

The 1980s and 1990s saw a heavy influx of Hispanic (mostly Mexican and Central American) residents to Cicero. Once considered mainly a Czech or Bohemian town, most of the European-style restaurants and shops on 22nd Street (now Cermak Road) have been replaced by Spanish-titled businesses. In addition, Cicero has a small black community.

Cicero has seen a revival in its commercial sector, with many new mini-malls and large retail stores. New condominiums are also being built in the city.

Cicero has long had a reputation of government scandal. In 2002, Republican Town President Betty Loren-Maltese was sent to federal prison in California for misappropriating $12 million in funds. Due to this corruption, Cicero is frequently overlooked as candidate for annexation with Chicago.

==Geography==

<text>Country Club Hills is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is a suburb south of Chicago. The population was 16,775 at the 2020 census.

==History==
10,000 years ago, during a glacial period, there was a complex of moraines in this area, before modern times.

Country Club Hills was historically known as Copper&#x27;s Grove, a German Farmer-based place, throughout the 1800s. It was used for growing crops, and a lot more at that time.

In the 1950s, Copper&#x27;s Grove started to transition into present-day Country Club Hills, where farms started to move away, and started to get more populated. As a result, Country Club Hills became a incorporated city in 1958. The first town hall was located on a farmhouse on the southeastern corner of present day Cicero Ave. and 183rd St. That building relocated to currently the Police Department building on 175th St in 1975.

The city has been developing rapidly since then, especially in 2006, where the city used a $16 million municipal bond to build a $5 million amphitheatre on the City Campus, a $2 million fire station, an upgraded community park, and various infrastructure improvement projects.

<text>Countryside is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 6,420.

==History==
The land where Countryside sits was originally inhabited by the Potawatomi Indians and later by early American pioneers in the beginning of the 19th century. Settler Joseph Vial and his family were among the first non-native people to settle in the Countryside area in 1833.

The area remained large expanses of rural farmland until the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, when the fire sent thousands of city dwellers into what is now west suburban Chicago. Land sold for only $2 an acre, which made areas such as Countryside a welcome respite from the congestion and industry in Chicago.

Despite the settlement of these early Countryside inhabitants, the area largely remained a quiet farming community until the post-World War II era when suburban areas such as Countryside began to experience explosive growth. The area&#x27;s first residential subdivision was LaGrange Terrace, built in 1947; it was later followed by the Don L. Dise and Edgewood Park subdivisions in the 1950s.

The City of Countryside was officially incorporated in 1960.

Around 1917, the Marx Brothers family (later a famous comedy team) bought a chicken farm near Joliet Road (Route 66) and La Grange Road. Groucho Marx later claimed that the brothers spent too much time at Wrigley Field watching the Chicago Cubs to make the farm economically viable.

==Government and politics==

=== Government ===
Crestwood is a Council–manager village. The mayor with the approval of the village board appoints a village manager to oversee the daily affairs of the village. The current village manager is William Graffeo, who has served in that role since 2010.

Crestwood&#x27;s government used to rebate to its residents a portion of their property and other municipal tax payments. It was praised by proponents of small government for its low taxes and cheap government. Crestwood&#x27;s rebates ended in 2009 so that the village could pay the legal fees associated with the contaminated water scandal.

Crestwood is home to several units of the Illinois National Guard, including Battery B, 2nd Battalion 122 Field Artillery; Company B, 404th Brigade Support Battalion; Company G, 634th Brigade Support Battalion; 108th Signal Company; and the 1744th Transportation Company.

On November 17, 2021, Mayor Louis Presta resigned after pleading guilty to a federal bribery case regarding red light cameras installed in the village.

Robert Stranczek, son of former mayor Chester Stranczek. Chester retired in October 2007, and it was then announced that Robert would be taking over his father&#x27;s role as mayor.

=== Politics ===
Crestwood is currently governed by the Crestwood United Party. The Crestwood United Party is composed of members from both the Republican Party and Democratic Party.

Crestwood is considered competitive on the state and federal level. It has been won by both democrats and republicans in recent years.

==Water contamination==

In April 2009, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in an investigative article titled &quot;Poison in the Well&quot;, reported that the water from a well used to supply residents with drinking water had been contaminated with chemicals (including two linked to the known carcinogen perchloroethylene) from dry cleaning solvents. Village of Crestwood officials, including Mayor Robert Stranczek, and the former mayor Chester Stranczek, were accused of secretly and illegally using the well and lying to regulatory authorities in order to cover that up. The ensuing investigation has generated three class-action lawsuits, two wrongful death lawsuits, and several federal raids. Tricia Krause, a mother of a son who had leukemia for six years and a daughter who had a brain tumor alerted the USEPA of the wrongdoings of the Village of Crestwood officials.

In April 2013, certified water operator Frank Scaccia pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement. Crestwood&#x27;s police chief and former water supervisor, Theresa Neubauer, was also found guilty of making false statements to regulators. Former Mayor Chester Stranczek was declared not fit to stand trial due to dementia.

<text>Deerfield is a village in Lake and Cook counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. A northern suburb of Chicago, Deerfield is located on the North Shore, about north of downtown Chicago. The population was 19,196 at the 2020 census.

Deerfield is home to the headquarters of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Baxter Healthcare, and Fortune Brands Home &amp; Security. Deerfield is often listed among the wealthiest and highest-earning places in Illinois and the Midwest. According to the United States Census Bureau, the median household income in Deerfield was $185,762 in 2022.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
Originally populated by the Bodéwadmiakiwen (Potawatomi), Myaamia (Miami), Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo), and Peoria Native Americans, the area was settled by Horace Lamb and Jacob B. Cadwell in 1835 and named Cadwell&#x27;s Corner. A shopping center located on the site of Cadwell&#x27;s farm at Waukegan Road and Lake Cook Road still bears that name. The area grew because of the navigable rivers in the area, notably the Des Plaines River and the Chicago River.

By 1840, the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Leclair&quot;. Within a decade, settler John Millen proposed a further name change to &quot;Deerfield&quot; in honor of his hometown, Deerfield, Massachusetts and the large number of deer living in the area. At the time, the alternate name for the village on the ballot was &quot;Erin&quot;. &quot;Deerfield&quot; won by a vote of 17–13.

The village&#x27;s first school, Wilmot School, was founded in 1847. Originally a one-room schoolhouse, Wilmot is now an elementary school which serves 548 students. It is located on land donated by Lyman Wilmot, whose wife, Clarissa, was the village&#x27;s first schoolteacher.

The village was incorporated in 1903, with a population in the low 400s.

In the 1850s, the Deerfield home of Lyman Wilmot served as a stop on the Underground Railroad as escaped slaves attempted to get to Canada.

=== 20th century ===
In a 1917 design by Thomas E. Tallmadge of the American Institute of Architects, Deerfield (and adjacent Highland Park) served as the center for a new proposed capital city of the United States. By that year, all of Deerfield&#x27;s original farms had been converted either to residential areas or golf courses.

On May 26, 1944, a US Navy plane crashed in Deerfield on the current site of the Deerfield Public Library, killing Ensign Milton C. Pickens. Following World War II, a portion of Waukegan Road (Route 43) that runs through Deerfield was designated a Blue Star Memorial Highway.

In 1959, when Deerfield officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to African Americans, they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as &quot;the Little Rock of the North.&quot; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by angry residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials. The developer, Morris Milgram, sued the city charging that it had violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled against Milgram, who then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to consider the case. The remaining land lay dormant for years before it was developed into Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. At the time, Deerfield&#x27;s black population was 12 people out of a total population of 11,786. This episode in Deerfield&#x27;s history is described in &quot;But Not Next Door&quot; by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield. On June 18, 2020, the Deerfield Park District Board voted to remove James Mitchell&#x27;s name from the park and later renamed it to Floral Park, which was the name originally intended for the sub-division that would have been built at that location.

Since the early 1980s, Deerfield has seen an increase in the population of Jews, Asians, and Greeks, giving the community a more diverse cultural and ethnic makeup.

On June 27, 1962, ground was broken by Kitchens of Sara Lee (now Sara Lee Corporation) for construction of the world&#x27;s largest bakery. The plant, located on the current site of Coromandel Condominiums on Kates Road, began production in 1964 using state-of-the-art materials handling and production equipment. It was billed as the world&#x27;s first industrial plant with a fully automated production control system and was designed by Stanley Winton. President Ronald Reagan visited the plant in 1985. The plant closed in 1990 as Sara Lee consolidated production in Tarboro, North Carolina. By 1991, headquarters employees had moved to downtown Chicago. In 2007, Sara Lee severed its final tie to its former home town with the closure of the Sara Lee Bakery Outlet Store.

In 1982, Deerfield began an experiment with a community farm. Two hundred residents applied for plots on a community garden. The project had such a strong initial success that the village opened additional community farms on vacant land in the village.

As of 1987 Deerfield was mostly made up of single-family houses. As of that year the resale prices of Deerfield houses ranged from $100,000 to $300,000. 43.5% of the town&#x27;s land consisted of single-family houses, while 1.1% contained multi-family housing. As of that year little of the remaining land was available for further residential development.

=== 21st century ===
On December 19, 2005, the village board passed a strict anti-smoking ordinance. The law bans smoking in all public places, including businesses, bars, restaurants, parks, parade routes, public assemblies, and within from any of the above.

In November 2007, BusinessWeek.com listed Deerfield third in a list of the 50 best places to raise children. The rankings were based on five factors: school test scores, cost of living, recreational and cultural activities, number of schools and risk of crime. Deerfield ranked behind Groesbeck, Ohio, and Western Springs, Illinois.

In 2015, a plan to rezone a parcel of land originally zoned for single-family homes, in order to allow the construction of a 48-unit affordable apartment building complex, was proposed. Some Deerfield residents were opposed to the proposition.

In 2018, the Village Board of Trustees unanimously approved a ban on what were described as certain types of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, amending a 2013 ordinance that regulated the storage of those items. This was done despite an Illinois State Preemption on any further municipal firearms restrictions after 2013, and the fact that amendments to municipal ordinances have to pass said amendments as separate ordinances. Lawsuits were filed challenging the Ordinance and the ban was eventually blocked by Lake County Circuit Court Judge Luis Berrones until the lawsuits could be heard. One of the lawsuits is based on the Illinois state preemption statute regarding local bans enacted after 2013.

Deerfield was a sister city with Lüdinghausen, Germany, until the commission was dissolved in October 2019 due to inactivity.

===Deerfield Historic Village===
Located in front of Kipling Elementary School is the Deerfield Historic Village, founded and maintained by the Deerfield Area Historical Society, this outdoor museum consists of five historic buildings and includes the headquarters for the Deerfield Historical Society. Tours are offered during the summer months.

The Historic Village includes the Caspar Ott House, where the Ott family assisted in the passage of slaves in the Underground Railroad, considered to be the oldest building in Lake County, built in 1837. It was restored by Bob Przewlocki. The George Luther House (1847) now includes the Society&#x27;s offices and Visitor Center. The Bartle Sacker Farmhouse (1854) is a typical 19th century home. While those buildings are all original (although relocated from their original sites), the carriage house and little red school house are replicas. Each year, all fourth graders in Deerfield School District 109 spend a day learning in the school house.

==Popular culture==
National Boss&#x27;s Day was invented by a Deerfield employee.

In 1979, Deerfield created a &quot;No-Kissing Zone&quot; at the local train station in response to complaints about traffic jams at the station caused by couples taking too long to kiss their goodbyes at the drop-off point. The &quot;No-Kissing&quot; signs (patterned after international traffic signs) attracted national attention and were featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine and ABC&#x27;s &quot;AM America&quot; (precursor to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;). A Deerfield family appearing on the game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; presented Richard Dawson, famous for kissing contestants on the show, with replica pins of the signs.

In the 1980s, Deerfield and other North Shore communities inspired the teen films of director/screenwriter John Hughes. The fictional Shermer, Illinois, included elements of Deerfield and neighboring Northbrook and Highland Park.

A number of media properties have been set and/or filmed in Deerfield, including television drama &quot;Once and Again&quot;, comedy &quot;Married... with Children&quot; and portions of reality show &quot;American High&quot;. In film, the Deerfield train station is shown in the film &quot;Risky Business&quot;, and &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; used various parts of the village.

The village was identified as the hometown of Kitty Pryde in the X-Men comics.

Deerfield also figures in the musical &quot;Dear Edwina&quot;, written by Marcy Heisler, a Deerfield native, and Zina Goldrich. The fictional protagonist lives on Birchwood Avenue. Although the play is set in Paw Paw, Michigan, much of it (including the address) is inspired by Heisler&#x27;s hometown, Deerfield.

In 2010, the History Channel&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Crumbling of America&quot; mentioned Deerfield in a discussion of frequent blackouts that residents experienced over 2000 times from 2000 to 2009.

<text>Des Plaines () is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 60,675. The city is a suburb of Chicago and is located just north of O&#x27;Hare International Airport. It is situated on and is named after the Des Plaines River, which runs through the city just east of its downtown area.

== History ==
Potawatomi, Ottawa, and Ojibwe (Chippewa) Native American tribes inhabited the Des Plaines River Valley prior to Europeans&#x27; arrival. When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s in what was then the Illinois Country of New France, they named the waterway &quot;La Rivière des Plaines&quot; (English translation: &quot;Plains River&quot;) as they felt that trees on the river resembled European plane trees. The first white settlers came from the eastern United States in 1833, after the 1833 Treaty of Chicago was negotiated, followed by many German immigrants during the 1840s and &#x27;50s. In the 1850s, the land in this area was purchased by the Illinois and Wisconsin Land Company along a railroad line planned between Chicago and Janesville, Wisconsin. In 1852, the developers built a steam-powered mill next to the river to cut local trees into railroad ties. Socrates Rand then bought the mill and converted it into a grist mill, which attracted local farmers. The Illinois and Wisconsin Railroad made its first stop in the area in the fall of 1854.

In 1857, the Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lac Railroad began running its route, stopping near the mill on the Des Plaines river, where a small business section had grown up. The railroad platted the prospective town of Rand at the site. In 1859, the Chicago and North Western Railway purchased the rail line, giving the train station the name &quot;Des Plaines.&quot; In 1869, the Rand subdivision&#x27;s name was changed to Des Plaines, and the village of Des Plaines was then incorporated.

Des Plaines was reincorporated in 1873 and elected a village board the following year. Local brick manufacturer Franklin Whitcomb served as the first Village President.

In 1925, village residents voted to convert to a city form of government and annexed the village of Riverview to the south. Subsequent annexations included the Orchard Place area in 1956. The city experienced rapid growth after World War II and with the opening of nearby O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

In 1955, Des Plaines became the site of the first McDonald&#x27;s franchise, which was torn down in 1984 and replaced by a museum the following year. The museum was demolished in 2018 after repeated flooding.

In 1979, Des Plaines was the site of the accident of American Airlines Flight 191, in which a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 departing from O&#x27;Hare lost an engine and wing material and crashed near a local trailer park just north of Touhy Avenue. All 271 people on board the aircraft died, as did two workers at a repair garage. Two more, along with three civilians, were injured.

In 2008, the Illinois Gaming Board awarded the state&#x27;s 10th casino license to Midwest Gaming and Entertainment LLC to build a casino on approximately adjacent to the Tri-State Tollway at the northwest corner of Devon Avenue and Des Plaines River Road. Midwest Gaming received the award despite having the lowest bid because other bidders were found unacceptable by the Board, with one board member finding no bidders acceptable. The city approved zoning in early 2010, and the casino opened in July 2011 as Rivers Casino.

In July 2022, the third largest winning lotto ticket in U.S. history, valued at $1.34 billion, was sold at a Speedway gas station in Des Plaines near O&#x27;Hare Airport on Touhy Avenue. , the winning ticket holder has not come forward or been identified.

==Geography==
According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Des Plaines has a total area of , of which (or 98.98%) is land and (or 1.02%) is water.

Des Plaines is traversed by two interstate highways – I-90 (the Northwest Tollway) and I-294 (the Tri-State Tollway).

Des Plaines is named for the Des Plaines River, which flows through it. The name is from 18th-century French referencing the American sycamore which resembles the European plane tree.

Portions of Des Plaines are underlain by the &quot;Des Plaines Disturbance,&quot; an area in which the layers of sedimentary rock are highly abnormal. This probably represents an ancient meteorite crater, beneath the town. The bedrock was highly fractured by the impact, with large blocks of sediment upended. The crater was eventually filled by glacial activity, so that no trace now remains on the surface.

Addresses in the city limits of Des Plaines have their own numbering system. Areas in unincorporated Maine Township have Des Plaines postal addresses that follow the Chicago numbering system. Devon Avenue in Des Plaines is 3200 South, while it is 6400 North in Chicago. Golf Road runs through a large unincorporated area as 9600 North with a Des Plaines mailing address but is 0 North/South when entering the Des Plaines city limits. As sections become incorporated, they take on the city numbering system. For instance in 2003, land at 9661 West Golf Road, Des Plaines, became 2323 East Golf Road, Des Plaines, when it was formally incorporated into the city limits. The largest unincorporated areas are in the O&#x27;Hare area and east of the Tri-State Tollway.

<doc id="110972" wikidata="Q499887" url="?curid=110972" title="Elgin, Illinois">
<text>Elgin ( ) is a city in Cook and Kane counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is located northwest of Chicago along the Fox River. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 114,797, making it the sixth-most populous city in the state.

==History==

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Black Hawk Indian War of 1832 led to the expulsion of the Native Americans who had settlements and burial mounds in the area and set the stage for the founding of Elgin. Thousands of militiamen and soldiers of Gen. Winfield Scott&#x27;s army marched through the Fox River valley during the war, and accounts of the area&#x27;s fertile soils and flowing springs soon filtered east.

In New York, James T. Gifford and his brother Hezekiah Gifford heard tales of this area ripe for settlement, and they traveled west. Looking for a site on the stagecoach route from Chicago to Galena, Illinois, they eventually settled on a spot where the Fox River could be bridged. In April 1835, they established the city, naming it after the Scottish tune &quot;Elgin&quot;.

Early Elgin achieved fame for the butter and dairy goods it sold to the city of Chicago. Gail Borden established a condensed milk factory here in 1866, and the local library was named in his honor. The dairy industry became less important with the arrival of the Elgin Watch Company. The watch factory employed three generations of Elginites from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, when it was the largest producer of fine watches in the United States (the factory ceased production in 1965 and was torn down in the summer of 1966) and the operator of the largest watchmaking complex in the world. Today, the clocks at Chicago&#x27;s Union Station still bear the Elgin name.

From 1910 until 1920, with the exception of the World War I years, the city hosted the Elgin National Road Races, which attracted the top national racing champions as well as many of the major automobile manufacturers. The races were sponsored by the Elgin Watch Company who offered a $1,000 prize and a silver trophy to the winner. The races contributed significantly to the development of the modern automobile.

Elgin has a long tradition of education and invention. Elgin is home to the Elgin Academy, the oldest coeducational, non-sectarian college preparatory school west of the Allegheny Mountains. Elgin High School boasts five Navy admirals, a Nobel Prize winner, a Pulitzer Prize winner, a Tony Award winner, two Academy Award-winning producers, Olympic athletes and a General Motors CEO among its alumni. Elgin resident John Murphy invented the motorized streetsweeper in 1914 and later formed the Elgin Sweeper Corporation. Pioneering African-American chemist Lloyd Hall was an Elgin native, as was the legendary marketer and car stereo pioneer Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz; and Max Adler, founder of the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, America&#x27;s first planetarium.

In the 1990s, Elgin became one of the few cities in northern Illinois to host a riverboat casino. The Grand Victoria Casino initially generated controversy, but went on to be a significant source of income for the city. Drawing nearly four million people annually, as of March 2005 it was the fifth most popular tourist attraction in Illinois. The Grand Victoria Foundation, to which the casino had contributed an amount in excess of $116 million, provides community grants to nonprofits in the city. In the years since, more casinos have opened in the area and the Grand Victoria Casino had seen attendance and revenue decline.

In 2013, Elgin ranked number one in the Chicago metropolitan area in new home starts while ranking second in new home closings. Elgin&#x27;s downtown has also been the center of city renovations and new developments. New townhouses, condo towers, loft spaces, and art galleries have opened in the last decade. In October 2003 the Gail Borden Public Library moved into a new $30 million, 139,980 square foot, 460,000 volume-capacity building, and in August 2009 opened its first-ever satellite branch. The 10,000 square foot Rakow Branch, situated on Elgin&#x27;s West Side, was LEED registered, and was designed to be expandable up to 30,000 square feet. Elgin opened the 185,000 sq. ft. Centre of Elgin recreation facility across the street from the library. In 2009, Gail Borden was one of five libraries to receive the National Medal for Museum and Library Service issued by the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington D.C. In 2014, Elgin completed the Central Business District Streetscape Improvement Project and the Riverside Drive Promenade.

A significant Laotian American community calls Elgin home. Elgin has been a sister city of Vientiane, the capital of Laos, since 1967. Some Laotian Americans have opened stores and restaurants, contributing to the city&#x27;s cultural diversity. Elgin is also home to a sizable Latino population, contributing to 45.7% of the population in 2020.

==Arts and culture==
Elgin is home to the Elgin Symphony Orchestra. Other classical music groups include the Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra, the Elgin Master Chorale, and the Elgin Children&#x27;s Chorus. Outdoor music can be heard at the Wing Park Bandshell. Theatre groups include the Janus Theatre Company, Elgin Theatre Company, the Independent Players, Children&#x27;s Theatre of Elgin, Fox Valley Youth Theatre, and Nothing Special Productions. Together, The Hemmens Cultural Center and Elgin Community College&#x27;s Visual &amp; Performing Arts Center host dozens of performances a year by performers ranging from Chicago&#x27;s Hubbard Street Dance Company to comedian Bill Maher.

After losing many landmark businesses in the 1980s, downtown Elgin experienced a renaissance in the 1990s with the arrival of the Grand Victoria riverboat casino and improvement in the local economy. Many historic buildings have been transformed into stylish clubs and restaurants.

===Architecture===

The city was known for its historic architecture and landmarks from the Victorian era, including some fine examples of homes in the Queen Anne style. Many of the most remarkable homes once belonged to National Watch Company executives. Many interesting Sears Catalog Homes arrived in Elgin as kits from 1908 to 1940. The Elgin Tower Building and the Elgin Professional Building are two large towers constructed in Elgin&#x27;s heyday, before the Great Depression. The Tower Building was recently renovated, converting it to residential apartments.

Predating Victorian homes were homes made of native cobblestone. It was believed that Elgin had at one time the largest concentration of cobblestone homes outside of Rochester, New York. Several such homes built by the earliest settlers still stand. They can be seen in Elgin&#x27;s historic districts, two of which are recognized by the National Register of Historic Places.

The Elgin Public Museum at Lords Park was the oldest building in Illinois built expressly as a museum that was still serving that purpose.

Open Elgin is a free, self guided tour of downtown Elgin&#x27;s architecture. Each April, over two dozen buildings are accessible on the tour, though the event has been postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The nine-member Elgin Heritage Commission promotes historic preservation activity. The Gifford Park Association was also active in historic preservation, and conducts a popular annual house tour.

==Parks and recreation==
Elgin&#x27;s city parks include Lords Park, which features the Elgin Public Museum and a small zoo featuring a herd of American bison, and Wing Park, which includes a golf course and outdoor swimming pool. Other golf courses within Elgin include the Highlands of Elgin, the Elgin Country Club, and Bowes Creek Country Club. The Centre of Elgin, which among other features includes an aquatic park and a climbing wall, remains one of the largest municipal recreation centers in the United States. The Elgin Sports Complex on the city&#x27;s southwest side offers ten lighted ballfields, ten soccer fields and The Hill BMX track. The complex hosts several local, regional and national tournaments every year. Elgin connects to Algonquin and Dundee to the north, and St. Charles, Geneva, and Batavia to the south by the Fox River Trail bike path.

Although one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in Illinois, Elgin still retains some of the natural habitat diversity that first brought settlers to this area. On the east, the city borders the Poplar Creek Preserve, maintained by the Cook County Forest Preserves, which includes bike trails, hiking trails and equestrian trails. The Shoe Factory Road Prairie located in the preserve provides an example of the hill prairies that once dotted the region. Poplar Creek Preserves connects to the Spring Creek Valley Forest Preserve via a conservation easement covering parts of the Sears campus.

Elgin boasts two highly protected nature preserves, the Bluff Spring Fen and Trout Park. For its size, Bluff Spring Fen has a remarkable number of distinct plant communities, including a hill prairie and a fen, or alkaline spring marshland, which is home to several rare orchids. Trout Park also includes a similar calcareous seep community, with the addition of a unique forest community of oaks, ashes, maples, and uncommon species such as arborvitae and witch-hazel. When the park was created in the 1920s, the local newspaper ran a lengthy front-page story with lists of the plant species of Trout Park, reflecting both the great variety of plants present and the interest Elginites had in conservation. In the 1960s, the Northwest Tollway bisected the site and reduced it in size.

In recent years, Elgin has increased its efforts to be more environmentally sustainable. In 2017, the city introduced free curbside textile recycling to residents, and it is the first city in Illinois to do so. Additionally, Elgin encourages its residents to compost and use rain barrels, which it sometimes subsidizes for residents to purchase. The city also has a proposed Sustainability Action Plan that includes plans for creating renewable sources of energy for the city, a curbside organics/composting pilot-program, and information about community gardens.

==Government==
Elgin was chartered as a city by the State of Illinois in 1854, and 100 years later it became the first city in Illinois to adopt a council-manager form of government. Residents elect eight at-large council members and a mayor, who serve on a part-time basis. The city manager, a full-time professional, serves at the pleasure of the mayor and city council.

The current council members are Corey Dixon, Dustin Good, Rosamaria Martinez, Anthony Ortiz, Tish S. Powell, Carol J. Rauschenberger, F. John Steffen and Steven Thoren. Elgin&#x27;s current mayor is David Kaptain and city manager is Rick Kozal.

The city council meets the second and fourth Wednesday of each month at 6:00 p.m. in the council chambers, located on the second floor of City Hall. Agenda and minutes are available on the city&#x27;s website. Residents may attend in person at City Hall, watch the live video stream from the online newsroom, or view the replays on cable Channel 17.

The city is represented in the Illinois legislature by Representatives Anna Moeller (D), Dan Ugaste (R), and Fred Crespo (D) and Senators Cristina Castro (D) and Don DeWitte (R). In the US House of Representatives, Elgin is represented by Lauren Underwood (D), Delia Ramirez (D), and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D).

Elgin includes portions of Hanover Township in Cook County and Elgin Township, Plato Township, Rutland Township, Dundee Township, and Campton Township in Kane County. Elgin Township is governed by a supervisor (Kenneth C. Bruderle), highway commissioner (Jason Krabbe), assessor (Steven P. Surnicki), clerk (Karen Dowling) and four trustees (Mark Bialek, Alejandro Lopez, Janet Rogalla and Eric Stare) elected to four-year terms.

Elgin Fire Department has 133 sworn firefighters and seven fire stations. The front-line fire apparatus consists of four Advanced Life Support (ALS) fire engines, three ALS Quints, five ALS ambulances, two boats, a rescue raft, and a Battalion Chief, along with several vehicles used for inspections and other official business.

==Commemorative coin==
In 1936, a commemorative silver half dollar was issued by the United States Mint commemorating the centennial of Elgin. The coin was meant to raise money for the pioneer family memorial proposed by Elgin sculptor Trygve Rovelstad, and sold for $1.50. The obverse features the profile of a pioneer with the dates 1673 * 1936, while the reverse features a pioneer family; both images are based on a centennial &quot;Pioneer Medal&quot; made by Rovelstad. The date 1673 was in reference to the expedition of Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, despite the fact that their journey took them nowhere near the future site of Elgin.

The coin did not prove to be a popular success, probably because of the Great Depression and the great variety of commemorative coins being issued at the time. Five thousand of the 25,000 coins initially minted were unsold and melted down by the mint. Rovelstad&#x27;s pioneer statue was not installed until 2001.

<text>Elk Grove Village is a village in Cook and DuPage counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. Per the 2020 census, the population was 32,812. Located northwest of Chicago along the Golden Corridor, the Village of Elk Grove Village was incorporated on July 17, 1956. It is directly adjacent to O&#x27;Hare International Airport and is economically important to the Chicago metropolitan area due to its large industrial park, located on the eastern border of the village. The community is served by several Interstate highways including I-90, I-290/I-355/Route 53, and IL-390. Elk Grove is also expected to be served by the I-490 Western O&#x27;Hare Bypass upon completion of the project.

==History==

=== Pre-colonial and colonial eras ===
The land that is now the Village of Elk Grove was controlled by the Miami Confederacy (which contained the Illini and Kickapoo tribes) starting in the early 1680s. The Confederacy was driven from the area by the Iroquois and Meskwaki in the early 1700s.

The French-allied Potawatomi began to raid and take possession of Northern Illinois in the 1700s. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Potawatomi expanded southwards from their territory in Green Bay and westward from their holdings near Detroit, until they controlled in an L-shaped swath of territory from Green Bay to the Illinois River, and from the Mississippi River to the Maumee River.

In 1833, the Potawatomi signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago with the United States Government. As a result of the Treaty, the United States was granted control of all land west of Lake Michigan and east of Lake Winnebago in exchange for a tract of land west of the Mississippi. The land that is now Elk Grove was ceded to the U.S. in this treaty, which sparked mass white immigration to the Northern Illinois area. The U.S. Government purchased the land for about 15 cents per acre, and then resold it to white settlers for 1.25 dollars per acre.

Aaron Miner, a revolutionary war veteran, moved to what is now in Elk Grove in 1833. He maintained friendly relations with the remaining Potawatomi, who gave him a firebrand. His wife and daughter often baked cookies which they would trade with the Potawatomi for venison and game.

=== Incorporation and planned community ===
The village was formally incorporated in 1956 in Elk Grove Township, and was founded as a planned suburban community. The majority of houses were constructed by Centex Corporation. As part of the original planning concept, the village was to be home to separated residential and industrial areas (the latter of which would later become the largest industrial park in the United States). Today, it ranks as the second-highest scoring American industrial park, according to Benchmarkia.

Prior to its development as a residential community, it was home to many farmers and their families (mostly German immigrants). Many of the major streets in and around the village are named for these farmers. Busse Farm was the final undeveloped agricultural property in the village, located between Higgins Road and Oakton Street, and was at one time considered as a location for a new Chicago Bears stadium, to replace the aging Soldier Field. In 2018 the land was sold to be developed into the Elk Grove Technology Park.

The original boundaries of Elk Grove Village&#x27;s residential area were Higgins Road (Illinois Route 72) on the north, State Road (now Arlington Heights Road) on the west, Landmeier Road on the south, and Wildwood Road on the east. The village easily doubled in size during the 1960s. By the end of the decade, most of the land between O&#x27;Hare Airport and I-290/IL-53 was developed. As the village expanded to the south and west, new roads, schools, and parks were added to the community. Rupley Elementary was the first school to be constructed in Elk Grove Village. It was named after Ira Rupley, an executive vice president at Centex who helped lead the early development of the village.

In the 1970s, the village developed land west of the expressway in Schaumburg Township along with industrial development into Addison Township. New apartment communities were constructed in Elk Grove Village along Tonne Road and Ridge Avenue. These developments have since been sectioned, and some converted to condominium homes. The village saw continuous residential, commercial, and industrial growth during the 1980s. However, Lively Junior High School was no longer necessary and saw fast-declining enrollment numbers. It was shut down by the school district, leased to Elk Grove Park District, and remodeled to become the Jack E. Claes Pavilion Recreation Facility. School District 59 built administrative offices at the site.

In 1982, Elk Grove Village was briefly in the national spotlight with one of the first reported deaths in the Chicago Tylenol murders case with the death of 12-year-old Mary Kellerman, who died after taking a Tylenol capsule that was laced with potassium cyanide. The case led to the development of more stringent FDA regulations around tamper-evident technology.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the village embarked on a series of beautification and redevelopment programs which included the installation of a clock tower at Village Hall, installation of brick-paved crosswalks in residential areas, new landscaping in boulevards and other public lands, and installation of retro-themed street lights.

In 2006, Elk Grove Village became one of the first municipalities in Illinois to enact a public smoking ban, and in 2008 became one of the first Chicago suburbs to use red light cameras. In June 2010, Elk Grove Village&#x27;s Municipal Administration and Public Safety Complex was LEED Gold Certified by the US Green Building Council.

The Elk Grove business park is home to the largest concentration of manufacturers in the Midwest; the largest concentration of logistic freight companies in the United States, and the second-largest source of manufacturing in Illinois behind only the City of Chicago. The village is home to many large data centers which rely upon the convergence of national fiber optic networks and natural gas lines in Elk Grove, which has other strategic advantages for business including the convergence of national fiber optic cables, national gasoline and oil pipelines, and a virtually unlimited supply of fresh water from Lake Michigan.

==Arts and culture==
As the name suggests, Elk Grove Village is home to a small herd of elk kept in a grove at the eastern edge of the Busse Woods forest preserve for which the grove is named. Elk were originally native to the area (and most of the Eastern United States) but had been extirpated by the early 1800s. The tradition of the Elk Grove herd began when elk were brought by train from Montana by an early resident, William Busse, in the 1920s. The elk are currently maintained by the Chicago Zoological Society veterinary staff and the Busse Woods Forest Preserve wildlife biologists.

In July 2018, the village, as part of its &quot;Makers Wanted&quot; campaign announced that they would be taking over its naming rights sponsorship of the Bahamas Bowl beginning with its 2018 edition of the bowl.

<text>Elmhurst is a city in DuPage and Cook counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is a western suburb of Chicago. The population was 45,786 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Members of the Potawatomi Native American people, who settled along Salt Creek just south of where the city would develop, are the earliest known settlers of the Elmhurst area. Around 1836, European-American immigrants settled on tracts of land along the same creek. At what would become Elmhurst City Centre, a native of Ohio named Gerry Bates established a community on a tract of &quot;treeless land&quot; in 1842.

The following year, Hill Cottage Tavern opened where St. Charles Road and Cottage Hill Avenue presently intersect. In 1845, the community was officially named Cottage Hill when a post office was established. 
Four years later, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was given right-of-way through the community, giving farmers easier access to Chicago. The first Elmhurst railroad station was built in 1894. The community changed its name to Elmhurst in 1869, and in 1871 Elmhurst University was organized. The land for Elmhurst University was gifted by prominent resident Thomas Barbour Bryan. Bryan (often referred to as the &quot;Father of Elmhurst&quot;) played an important role in the development of the town, and has been as the one responsible for renaming the town.

Elmhurst was incorporated as a village in 1882, with a population between 723 and 1,050, and legal boundaries of St. Charles Road to North Avenue, and one half mile west and one quarter mile east of York Street. Elmhurst Memorial Hospital was founded in 1926 as the first hospital in DuPage County.

The Memorial Parade has run every Memorial Day since 1918. The annual Elmhurst St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade continues to be the third largest parade of that sort in the Chicago area, following the more famous parades downtown and on the city&#x27;s South Side.

Since 1964, it has been home to Elmhurst CRC, one of the largest congregations of the Christian Reformed Church in North America.

The Keebler Company&#x27;s corporate headquarters was in Elmhurst until 2001, when the Kellogg Company purchased the company. The city is home to the headquarters of Sunshine Biscuits and McMaster-Carr Supply Co.

In 2014, &quot;Family Circle&quot; magazine ranked Elmhurst as one of the &quot;Ten Best U.S. Towns for Families&quot;.

<text>Elmwood Park is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 24,521 at the 2020 census. The community has long maintained a large Italian American population, with a more recent influx of Hispanic and Latino Americans.

== History ==

Elmwood Park was incorporated as a village in early April 1914 in order to prevent annexation by the greater city of Chicago. Today one can still see evidence of a minority of landowners, or share farmers who voted for annexation to the city in 1915 by the odd chunk taken out of Elmwood Park&#x27;s northeast corner, which kept the community from achieving a full square rectangular border.

At the turn of the century, urban dwellers would take a train on the Milwaukee Road, (which is now Canadian Pacific) westward out of the harsh concrete city for family picnics at the &quot;Elm-Wood-Park,&quot; which was an ancient &quot;Grove of majestic 180 year old Elms&quot; found near 72nd Ave/Harlem and Irving Park Road. Taking advantage of the park&#x27;s provenance, a new cemetery was named Elmwood, while the closest train stop to both cemetery and park in unincorporated Marwood/Ellsworth became identified with the official name of &quot;Elmwood Park.&quot; During the pressure era of incorporation a decade later, the village&#x27;s founding representatives thought it most ideal to legally title the community after the stop, and after the namesake elm, which is a native, locally evolved, riparian prairie &quot;bottomland&quot; tree species.

Russell&#x27;s Barbecue, the oldest continuously operating barbecue restaurant in Chicagoland, is located in Elmwood Park.

<doc id="110976" wikidata="Q391071" url="?curid=110976" title="Evergreen Park, Illinois">
<text>Evergreen Park is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. In 2020, the population was 19,943. The village shares a border with Chicago on the north, east, and south sides; while also sharing a border with Oak Lawn on the west side.

==History==
As early as 1828, a German farming family had settled in the area of what is now Evergreen Park. In the succeeding decades, other German immigrants arrived. Kedzie Avenue and 95th Street crisscrossed the farmland and provided access to markets.

The first railroad (now the Grand Trunk Railroad) came through the area in 1873. In 1875, the community built its first school just west of 95th and Kedzie. The school and the stores that began to cluster around this intersection defined the community&#x27;s main business area. Nearby, a real-estate developer, with a vision of the Arc de Triomphe area of Paris, laid out a star-shaped park with eight streets radiating from it. The evergreen trees planted in the park inspired the village&#x27;s name. The location and layout of the park was intended to be the center of town, but 95th St and Kedzie Ave. later proved a more accurate midpoint. After the death of Mayor Henry Klein shortly after the village&#x27;s 75th anniversary, the park was renamed Klein Park in his honor.

In 1888 St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery opened, and mourners traveled by train from Chicago. Restaurants and taverns were created to provide meals for cemetery visitors. Within five years, the village had become a recreation center that attracted hundreds of Chicagoans to its picnic groves, beer gardens, and dance halls. The first of the village&#x27;s 13 churches was established in 1893.

As a result of the financial panic of the 1890s, several surrounding communities voted to be annexed by Chicago. Realizing the current and future potential of its strong business district, and in order to avoid annexation during the serious economic crisis, The Village of Evergreen Park declared its independence and was incorporated on December 20, 1893. Prior to its incorporation, the village was sustained by approximately 500 regional residents. The final decision to incorporate as its own entity separate from the City of Chicago was made by a 41 out of 50 approval by village residents. John M. Foley, a real estate and insurance agent, became the village&#x27;s first mayor. During the 1890s, The Village of Evergreen Park officially occupied an area of four square miles; it now covers an area of the same size.

In 1899, shortly after its incorporation, the village introduced telephone services to the community. In 1910, gas and electric lines were extended into homes and street lights were erected. By 1920, most of the village&#x27;s homes had indoor plumbing, although some residents still used a well located behind the village hall as their water source.

In the early 20th century, many residents still farmed and there were many open fields within the town limits. As a result, fire was a constant threat and the water supply was scarce. In July 1918, a spark from a passing train set the original village hall on fire. Despite villagers&#x27; attempts to douse the flames, the village hall was destroyed. In 1920, a new village hall was built and the population grew to 800.

In 1930, Little Company of Mary Hospital was opened at 95th and California. Within the first year of its inception, 232 babies were born.

In 1967, a violent and damaging F4 tornado occurred in Evergreen Park and other nearby suburbs.

While the village remains small in size, it is only seventeen miles southwest of the Loop. The Village is also currently surrounded by Chicago on the north, south, and east sides. Evergreen Park is also known as the &quot;Village of Churches&quot; because of its thirteen established religious congregations within close proximity.

== First successful organ transplant ==
On June 17, 1950, Little Company of Mary Hospital, located at 2800 W. 95th St. in Evergreen Park, was the site of the world&#x27;s first successful organ transplant. Dr. Richard Lawler, MD, an exceptional surgeon at Cook County Hospital, led a team of doctors that performed the hazardous and highly controversial operation. In order to prepare for the experimental procedure, Lawler spent several years researching and practicing various organ transplants and used canines as the testing subjects. He concluded through his research that the most probable means of achieving success for organ transplantation would involve a human kidney from a post-mortem donor. Realizing he had the opportunity &quot;get it all started,&quot; Lawler decided to attempt the medical first on a chronically ill patient in dire need of a new kidney. The recipient of the first successful organ transplantation was Ruth Tucker, a 44-year-old Chicago-area woman who suffered from terminal polycystic kidney disease. Tucker amazingly survived for another 5 years. 

Dr. Lawler&#x27;s pioneering achievement did not escape criticism. He was repudiated by many of his colleagues and criticized by the Catholic church. By the 1970s, with organ transplantation evolving into a widely recognized life-saving necessity, Lawler and his entire team earned the much-deserved respect from the medical community, and their reputation healed. Dr. Lawler retired in 1979 and died in 1982. 

==Historical landmarks==

;Evergreen Plaza, &quot;The Plaza&quot;

The Evergreen Plaza, located on 95th and Western, was an indoor shopping mall originating from the early 1950s. In 1952, real estate developer Arthur Rubloff debuted the Evergreen Plaza in the heart of the southwest Chicago suburbs. A few years after the shopping mall&#x27;s debut, Rubloff decided to enclose the mall thereby making it the first indoor shopping mall in the Chicago area. As a result, Rubloff changed shopping by allowing people the opportunity to pull up, park, and shop for various goods all in one place. Since the 1950s the Evergreen Park Plaza had seen more than $8 million in major internal &amp; external improvements. Evergreen Plaza was shortened to be acknowledged as, &quot;The Plaza&quot;. The Plaza covered , and two stories. As of 2006, The Plaza had an annual visitor count of roughly 7 million people. After 61 years of operation, The Plaza closed for redevelopment on May 31, 2013. The Plaza, in its new form, re-opened on October 18, 2018, and was renamed the Evergreen Marketplace.

<text>Ford Heights (formerly East Chicago Heights) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,813 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Chicago, many of the area&#x27;s first settlers were African American and since its incorporation in 1949 the village has remained predominantly Black. Due to the lack of commercial activity and financial stability, the village has declined over the years. Urban renewal efforts were attempted in the 1960s, although the village has continued to decline.

==Geography==
Ford Heights is located at .

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Ford Heights has a total area of , all land. The village lies on the edge of the Tinley Moraine.

==History==
The area that would eventually become Ford Heights was first settled in the late 1840s. It served as a stopping point on the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves fleeing to freedom. By the early 20th century, the area had developed into an agricultural community of farms operated mostly by Poles, Lithuanians, and Italians. After World War I, African Americans from the Southern U.S. migrated to the area and worked on the farms.

A new subdivision known as the &quot;Park Addition&quot; was created on a farm road from Chicago Heights to Indiana, and it attracted residents to the area during the early 1920s. In 1924, 40 families successfully petitioned for electrical service. Soon after, the main east–west road became a two-lane concrete highway designated as U.S. Route 30, part of the transcontinental Lincoln Highway. By the 1930s, the Park Addition had telephone service and was known as East Chicago Heights. During the 1940s, Alberta Armstrong and others organized both black and white women in the community to raise funds for a new fire truck. By 1948, they had become the East Chicago Heights Citizens Association.

East Chicago Heights was incorporated as a village in 1949. The first mayor was Charlie Williams. In the 1950 census, 1,548 people lived in the village – 76.9% of whom were black. The Ford Motor Company opened a stamping plant adjacent to the village in 1956. The company offered minorities an equal opportunity for well-paying jobs, and East Chicago Heights developed into a blue-collar community inhabited mostly by middle-class black families whose housing choices in suburban Chicago were severely limited at that time. The village&#x27;s population more than doubled to 3,270 by 1960. That growth continued throughout the decade, with one of the biggest successes being the Sunnyfield subdivision, which opened in 1964 and became one of the most popular neighborhoods in East Chicago Heights.

Towards the end of the 1960s, over of housing deemed substandard were cleared and replaced by federally subsidized public housing. These developments attracted lower income residents to East Chicago Heights, which strained the village&#x27;s resources, already limited by little commercial activity and a small tax base. The population rose to 5,000 in 1970 and peaked at 5,347 in 1980. In an attempt to annex the unincorporated site of the Ford Stamping Plant, the village of East Chicago Heights changed its name to Ford Heights in 1987. The move was unsuccessful, and the land eventually was annexed by the neighboring city of Chicago Heights.

Often viewed as one of Chicago&#x27;s most impoverished suburbs and at one point the poorest suburb in the United States, Ford Heights has experienced high levels of political corruption, decaying infrastructure, and an elevated crime rate. In 2008, the Cook County Sheriff&#x27;s Department took over law enforcement duties for the village. Between 1980 and 2020, the population of Ford Heights declined by more than 66%.

<doc id="110979" wikidata="Q2483749" url="?curid=110979" title="Forest Park, Illinois">
<text>Forest Park (formerly Harlem) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, and a suburb of Chicago. The population was 14,339 at the 2020 census. The Forest Park terminal on the CTA Blue Line is the line&#x27;s western terminus, located on the Eisenhower Expressway at Des Plaines Avenue. This makes it one of just two municipalities served by the Chicago &quot;L&quot; train network that does not directly border Chicago (the other being Wilmette).

==Geography==
Forest Park is located at (41.873031, -87.811155). According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Forest Park has a total area of , all land. The Des Plaines River runs through Forest Park.

==History==

The community (formerly part of a larger town called Harlem) officially became incorporated under the name of Forest Park on April 17, 1907.

For much of its history, Forest Park was known as a &quot;Village of cemeteries&quot;, with more dead &quot;residents&quot; than living ones; some figures estimate the ratio at 30:1, dead to alive. Forest Park cemeteries include Altenheim, Forest Home Cemetery (incorporating the German Waldheim Cemetery), Jewish Waldheim (producer Mike Todd is buried in Beth Aaron there), Woodlawn (including Showmen&#x27;s Rest), and Concordia. Forest Home Cemetery is home to the famous &quot;Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument&quot;.

From 1925 to 1931, Forest Park had a radio station with a variety of call letters. The station began in 1925 as WHT. It was known as WNBA, with its studios near Des Plaines and Roosevelt Road from 1927 to 1928. In 1929, the call letters changed again, this time to WSOA and again to WCHI in 1929. As WSOA, the radio station had 5,000 watts of power. It went off the air for good in 1931.

The Naval Ordnance Station Forest Park (originally a Naval Ordnance Plant) operated from early in World War II until most of the plant was replaced by a mall in 1971, with some of the site used as a Naval Reserve center until 2007. The plant employed up to 6,500 workers and produced 19,000 torpedoes during World War II.

In 2007, the town held a summer-long centennial celebration. Forest Park has also held two other centennial celebrations, one in 1956 for when the first settlers came and one in 1984 for the 100th anniversary of the creation of the town of Harlem.

Women&#x27;s professional baseball/softball has roots in Forest Park. Emery Parichy purchased the Boston Bloomer Girls softball team in the early 1930s, renamed them Emery Parichy&#x27;s Bloomer Girls, and moved them to Forest Park. The team operated in the suburb until 1955, when the land their softball field was on was taken for the Eisenhower Expressway.

=== Amusement park ===
Forest Park was the location of Forest Park Amusement Park, a small but popular amusement park located just west of Desplaines Avenue, and just north of the then Waldheim Cemetery, from 1907 to 1922. Initially, the park was received negatively by Chicago area church members due to its close proximity to the cemetery. However, its public acclaim helped bring in a crowd of approximately five to ten thousand on opening day, and the various rides, games, and shows the park had to offer kept residents coming back. On July 25, 1918, a fire broke out in the swimming pool&#x27;s boiler room. The fire quickly spread to other utility areas of the park which left firefighters without access to water and power. The park planned to reopen later that same day, though 1/5th of the park was destroyed by the fire. In the years following the fire, the park was mostly successful primarily due to events and activities that helped the community and the park&#x27;s occasional rallies against prohibition. However, with the 18th Amendment taking effect coupled with a strict crack-down on gambling, the park never reopened following the cessation of its 1922 season. Its former location is now occupied by the Forest Park station on CTA&#x27;s Blue Line at Desplaines Avenue.

===Circle Theatre===
For most of its history, Forest Park was home for the 25-year-old professional (non-equity) theater company, Circle Theatre, which now resides across Harlem Avenue in neighboring Oak Park. Hedy Weiss of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; writes: &quot;One of the most consistently satisfying theatrical operations in the area ...everything from classics to new American plays ...theatre at its very best.&quot; Circle Theatre has produced over 175 productions and received over 80 Joseph Jefferson (JEFF) nominations and won over 30 Jeff Awards. Notable visits from famous playwrights have included Marvin Hamlisch, Rupert Holmes, Douglas Post, Michael John LaChiusa, Stephen Clark and Rebecca Gilman. Rebecca Gilman had her first play produced at Circle Theatre before becoming one of America&#x27;s leading playwrights. Notable supporters have included Harry Connick, Jr. and Russell Crowe. Award-winning director/choreographer Kevin Bellie was artistic director from 2003 to 2012.

<doc id="110981" wikidata="Q2384761" url="?curid=110981" title="Frankfort, Illinois">
<text>Frankfort is a village in Will County and Cook County in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is a southern suburb of Chicago, and is approximately 28 miles (45 km) south of the city. As of the 2020 census, the population was 20,296.

Frankfort’s historic downtown area contains the Frankfort Grainery, Breidert Green, and a portion of the Old Plank Road Trail, a 22 mile-long paved recreation trail. The village also contains Commissioners Park and multiple schools, including Lincoln-Way East High School, Hickory Creek Middle School, and Dr. Julian Rogus School.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Frankfort&quot; was taken from Frankfort Township designated by the governing board of Will County. It was commonly known as &quot;Frankfort Station&quot; after the opening of the Joliet &amp; Northern Indiana Railroad through the township in 1855, though the official plat of the community dated March 1855 shows the name as &quot;Frankfort&quot;. Property deed abstracts and railroad documents also show that the name was always Frankfort. Local residents incorporated Frankfort as a village in 1879. It also has some reference to the major German city of Frankfurt.

== History ==
First inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi and Sac and Fox tribes, Frankfort was used as a conduit between the Des Plaines and St. Joseph rivers. Originally, the area was part of the Virginia Territory before the French signed a treaty with Manitoqua, the Potawatomi chief, for land in the Prestwick area. The first pioneers came to Frankfort in the early 1830s by means of the Des Plaines River from the southwest and by wagon from the east along the Sauk Trail, a roadway that still exists today.

William Rice, the first non-native settler, made a permanent settlement in Frankfort in 1831. While the first pioneers, coming mainly from the New England colonies, were mostly of English and Scottish descent, German settlers made the village of Frankfort a reality. Later in the 1840s German settlers migrated from Germany to Frankfort. They had fled harsh conditions in their homeland by coming to America and proved to be very industrious and experienced farmers as they soon bought most of the fertile farm land from the &quot;Yankees&quot;, who were more inclined to provide services for local needs. Establishing both ownership and pride in the area, the German settlers implemented the first system of resident concern for local lands, which has been maintained ever since.

What is now known as Frankfort Township was originally part of the Hickory Creek Precinct. Will County was originally divided into ten precincts. The county, in 1850, was changed to the township form of government. Frankfort Township was named by Frederick Cappel after his native city, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In 1855 the Joliet and Northern Indiana Railroad built a line through an area linking Joliet, Illinois, with Lake Station, Indiana. The J&amp;NI Railroad was leased to the Michigan Central Railroad, and service was implemented in July 1855. Nelson D. Elwood, an officer of the rail line, and Sherman Bowen, a Joliet attorney and real estate man, jointly platted a village of around in March 1855 and named it Frankfort after the township. It was commonly referred to as &quot;Frankfort Station&quot; because of the railroad depot located there, but when the village was incorporated, the &quot;station&quot; was dropped from the name.

John McDonald became the first railroad agent in 1857.

In 1879, the village of Frankfort was incorporated, and elected John McDonald as the first Village President. Along with the establishment of the government, among the first undertakings of the newly formed administration was the institution of land use policies. Early plans that were recorded indicated a traditional grid pattern with residential uses surrounding the business district and railroad line and additional land provided for schools and public open spaces.

<text>Glencoe () is a lakefront village in northeastern Cook County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,849. Glencoe is part of Chicago&#x27;s North Shore and one of the wealthiest communities in Illinois. According to the United States Census Bureau, the median household income in Glencoe was $228,750 in 2022.

==History==
Opinions differ about the origins of the village&#x27;s name. Some attribute it to an early resident, Matthew Coe. Others say it is named for the area of Scotland of the same name. It developed in the late 19th century around a railroad stop. Former Chicago mayor Walter S. Gurnee had become president of the line connecting Chicago and Milwaukee, and often bought up and developed land around railroad stops. Thus, one historian believes the name derives from the maiden name of Gurnee&#x27;s wife, since Gurnee bought the land in 1867 and began subdivision, although financial problems prevented him from building a home there and he returned to New York for his final years. The village&#x27;s first seal was based on the seal of Glencoe, Scotland.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many elegant homes were built in Glencoe. Most notably, the village is home to the world&#x27;s third largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright structures: the Ravine Bluff subdivision contains seven houses, a concrete bridge and three sculptural markers. There are also two larger, individually built homes, located nearby Ravine Bluffs. In addition to Wright, there are houses designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw, David Adler, Robert E. Seyfarth and George Washington Maher, among others.

Glencoe has had an African American population since almost immediately after the Village&#x27;s 1869 incorporation.[Images of America, Glencoe Illinois, Ellen Kettler Paseltiner and Ellen Schubert for the Glencoe Historical Society p.8]. Many in the Black and Italian community lived within a five-square block area near what is now Vernon Avenue from Washington to Jackson streets. Homes in this area were close together in accordance with the city planner&#x27;s 20-foot wide alleys. In 1920 the city of Glencoe condemned these properties to clear land for a park.[Glencoe Historical Society Exhibition]

In 1920 the African American community in Glencoe grew to 676 residents. The African American population in 1930 numbered 313 members and 176 in the 2000 census.

Homer Wilson was the first Black property owner in Glencoe. He went on to mortgage his home to found the St. Paul AME Church which is still active in Glencoe under the leadership of Katrese Kirk McKenzie. Glencoe beaches were not integrated until 1942 when a court injunction allowed the sale of beach passes for the (formerly white-only) Park Avenue beach to the family that requested them, A.L. Foster, his wife, Mildred and their two sons who lived at 379 Jefferson.

 Glencoe has a Village Manager form of government. It had one of the first public safety departments (combined police/fire/paramedic). In 1921 Glencoe adopted the first zoning code in Illinois. Its land-use plan, adopted in 1940, has been adhered to with minor changes since then. For example, eminent domain law was used to condemn homes of the Black and Italian residents to make way for a new park next to South School. The allowed uses outlined on the 1940 zoning map is predominantly a single-family residential area, with no industrial uses. It has a small cohesive central business district that provides most basic services, including post office, library, Village Hall, performing arts theatre, train station (to Chicago), and other shopping needs.

==Geography==
According to ford Cohen census gazetteer files, Glencoe has a total area of , of which (or 98.39%) is land and (or 1.61%) is water.

Glencoe is located on the west side of Lake Michigan. It is separated from wells and suburbs to the north and west by more than of the Cook County Forest Preserve natural forest area. Three golf clubs also buffer it, with the private Lake Shore Country Club on the north, the public Glencoe Golf Club (operated by the village of Glencoe) on the northwest, and the private Skokie Country Club on the west.

The village is surrounded on three sides by upper-income communities, with Highland Park on the north, Northbrook on the west, and Winnetka to the south. The Skokie Lagoons are located in the forest preserve to the immediate west of the village. The same forest preserve has a bicycle trail that connects to other forest preserves to the south. In the village, the Green Bay Trail allows bicyclists to travel as far south as Wilmette and north past Lake Forest. The highest point of elevation in Glencoe is above sea level along Green Bay Road in the northern part of the village.

===Southern boundary===
Glencoe&#x27;s southern border with Winnetka cuts through 58 homes, forcing homeowners to pay taxes to and seek permits from both villages. The two villages began discussing a solution in 1920s, reaching a tentative agreement in 2007 in which each homeowner could choose a village from which to receive services while the boundary officially remained unchanged. Initially, 46 homeowners chose Winnetka, but the others had the option to choose a village later. The boundary was later updated to reflect these choices.

==Education==
Glencoe School District 35 is an elementary school district based in Glencoe. All schools are located within Glencoe boundaries.

<doc id="110984" wikidata="Q1531184" url="?curid=110984" title="Glenview, Illinois">
<text>Glenview is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, approximately northwest of the Chicago Loop. Per the 2020 census, the population was 48,705.

It is part of a collection of upscale residential communities north of Chicago that belong to New Trier and Northfield townships and the greater North Shore. According to the United States Census Bureau, the median household income in Glenview was $134,910 in 2022. 

==History==
The entire Northfield Township originally was known as the town of Northfield. There were different names for various areas within the community. The Post Office demanded that an official name be selected, whereupon a special meeting of the villagers was called. Various names were suggested such as Rugenville, Glenvarr, Glendale, Glengrove, Glen Hollow, Oak View, and Glenview. The name Glenview won the majority vote on May 7, 1895. The village was incorporated in 1899. Much of the Glenview area remained farmland but after World War II, developers such as Tom Sullivan began to give the township its current suburban appearance.

===The Park===
&quot;The Park&quot; is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the village. Located near the center of Glenview, just south of the Glen development, The Park was established as home to a religious society in 1894 by Hugh Burnham, the first village president and nephew of architect Daniel Burnham. This religious society is based on the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg a scientist and theologian who lived and wrote in the 1700s. In the late 1890s through the turn of the century, New Church members purchased 40 acres of land and built their houses in an oval surrounding a common park area where the church and school were built. Architect Swain Nelson, one of the designers of Lincoln Park, designed the neighborhood.

As part of the New Church service mission to be universally accepted as a guidepost for kindness and character, today, the Glenview New Church Schools are open to many students beyond the congregation and the church has been updated and expanded to accommodate a much larger Sunday service. Despite its new open focus and broadening congregation, the original church in the center and many of the surrounding buildings remain the same today as they were in 1900.

===Naval Air Station===

Naval Air Station Glenview was a major facility in Glenview for many years. It was host to a number of squadrons, including the Coast Guard air/sea rescue helicopter service for Chicago/Lake Michigan and a squadron of P-3 Orions which had the mission of East Coast antisubmarine warfare. The rationale for basing the squadron there was that so many reserve staff were in the central United States, and it was convenient to base the facility near the staff. As a 1−2 hour checklist had to be executed before scanning the seas, there was actually little dead time in the flight to the coast. The base consisted of 1 million cubic yards (800,000 m3) of concrete, of runways and 108 U.S. Navy buildings. The only two buildings that are left from the naval airstation are the pilot tower and the chapel. The rest has been renovated into &quot;The Glen Town Center&quot; which is a shopping center.

===The Glen===
In 1995, the base was closed as part of the Base Realignment and Closure military restructuring process. The land was deeded back to Glenview by the U.S. Department of Defense. A reuse plan was completed by the Village of Glenview in 1995 and updated into a master plan by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in 1998. The village then assumed the role of Master Developer. The development was named &quot;The Glen&quot; in 1999. It comprises approximately 15% of the area of Glenview. It contains new homes, offices, and shopping centers, including a movie theater and The Glen Town Center. Among other amenities, it includes a lake, soccer fields, tennis courts, walking and biking trails, two golf courses, Kohl Children&#x27;s Museum, the Glenview Park District Park Center, Attea Middle School, and the North Glenview Metra station.

===The Grove===
The Grove is an area of prairie that contains an interpretive center, historic buildings, and nature trails. The Grove houses many animals for visitors to interact with, such as snakes, snapping turtles, and skunks. Covering , the land was formerly the home of Dr. John Kennicott, who settled in the area in 1836 from New Orleans, the Kenniott family lived in a log cabin until the Kennicott House was built in 1856. John Kennicott was influential in the advancement of horticulture in Illinois. His son, Robert Kennicott, became interested in natural history, his research contributed to the American purchase of Alaska, and he was one of the founders of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. Robert&#x27;s brothers Flint and Amasa started the Kennicott Brothers floral distribution company in 1886, which is still in business today. Members of the Kennicott family lived in The Grove until 1966. The Grove was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior in 1976 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Wagner Farm===
Wagner Farm is an farm owned by the Glenview Park District. Wagner Farm is the last remnant of a much larger farm which was owned and farmed by members of the Wagner family since their arrival in this area from Trier, Germany in the 1850s. In 1997, Rose Wagner, the last surviving member of the Glenview Wagner family, died. Her will directed Glenview State Bank, the trustee for her estate, to sell the farm to the highest bidder with the proceeds to benefit her family parish, Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Glenview. A group of local citizens approached the park district and asked the district to buy the farm and preserve it as an historic working farm for the education and enjoyment of the community. With citizen support, a referendum to approve funds to pay for the farm was approved by the voters in 1998 and the park district purchased the farm in 2000. In 2007, the farm had over 54,000 visitors. Also in 2007, Wagner Farm became home to the Glenview Farmer&#x27;s Market.

Johann and Katharina Wagner came to the United States from their home in Weiler, Germany in the winter of 1855. They eventually settled in Gross Point (modern day Wilmette), an area with a high population of German immigrants. Over time, the Wagners established their home on the southeast corner of Lake Ave and Wagner Road, in the heart of what is present-day Glenview. By 1898, the Wagner farm encompassed approximately , many of which have been replaced by housing and road development today. Johann and Katharina&#x27;s youngest son, Thomas, married Julia Brachtendorf of the Northfield Township in 1892, and ten years later they purchased the Hoffman farm on the northwest corner of Lake Ave and Wagner Road. This is the area known as Wagner Farm today. The area was then, but Thomas also inherited land on the northeast corner of the two roads. Thomas&#x27;s siblings inherited this land in the farm&#x27;s estate. Thomas and Julia had 5 children, 4 of whom remained on the farm for their entire lives. The farm was operated by Thomas&#x27; children until the last member of the family, Rose (1903–1997) died in 1997. Rose stated in her Will that the farm should be sold, and placed in trust for a local catholic church, and it remains a property of the Glenview Park District today.

Wagner Farm offers hands-on programs on the farm funded by the Glenview Park District. The programs themselves vary from season to season, but they include activities like horseback riding, tractor driving, and more activities that reflect the life of a farmer in the 1920s.

Glenview&#x27;s Farmers&#x27; Market was established in 1988 by the Glenview Women of Today. After years of running it, the group realized that maintaining the market was no longer in their interest. After the group abandoned the annual event, the Glenview Park District decided to move the market to Wagner Farm. This switch was historically suitable for the farm, given that at one point, Wagner was a truck farm that produced crops in bulk for the Chicago area. A spreadsheet of the number of crops per city that Wagner provides can be found on their website. In remembrance of Wagner&#x27;s truck farming history, a market wagon was constructed, and is now in display in the museum. The Farmer&#x27;s Market takes place between the days of June 25 to October 8, on every Saturday. It is located across the street from Wagner Farm, giving shoppers the opportunity to visit a working 20th-century farm. In addition to the food and other products that are produced by the farm, the Market features a different musical artist to perform each week. It is a great, family-friendly, destination.

In residential areas, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, skunks, opossums, rats and mice cohabit with people. On nature walks through the Glen, the forest preserves, or The Grove, one can come upon white-tailed deer, and an occasional coyote or fox. Also to be seen are brown rabbits, cicadas (both the 17-year and the 4-year varieties), box and alligator snapping turtles, and sometimes small frogs and toads. Among the arthropods and insects seen in Glenview are ants, bees, mosquitoes, daddy-long-legs, wolf spiders, and many others.

<doc id="110986" wikidata="Q2054459" url="?curid=110986" title="Golf, Illinois">
<text>Golf is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, incorporated in 1928. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 514. The community is primarily residential, and has a dedicated police department, post office, and Metra train stop.

==History==
The village of Golf occupies approximately half a square mile in Cook County, Illinois, roughly northwest of the Loop.

The land which is now the village was originally inhabited by Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi peoples. It was designated for their settlement in the August 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien.

Around 1830, John Dewes purchased for 50 cents an acre from Antoine Ouilmette and became the first non-Indian settler in what is now Golf. Dewes first built a log cabin, then in 1834 he built a brick house - a mansion at the time. Both structures remain on the grounds of what is now the Glen View Club.

In 1897, the Glen View Club bought a portion of the Dewes land and built an 18-hole golf course.

Around 1899, one member, Albert J. Earling, President of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, started taking his private rail car from his offices downtown to golf at the Glen View Golf Club. He would tell people he was &quot;going to golf.&quot; Earling arranged to have his car switched to a special siding at what is now the Golf train station. Other members began using Earling&#x27;s siding, and it soon became a regular stop known as the &quot;golf stop&quot;. The siding remained until it was salvaged during World War II to reclaim the steel tracks for use in the war effort, according to residents of Golf at that time.

In 1925 Edward R. Diederich, a Chicago businessman, wanted to buy an acre of land near the Glen View Golf Club to build a country home. He found that in order to get the site he wanted, he would have to purchase a tract that was being sold to close an estate. The 30 acres extended from the Golf train station to the Glen View Golf Club boundary. Diederich chose to purchase the land, and had it laid out with winding streets and big lots. He installed sewer, water, gas, and electricity, paved streets, sidewalks, and installed electric street lights. The village of Golf was incorporated in 1928. The Glen View Club was originally outside of Golf village limits until annexation c. 1975.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Golf has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 514 people, 167 households, and 137 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 168 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 83.46% White, 1.36% African American, 0.19% Native American, 5.64% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 3.50% from other races, and 5.84% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.81% of the population.

There were 167 households, out of which 35.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 80.24% were married couples living together, 1.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.96% were non-families. 17.37% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.77% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.32 and the average family size was 2.92.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 27.4% under the age of 18, 5.2% from 18 to 24, 14.4% from 25 to 44, 34.7% from 45 to 64, and 18.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.4 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $201,875, and the median income for a family was $240,313. Males had a median income of $126,250 versus $66,250 for females. The per capita income for the village was $92,636. No families and 3.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 15.8% of those age 65 or over.

As of 2022, the population was 546, the median age was 50.1, the median income per household was $228,750, and the poverty rate was 3.66%.

==Education==
Golf School was built in 1927, just south of the village, at a location that would become 9401 Waukegan Road in Morton Grove. At the time it was a prototypical country school house - a wooden structure with four rooms, no electricity, and no running water. A 1930s Works Progress Administration project constructed a large brick structure east of the original building. Up until the early 1980s, public school students from Golf attended Golf Elementary School (K-5), Golf Junior High School, and Niles North High School. After three years of legal wrangling, in February 1982, Golf detached from School District 67, and was attached to Glenview School District 34. As demographics changed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Golf residents chose to align with the more upscale school districts in Glenview. More than two-thirds of the registered voters in the detachment area (village of Golf and the adjacent Golf Acres subdivision of the village of Glenview) signed the petition to detach from Niles Township High School District 219 and to attach to Northfield Township High School District 225. The Cook County Regional Board of School Trustees granted the petition in the 1980s.

Currently students from Golf attending public school go to Lyon School, Pleasant Ridge School, Springman Middle School (Glenview School District 34), and Glenbrook South High School (District 225).

<text>Hanover Park is a village in Cook and DuPage counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. A suburb of Chicago, the population was 37,470 at the 2020 census. Ontarioville is a neighborhood within the village.

==History==
Ontarioville was initially the name assigned to the village of Hanover Park, a municipality situated on the border of Cook and DuPage Counties. Back in 1836, a stagecoach service transported residents along Lake Trail (also known as Grant Highway and later renamed Lake Street) all the way to Galena. By 1872, the Chicago &amp; Pacific Railroad (later known as the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul) installed railway tracks on land donated by Edwin Bartlett, who contributed over seven acres for the establishment of a depot. Edwin and Luther Bartlett each established stations named &quot;Bartlett&quot; along the Chicago and Pacific Railroad line. Luther&#x27;s station kept the name Bartlett, but to avoid confusion, Edwin renamed his station &quot;Ontario&quot; in 1873, after a legend that the site was built on an old Indian trail between Lake Ontario and Green Bay, Wisconsin.

A post office was established in Ontarioville in 1873.

Ontarioville was eventually incorporated into the surrounding village of Hanover Park in 1982.

<text>Harvey is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 20,324 at the 2020 census.

Harvey is bordered by the villages of Dixmoor and Riverdale to the north; Dolton, Phoenix, and South Holland to the east; East Hazel Crest to the south; and Hazel Crest, Markham and Posen to the west.

==History==

Harvey was founded in 1891 by Turlington W. Harvey, a close associate of Dwight Moody, the founder of the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Harvey was originally intended as a model town for Christian values and was one of the Temperance Towns. It was closely modeled after the company town of Pullman, which eventually was annexed into the city of Chicago.

The city had its greatest growth in the prosperous postwar years, when it was home to the Buda Engine Co., which was acquired by Allis-Chalmers in 1953. The city reached its peak population in 1980. By this time, it was beginning to suffer losses in jobs and population through restructuring of steel and similar industries. The Dixie Square Mall closed in November 1978.

In the 2000s and 2010s, Mayor Eric Kellogg attempted to boost Harvey&#x27;s economy, with little success. Kellogg offered developers millions of dollars in incentives to revive the long-vacant Dixie Square Mall, but trends in retail adversely affected malls around the country. The city granted a developer $10 million in incentives to redevelop the Chicago Park Hotel, but he abandoned the project before completion, leaving the building gutted.

In February 2018, Harvey became the first city in Illinois to have its revenue garnished by the State in order to fund the city&#x27;s pension liabilities. The city laid off employees in order to deal with the changes.

== Government ==
Harvey is in Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district.

The city faces severe financial problems. From 2010 to 2013, it failed to fund its police and fire pensions, paying just $140 of $10.1 million required contributions. This problem has been reported in other Chicago suburbs with economic problems. Since 2007, Harvey has refused to audit its municipal finances as required by the state. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that during this time, there was &quot;a scheme to divert bond proceeds for improper purposes.&quot;

As of September 2014, some aldermen were concerned the city could soon be unable to make payroll. In 2017, the city was forced to pay almost $11 million in unpaid and underpaid pension fund contributions for the city&#x27;s firefighters. A panel of judges on the Illinois First District Appellate Court in Chicago determined that Harvey&#x27;s mayor and city Council had improperly abused their discretionary powers for years. According to the &quot;Cook County Record&quot;, &quot;The case had landed in Cook County court in 2010, when the Board of Trustees of the City of Harvey Firefighters’ Pension Fund first filed suit against the city of Harvey, alleging chronic underfunding of the pension fund, which managed pension money for 67 retired firefighters, had left the fund teetering on the verge of insolvency.&quot;

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Harvey is served by two stations along the Metra Electric University Park line to Chicago. One is at 147th Street (a.k.a. Sibley Boulevard) and Clinton Street, and the other is at Park Avenue and 154th Street. Eleven Pace bus routes serve Harvey and the Pace Harvey Transportation Center.

Three major north–south streets in Chicago venture as far south as Harvey in some capacity. Halsted Street (Illinois Route 1) runs through the east side of town. Dixie Highway, as it is known in Harvey, is Western Avenue in Chicago. Finally, Chicago&#x27;s Ashland Avenue becomes Wood Street in Harvey. The reason for this is a surveyor&#x27;s error along the line where Interstate 57 is now located; Harvey&#x27;s street names and numbers conform to the section lines rather than actual distance from Chicago&#x27;s base lines (as indicated by the jogs in Halsted Street near 150th Street and 159th Street between Harvey and Markham, as examples). Harvey&#x27;s own Ashland Avenue serves as the east–west dividing line for house numbering.

== Notable people ==
==In popular culture==
The Dixie Square Mall, an abandoned shopping mall in Harvey, was the setting for filming of the car chase scene in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.

<text>Hillside is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 8,320. It is a suburb of Chicago.

==Geography==
Hillside is located at (41.874797, −87.900372).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Hillside has a total area of , all land.

==History==
German Lutheran immigrants planted farms and constructed Hillside&#x27;s first school and church (Immanuel) near the intersection of Wolf and 22nd Street in the 1840s, which marked the start of the community&#x27;s formal settlement. Although the majority of Hillside&#x27;s later construction was located north of 12th Street, Immanuel Lutheran Church and School were incorporated inside village boundaries, giving Hillside its characteristic form.

However, Marion Covell found a significant limestone deposit just a few feet below the surface of his property during the 1850s, despite the fact that farming was the main industry at the time. The quarry he started in 1854 was still in operation until the middle of the 1970s, providing crushed stone for the construction of roads across the Chicago metropolitan area. The John Sexton Company purchased the quarry in 1979 and operated it as a sanitary landfill.

Cemeteries also took the place of active farming immediately beyond Hillside on its western and southern borders, first with Mt. Carmel in 1894, then Oak Ridge, Glen Oak, and ultimately Queen of Heaven in 1947. The Illinois Central Railroad station and the Chicago, Aurora &amp; Elgin Railroad interurban&#x27;s 12th Street spur made the cemetery easily accessible, which led to the development of taverns, restaurants, monument businesses, greenhouses, and flower stores. The Illinois Central Railroad station, known as Hillside because westbound trains had to ascend a slope at this location, served as the inspiration for the village&#x27;s name when it was founded in 1905.

The community had its first significant residential growth during the 1920s when additional farmland was split up and sold. In the 1920s, there were substantial holdings obtained by St. Domitilla Roman Catholic Church and Mater Dolorosa Seminary. (The Mater Dolorosa Seminary building today houses Hillside&#x27;s government offices.) These institutions were formerly surrounded by open space, but following World War II, when Hillside&#x27;s population quadrupled (from 1,080 to 2,131) between 1940 and 1950, then surged to 7,794 in 1960, it was submerged in a wave of residential building. Hillside Retail Mall, a pioneering regional shopping area, was next to the just finished Congress Expressway in 1956. Soon after, a Holiday Inn, Hillside Theaters, the High Point Tower office structure, and the industrial park on Fencl Lane surrounding the center.

Hillside Retail Center&#x27;s heyday was brief due to the construction of newer, bigger malls and shopping complexes in the 1960s. The mall&#x27;s deterioration was unaffected by changes to the exterior look of the building, its tenants, or its ownership. The majority of the mall was razed in 1997 to make room for a large auto dealership.

According to the 2010 census, Hillside has a total area of , all land.

The Village Treasurer, the Village Chief of Police, and the Village Superintendent of Public Works are appointed. Hodgkins is in Illinois&#x27;s 3rd congressional district.

==History==
The first European visitors to present-day Hodgkins, explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet, paddled down the Des Plaines River in 1673, passing through the area, making their camp in present-day Summit. Settlement in the area, however, was somewhat stagnant until the early 19th century. It was at this time, around 1836, that Irish and Italian immigrants came to the area to work on the Illinois and Michigan Canal. The construction and eventual operation of the canal was responsible for the formation of many villages presently located along its banks, including Hodgkins. The I&amp;M Canal is still in existence, located about south of Hodgkins. The canal and its adjacent land, now known as the I&amp;M Canal National Heritage Corridor, was designated a National Heritage Corridor by Congress in 1984. The I&amp;M Canal National Heritage Corridor is rich in historic sites, nature preserves, and wildlife, and stretches from Chicago to LaSalle-Peru.

The village of Hodgkins was originally known as Gary, a name locals claim was derived from &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, in recognition of the large number of Italian laborers working in an area grain mill. After several name changes, the Village of Hodgkins was incorporated in 1896. Jefferson Hodgkins, the president of the Kimball and Cobb Stone company, which was also the first business to locate in the village, was the man for whom Hodgkins was named. Modesto Lenzi, the somewhat dubious &quot;King of Gary&quot;, became the village&#x27;s first president that same year.

===Patrick Crowley murder===
Modesto Lenzi was unsuccessful in his 1909 reelection bid. Lenzi was defeated by L. E. Thatcher in an election that contemporary newspaper accounts called &quot;a political feud between the prohibition and liquor interests&quot;. The election campaign raged hotly for several months, culminating in Lenzi&#x27;s ouster. On the night of June 14, 1909, the crowd gathered in Hodgkins during and after the election became unruly. Village marshal Patrick Crowley, in an attempt to restore order, placed Modesto Lenzi, who was allegedly inciting the crowd, under arrest for disturbing the peace. As Crowley was bringing Lenzi to the jail: &quot;A shot was fired in to his breast by some person in a crowd of alleged Lenzi sympathizers gathered about.&quot;

The &quot;Fort Wayne News&quot; reported the following on June 14, 1909:

::Modesto Lenzi, an Italian, was defeated for re-election as president of the village, after a hot anti-liquor fight at the last election...the man started peacefully to the village lock-up, but when half way there suddenly offered resistance. As Crowley as remonstrating with him, an unknown man suddenly appeared, drew a revolver and shot Crowley dead. In the excitement the slayer fled.

The shooter, believed to be Modesto&#x27;s brother, Harry, escaped and a manhunt ensued.

On June 22, 1909, a grand jury concluded:

::The said Patrick Crowley now lying dead...in said village of LaGrange...came to his death...from shock and hemorrhage due to a bullet wound in the right breast, said bullet fired from a revolver held in the hand of one Harry Lenzi, on the road at Gary [Hodgkins], Ill. on June 13, 1909. And from the evidence presented, we the jury recommend that Harry Lenzi, as principal and now at large, be apprehended, and that Modesto Lenzi and John May, as accessories before the fact, be held to the Grand Jury on the charge of murder, until released by due process of law. We the jury further believe that if one Frank Meno, had not interfered, the above named Harry Lenzi would now be in custody. We therefore recommend that Frank Meno be apprehended and held as an accessory after the fact.

On December 23, 1909, it was reported by the &quot;Logansport Pharos&quot; newspaper that the charges of murder against Modesto Lenzi and John May had been dropped. The paper reported that Assistant State&#x27;s Attorney Benedict J. Short told Judge Kersten&#x27;s court that the state had no evidence against the defendants. Harry Lenzi, known locally as &quot;Rio&quot;, disappeared immediately after the shooting and was never seen again.

Marshall Crowley was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Chicago.

==McCook-Hodgkins Enterprise Zone==
In the 1950s and 1960s, Hodgkins began to attract motor freight terminals. The village&#x27;s location relative to expressways and the availability of high, flat, and dry land made it a natural distribution and transfer point between Chicago and the rest of the nation. Hodgkins grew substantially during these two decades; however, by the late 1970s, the motor freight industry began to decline.

In 1985, Hodgkins joined with the village of McCook to create the McCook-Hodgkins Enterprise Zone. The next year saw the creation of a Tax Increment Finance (TIF) District within the Enterprise Zone. Both of these tools allowed the village to offer incentives to new businesses desiring to locate there. As a result of these programs, commercial business began to replace motor freight as Hodgkins&#x27; mechanism of growth. Developers built a major local shopping center, The Quarry Mall, on land vacated by the declining motor freight companies in 1992. Several auto dealerships, restaurants, a movie theater and an off-track betting establishment were also attracted to the development. The crown jewel of the Enterprise Zone, however, is the United Parcel Service (UPS) package sorting facility built in 1991.

==Jefferson Hodgkins==
The village&#x27;s name comes from a local landowner and businessman, Jefferson Hodgkins, and is unrelated to the discoverer of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, Thomas Hodgkin.

The Kimball and Cobb Stone Quarry, organized in 1888, was the first major business in the area that would later become Hodgkins. The establishment of this business was the first concrete step in permanent settlement of the village. The president of the Kimball and Cobb Stone Quarry was Jefferson Hodgkins, the man for whom the village was named. The secretary of the company was Frederic Cobb, the man whose name was given to Cobb Street.

Hodgkins, a quarryman and crushed stone contractor, was born in Lamoine, Maine, on October 27, 1843. Hodgkins went through the public schools of Lemoine. After leaving school at the age of 17, he became a sailor. Hodgkins spent eight years in this vocation, sailing out of both New York and Boston, except for one year when he served as a private in Company C 26th Maine Volunteers during the Civil War.

Hodgkins worked for the federal government in surveying projects in 1869 and 1870. He came to Chicago in 1872 and became superintendent of the Chicago Dredging and Dock Company for several years, later contracting business for himself. It was in 1885, while president of the Brownell Improvement Company, that Hodgkins organized the Kimball and Cobb Stone Company. Three years later, he bought the company and consolidated it with his own. The newly merged improvement company owned stone quarries, manufactured crushed stone and contracted primarily railway work.

Hodgkins was active socially and in politics. In addition to other posts, Hodgkins served as aide-de-camp on Illinois Governor Joseph W. Fifer&#x27;s staff, holding the rank of Colonel.

It is unclear exactly how Hodgkins&#x27; name came to replace Gary as the village&#x27;s moniker. Throughout its history, Hodgkins has been known by several different names. In the years before settlers began to arrive, the Potawatomi people lived in the area near the Des Plaines River. From 1836 transient workers were brought to the area to work on the I&amp;M Canal; however, it was not until 1860, when the United States government deeded property to a local settler, Hurls Polk, that the name &quot;Polk&quot; was given to the area. When the Santa Fe Depot was built in 1887, the name of the stop was &quot;Novak&quot;. By 1890, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad listed the stop in present-day Hodgkins as &quot;Gary&quot;. this designation would stick until July 1, 1896, when the village of Hodgkins was incorporated.

Quarrying continues today at the Vulcan Materials Company McCook Quarry, with a total of in Hodgkins and McCook.

==Immanuel Lutheran Church==
Thoughts of organizing a Lutheran congregation at Hodgkins were entertained as far back as the 1880s. At that time there were several Lutheran families living in what would later be the village of Hodgkins who were members of the Lutheran churches of La Grange (St. John) and Willow Springs (Trinity). A local merchant named John Witsan organized a Sunday school in Hodgkins about this same time. The development of the Sunday school amplified, for the Lutheran families, the inconvenience of sending their children to the Lutheran day schools and Sunday schools in La Grange and Willow Springs, and thoughts of a stand-alone congregation in Hodgkins began to materialize. Two representatives from the Lutheran churches in La Grange and Willow Springs, Reinhardt Leu and Henry Bloedorn, approached Reverend Alex Ullrich of LaGrange with the proposition of establishing a Lutheran congregation in Hodgkins.

A conference was held after this meeting with Reverend Herman Meyer of Willow Springs. Reverend Meyer was strongly in favor of the movement and immediately set about to conduct the first Lutheran worship services in Hodgkins, in the old Village Hall in the spring of 1911. On April 23, 1911, twenty-six men gathered together in the same hall, along with Reverend Ullrich and Reverend Meyer, and formally organized Immanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hodgkins, Illinois. The newly formed congregation adopted a constitution and called Reverend Meyer as its pastor. Reverend Ullrich was called as the assistant pastor.

==Fire protection==
From the early days of the village, Hodgkins maintained its own firefighting capabilities, going from an organized bucket brigade that assembled at the ringing of the large bell atop the original wood-frame Village Hall during the 20th century, to a Volunteer Fire Department with two full-time firefighters augmented by other volunteers who manned three fire engines.

Since 1976, Hodgkins has been served by the Pleasantview Fire Protection District which began with one engine in 1946. It now serves a large area in the southwest suburbs of Chicago. It is administered by its own board of trustees made up of citizens living in its geographical district who are elected by voters in the district. The fire district currently maintains three stations throughout its coverage area.

Station One, which also houses the district&#x27;s headquarters, is located at 1970 Plainfield Road in La Grange Highlands. Station Two is located at 7675 Wolf Road in Burr Ridge. Station Three, the newest facility, is located at 9096 W. Joliet Road in Hodgkins. These three facilities serve the municipalities of Burr Ridge, Countryside, Hodgkins, and Indian Head Park, and the unincorporated areas of La Grange Highlands and other areas nearby.

The district maintains professional, full-time firefighting crews at all three stations including paramedics for its ambulances. The Pleasantview Fire Protection District is also an integral member of a large Mutual Aid Association of fire fighters, paramedics, and rescue workers throughout the area.

== Hodgkins today ==
The village of Hodgkins maintains its own police department, public works department, and water department, which purchases Lake Michigan water from McCook. Hodgkins Elementary School is part of La Grange School District 105. High school students attend Lyons Township High School. The Hodgkins Park District offers a large community center and schedules a myriad of activities all year long. The Hodgkins Public Library is a full-service facility within the Reaching Across Illinois Library System. The Village of Hodgkins currently employs 25 full- and part-time employees. Hodgkins is covered by two local newspapers: the &quot;Suburban Life&quot;; and the &quot;Desplaines Valley News&quot;.

<text>Hoffman Estates is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is a suburb of Chicago. Per the 2020 census, the population was 52,530.

The village previously served as the headquarters for Sears and is one of the American headquarters for Mori Seiki. Now Arena, home of the Windy City Bulls of the NBA G League is part of the village. Between 2006 and 2009, the village hosted the Heartland International Tattoo, one of the largest music and dance festivals of its kind in the Midwest.

==History==
Prior to the 1940s, German settlers moved into the area west of Roselle Road and north of Golf Road, then known as Wildcat Grove. The area was sparsely populated until farmers purchased land in the area in the 1940s.

In 1954, Sam and Jack Hoffman, owners of a father-son owned construction company, bought 160 acres of land in the area. The pair constructed homes and began the development of the region which now bears their name. As residents moved in, they voted to incorporate the area, and the Village of Hoffman Estates was incorporated on September 23, 1959. In 1973, six former town officials, including mayors Edward F. Pinger (1959−1965) and Roy L. Jenkins (1965−1969) were indicted on bribery and tax charges.

Once the Northwest Tollway opened, Schaumburg Township became more attractive to Chicago commuters. In the early 1960s, land annexations north of the tollway and in other neighboring regions more than doubled Hoffman Estates&#x27; land area.

The opening of the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg to the east in 1971 made the area a major business center. An attempt to change the name of the village to East Barrington, among other names, was made in the early 1980s but failed upon a residential vote.

In the 1990s, the Prairie Stone Business Park began development. This planned multi-purpose business park is bounded by Illinois Route 59 on the east, Interstate 90 on the south, Illinois Route 72 on the north, and Beverly Road on the west. The business park came to fruition in 1993 when Sears, Roebuck and Company relocated from the Sears Tower in Chicago to a sprawling headquarters in the northwest part of Prairie Stone. That was followed in by Indramat and Quest International, which in 1995 also opened facilities in the park. Throughout the 1990s, a health and wellness center and child care facility were developed, as well as other smaller office buildings, and a branch of Northern Illinois University. Development of the business park is still ongoing, and recent additions in the 2000s include the 11,000-seat Now Arena; office buildings for Serta, WT Engineering, I-CAR, and Mary Kay; a Cabela&#x27;s outdoor outfitters store; a 295-room Marriott hotel; and the Poplar Creek Crossing Retail Center, which is anchored by Target and numerous other big-box retailers. Future development will include further office buildings and retail development, Sun Island Hotel and Water Park, an amphitheater, and restaurants.

In 2011, the Village of Hoffman Estates took over ownership of the Now Arena. On June 23, 2020, the Village of Hoffman Estates approved an $11.5 million deal to rename the Sears Centre Arena to the &quot;NOW Arena&quot;.

In the fall of 2016, papers and artifacts from President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration began to arrive in town, where they are being stored in a building on Golf Road. The site is their temporary home while construction takes place on the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, Chicago, and is not open to the public.

In January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the second U.S. case of COVID-19 in a Hoffman Estates resident. The patient, a woman in her 60s returning from Wuhan, China, was treated at St. Alexius Medical Center. Her husband was later infected in the first case of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the United States.

The Lyonsville Congregational Church on the corner of Joliet and Wolf roads was once a stop on the Underground Railroad.

The Village of Indian Head Park was incorporated on August 4, 1959.

<text>Inverness is a suburban village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 7,616.

==Geography==
Inverness is located at (42.113275, -88.098433).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Inverness has a total area of , of which (or 97.68%) is land and (or 2.32%) is water.

The village borders are defined by Barrington Road to the west, Roselle Road to the east, Algonquin Road to the south, and Dundee Road to the north.

==History==

The Inverness area was first settled in 1836 by George Ela and became known as Deer Grove. After surveying the township area, in 1840 the US government offered land in the area for $1.25 per acre. By 1854, rail service was established to Deer Grove, and in 1859 the line was incorporated into the Chicago and North Western Railway system. The Inverness area was now easily accessible to Chicago. The frontier had been opened.

In 1926, Mr. Arthur T. McIntosh, one of Chicago&#x27;s leading land developers, bought the Temple farm and house, which was originally built by Ralph Atkinson. It was the first of eleven parcels to be acquired by him. These lands, combined with the acquisition of the Cudahy Company Golf Course, comprised for development. With the area under McIntosh&#x27;s control, it became known as Inverness, after the McIntosh clan home in Scotland.

An important person during this early development was Way Thompson, who preserved the natural beauty of the area by laying out the road system to take advantage of the rolling land and by subdividing lots to conform to natural contours. A minimum lot size of was established. Thompson also approved all house plans and where they were located on the lots. The first ten homes were even decorated by his wife, Barbara. The first new homes were occupied by 1939. These homes were mostly situated around the edge of the Inverness Golf Club and were designed to be affordable to young couples. They were priced from $9,500 to $20,000. McIntosh built the first 20 homes. After that, the homes were custom built for individuals who purchased lots from McIntosh.

Construction in Inverness was halted during World War II. During the early post-war years, the McIntosh Company had complete control over the sale of lots as well as the resale of homes. Placement of homes was carefully controlled to protect the character of the community.

In 1962, Inverness was incorporated as a village to be governed by a president and board of trustees. The first meeting of the village board was July 5, 1962, and was held at the Field House, which was then at the western edge of the village. In the spring of 1977 the Village Hall was relocated to a 100-year-old farmhouse on Palatine Road. It was again relocated in 1985 to its present location at the Four Silos, which has become a famous landmark and gateway to the community.

During the 1970s and &#x27;80s, the village continued to grow at a pace that exceeded earlier predictions. Homes became larger and styles were more varied. It was also during this period that the village annexed large areas of existing homes in unincorporated Cook County, which laid the foundation for further annexations to the west, which continued to expand the village limits to what they are today. Williamsburg Village, the only business development in Inverness, was started in 1981.

<doc id="111001" wikidata="Q640701" url="?curid=111001" title="Kenilworth, Illinois">
<text>Kenilworth is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, north of downtown Chicago. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 2,514. It is the newest of the nine suburban North Shore communities bordering Lake Michigan, and is one of those developed as a planned community. 

In 2018, Kenilworth was the eighth wealthiest community in the United States, and the wealthiest in the Midwestern United States. In December 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed Kenilworth village as the wealthiest zip code in the state of Illinois, with a median home sale price of $1,385,000 as of October 2019. According to the United States Census Bureau, median household income exceeded an estimated $250,000 in 2022.

== History ==
Kenilworth was founded in 1889 when Joseph Sears purchased 223.6 acres of land consisting of several farms between the Chicago and North Western Railroad and Lake Michigan for $150,300. Sears and several of his associates formed The Kenilworth Company to execute his suburban dream.

Sears founded the town on four principles: &quot;Large lots, high standards of construction, no alleys, and sales to Caucasians only.&quot; The Caucasians only provision intended the exclusion of all non-whites and Jews as well. Sears later used an informal poll to amend this provision so that live-in servants of color were allowed. This resulted in a population of 79 African Americans by 1950, all of whom worked as servants. The impact has endured: as of 2020, just 10 African Americans lived in Kenilworth (0.4% of the population).

The company undertook all marketing activities. They publicized the community&#x27;s many attractive features through brochures, maps, and newspaper ads, as well as direct personal sales. Prospects were provided transportation from the city and greeted with a reception. Visitors were also offered overnight accommodations. In 1891, Sears invited about 20 of his personal friends, prominent bankers and Chicago businessmen to a picnic luncheon on Kenilworth&#x27;s lake shore. Lots were offered at $60 an acre; significantly above the $15 an acre for similarly located property nearby. Some laughed, but the property did sell within 12 months. This planned community attracted widespread attention and was visited by many noted architects attending the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

On February 4, 1896, the village reached the required 300 residents and was incorporated. The elected board assumed municipal functions from Sears. The Kenilworth Company continued their sales activities until 1904, at which time Sears acquired the existing stock and became the sole owner of the remaining property.

The Kenilworth Company coordinated every aspect of this planned community to ensure the highest quality implementation and adherence to Joseph Sears’ vision. The village layout was designed to take advantage of the natural features and beauty of the land. To maintain the country atmosphere, the plan required large lots and setbacks, tree plantings along roadways, and generous park lands. Mr. Sears donated much of his own property to achieve this goal.

The church, schools, parks, clubs, and recreational areas were early additions to encourage a spirit of community. Noted architect Franklin Burnham joined The Kenilworth Company and designed the railroad station and the Kenilworth Union Church. Burnham also designed several homes for company members to display for potential residents.

The first African American family to move to Kenilworth, the Calhouns, was met with resistance by many in the community, such as a cross burning in 1966 and racially charged vandalism, while others voiced shock over the offenses. Speaking of his friends and neighbors, Walter Calhoun, a young student and athlete at the time, recalls &quot;They bent over backwards to make sure I was never left out.&quot; Four years after the shocking incident, two teenagers visited Harold Calhoun in his downtown office where they confessed and apologized for the cross burning.

<text>La Grange ( ; often spelled LaGrange) is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is a suburb of Chicago. The population was 16,321 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area around La Grange was first settled in the 1830s, when Chicago residents moved out to the west due to the rapid population increase in the city in the decade since its incorporation. The first settler, Robert Leitch, came to the area in 1830, seven years before the City of Chicago was incorporated. La Grange&#x27;s location, at approximately from the Chicago Loop, is not considered far from the city by today&#x27;s standards, but in that time the residents enjoyed the peace of rural life without much communication with urban residents.

The village was officially incorporated on June 11, 1879. It was founded by Franklin Dwight Cossitt, who was born in Granby, Connecticut, and raised in Tennessee, and moved to Chicago in 1862 where he built a successful wholesale grocery business.

In 1870, Cossitt purchased several hundred acres of farmland in Lyons Township, along the Chicago-Dixon Road, known today as Ogden Avenue (U.S. Highway 34). Ogden Avenue, on the site of a defunct Native American trail, was also referred to as the &quot;Old Plank Road&quot;. Planks were often stolen by settlers to be used as building material, which made traveling very bumpy. When the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad came to town, La Grange was a milk stop called Hazel Glen. A few miles to the south, through present-day Willow Springs, the Illinois and Michigan Canal had emerged as a major shipping corridor, connecting Chicago and the Great Lakes with the Illinois and Mississippi rivers.

Cossitt set out to build the ideal suburban village – laying out streets, planting trees, donating property for churches and schools, and building quality homes for sale between $2,000–$8000 USD. He also placed liquor restrictions in the land deeds he sold to prevent the village from becoming a saloon town.

When Cossitt began his development, the area was served by a post office known as Kensington. But upon learning of another community already with that name in Illinois, Cossitt decided to name his town in honor of La Grange, Tennessee, where he had been raised as a youth on an uncle&#x27;s slave plantation. To this day, Kensington remains the name of one of the village&#x27;s major avenues.

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed much of that city, thousands of its citizens sought new homes and opportunities far from the city&#x27;s ills but within a convenient commute. La Grange was ideally situated to accommodate them.

Telephones were first set up by Dr. George Fox in the 1880s for quick communication between his home office and a drug store, enabling him to order prescriptions to be delivered by buggy in a moment&#x27;s notice. Growing to 52 lines in 1894, it increased twofold to 120 by the next year, and surged to 2,346 by 1921 (36 percent of the population at the time).

There was a large spike in population is the 1880s and 1890s as the village grew from just over 500 to nearly 4,000 residents, over 600% growth in twenty years. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1960s, peaking at 17,814 according to the 1970 census. The population declined slightly in the &#x27;70s &amp; &#x27;80s and has been relatively stable since then.

==Geography==
La Grange is located at (41.807938, −87.873455), about west of Chicago. The village is roughly flat, only deviating from the elevation of 645 feet by at most ten feet. La Grange is surrounded by incorporated places of similar sizes on all sides except to the South West, where the generously named La Grange Highlands are.

As of 2020, La Grange has a total area of , all land. Two major railroad tracks run through the village, including the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and the CSX/Indiana Harbor Belt lines.

Some 14,000 years ago, the land under La Grange sat on the western shore of Lake Chicago, a predecessor to Lake Michigan. The prehistoric shoreline today is delineated by Bluff Avenue, a north–south street on the village&#x27;s east side.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census there were 16,321 people, 5,445 households, and 3,974 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 6,415 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 84.09% White, 3.71% African American, 0.29% Native American, 1.72% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 2.88% from other races, and 7.30% from two or more races.

==Economy==

===Business and commerce===

La Grange is the mailing address for the headquarters of Electro-Motive Diesel, formerly General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division, a major manufacturer of railroad locomotives and diesel engines. The headquarters, engineering facilities and parts-manufacturing operations actually are located in the adjacent village of McCook. Originally, the locomotives were also built there, but in more recent years final assembly has moved to EMD&#x27;s other facility in Muncie, Indiana.

The downtown area, centered along and around La Grange Road (US 45) and the BNSF Railway line, became somewhat run-down during the 1980s, but saw a revival in the mid-to-late 1990s, with many new businesses opening, including many restaurants.

That expansion of the downtown led to increased congestion, and parking often became difficult to find, especially on weekends. A parking structure was paid for by a grant from the state for the advancement of public transportation, since increasing parking for train commuters would increase the number of people willing to use the train. The upkeep is paid for by an increase in the sales tax at restaurants and other entertainment establishments. There was no increase in the local property taxes.

==Arts and culture==
La Grange holds numerous public activities and festivals. Art fairs, historic housewalks, carnivals, and farmer&#x27;s markets are also common, mostly taking place in the downtown area.

===Pet Parade===
An annual event known as the &quot;Pet Parade&quot; has been conducted every year since 1947 and attracts thousands of people from the La Grange area. The parade marches through downtown and includes a wild variety of animal pets like dogs, cats, hamsters, birds, and farm animals. There is a long history of Grand Marshals for the parade including Elephants and Donkeys from the Brookfield Zoo (1948), Luci Baines Johnson – Daughter of the President Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), and Susan Dey and Danny Bonaduce of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (1971).

===Architecture===
The La Grange Village Historic District makes up a large section of the village and includes over 1,000 buildings representing several popular architectural styles of late 19th century and early 20th century. A few homes in district were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. There is even a &quot;bootleg&quot; house, one he designed on the side, contrary to his employment agreement, when he was supposed to be working exclusively for architect Louis Sullivan. Wright was reportedly fired over this and similar employment agreement infractions.

==Parks and recreation==
The Park District of La Grange maintains 78.5 acres of parkland at 11 locations, and offers over 1,500 recreation programs annually for its more than 16,000 residents. Parks within the village limits include:
*Community Center &amp; Park (1 acre)
*Denning Park (10 acres)
*Elm Park (2 acres)
*Gilbert Park (6 acres)
*Gordon Park (17 acres)
*Meadowbrook Manor Park
*Rotary Centennial Park (0.3 acres)
*Sedgwick Park (25 acres)
*Spring Park (0.85 acres)
*Spring/Gurrie School Park (8 acres)
*Stone Park (0.5 acres)
*Waiola Park (3.5 acres)

==Government==

The Village of La Grange is a non-home rule municipal corporation and operates under a board-manager form of government. A seven-member board of trustees, elected as provided by state law, serves four-year overlapping terms. A village manager is appointed by the board.

The village has six operating departments: administration, finance, police, fire, community development and public works.

The village is in Illinois&#x27;s 4th congressional district, and is represented by Jesús G. &quot;Chuy&quot; García.

The village is served by the Park District of La Grange with a five-member board of commissioners, elected as provided by state law, which serves four-year overlapping terms. An executive director is appointed by the board.

=== Endorsing organizations ===
A Citizens&#x27; Council has existed in La Grange for over 75 years. As all such organizations under the village manager form of government, it is non-partisan. The council in particular seeks, evaluates, and recommends candidates for the village, library and park district boards.

Other non-partisan slating organizations form periodically to seek and support candidates for the various elected boards.

==Education==

===Public schools===
Students in the village are served by one of three K-8 public school districts. The northern half of the village (roughly any students north of 47th Street) is part of La Grange School District 102. District 102 elementary schools within the village include: Cossitt School (named after Franklin Cossitt) and Ogden Avenue School (named after the local name for U.S. Route 34, which in turn is named after William Butler Ogden, first mayor of Chicago). Kindergarten students in District 102 may also attend Barnsdale Road School in La Grange Park, Illinois. Some elementary students attend Forest Road School in neighboring La Grange Park, Illinois, and Congress Park School in neighboring Brookfield, Illinois. Middle school students in District 102 attend Park Junior High, located in La Grange Park.

The southern half of the village (roughly any students south of 47th Street) is part of La Grange School District 105. District 105 elementary schools within the village include: Seventh Avenue School and Spring Avenue School, both located on the streets that share their names. Middle school students in District 105 attend Gurrie Middle School.

A small number of students in the southwest portion of La Grange are served by LaGrange Highlands School District 106, attending Highlands Elementary School and Highlands Middle School in nearby La Grange Highlands, Illinois.

Lyons Township High School District 204 serves the entire village grades 9 through 12. North Campus, located in La Grange, is used by Juniors and Seniors and was the original high school. Freshmen and Sophomores go to South Campus, founded in 1956, located in neighboring Western Springs. The Campus was split due to lack of available land for expansion around the original building. Previously there also was a junior college associated with the high school but due to increasing enrollment, lack of space, and new rules that separated junior colleges from high schools, it was merged with College of DuPage in 1967. When it was open, Lyons Township Junior College was nicknamed Tick-Tock Tech, due to its location near the clock tower.

===Private schools===
St. Cletus and St. Francis Xavier serve as the two Roman Catholic K-8 schools in La Grange. St. John&#x27;s Lutheran is the one Lutheran K-8 school within the village limits.

Preschool programs are available at Kensington School of La Grange, Creative World Montessori School, Little People&#x27;s Country, Grace Lutheran Church, and First United Methodist Church.

==Media==

One of the newspapers of La Grange is &quot;The Doings&quot;, a subsidiary of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

===Lyons Township===
Lyons Township High School by far provides the most media outlets. The first one established, &quot;LION Newspaper&quot;, was founded over a century ago and distributes news to all over the district. The second form of media, WLTL, first aired in 1968 and has been broadcasting music for fifty years. LTHS also hosts Lyons Township Television (LTTV), which transmits sports or programs created by students of Lyons Township.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Roads====

Two major highways traverse La Grange: The village&#x27;s main street, La Grange Road (U.S. Routes 12/20/45), runs north–south and intersects Interstate 55 (Stevenson Expressway) south of the village. Ogden Avenue (U.S. Route 34) runs east–west and intersects Interstate 294 (Tri-State Tollway), west of the village.

====Bus service====
Commuter bus service is provided by Pace, the suburban bus division of the Regional Transportation Authority.

====Train service====
The first rail link to Chicago dates to 1864, established by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. La Grange currently has three tracks belonging to the BNSF Railway that run through the north end of the village, with passenger rail service provided by Metra and Amtrak.

Metra&#x27;s BNSF Line provides frequent commuter service between Aurora and Chicago, with two stations in La Grange. Express service to Downtown Chicago (Union Station) from La Grange Road takes approx. 23 minutes. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg&quot; (both destined for Quincy, Illinois) run twice daily trains through La Grange stopping at La Grange Road.

Freight rail traffic on the BNSF line is extremely heavy, with BNSF operating freight trains on all three mainline tracks through the village. During non-rush hours, a freight train may run along the line as frequently as once every ten minutes on average. The Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, running north–south through the east end of the village, also has extremely heavy freight traffic.

====Airport====
O&#x27;Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport are approx. away from La Grange, respectively.

A proposed passenger rail line connecting the two airports would have a station in La Grange.

<doc id="111005" wikidata="Q1589523" url="?curid=111005" title="Lemont, Illinois">
<text>Lemont is a village located in Cook, DuPage, and Will counties in the U.S. state of Illinois, and is a south-west suburb of Chicago. The population was 17,629 as of the 2020 census. The village is situated on a hillside along the south banks of the Des Plaines River. It overlooks Waterfall Glen&#x27;s Midwestern Bluff Savanna on the opposite side. Lemont is home to Argonne National Laboratory and other heavy industrial sites, and has a substantial European immigrant population.

==History==

Before European settlers arrived in Lemont, Native Americans traveled the Des Plaines River in birch bark canoes on trading trips between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan. The native Potawatomi lived off the land in this area, directly using natural resources for food, shelter, clothing and medicine. In the 18th century, French voyageurs traveled down the Des Plaines River, trading Native Americans metal, beads and cloth for animal furs.

Lemont was originally known as &quot;Keepataw&quot; (after a Potawatomi chief) and a post office was established in 1840 as &quot;Keepatau&quot;. After that, it was named &quot;Athens&quot; and then &quot;Palmyra&quot;. The name &quot;Lemont&quot; (literally, &#x27;the mountain&#x27; in French) was chosen in 1850 at the suggestion of Lemuel Brown, the postmaster and justice of the peace, or perhaps by his brother Nathaniel Brown.

Established in 1836, the village of Lemont stands as one of the oldest American communities in northeastern Illinois. It is historically significant for its role in transforming the northern region of the state from a sparsely settled frontier to a commercial, agricultural, and industrial region that supplied Chicago and areas beyond with commodities. Lemont is also unique in boasting an authentic historic district that remains intact and has been continually used since the 19th century. In 2016, the Lemont Downtown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Both Lemont&#x27;s history and architectural uniqueness connect to the Illinois and Michigan Canal (I&amp;M Canal). Construction of the I&amp;M Canal began in 1837 and stands as one of the last major canal undertakings in the United States (the Hennepin Canal opened in 1907). When it was completed in 1848, it provided a continuous waterway stretching from New York (through the Erie Canal, Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan to Chicago, then through the I&amp;M Canal for entering the Illinois River at LaSalle, Illinois, to the Mississippi River, to New Orleans) to the Gulf of Mexico.

Immigrant workers, mostly Irish, settled in Lemont to work on the canal and later moved along the corridor of the canal, improving farms within the many communities that sprang up along it.

In digging, workers discovered Lemont yellow dolomite, a harder and finer grained version of limestone. This delayed digging of the canal, but was the start of the area&#x27;s second industry, quarrying. By the mid-19th century, limestone quarrying took over as the main economic factor in Lemont and sustained its growth. The town&#x27;s important major buildings were faced with the Lemont limestone, abundant in local quarries. Today, 38 of those buildings remain as the Lemont downtown district. Lemont limestone was used to build the Chicago Water Tower, a building that &quot;gained special significance as one of the few buildings to survive the destructive path of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871&quot;. In the early years, this stone was known as &quot;Athens Marble&quot; as a nod to its place of origin. An 1859 item in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; had this to say: “The Athens and DesPlaines quarries, situated on the Illinois and Michigan canal, embrace 335 acres of the finest stone in the West, known as “Athens Marble”. This stone has a high reputation for color, durability and beauty, which renders it quite an article of commerce”.

Cargo and passengers were transported on the I&amp;M until the early 20th century, when the wider, deeper Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was built parallel to it. The Sanitary Canal is still used today as part of the Illinois Waterway system.

Lemont&#x27;s motto is &quot;Village of Faith&quot;, and its church spires reflect the many ethnic groups who came here to quarry stone, dig the Sanitary and Ship Canal and work in other industries.

Lemont is credited with being the largest recruiting station for the Union Army during the American Civil War, and the Old Stone Church, built in 1861 of limestone, was used as a recruiting depot. It served as the Lemont Methodist Episcopal Church for 100 years, from 1861 until 1970, when it became home to the Lemont Area Historical Society. The oldest building in Lemont, it now serves as a museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the Civil War, Lemont was required to sign up 33 soldiers, the village recruited 293 soldiers; only 63 returned. The Lemont Civil War Memorial Committee was formed to build a memorial to honor Lemont&#x27;s Civil War veterans. The monument was dedicated in 2008 in Legion Park at the east end of Main Street, opposite the Metra Station. Of the 293 soldiers sent to fight in the war, only 243 names of the enlisted soldiers are known. Among them is Cpl. John Warden, the only Lemont resident ever awarded the Medal of Honor.

By 1854, railroads transported goods faster than water, and the I&amp;M became obsolete as Lemont evolved into a railroad community; the village was incorporated on June 9, 1873.

Increasingly, the canal was used to carry wastes away from Chicago. In 1900, the larger Sanitary and Ship Canal went into operation, carrying both wastes and larger, more modern barges. All use of the I&amp;M Canal ended in 1933, with the opening of the canal&#x27;s modern successor - the Illinois Waterway.

By about 1920, the quarries declined as styles changed and builders began to use Bedford limestone from Indiana and less expensive materials like concrete.

During World War II, the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago moved into the nearby Argonne Forest preserves to carry out Enrico Fermi&#x27;s work on nuclear reactors for the Manhattan Project. After the war, Argonne National Laboratory was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation establishing the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor as the nation&#x27;s first National Heritage Corridor. The status recognizes the historic importance of this region and the waterway that connected Lake Michigan and the Illinois River. Today, it is a cultural park between Chicago and LaSalle/Peru, representing an ongoing partnership between the public and private sectors created to achieve a successful mixture of preservation, public use and industrial activity.

Sacred architecture is a strong suit of Lemont, whose skyline is dominated by two landmark religious edifices: the Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago and SS. Cyril and Methodius church in the Polish Cathedral style. Both are situated on the sides of hills, giving an even more dramatic backdrop to their monumental architecture.

===Tornadoes===
On June 13, 1976, at 5:18 PM, a killer tornado struck Lemont and took three lives. 23 were injured, 87 homes were destroyed and 82 more were damaged. Damage to the high school alone was estimated at $500,000 (). Many people reported watching neighbors&#x27; homes explode, implode, shattering before their eyes. Cited as an unusual tornado, it backed up on its path before heading North, somewhat parallel to its path of origin. See Tornadoes of 1976 for more information on the outbreak.

On March 27, 1991, Lemont was again hit by a tornado. See Tornadoes of 1991 for more information on the outbreak.

The Lincolnwood Economic Development Commission has been established to ensure the continued enhancement of the local economy and improved tax base.

Mayor Henry Proesel was elected in 1931 and ended his 46 years in office in 1977, a record mostly unmatched by any other mayor in American history. Succeeding him was John Porcelli, who served two terms. Porcelli was followed by Frank Chulay, who also served two terms.

Lincolnwood&#x27;s first woman mayor, Madeline Grant, succeeded Chulay, and in 1995 created a nine-member Economic Development Commission.

Peter Moy served as village trustee from 1995 to 2000, then as village president until 2005. He was the first Asian American to serve any municipality in Illinois as its president.

== Public safety ==
Lincolnwood has a police station staffed by 34 personnel. The Lincolnwood Fire Department is housed in a facility operated by 28 full-timers. The Lincolnwood Fire Department was established through private contract in 1990. (Previously, village fire protection was provided through the City of Chicago.)

==Public library==
The Lincolnwood Public Library, established in 1978, is located in the center of the village at Pratt and Lincoln Avenues. Madeline Grant was the main driving force behind founding the library, and served as the first library president and later village president.

The library is governed by a board of trustees that meets monthly to make decisions about Lincolnwood Public Library&#x27;s services, finances, policies, and other business. The board of trustees is made up of trustees elected to four year terms. As of 2021, the Lincolnwood Public Library District&#x27;s Library Director is Josephine Tucci. 

The library has a substantial Historical Collection that includes materials that address the Village of Lincolnwood&#x27;s history from the time of the Village of Tessville until the COVID-19 pandemic. The library is also home to a Library of Things, where Lincolnwood residents can check out items not traditionally found in libraries, including bike repair kits, Dungeon &amp; Dragons kits, Rokus, photography equipment, and more.

==Education==
Lincolnwood is served by Lincolnwood School District 74, which has a one-campus setting with three main facilities named after the Lincoln family.

Northwestern University in Evanston, Loyola University in Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago, and North Park University in Chicago are all within of the village.

In September 2012, there was much controversy about the village board&#x27;s consideration of approving a zoning law change to allow the establishment of a public gun range and store in Lincolnwood 1/2 mile from schools and parks. In March 2013, the gun shop decided to sue the village in response to its denial of their shooting range proposal. A primary concern of residents is that the gun shop, one of &quot;A small handful of gun stores, three from Cook County and one from Gary, Indiana, continue to be responsible for a disproportionate number of crime guns recovered from Chicago&#x27;s streets.&quot;

<text>Lyons is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 10,817. The Chicago Portage National Historic Site is located in Lyons.

==History==
Lyons was incorporated in 1888, though activity in the area dates back much further. In 1673 French Explorer Louis Joliet and Jesuit missionary Father Pierre Marquette left Green Bay, Wisconsin, by canoe in search of a western passage to the Pacific. As they traveled into the Spanish-controlled area of Louisiana, they realized that the mighty Mississippi River drained into the already well-known Gulf of Mexico. With winter approaching, they headed north as quickly as possible. To save time, the Potawatomi who were with them were encouraged to change their route to the Illinois River. The shortcut led to the Des Plaines River and caused the French travelers to discover “Le Portage.” This half-mile wide area of land connecting the Chicago River and the Des Plaines River, over which they could carry their canoes and supplies, was to become the discovery for which they would both become famous. Later known as the Chicago Portage, this small area became the “Gateway to the West” and was used by thousands of early settlers and traders traveling both east and west. The discovery of “Le Portage” was part of the impetus that led to Chicago becoming a center for world trade.

Louis Joliet was the first to propose a canal between the two waterways, which would be constructed around 200 years later in 1848 with the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. In time, the part of the I&amp;M Canal that connected the south branch of the Chicago River with the Des Plaines River was replaced with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which was completed in 1900. Today, a statue stands in Lyons at the Chicago Portage National Historic Sight just north of Interstate 55 along Harlem Avenue, commemorating this historic National Heritage Corridor which stretches southwest through La Salle, Illinois.

From the early 1960s through the late 1980s, Lyons was known for its notorious links to organized crime. Mayor William Smith, for whom a park was named, was being subjected to a federal corruption investigation when he died from cancer in 1989. During the 1970s and 1980s, the small town was littered with strip clubs and bars along its Ogden Avenue corridor. It was often referred to an area of east Ogden Avenue known as &quot;Driftland&quot;, due to the amount of drifters in the area. However, the village changed dramatically in the 1990s, and none of the strip clubs and most licensed bars no longer exist. Lyons continues to thrive and attract businesses and new residents. It is now a quiet residential suburb supported by several grammar schools, a middle school, and a well-maintained park district.

Lyons is a working-class area, though much of the nearby manufacturing work has dried up (e.g., Electro-Motive &amp; Reynolds Aluminum) small specialty businesses have emerged. The city has historically been home to a large Polish American community since the turn of the 20th century, which is reflected in three of the town&#x27;s street names: Pulaski after Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski as well as Warsaw and Kraków. Lyons is the subject of a recently published book by Mark Athitakis, a native of Lyons, detailing the town&#x27;s rich and colorful history.

<text>Markham is a city and a south suburb of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 11,661 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

It is claimed this area was beach 10,000 years ago. After countless ages of geologic swamps, marshes and sloughs, the prairies dominated the landscape with groves of trees, flowers, and wildlife in abundance.

Markham, southwest of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, had been a crossroad for early pioneers. In 1816 a treaty was made with the Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomi tribes which ceded a corridor of land located between a point north of the Chicago River and the mouth of the Calumet River to the settlers. The southern boundary, one of two Indian Treaty Boundary Lines, was surveyed along a line from the Kankakee River to Lake Michigan. The line still appears on government maps and now includes a short portion of Interstate 57 near the US 6 interchange northwest of Markham.

The village of Markham was incorporated in 1925 with a population under 300. The village was named for Charles H. Markham, president of the Illinois Central Railroad 1911–1918, 1919–1926. In the mid-1930s, the Croissant Park subdivision was built and increased the population from 349 to 1,388. After World War II, Markham&#x27;s population doubled to 2,753 residents by 1950. The village developed into a bedroom community as residents sought homes, not industry. An airport developed at 165th Street and Kedzie Avenue was the nearest field outside of Chicago. The airport site was located near what is now the Cook County Sixth Circuit Courthouse. On August 24, 1967, Markham was incorporated as a city.

=== The Lone Pine Tree ===
In 1860, a German immigrant named Lawrence Roesner made his way to the southern boundary and settled on land located in the northwest corner of Markham. He brought with him six seedlings from the Black Forest of Germany and planted them along the Indian Boundary Line. This &quot;Lone Pine Tree&quot; was adopted as the official city symbol in 1985. The lone survivor of six pine trees brought from the Black Forest in 1860 died in 1986. The Markham City Council appropriated money to get a replacement tree from the Black Forest, which the Markham Garden Club planted that year.

<text>Matteson () is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 19,073 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of Chicago. 

Matteson is located in Chicago&#x27;s Southland area. The village is home to multiple warehouse facilities, a large commercial corridor, and housed the now-demolished Lincoln Mall. There are currently plans to redevelop the mall property into a mixed-use complex. The village is served by two stations on the Metra Electric District&#x27;s main line; Matteson station and 211th Street station.

==History==
The area encompassed by modern Matteson was settled in the late 1800s, primarily by people of German descent. Platted in 1855, Matteson had nearly 500 residents when it incorporated as a village in 1889. The village&#x27;s namesake is Joel Aldrich Matteson, who served as Illinois&#x27; tenth governor from 1853 to 1857. The 20th century saw improvements in plumbing, the electrification of the Illinois Central Railroad, and the construction of today&#x27;s school district, resulting in significant population growth to more than 3,000 residents by the end of the 1960s. By 2000, Matteson was home to Lincoln Mall (opened 1973) and annexed 195 acres of land for the village. Today, Matteson is home to nearly 20,000 residents, hundreds of businesses, and the close proximity of two major hospitals.

By 1995, African-Americans made up a significant portion of Matteson&#x27;s residential population. The village launched a program to encourage potential homeowners identifying as European-American to move to the village. Instead by 2011 the community had attracted many well-to-do African-Americans, many of whom had been previously based in Chicago. The village simultaneously recorded increases in the average household incomes in several census tracts. Between 2000-2010, Matteson&#x27;s African-American population increased by roughly 85% while its European-American population declined by about 1,200.

<text>Maywood is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, in the Chicago metropolitan area. It was founded on April 6, 1869, and organized October 22, 1881. The population was 23,512 at the 2020 census.

==History==
There was limited European-American settlement in the Maywood area before a railroad was built after the American Civil War, which stimulated the rise of Chicago. At least one house in what became Maywood is known to have been used as a station on the Underground Railroad, to aid refugee African-American slaves in escaping to freedom in the North. Some settled in the free state of Illinois; others went on to Canada, which had abolished slavery, seeking further distance from slavecatchers. The site of the former house has been nationally commemorated. The plaque is located at today&#x27;s Lake Street and the Des Plaines River bridge.

This early West Side suburb of Chicago was developed along the oldest railway line that led away from the city. It attracted real estate developers because of its open grass prairie and scattered groves of ancient trees.

In 1868, Vermont businessmen established the Maywood Company. In 1870 it organized the platting of streets, and began construction on the north side of the Chicago Great Western railroad tracks. The company planted 20,000 eight-year-old, nursery-grown trees to enhance the future town. By 2010, the last of these 148-year-old trees had succumbed to the emerald ash borer.

The oldest documented ash tree in northeast Illinois is in Maywood and is dated at 250 years old. It is being protected from the borers with horticultural treatment. The danger is expected to pass locally by year 2020, as it already has in Canton, Michigan, where borers were first seen. The ash is nicknamed &quot;The Great Dane&quot;, after Jens Jensen, founder of the Midwest&#x27;s prairie ecology movement a century ago. The tree is located within old growth woods just behind Proviso East high school.

With settlement underway, the village was founded on October 22, 1881, by Colonel William T. Nichols. He named it after his late daughter, May, and the groves.

Many century-old homes survive here in relatively unaltered condition. Maywood boasts 17 homes and properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

At one time two airports operated in Maywood. Loyola University Medical Center was developed on the site of one former airport, at the southwest corner of First Avenue and Roosevelt Road. It was the airfield used by Charles Lindbergh during his days as an airmail pilot.

Checkerboard Field was located at the southeastern corner of that intersection and was a private field. The land has been converted to a forest preserve meadow. There was some apparent consolidation of the fields in later years. Later, an automobile board racetrack was located here, along with a viewing grandstand. Barney Oldfield raced on the track. The Hines Veterans Hospital constructed one of its buildings on the foundation of the former grandstand.

===Maywood in World War II===

Maywood was established as the base for the 33rd Tank Company, Illinois National Guard. The Armory was located on Madison Street, two blocks east of First Avenue. It was organized on May 3, 1929, with the purpose of training men for combat. On November 25, 1940, 122 men of the 33rd Tank Company were inducted into active service to become Company B of the famous 192nd Tank Battalion, which fought in the Philippine islands. Many of these American soldiers were taken prisoner by the Japanese and died in April 1942 on the Bataan Death March. Of the 122 men of Company B, only 41 survived the war to return to Maywood. Their sacrifice has been honored with an annual Bataan Day Parade.

Given such losses, Ian Smith, who headed the history department at Proviso East High School, said that &quot;World War II hit the town of Maywood really hard.&quot;

<text>Melrose Park is a village in Leyden and Proviso Townships, Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is a suburb of Chicago. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 24,796. 

The suburb was the home of Kiddieland Amusement Park from 1929 until 2010 (it closed in September 2009 before it was demolished in 2010 and the sign of Kiddieland was relocated to the Melrose Park Public Library; a Costco warehouse store now stands in its place), the Shrine of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, Stern Pinball, Inc., the Melrose Park Taste, and the now-defunct Maywood Park horse racing track.

There is a Metra railroad station in Melrose Park with daily service to Chicago. Melrose Park is home to Gottlieb Memorial Hospital.

== History ==
According to the Encyclopedia of Chicago, in 1882 residents of a then-unincorporated portion of Proviso Township voted to establish their own municipality—called simply &quot;Melrose&quot; until 11 years later, in 1893, when the &quot;Park&quot; was added and population in the area began to steadily increase. The first Italian-Americans arrived in 1888.

On March 28, 1920, the F4 Palm Sunday tornado cut a path over through the village and killed ten people. It destroyed the Sacred Heart Church and attached convent.

At the turn of the 20th century, the population surge plateaued and industry began to stagnate; it was only after World War I that the local economy was able to recover, the result of some manufacturing companies setting up shop in the village. New industry, coupled with Melrose Park&#x27;s prime geographic location next to the Proviso freight yards, led to a steady increase in the number of area jobs. This continued after World War II, with still more companies moving to Melrose Park. Zenith Electronics, Alberto-Culver, Jewel, and International Harvester (now Navistar) are some examples. Many of these companies are still located in Melrose Park and the local industry remains stable, but Alberto-Culver no longer exists, Zenith continues to exist as a brand only today, and Navistar’s plant facility closed in 2021 and was eventually demolished.

During the late 1990s, to attract more commerce, the village underwent major cosmetic improvements, beginning with the redesigning of all village street signs. The wooded area on both sides of Silver Creek, between Broadway and 17th Avenue along North Avenue, was almost completely excavated, the grass replaced, and wood chips were added along the bases of the remaining trees. Many busy streets were repaved and the athletic field next to the village hall was completely redone. This has helped not only to attract new businesses but also many first-time home buyers.

The athletic field next to the village hall is named after the late Ralph &quot;Babe&quot; Serpico, father of the current mayor, Ronald M. Serpico.

==Economy==
Navistar International had a factory and an engine group office in Melrose Park which closed in 2021. This building was formerly a Buick plant that made aircraft engines for WWII. Melrose Park Immediate Care is a medical and dental clinic located in downtown Melrose Park. Melrose Park is also home to WellNow Urgent Care and West Lake Urgent Care.

In March 2021 Lake Book Manufacturing, a company of nearly 300 employees specializing in book printing, was acquired by Grafica Veneta.

The Merrionette Park Police Department provides police protection within the village. The department was established in 1947, hiring its first full time police officers in 2023.

==Recreation==
Merrionette Park is home to the Merrionette Park baseball fields, where children of all ages play every summer. Merrionette Park Baseball is a volunteer organization. There is also a small park in the village once named for long time village resident Harry J. Rogowski but was renamed Patriot Park in 2022. 

==Transportation==
CTA provides bus service on Route 52A connecting Merrionette Park to destinations across the Southland.

<text>Midlothian () is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. It is a southwestern suburb of Chicago. As of the 2020 census the population was 14,325.

==History==

Like many southwest suburbs of Chicago in the 1800s and early 1900s, the area now known as the Village of Midlothian consisted of a few area farmers being surrounded by large and small endeavors alike as the industrial age began its exponential expansion process in the Bremen Township in Cook County, Illinois community. By 1854, the sprawling landscape comprising the township of Bremen had a trail of railroad track carrying both passengers and commodities between Chicago and Joliet on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. It had been a somewhat brutal battle for the Illinois Central Railroad over the decades, with Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln working hard to establish the presence of the Illinois Central Railroad on a State level until Douglas moved to the federal level. By 1850, Douglas was busy working on federally mandated development of transportation plans into law at a federal level for the benefit of the Illinois Central Railroad.

Explosions were not uncommon in gunpowder factories and storage facilities and 12 years later in 1906, an explosion leveled the DuPont facility. Although there is currently no clear evidence as to the precise location of the facility, apparently the shock-waves from the explosion traveled a decent enough distance in which the windows of the Midlothian Country Club were shattered, according to a report on November 8, 1906, in the Charlotte News. It also appears the Associated Press distributed the geographical location of the facility to be situated in Tinley Park, however a 1900 Homesteader&#x27;s Map shows the DuPont property to be closer to what would become Oak Forest in 1947 rather than Tinley Park. Eventually the northern portion of the DuPont Farm and Ammunition Storage property was eventually annexed by the Village of Midlothian, while the rest of the DuPont property was acquired by Cook County, Illinois and developed into what is now the Midlothian Meadows Forest Preserve (part of the Cook County Forest Preserve system)

Despite land speculation and sporadic development growing from the direction of what would become the Village of Robbins in 1917, dirt roads continued to act as an uncontrollable barrier to a variety of economic activities, such as delivering goods and services. While rain of any slight measure was a nuisance, it didn&#x27;t take much to render the roadways virtually unusable by the wagons being pulled by horses. The extremely and extraordinarily wealthy members of the Midlothian Country Club found such a method of transportation enough of an inconvenience, a group of individuals decided to petition the State of Illinois for a charter to form the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad and to lay tracks from Blue Island straight to the front lawn of the country club.

The initial charter approved a separate track to begin in Blue Island, Illinois and ending on the Midlothian Country Club grounds. However, the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad negotiated with the Chicago-Rock Island Railroad to build either the longest spur track or the Shortest Railroad in the World, as it became known as. Rather than laying new rails all the way from Blue Island, they would use Rexford Crossing as a turn around point and then lay track a short distance away to the country club. As part of the arrangement, a station was erected in place of what constituted Rexford Crossing and the station was renamed to &quot;Midlothian.&quot; Although it is unclear who exactly paid for the construction, ownership of the building was eventually acquired by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific while the stockholders of the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad retained ownership of the rails and all of the rights and responsibilities associated with such ownership. All rail cars and engines were purchased by the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad and not the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. Although the club would not be annexed to Midlothian for a few decades, the Midlothian train station was located within the vicinity of the original boundaries for the village and eventually considered a part of the downtown area of Midlothian, which meant some of the tracks were to be governed by the municipal codes of the village. Bremen Township and Cook County may have had property-related laws the company was supposed to adhere to, but even more telling is the absence of the company in a number of Railway and Warehouse Commission annual reports. By 1927, the Village of Midlothian was incorporated and at the end of the summer season in 1928, the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad tracks were removed, thereby ending any potential track maintenance issues or conflicts with the village.

By the turn of the century, the Village of Midlothian was still primarily a farming and forested area, despite activities conducted by the Midlothian Country Club creating a short layover for passenger traffic to and from the Midlothian train station. This stalling of development was partially driven by the housing speculation crash after the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian&#x27;s Fair, especially the property that would eventually become the Village of Robbins in 1917. In addition, a large swath of the southwest suburbs of Chicago can quickly become quite soggy from a variety of sources. Contemplating the odds of a flood or other natural disaster is a common contemplation when considering home ownership. The rolling hills surrounding Midlothian and the creeks running through its fabric have always presented a natural path downward for water to travel without much width to the creeks to contain a heavy and steady rainfall. Therefore, until paved roads shifted from being a luxury to that of a necessity, families with names such as Woerheide, Largent, William Schwartz, Frank Coole, Benjamin Coole and William J. Shedd all had to contend with commerce-related issues all centering on roads that could be rendered virtually useless in a matter of minutes and potentially last for days. Even the construction of the train station has not seemed to attract significant passenger traffic over the decades, with little commerce being conducted in Midlothian other than farming, harvesting limestone and gunpowder manufacturing. The first stationmaster was a woman and by 1912, R.K. Cummings was appointed first regular agent of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. In that same year, Cummings and two monthly ticket holders lived in the vicinity.

The Midlothian Fire Department was organized in 1924, possibly in preparation for the first attempt at incorporating the village. However, for unknown reasons, the proposition was defeated and it wasn&#x27;t until three years later in 1927 the residents would vote their approval of establishing the Village of Midlothian. The Village of Midlothian was formally incorporated March 17, 1927. Although there are no clear records on why the name was chosen, there is common conclusion they adopted the name of the train station with perhaps hopes of garnering a sense of similar prestige for the village as was being generated by the golf club at the time, if not also marketing abilities. The following month, John H. Hamilton was elected as the village&#x27;s first president and by the end of summer 1928, all of the rails belonging to the Midlothian - Blue Island Railroad were removed, leaving Midlothian with one train line. By 1929, Midlothian had its first newspaper, The Messenger owned by the Andrews brothers. Kevin McCann was the first Editor In chief of the publication located above the old Largent store on 147th and Kildare, who later went on to serve as aide-de-camp to General Dwight Eisenhower during World War II as well as working with the General on his two books.

In the 1930s and &#x27;40s, homes continued to be built for people moving to and settling down in Midlothian. The Kreis Brothers opened the Ford Garage (where the village&#x27;s fire engine was kept) and Chuck Cavallini began selling ice cream from his corner &quot;Sweet Shop&quot;. In 1949, a Village Hall was constructed at the intersection of 148th and Pulaski, where village employees and officials still work out of as of 2014. As part of the architecture, divisions of the Village such as the police and fire departments are attached to the main building. Across the parking lot along Waverly Avenue is the public works offices and garage while the VFW Hall is across from the entrance to the police department on Pulaski.

<doc id="111016" wikidata="Q1641893" url="?curid=111016" title="Morton Grove, Illinois">
<text>Morton Grove is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 25,297. It is part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

The village is named after former United States Vice President Levi Parsons Morton, who helped finance the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad (later the Milwaukee Road), which roughly tracked the North Branch of the Chicago River in the area and established a stop at the old Miller&#x27;s Mill. Miller&#x27;s Mill Road, now Lincoln Avenue, connected the former riverside sawmill to the township&#x27;s central settlement (Niles Center, now Skokie). The railroad stop facilitated trade and development; the upstart neighborhood grew enough to incorporate in December 1895.

==History==
A handful of farmers from England settled in 1830-1832, despite there being no roads from Chicago, only Native American trails, as the defeat of the Black Hawk War and the 1833 Treaty of Chicago led Native Americans to leave the areas. Farmers from Germany and Luxembourg started arriving by the end of the decade, clearing the land by cutting the walnut, oak, hickory, elm and maple trees. Logs were initially hauled to a sawmill at Dutchman&#x27;s Point (later Niles, Illinois) at the corner of what became Milwaukee, Waukegan and Touhy Avenues, and stumps burned for charcoal that could then be hauled to heat homes in expanding Chicago. Immigrant John Miller erected a water-powered sawmill near where the Chicago River met the future Dempster Street shortly after 1841. This simplified homebuilding in the area, as well as facilitated further lumber sales. A road (first known as Miller&#x27;s Mill Road and after 1915 as Lincoln Avenue) allowed wood from the sawmill (and produce from nearby farms) to be hauled to the largest settlement in the surrounding Niles Township (initially known as Niles Center and now Skokie) or even further, into Chicago. Around 1850, the &quot;Northwestern&quot; road to/from Chicago (now known as Milwaukee Avenue) was improved (partly using lumber from Miller&#x27;s sawmill) to become a single lane plank (toll) road. That reduced a four-day journey into Chicago to about a half day, and also helped sales of produce and farm products from the rich bottomland. Lumber was also hauled to Jefferson Park to fuel locomotives after the first railroads were built in the area. In 1858, Henry Harms built a toll road from the intersection of Ashland and Lincoln Avenues in Chicago to Skokie, where it met Miller&#x27;s Mill Road. Harms&#x27; Road was later extended through Glenview.

In 1872, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad bought Miller&#x27;s Mill and laid track (which became two lines in 1892). They also dug gravel for railroad and road use nearby, creating a quarry at what later became Austin Park. The stop (later station) at what had been Miller&#x27;s Mill was named Morton Grove to honor one of the railroad&#x27;s New York financiers, Levi Parsons Morton. The Morton Grove settlement began growing from about 100 persons, and by 1874 had grown enough to have its first postmaster, Civil War veteran Medard Lochner. Rural mail service started 21 years later, although a blacksmith shop was opened at the settlement by 1884, and a trading post and saloon had operated since 1847. The first subdivision (177 lots) was platted by real estate developers George Fernald and Fred Bingham in 1891, and a convalescent home for German-American aged was built in 1894. The village formally incorporated on December 24, 1895, just eight days before Morton became the Governor of New York. Morton Grove&#x27;s first mayor, George Harrer, was of German descent (and became the namesake of the village&#x27;s largest park), and his brother became Skokie&#x27;s mayor.

===20th century growth===
The first greenhouses were built in Morton Grove in 1885 (the railroad transported 135,000 tons of coal annually to heat them in cold weather), and the Poehlman Brothers&#x27; floral business grew into one of the world’s largest floral firms, receiving international recognition when one of its roses won first place at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair. The orchid department alone included eight greenhouses, and the nearby railroad station received flowers from the Philippines and South America to service customers with more exotic tastes. By 1915 the Poehlman Brothers&#x27; payroll included 400 to 500 people. However, the business went bankrupt in the Great Depression. Baxter Laboratories bought much of the former Poehlman land, and became a major employer in the following decades. The of land surrounding Greenhouse C was purchased by the Morton Grove Days Committee and ultimately became Harrer Park. Lochner&#x27;s and the wholesale firm Platz Flowers (retail business name &quot;Jamaican Gardens&quot;) continue to operate in the village. August Poehlman long served as one of Morton Grove&#x27;s six trustees (and as its second mayor), and his brother Adolph was the village attorney.

The Poehlmans also helped found Jerusalem Evangelical Lutheran Church and its school in 1897.

In 1897, close to the turn of the 20th century, Morton Grove built a public school. A one-room &quot;little red schoolhouse&quot; had existed at Waukegan in Beckwith roads from 1860 until finally torn down in 1990, and the Jerusalem Lutheran pastor also operated a school. The city gained a telephone exchange in 1900, and then established a volunteer fire department in 1904. That year, considerable land in the village became forest preserve property, including the banks of the North Branch of the Chicago River (now part of the Ralph Frese Trail) and a section known as the Skokie marshes.

In 1907, gas lines were installed. In 1911, North Shore Electric Light Company installed 36 street lights and the village installed a cement sidewalk along Miller&#x27;s Road. The next year, water and sewer lines were completed, and the first sewerage treatment plant began operations in 1914, leading to the new Metropolitan Sanitary District Treatment Plant at Oakton Street and McCormick Road in Skokie. Morton Grove then outlawed outhouses in 1920. Meanwhile, pickle and sauerkraut plants also operated in the village from 1900 until 1915, when a pickle blight caused them to close. Morton Grove&#x27;s first bank was constructed in 1912 and a theater began showing silent movies beginning in 1916.

Morton Grove continued to grow and prosper as it welcomed home those who fought in World War I, and new immigrants. Village population exceeded 1000 in the 1920 census. St. Martha Catholic Church was founded in 1919 as parishioners rented what had been a tavern before Prohibition, then erected their own church in 1923. Catholics had previously traveled to St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Niles Center or St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Grosse Point, which became Wilmette.

From 1919 to 1932, some farmland was transformed into a small airfield north of Dempster St., and tourist flights and wing-walking continued. One of the owners, Fred Sonne, helped form the Chicago Aerial Survey Company (and was honored for his aerial photography in World War II). Hermine Sonne, who married his partner, Dick Boettcher, became the first woman in the village to fly.

As the &quot;Jazz Age&quot; roared on, Morton Grove also became known for its night clubs and speakeasies, especially the Dells club (originally the Huscher family residence at Austin and Dempster streets, which burned down in 1934), the Lincoln Tavern (now the American Legion hall, it burned down in 1918 and was rebuilt across the street, and became a gambling casino in the 1930s with over 400 slot machines, plus dice tables, roulette, blackjack, etc.), the Light House (later called the Coconut Grove) and the Bit and Bridle, among others. The clubs offered live music and entertainment, dancing, fine food, and ambiance (and discreetly served liquor during Prohibition). Since Evanston to the east was dry (and headquarters of the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union) and Skokie in between often hosted temperance lectures, Morton Grove&#x27;s speakeasies drew visitors in limousines and cars from across the North Shore. The Morton Grove Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry was founded in 1926; the village&#x27;s resident population reached 1,980 in 1930.

The Great Depression struck the village, then World War II forced it to meet further challenges. Morton Grove gained a Bell &amp; Gossett plant in 1941, which as part of W.W. Grainger Industrial Supply remained a major employer for decades.

After World War II, a new era of growth and prosperity began as Morton Grove entered the “Baby Boom” era. The population of Morton Grove grew from 2,010 in 1940 to 3,926 by 1950, then soared to 20,533 in 1960. People seeking a better life ventured into the suburbs from Chicago and found Morton Grove, especially after the Edens Expressway opened and cut commuting time into Chicago. In addition to building new schools, Morton Grove gained a Community Church (affiliated with the Presbyterian denomination; chartered in 1951), as well as St. Luke&#x27;s United Church of Christ (in 1956), the Northwest Suburban Jewish Congregation (in 1957) and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses temple (in 1962). Also, one current resident now maintains a repository for memorials from defunct synagogues in northwest Chicago and surrounding communities. However, the railroad station was downsized in 1974, as freight traffic had declined and it was mostly used for commuters into Chicago.

The community&#x27;s demographic mix continued to change from its predominantly Germanic founding. Morton Grove gained many Filipino immigrants, as well as many from Syria, India and Pakistan, so that by 2010 it had among the largest Asian communities on the North Shore. The northwest Chicago Muslim Community Center (founded in 1969) established a branch in Morton Grove and a school in Skokie. In 2000, Morton Grove had 22,451 residents (74 percent white, 22 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic and 0.6 percent black). The village&#x27;s population reached 23,270 by the 2010 Census (66 percent white, 28 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 1.2 percent black and 2.7 percent identified themselves as belonging to two or more races).

===Handgun ban===
In 1981, Morton Grove became the first town in America to prohibit the possession of handguns. Victor Quilici, a local lawyer, sued the city (Quilici v. Morton Grove). The federal district court as well as the Appellate Court ruled the Morton Grove ordinance to be constitutional, thus upholding the gun ban. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, letting the lower court decision stand. The ban stood as village code 6-2-3. However, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 2008 opinion in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, it appeared likely that the village would drop the ban. On July 28, 2008, the city dropped its prohibition on handguns. The village board voted 5–1 in favor of removing the ban.

<text>Niles is a village in Cook County, Illinois, United States, located in the townships of Maine and Niles, directly neighboring Chicago&#x27;s far northwest border. Per the 2020 census, the population was 30,912. The current mayor of Niles is George Alpogianis.

==History==
Joseph Curtis settled in what became Niles in 1827, and John Dewes followed in 1831. The settlement was originally called &quot;Dutchman&#x27;s Point&quot;, referring to German immigrants who followed, including John Plank of Hesse-Darmstadt (who sold whiskey to passing travelers and remaining Native Americans) and the Ebinger brothers of Stuttgart, as well as John Schadiger, Julius Perren, John-Jackson Ruland (d. 1880) and Revolutionary war soldier John Ketchum.

Many people of Native American ancestry lived in the area; Chief Blackhawk reportedly often smoked a peace pipe with Christian Ebinger. Article 4 of the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien, signed on July 29, 1829, between the United States government and several chiefs of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatamie left particular tracts of land to individuals of mixed-Native American ancestry. Among them were Billy Caldwell, Victoria Pothier, and Jane Miranda. Land titled to these individuals eventually established part of the border of Niles. During the 1832 Black Hawk War, one band of Native Americans may have reached Billy Caldwell&#x27;s property as part of an attempt to reclaim land lost to the United States. Hostilities ended in 1833, and most Native Americans immediately left, moving west of the Mississippi River

===Niles and Niles Township founding===

The Ebingers settled near Milwaukee and Touhy Avenues in the early 1830s. John Ebinger had been the head gardener for King William in Württemberg, Germany, but moved to the United States (initially Ann Arbor, Michigan) when he was 62. His eldest son Frederick had traveled to Chicago and worked on the pier or harbor by 1832, and was soon joined by his brother John Jr. and their wives, as well as John Plank. John Ebinger and his youngest son Christian (at 21 newly married to orphaned Barbara Reuhle of Stuttgart in 1834; both of whom walked the route to enable their elders to ride) packed and traveled to join them, but found Chicago too swampy to farm. After their horse stepped on a rattlesnake and died shortly after crossing the North Branch of the Chicago River on an Indian trail leading towards Milwaukee, the Ebingers built a cabin at Milwaukee and Harlem Avenues, and laid claim to of land. The older Ebinger brothers (one of whom married the sister of Fort Dearborn&#x27;s commanders&#x27; wife) soon joined them, as did the Planks. John Plank soon sold his house to Mr. Phillips, who opened a store and became the area&#x27;s first postmaster. Christian Ebinger or his son of the same name (born 1835 and the first white child born in the area, d. 1879), became the first minister to be ordained in their German Evangelical Association, and served as the Village Collector, Township Assessor and Overseer of the Poor (from 1852 to 1865) and Highway Commissioner, as well as left seven surviving children.

There is no clear indication of the origin of the name &quot;Niles.&quot; A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article from 1929 opined that the name referred to the &quot;Niles Weekly Register&quot;, a popular newspaper published in the 1820s and 1830s by fervently nationalist (and abolitionist) Quaker Hezekiah Niles out of Baltimore, Maryland. His son William Ogden Niles published the newspaper from Washington, D.C. until it ceased publication in 1849; the Odgen family had longstanding connections with the Chicago area. Another belief is that the name &quot;Niles&quot; was named after Niles Construction which did much of the building early during the city&#x27;s founding. Alternatively, soldiers from Niles, Michigan reinforced Fort Dearborn during the Black Hawk War, and afterward may have sent word back about the rich farmland to the north. Three early families of settlers came from Niles, Michigan with troops or had relatives at Fort Dearborn. An early history of Cook County, Illinois reported that every two weeks a half-breed Indian traveled to Niles, Michigan for mail. By 1834 a twice-weekly stage connected Chicago and Niles. The North Branch Hotel was built in 1837 and the White House tavern in 1847. By 1839, a traveling German preacher visited Dutchman&#x27;s Point every two or three weeks.

Niles Township was organized in a meeting at the North Branch Hotel on April 2, 1850, a year after John Odell donated land at Milwaukee and Harlem Avenues to build a second school (constructed by John Ketchem, who was active in the Methodist church) and four years after Joseph Curtis returned to England. Blacksmith Benjamin Lupton had returned to England to marry, then returned with his bride to Dutchman&#x27;s Point in 1840, and remained the settlement&#x27;s blacksmith for the next two decades. Residents later said the township name was chosen before the public meeting. The following year, the township adopted an ordinance to regulate livestock running amok. By 1858, Henry Harms had a store on Harms Avenue in Niles Center, the township&#x27;s other population center, which was later renamed Skokie. By 1890, that area had six saloons, two blacksmith shops and three churches.

===Post–World War II growth===
Along with neighboring Skokie and several other suburbs, Niles is partly within Niles Township, from which it draws its name. The other part of Niles is in Maine Township. The village of Niles was formally incorporated by the state of Illinois on August 24, 1899. The village had a population of 500 people at that time.
Niles, like neighboring communities Skokie, Park Ridge and Glenview, grew significantly after veterans of World War II and the Korean War returned home to the Chicago area and established families in the streetcar suburbs. In 1950, Niles had only 3,500 people, but as former farms and nurseries redeveloped into housing, the population tripled in the next five years, then nearly doubled, reaching 18,863 people in 1962. Unlike Park Ridge, Skokie and Glenview, Niles did not have its own commuter rail stop. Residents who did not use their own automobiles to reach their jobs could connect by bus to the Chicago Transit Authority stops at Jefferson Park or the Skokie Swift, or with the Chicago and Northwestern Commuter rail line (incorporated into Metra) in Park Ridge or Glenview or at intervening stops such as Norwood Park and Edison Park (once part of Niles Township until annexed by Chicago). Niles became the first community in Illinois, and one of the first in the United States to establish free ambulance service, in 1946. Several decades later, it instituted a free bus service to connect residents with local shops, government offices and transit options (shown).

In 1964, under then-new mayor Nicholas B. Blase, Niles was named an &quot;All America City&quot;. Niles grew by selectively annexing nearby unincorporated areas of Cook County, the most important for tax revenue purposes being the area that became the Golf Mill Shopping Center. Its population peaked in 1970 at 31,432 people. Blase, the son of Greek immigrants raised in Chicago&#x27;s Bridgeport neighborhood and a law and business graduate of University of Notre Dame, had moved to Niles in 1959 and initially worked as a claims adjuster for Allstate Insurance Company. He would become Niles&#x27; longest-serving mayor, but resigned in a scandal in 2008 which led to his federal criminal conviction for steering insurance business to cronies. Ironically, Blase was first elected in 1961, when he upset Frank Stankowicz, a former motorcycle cop who had won election first as village clerk, then had won election and re-election as mayor for two decades before passing the gavel to the young upstart. Blase&#x27;s &quot;New Era Party&quot; ran a door-to-door campaign against corruption (police turning a blind eye to local gambling houses, and prostitution flourishing near the Chicago border) and builder favoritism. During his nearly five decades as mayor, Blase established a free bus service, a new village hall, a senior and fitness center, and a new police station, as well as jobs for nearly 500 municipal employees. Blase resigned in 2008 amid federal charges that he participated in an insurance kickback scheme. Several months later he pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion, and admitted that he had pressured local businesses to buy insurance from a friend&#x27;s agency in return for a share of the commissions, receiving more than $420,000 over a period of more than 30 years. In 2010 Blase, then 81 years old, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. After serving his term – first in federal prison, then in a halfway house, and then in home confinement – he returned to live in Niles. In 2011, his name was removed from the plaza outside the village hall and post office. Blase died in 2019.

<text>Norridge is a village in Leyden Township, Cook County, Illinois, United States. The population was 15,251 at the 2020 census.

Norridge began as an subdivision that ran from Ozanam Avenue in the west to Olcott Avenue in the east and from Irving Park Road in the south to Montrose Avenue in the north.

== Government ==
North Riverside is divided between three congressional districts. The area east of the Des Plaines River is in Illinois&#x27;s 3rd congressional district; the area west of 1st Avenue is in the 7th district; the area between 1st Avenue and the river, consisting almost entirely of the western half of the Riverside Golf Club, is in the 4th district.

The Village of North Riverside is governed by a Village President (also referred to a Mayor), Village Clerk, and six Trustees who are all elected to four year terms. The terms are staggered, with elections being held in odd number years. The Mayor and Board of Trustees exercise policy-making and legislative powers of the Village, including adopting ordinances and resolutions, approving the Village’s annual appropriation and operating budget and enacting tax levies. In addition, the Village Board receives findings and recommendations from a number of appointed citizen advisory committees.
An Illinois state appeals court ruled in 2016 that the village must pay into the fire and police pensions. The village had argued that it was unable to contribute to the pension plans because of economic hardship during the Great Recession, which lowered tax revenues. The state Department of Insurance determined that the village had not contributed to its police and firefighter pension funds for several years prior to 2013. The state ordered the village to pay into the pensions, and instead the village filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court in 2014. The judge ruled against the village, and the village appealed.

== Notable events ==
=== Fire Department privatization ===
In a letter dated June 19, 2014, to the residents of North Riverside, Mayor Hermanek pitched the idea of contracting the fire department positions to a private contact company, Paramedic Services of Illinois, Inc.. The Village currently contracts with the company to provide paramedic services, but the plan was to contract the fire fighter positions as well. The plan has drawn significant opposition from the Fire Fighters Union Local 2714, as well as village residents, and department supporters.

At the July 24 Special Meeting of the Village Board to adopt the annual appropriation, there was no vote on the privatization proposal, but the Appropriation Ordinance passed by a vote of 4 to 1. The Fiscal Year 2014-2015 (which began May 1, 2014) budget includes slashed salaries for the fire fighters. &quot;The negotiations are not going to go on forever,&quot; said Hermanek. &quot;This will be done by the end of the summer.&quot;

On September 12, 2014, in a press release from the Village, Mayor Hugh Hermanek stated that he has instructed Village attorney&#x27;s to file suit with the Cook County Courts, for the right to terminate the Firefighter&#x27;s Contact, which expired April 30, 2014. The press release in part reads:

<text>Northbrook is a suburb of Chicago, located at the northern edge of Cook County, Illinois, United States, on the border of Lake County. It is part of a collection of upscale residential communities north of Chicago and belongs to Northfield Township and the greater North Shore. Per the 2020 census, the population was 35,222.

When incorporated in 1901, the village was known as Shermerville in honor of Frederick Schermer, who donated the land for its first train station. The village changed its name to Northbrook in 1923 as an effort to improve its public image. The name was chosen because the West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River runs through the village.

Glenbrook North High School, founded in 1952 as Glenbrook High School, is located in Northbrook. The village is also home to the Northbrook Park District, the Northbrook Court shopping mall, the Ed Rudolph Velodrome, the Chicago Curling Club, and the Northbrook Public Library.

==History==
Members of the Potawatomi tribe were the earliest recorded residents of the Northbrook area. After signing the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, the Potawatomi ceded their Illinois lands and moved to a place near Council Bluffs, Iowa. Afterward, Joel Sterling Sherman moved from Connecticut with his family and bought of land in the northwest quarter of Section 10 for $1.25 per acre; Northbrook&#x27;s downtown is located on this site. A German immigrant named Frederick Schermer donated a portion of the land he bought from Sherman to be used for the town&#x27;s first railroad station, which was named after him. By the 1870s, Shermerville (which also took its name from Shermer) was a farming community. In 1901 the community was incorporated as the Village of Shermerville after a close referendum for incorporation. At the time of incorporation, it had 311 residents and 60 houses. In these early years, Shermerville became notorious for rowdy gatherings at its five saloons; by 1921, therefore, residents believed that the name &quot;Shermerville&quot; had a negative reputation and sought to change it. A renaming contest was held, and the name &quot;Northbrook&quot; was submitted by the US postmaster (and then President of the National Rural Letter Carriers&#x27; Association) Edward Landwehr. Landwehr was the son of Herman and Anna Helene Landwehr, both German immigrants and early settlers in the community and for whose family Landwehr Road in Northbrook is named. In 1923, &quot;Northbrook&quot;, the winning name, was adopted. At the time, Northbrook had 500 residents. Later on, after the end of World War II, Northbrook&#x27;s population began to rapidly increase. In 1997, President Bill Clinton visited Northbrook to congratulate the 8th-grade students of Northfield Township (which is mainly Northbrook) for getting the highest score on a world science test, and for getting the second-highest score on a world math test.
Between 1950 and 1980, the town&#x27;s population rose from 3,319 to 30,735. Northbrook was the first community not bordering Lake Michigan to filter Lake Michigan water for public use. Owing to the suburbanization of the community, the last working farm in Northbrook, the Wayside Farm, was sold and closed in 1987.

A primary advocate for a library in Northbrook after World War II was Carolyn A. Landwehr, daughter-in-law of Edward Landwehr who had originally suggested the name &quot;Northbrook&quot; for the community. The Northbrook Public Library first opened on June 30, 1952, in space located in the village hall; the first dedicated library building was dedicated in 1954. The northern portion of the current library opened in 1969, and bonds of 1975 and 1997 expanded the current library.

===Movies and filming===
Director John Hughes, a native of Northbrook, used the fictional town of &quot;Shermer&quot; as a setting for several of his films. David Kamp of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said &quot;Hughes&#x27;s Shermer was partly Northbrook and partly a composite of all the North Shore&#x27;s towns and neighborhoods—and, by extension, all the different milieus that existed in American suburbia&quot; and that Shermer &quot;was at once an Everytown for every teen and an explicit homage to Hughes&#x27;s home turf, the North Shore suburbs above Chicago&quot;. Hughes and his family moved to Northbrook in 1962, and Hughes attended Glenbrook North High School.

Some exterior shots of Glenbrook North High School were used in the films &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Northbrook is notable for being home to the &quot;Save Ferris&quot; water tower featured in the movie, which inspired the name of the synonymous band.
