<text>Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In (often simply referred to as Laugh-In) is an American sketch comedy television program that ran for six seasons from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973, on the NBC television network. The show, hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). It quickly became the most popular television show in the United States.

The title of the show was a play on the 1960s Hippie culture &quot;love-ins&quot; or the Counterculture &quot;be-ins&quot;, terms derived from the &quot;sit-ins&quot; common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. In the pilot episode, Dan Rowan explained the show&#x27;s approach: &quot;Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to television&#x27;s first Laugh-In. Now for the past few years, we have all been hearing an awful lot about the various &#x27;ins&#x27;. There have been be-ins, love-ins, and sleep-ins. This is a laugh-in and a laugh-in is a frame of mind. For the next hour, we would just like you to sit back and laugh and forget about the other ins.&quot;

&quot;Laugh-In&quot; had its roots in the humor of vaudeville and burlesque, but its most direct influences were Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s comedies (such as the free-form Broadway revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;), the innovative television works of Ernie Kovacs (George Schlatter&#x27;s wife, Jolene Brand appeared in Kovacs&#x27; shows), and the topical TV satire &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. The show was characterized by a rapid-fire series of gags and sketches, many of which were politically charged or contained sexual innuendo. The co-hosts continued the exasperated &quot;straight man&quot; (Rowan) and &quot;dumb guy&quot; (Martin) double act that they had established as nightclub comics.

The show featured Gary Owens as the on-screen radio continuity announcer, and an ensemble cast. Ruth Buzzi was part of the ensemble throughout the show&#x27;s six-year run, while others appeared in at least three seasons. This includes
Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson, Jo Anne Worley, Alan Sues, Lily Tomlin, Dennis Allen and Richard Dawson.

In 2002, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; was ranked number 42 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.

==Episodes==
&quot;Laugh-In&quot; was designed to be very lightly structured and consisted mainly of short comedic sketches. Some of these would reappear multiple times throughout an episode with variations on a theme, while others involved reoccurring characters created by the cast. In others, cast members and guest stars would simply appear as themselves, delivering jokes or reacting to a previous sketch. In addition to the announced guest star or stars of the evening, some recurring guest stars would appear unannounced multiple times through a season (which was easy to accomplish given the show&#x27;s non-linear taping sessions). A trademark of the series was its (even shorter) blackout sketches, often involving rapid-fire cuts between two or more scenes or camera angles, set to a six-note musical sting (or at times, an elongated 16-note version). These were used as transitions into and out of commercials, among other places.

The show started with a batch of sketches leading into Gary Owens&#x27; introduction segment, in which the cast and announced guest star(s) would appear behind open doors of the show&#x27;s iconic, psychedelically painted &quot;Joke Wall&quot;. Owens would also insert offbeat lines in his monotone, deadpan style, in the introductions and occasionally throughout the episode, generally facing a microphone to his side with one hand cupped to his ear (Owens&#x27;s character loosened up and became &quot;hipper&quot; in later seasons).

After more short sketches leading into and out of the first commercial break, Rowan and Martin would walk in front of the show&#x27;s homebase set to introduce the show and have a dialogue, generally consisting of Martin frustrating Rowan by derailing his attempt to do a proper introduction via misunderstandings or digressions.

Eventually, Rowan would end the introduction and invite the audience to the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot;. This live to tape segment consisted of all cast members and occasional surprise celebrities dancing before a 1960s &quot;mod&quot; party backdrop, delivering one- and two-line jokes interspersed with a few bars of dance music. (This was similar in format to the &quot;Word Dance&quot; segments of &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot;, and would later be imitated on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.)

Another weekly segment was &quot;Laugh-In Looks at the News&quot;, which began with the female cast members singing the segment&#x27;s opening theme in a different costumed set piece each week, often with the help of the guest star. The news varied in presentation over the years, but in the earlier seasons started with Martin reading the &quot;News of the Present&quot;, with Rowan providing &quot;News of the Future&quot; and sketches depicting the &quot;News of the Past&quot;. Alan Sues, as his &quot;Big Al&quot; character, would provide a typically clueless sports report.

&quot;Mod, Mod World&quot; was a group of sketches introduced by Rowan and Martin that fit into an announced theme. This segment is notable for being interspersed with film clips of some of the female cast members (most frequently Carne and Hawn) performing go-go dancing in bikinis to the segment&#x27;s burlesque-inspired theme, with the camera periodically zooming into jokes or images that had been painted onto their bodies. The segment also usually included an additional musical number based on the topic, performed by cast members at the beginning and end of the segment, as well as in short bridges between sketches.

At the end of every show, after a final dialogue, Rowan would turn to his co-host and say, &quot;Say good night, Dick&quot;, to which Martin replied, &quot;Good night, Dick!&quot;, leading into the final Joke Wall segment. The cast would pop out of their doors and either tell jokes to the camera, to each other, or to Rowan and Martin, who stood in front, or just yell out, &quot;Good night, Dick!&quot; This would lead into and continue under the closing credits. There would be one final batch of skits, including a closing appearance from Owens. Up until the finale of Season 4, the last gag would be Arte Johnson&#x27;s character, Wolfgang, the German soldier. He would slowly rise up from among some plants, look into the camera and say with a thick German accent, &quot;Veeeeery eeenterestingk!&quot; This would bring the episode to a conclusion - almost. The very last thing the television audience would hear is one pair of hands clapping several seconds after all the credits had rolled. This was the conclusion to almost every show up to the Season 5 finale. For Season 6, the television audience would hear a woman laughing (Ruth Buzzi) very strangely long after the credits had rolled.

Other segments and recurring characters, listed below, would come and go throughout the years.

==Production seasons==


===1967 Special===

The September 9, 1967, was meant to be a special, sponsored by Timex, with guest stars: Pamela Austin, Ken Berry, Judy Carne, Barbara Feldon, and featuring Ruth Buzzi, Henry Gibson, Larry Hovis, Arte Johnson, Monte Landis, Jo Anne Worley, and Paul Weston and His Orchestra&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/ytwtzDM79Mg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 1, 1968===

Season 1 ran from January to April 1968 with 14 episodes. Gary Owens joined the cast in the first episode along with series regulars Pamela Austin, Eileen Brennan, Judy Carne, Ruth Buzzi, Henry Gibson, Larry Hovis, Arte Johnson, and Jo Anne Worley. Goldie Hawn joined the cast in the third episode. She had been under contract to &quot;Good Morning World&quot; at the time of the pilot. Eileen Brennan, Barbara Feldon, and Jack Riley made frequent appearances in both season 1 and 2. Riley usually did skits as President Lyndon Johnson.

Ian Bernard (1930–2020) was the musical director for all 6 seasons. He composed the show&#x27;s theme song along with numerous other pieces.

Billy Barnes composed special comedic and topical songs for the show&#x27;s cast and guest stars. He was regularly seen playing a golden grand piano to accompany solos by cast members such as Ruth Buzzi, Alan Sues, and Jo Anne Worley and guest stars such as Dinah Shore and Lena Horne.

Cast departures: all continued on into Season 2 but Hovis.

===Season 2===
Season 2 (1968–1969): New regulars included Chelsea Brown, Dave Madden and Alan Sues.

Arte Johnson now insisted on star billing, apart from the rest of the cast. The producer mollified him by having on-screen radio continuity announcer Gary Owens read Johnson&#x27;s credit as a separate sentence: &quot;Starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin! &quot;And&quot; Arte Johnson! With Ruth Buzzi...&quot; This maneuver gave Johnson the star billing he wanted, but it also implied that he was still part of the ensemble cast.

Cast departures: Chelsea Brown and Dave Madden left at the end of season 2. Judy Carne officially left the show after episode 11 but did return for a few appearances in season 3.

===Season 3===

Season 3 (1969–1970): New regulars included Johnny Brown, Byron Gilliam, Teresa Graves, Jeremy Lloyd, Pamela Rodgers, and Lily Tomlin. Gilliam was a dancer in seasons 1 to 2 and promoted to cast member this season. Both Brown and Tomlin joined late in this season.
Cast departures and changes: After the season finale, Gilliam returned to being a regular dancer in The Cocktail Party scene and in occasional skits. He remained until the end of the series. Graves, Hawn, Lloyd, and Worley left after the season 3 finale. Tomlin remained until the series ended in 1973.

===Season 4===
Season 4 (1970–1971): There were major changes to the set and new additions to the cast. The overall psychedelia look was replaced with a more avant-garde ambience. The Cocktail Party set now consisted of oversized cutouts of celebrity and historical figures. The show began to depart from both its Hippie-esque &quot;vibe&quot; and humor and its leanings toward the 
counterculture of the 1960s. There were now significantly fewer jokes and less commentary about race relations and anti-Vietnam War sentiment.

New cast members: Dennis Allen, writer-actress Ann Elder, and tap dancer Barbara Sharma.

Cast departures: Gibson left after episode 10 and Johnson left after the season 4 finale.

Notable visits for season 4: Goldie Hawn made a guest appearance in episode 3. After she left &quot;Laugh-In&quot; she made two movies, &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl In My Soup&quot; and &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, for which she won an Academy Award. Teresa Graves made two consecutive appearances toward the end of season 4.

===Season 5===

Season 5 (1971–1972): Another new set design was introduced that combined abstract art with avant-garde. The Cocktail Party set now consisted of a main wall covered in mirrored tiles. The jokes, commentary and overall humor became even more mainstream in Season 5, and there were more schtick and vaudeville-styled musical numbers. The few political jokes told were mostly aimed at the Nixon administration. Around mid-season, the show began to air brief anti-drug messages at the end of each episode. In keeping with &quot;Laugh-In&quot;&#x27;s groundbreaking nature, these messages strongly resembled 21st century GIFs.

New cast members: &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; alumni Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis. Both had been part of season 1. Child actor Moosie Drier was also added, doing solo cameo jokes.

Cast departures after the season 5 finale: Brown, Elder, Hovis, Sharma, and Sues. Dawson remained until the series ended.
During season 5 the show also celebrated its 100th episode. Former cast regulars Carne, Gibson, Graves, Johnson, and Worley returned for the festivities. Frequent guest stars Tiny Tim and John Wayne were also on hand to celebrate. This was Wayne&#x27;s first guest appearance since 1968.

===Season 6===
Season 6 (1972–1973): This was &quot;Laugh-In&quot;&#x27;s final season. Rowan and Martin assumed the executive producer roles from George Schlatter and Ed Friendly. A new set was designed that mixed abstract art with muted psychedelia colors. There was once again a visible studio audience. Ian Bernard, the show&#x27;s musical director, and five other musicians became participants in the Cocktail Party scenes as the house band known as &quot;Ian Bernard and His Band at Large&quot;. Owens would often incorrectly introduce them as &quot;Ian Bernard and His Band of Irvine Quickies&quot;, &quot; ...His Band of Lard&quot; or &quot;...His Band of Lies&quot;. Also new for the first few episodes was a group of six women dancers called &quot;The Downtown Beauties&quot;, referring to the show&#x27;s running joke of &quot;beautiful downtown Burbank&quot;. The members of this group were in the Cocktail Party scenes and the group was featured for many of the musical numbers. The known names of these dancers are Janice Pennington, Mary Rowan (Dan&#x27;s daughter), and Adele Yoshioko.

Cast (returning veterans): Allen, Buzzi, Dawson, Owens, and Tomlin. (New members:) child actor Moosie Drier, promoted to cast member and teamed with child actor Tod Bass, character comedian Brian Bressler (up to episode 10), comedienne Patti Deutsch, German model Lisa Farringer (episodes 13–24), Sarah Kennedy, folksy singer-comedian Jud Strunk, ventriloquist act Willie Tyler and Lester, and Donna Jean Young. Former regular Jo Anne Worley returned for two guest appearances, including the series finale.

Although Owens was not in the 1967 pilot and Buzzi was not in two episodes of season 1, of the more than three dozen entertainers to join the cast over the years only Rowan, Martin, Owens, and Buzzi were present from beginning to end.

This last season was not George Schlatter&#x27;s property, so it was not included in the edited and condensed rerun package of half-hour episodes that was syndicated (through Lorimar Productions) to local stations in 1983 and later to Nick at Nite in 1987. Season 6 ultimately was shown for the first time since its original 1972 -1973 run when the entire series of full, uncut episodes began airing on Decades in 2017.

==Series writers==
The writers for &quot;Laugh-In&quot; were: George Schlatter, Paul W. Keyes (head writer), Larry Hovis (pilot only), Digby Wolfe, Hugh Wedlock Jr. and Allan Manings, Chris Bearde (credited as Chris Beard), Phil Hahn and Jack Hanrahan, Coslough Johnson&lt;ref name=&quot;thr/coslough-dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Arte Johnson&#x27;s twin brother), Marc London and David Panich, Dave Cox, Jim Carlson, Jack Mendelsohn and Jim Mulligan, Lorne Michaels (before he became the producer of Saturday Night Live) and Hart Pomerantz, Jack Douglas, Jeremy Lloyd, John Carsey, Dennis Gren, Gene Farmer, John Rappaport and Stephen Spears, Jim Abell and Chet Dowling, Barry Took, E. Jack Kaplan, Larry Siegel, Jack S. Margolis, Don Reo and Allan Katz, Richard Goren (also credited as Rowby Greeber and Rowby Goren), Winston Moss, Gene Perret and Bill Richmond, Jack Wohl, Bob Howard and Bob DeVinney. Script supervisors for &quot;Laugh-In&quot; included Digby Wolfe (comedy consultant, season 1), Phil Hahn and Jack Hanrahan (season 2), Allan Manings (season 3), Marc London and David Panich (seasons 3–6), and Jim Mulligan (season 6).

==Musical direction and production numbers==
The musical director for &quot;Laugh-In&quot; was Ian Bernard.&lt;ref name=&quot;syvn/ian-bernard&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the opening theme music, &quot;Inquisitive Tango&quot; (used in Season 1 and again permanently from season 4), plus the infamous &quot;What&#x27;s the news across the nation&quot; number. He wrote all the musical &quot;play-ons&quot; that introduced comedy sketches like Lily Tomlin&#x27;s character, Edith Ann, the little girl who sat in a giant rocking chair, and Arte Johnson&#x27;s old man character, Tyrone, who always got hit with a purse. He also appeared in many of the Cocktail Party scenes, primarily Season 6, where he directed his band as they stopped and started between jokes. Composer-lyricist Billy Barnes wrote all of the original musical production numbers in the show, and often appeared on-camera, accompanying Johnson, Buzzi, Worley, or Sues, on a golden grand piano. Barnes was the creator of the Billy Barnes Revue of 1959 and 1960. For the entire 141-episode series of &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, including the pilot, the show&#x27;s musical coordinator was West Coast bebop jazz pianist and composer Russ Freeman.

==Post-production==
The show was recorded at NBC&#x27;s Burbank facility using two-inch quadruplex videotape. As computer-controlled online editing had not been invented at the time, post-production video editing of the montage was achieved by the error-prone method of visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting it with a razor blade or guillotine cutter and splicing with adhesive tape, in a manner similar to film editing. This had the incidental benefit of ensuring the preservation of the master tape, as a spliced tape could not be recycled for further use. &quot;Laugh-In&quot; editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the &quot;jump cut&quot; – the unique editing style in which a sudden cut from one shot to another was made without a fade-out.

When the series was restored for airing by the Trio Cable Network in 1996, the aforementioned edits became problematic for the editors, as the adhesive used on the source tape had deteriorated during 20+ years of storage, making many of the visual elements at the edit points unusable. This was corrected in digital re-editing by removing the problematic video at the edit point and then slowing down the video image just before the edit point; time-expanding the slowed-down section long enough to allot enough time to seamlessly reinsert the audio portion from the removed portion of video.

==Recurring sketches and characters==

===Sketches===

Frequently recurring &quot;Laugh-In&quot; sketches included:
*&quot;Cocktail Party&quot;; a live to tape segment consisting of all cast members and occasional surprise celebrities dancing before a 1960s &quot;mod&quot; party backdrop, delivering one- and two-line jokes interspersed with a few bars of dance music. (This was similar in format to the &quot;Word Dance&quot; segments of &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot;, and would later be imitated on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.)
*&quot;Mod, Mod World&quot;; a group of sketches introduced by Rowan and Martin that fit into an announced theme. This segment is notable for being interspersed with film clips of some of the female cast members (Judy Carne, Ruth Buzzi, Goldie Hawn, Chelsea Brown, and others&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/OIQiOxRkzBw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) performing go-go dancing in bikinis to the segment&#x27;s burlesque-inspired theme, with the camera periodically zooming into puns, jokes and images that had been painted onto their bodies. The segment also usually included an additional musical number based on the topic, performed by cast members at the beginning and end of the segment, as well as in short bridges between sketches. 

*&quot;Sock it to me&quot;; Judy Carne was often tricked into saying the phrase (&quot;It may be rice wine to you, but it&#x27;s sake to me!&quot;), which invariably results in her (or other cast members) falling through a trap door, being doused with water, or playfully assaulted in various other manners. The phrase was also uttered by many of the cameo guest stars, most notably Richard Nixon, though they were almost never subjected to the same treatment as Carne. The phrase was &quot;retired&quot; after Carne left the series. In the last season where Alan Sues was a regular, he would be the one who got water thrown on him after a ticking alarm clock went off.
*&quot;The Farkel Family&quot;, a couple with numerous children, all of whom wore round glasses, had bright red hair and large freckles - strikingly similar to their &quot;good friend and trusted neighbor&quot; Ferd Berfel (Dick Martin). The sketch employed diversion humor, the writing paying more attention to the lines said by each player, using alliterative tongue-twisters (&quot;That&#x27;s a fine-looking Farkel flinger you found there, Frank&quot;). Dan Rowan played father Frank Farkel the Third, Jo Anne Worley, Barbara Sharma, and Patti Deutsch played his wife Fanny Farkel, Goldie Hawn played Sparkle Farkel, and Arte Johnson played Frank Farkel the Fourth. Ruth Buzzi played Flicker Farkel, who wore a frilly dress and would contort herself and roll on the floor and loudly say &quot;HIIIIII!&quot; in a very high-pitched voice. Two of the children were twins named Simon and Gar Farkel, played by cast members of different races (Teresa Graves and Pamela Rodgers in the third season; Johnny Brown and Dennis Allen in the fourth). By the final season the Farkel offspring had dwindled to only two children, played by Ruth Buzzi and the puppet Lester. All of the Farkel skits were written or co-written by David Panich.
*&quot;Here Comes the Judge&quot;. The judge, originally portrayed by British comic Roddy Maude-Roxby, was a stuffy magistrate with a black robe and oversized judge&#x27;s wig. Each sketch featured the judge trading barbs with a defendant brought before him. On delivery of the punchline, he would strike the defendant with an inflated bladder balloon tied to the sleeve of his robe. Guest stars Flip Wilson or Sammy Davis Jr. would introduce the sketch saying &quot;Here come da judge!&quot;, which was a venerable catchphrase by nightclub comedian Pigmeat Markham. Surprised that his trademark had been appropriated, Markham asked producer George Schlatter to let him play the judge himself; Schlatter agreed and Markham presided for the first half of the second season. After Markham left, the sketch was briefly retired until Sammy Davis Jr. donned the judicial robe and wig during his guest appearances, making the role his own. The character was introduced as &quot;The Right Honorable Samuel Davis, Junior&quot; (or &quot;Right Hon.&quot; for short). Davis introduced each sketch with a spoken verse like &quot;If your lawyer&#x27;s sleepin&#x27;, better give him a nudge! Everybody look alive &#x27;cause here come de judge!&quot; Davis would then strut off stage chanting &quot;Here come de judge! Here come de judge!&quot;
*&quot;Laugh-In Looks at the News&quot;, a parody of network newscasts. It first appeared in the pilot episode in a slightly different format, meant to show how a news broadcast would run if presented as a weekly variety show. The segment was introduced by the female cast members singing the segment&#x27;s opening theme in a different costumed set piece each week, often with the help of the guest star, in a highly un-journalistic manner - with clever production numbers that had intricate choreography and amazing costume design. The sketch was originally called the Rowan and Martin Report (a take-off on the Huntley-Brinkley Report, Hovis had mimicked Brinkley in the Pilot/Special). The sketch itself featured Martin reading the &quot;News of the Present&quot;, humorously reporting on current events, which then segued into Dan reporting on &quot;News of the Future&quot; (20 years later), and sketches depicting the &quot;News of the Past&quot;. &quot;News of the Future&quot; segments, on at least two occasions, &quot;correctly predicted&quot; future events, one being that Ronald Reagan would be president in 1988, and another that the Berlin Wall would finally come down in 1989 (&quot;S2 E23&quot;). A third prediction came partially true in &quot;S3 E7&quot; when Rowan lightheartedly discussed the devastation of &quot;Hurricane Bruce&quot; on Burbank, with damage at $27.00&quot;. People laughed hysterically at the dubious name, but 16 years later, on August 14, 1985, the real Hurricane Bruce, a Major Category 5, roared through the Caribbean and the Gulf States. The Cayman Islands got the brunt of the storm, with 95% of all buildings destroyed and 60 lives lost. The name Bruce was officially retired at the RA IV Hurricane Committee Meeting in the Spring of 1986. This segment was influenced by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, and in turn inspired &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segments (&quot;SNL&quot; creator Lorne Michaels was a &quot;Laugh-In&quot; writer early in his career). The News segments were followed by &quot;Big Al&quot; (Sues) and his sports report in seasons 2–5. After Sues left the show, Jud Strunk took over the sports segment (&quot;reporting from the sports capital of Farmington, Maine&quot;) by featuring films of oddly-named events which were actual sports films played backwards. An example is the &quot;Cannonball Catch&quot;, featuring a backwards film of a bowling tournament where the &quot;cannonballs&quot; (bowling balls) are caught one-handed by the catcher (the bowler) after rolling up the alley. 
*&quot;New Talent Time&quot; also called &quot;Discovery of the Week&quot; in later seasons. It introduced oddball variety acts (sometimes characters played by regular cast members). &quot;Laugh-In&quot; writer Chris Beard (later known as Chris Bearde) took the &quot;New Talent&quot; concept and later developed it into &quot;The Gong Show&quot;.
:*Tin Pan Alley musician Tiny Tim – The most notable of these performances was in episode 1 and shot him to fame. He returned in the Season 1 finale, made several guest appearances after, and was there for the series finale.
:*Actor Paul Gilbert (adoptive father of actress Melissa Gilbert) appeared in three episodes as an inept French juggler, introduced as &quot;Paul Jill-&quot;bare&quot;&quot;.
:*The Holy Modal Rounders, 14 October 1968
:*6&#x27;2&quot; actress Inga Neilsen made appearances as a bugle/kazoo player who could only play one note of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; and had to deal with Martin&#x27;s advances. Martin, who showed mild interest in most New Talent acts, enthusiastically cheered her on despite the obvious lack of talent.
:*Ventriloquist Paul Winchell appeared three times as &quot;Lucky Pierre&quot;, whose puppets would fall apart or die on him.
:*Arte Johnson would appear as his Pyotr Rosmenko character looking for his big American break, singing gibberish in a Russian accent.
:*Murray Langston, made an appearance. He would later achieve fame as the Gong Show&#x27;s &quot;Unknown Comic&quot;.
*&quot;The Flying Fickle Finger of Fate Award&quot; sardonically recognized actual dubious achievements by public individuals or institutions, the most frequent recipients being members or branches of the government. The trophy was a gilded left hand mounted on a trophy base with its extended index finger adorned with two small wings. The award was created by Paul Keyes and Jack Hanrahan, with the former credited with its name and the latter the trophy.
*&quot;The Wonderful World of Whoopee Award&quot; was a counterpart to the &quot;Flying Fickle Finger of Fate Award&quot;, described by Rowan as a citation &quot;for the little man who manages to outfight or outfox the bureaucracy&quot;; the statue was similar to the Finger of Fate, only it was a right hand (without wings on the index finger) pointing straight up, and with a hidden mechanism that, when activated, waved the finger in a circular motion.
*&quot;The C.F.G. Automat&quot;; a vending machine whose title was an inside joke for cast members who referred to producer Schlatter as &quot;Crazy F***ing George&quot;. The vending machine would distribute oddball items that were a play on the name. Examples: The &#x27;pot pie&#x27; produced a cloud of smoke when the door was opened, then the pie floated away. The &#x27;ladyfingers&#x27; was a woman&#x27;s hand reaching out and tickling Arte&#x27;s face while another &#x27;ladyfingers&#x27; door opened and picked his pocket.
*Many episodes were interspersed with a recurring, short wordless gag in which an actor repeatedly tried to accomplish some simple task like entering an elevator, opening a window or door, watering a plant, etc., which would fail each time in a different, surprising way (the object would move unexpectedly, another part of the wall or room would move, water would squirt the actor in the face from the object, etc.)
*Another recurring wordless gag involved one or more actors walking around the street in a jerky fashion (using stop-motion or low shutter speed filming) holding and turning a bare steering wheel, as if they were driving a car or actually were a car, with various sound effects to simulate honking, back-ups, collisions with each other, etc.
*From season 4 on, a variety of sketches or jokes used the word &quot;Foon&quot;, usually as part of the name of imaginary products or persons (e.g., Foon detergent, Mr. Foonman). The names &quot;Nern&quot; and &quot;Wacker&quot; were used similarly from Seasons 1 through 3. 
*&quot;Questions From The Audience / Dick&#x27;s Costumes&quot;; In the sixth season, Dan Rowan would ask the audience if anybody had any questions about the show or otherwise. As he was doing so (in which nobody in the audience ever spoke up), Dick Martin would come out wearing a wacky costume which Rowan would ask about, leading to a humorous exchange on the costume&#x27;s subject matter.

===Characters===

*Dan Rowan, in addition to hosting, provided the &quot;News Of The Future&quot; and also appeared as General Bull Right, a far-right-wing representative of the military establishment and outlet for political humor.
*Dick Martin, in addition to hosting would also play the drunken Leonard Swizzle, husband of an equally drunk Doris Swizzle (Ruth Buzzi); and a character always buzzing for an elevator on which the doors never closed in a normal way
*Gary Owens as an on-screen radio continuity announcer, who regularly stands in an old-time radio studio (acoustic tiles, large microphone), with his hand cupped over his ear, making announcements, often with little relation to the rest of the show, such as (in an overly-dramatic voice), &quot;Earlier that evening ...&quot;
*Arte Johnson:
**Wolfgang, the WWII German soldier who was unaware the war was over – Wolfgang would often peer out from behind a potted palm and comment on the previous gag saying, with a thick German accent, &quot;Verrry in-te-res-tink&quot;, sometimes with comments such as &quot;... but &quot;shtupid&quot;!&quot; He eventually closed each show by talking to Lucille Ball and her husband Gary Morton, as well as the cast of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; — both airing opposite &quot;Laugh-In&quot; on CBS; as well as whatever was on ABC. Johnson later repeated the line while playing Nazi-themed supervillain Virman Vundabar on an episode of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. Johnson also reprised his Wolfgang character in a series of skits for the second season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1970–1971), and in 1980 for a series of small introductory skits with a plant on &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;, during the &quot;Growth/Decay&quot; week.
**Tyrone F. Horneigh (pronounced &quot;hor-NIGH&quot;, presumably to satisfy the censors) was a &quot;dirty old man&quot; who was always after drab spinster Gladys Ormphby (Ruth Buzzi). As she sat on a park bench he would attempt to sit right next to her, eventually forcing her to the edge of the bench. Gladys always rebuked Tyrone&#x27;s advances and would clobber him multiple times with her purse until he would make a final comment about his well-being and do a slow roll off the bench. Both Tyrone and Gladys later became animated characters (voiced by Johnson and Buzzi) in &quot;The Nitwits&quot; segments of the 1977 Saturday morning animated television show, &quot;Baggy Pants and the Nitwits&quot;.
**Pyotr Rosmenko, a Russian man, stands stiffly and nervously in an ill-fitting out-of-fashion 1940s pin-striped suit while commenting on differences between America and &quot;the old country&quot;, such as &quot;Here in America, is very good, everyone watch television. In old country, television watches you!&quot; This type of joke has come to be known as the Russian reversal.
**Rabbi Shankar (a pun on Ravi Shankar) was an Indian guru who dresses in a Nehru jacket dispensing pseudomystical Eastern wisdom laden with bad puns. He held up two fingers in a peace sign whenever he spoke.
**An unnamed character in a yellow raincoat and hat, riding a tricycle and then falling over, was frequently used to link between sketches. The character was portrayed by many people besides Johnson, including his brother Coslough (a writer for the show), Alan Sues, and Johnny Brown.
**The Scandinavian Storyteller – spoke gibberish, including nonsensical &#x27;Knock Knock&#x27; jokes in the Joke Wall. No one could ever understand him. Possibly inspiration for the Muppets&#x27; Swedish Chef character.
**The Psychiatrist - a black haired, black clad doctor who often attends the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; during season four and talks about his experiments and patients with a thick Freudian accent. 
*Ruth Buzzi:
**Gladys Ormphby – A drab, relatively young spinster, in the Close-up segments, including &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; segments, she is portrayed as desperate for males, in the Arte Johnson segments, she is the eternal target of Arte Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Tyrone&quot;, whom she rebukes, then attacks; when Johnson left the series, Gladys retreated into recurring daydreams, often involving marriages to historical figures, including Christopher Columbus and Benjamin Franklin (both played by Alan Sues). She typically hit people repeatedly with her purse. The character was recreated, along with Tyrone, in &quot;Baggy Pants and the Nitwits&quot;. Buzzi also performed as Gladys on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, most notably in the Celebrity Roasts.
**Doris Swizzle – A seedy barfly, she is paired with her husband, Leonard Swizzle, played by Dick Martin.
**Kim Hither – An exceedingly friendly hooker, commonly seen in sketches or at the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; propositioning people while leaning against a lamppost.
**Busy Buzzi – A cold and heartless old-style Hedda Hopper-type Hollywood gossip columnist.
**Kathleen Pullman – A wicked parody of televangelist Kathryn Kuhlman. This always helpful but overdramatic woman is always eager to help people. 
**Laverne Blossom - A former silent movie star (an Alla Nazimova as Marguerite Gautier in &quot;Camille&quot; homage) with dark make-up around the eyes. She often attends the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; in the later seasons. 
**Florence Lawrence - a meek wannabe secretary with giant teeth. Also attends the &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; during the back half of season four.
**Alice Capone - tells jokes during the Syndicate news segment in Season 6. Wears cotton stuffed in her mouth to resemble Marlon Brando in The Godfather.
*Henry Gibson:
**The Poet held an oversized flower and nervously read offbeat poems. (His stage name was a play on the name of playwright Henrik Ibsen.)
**The Parson – A character who makes ecclesiastical quips. In 1970, he officiated at a near-marriage for Tyrone and Gladys.
**Would frequently just pop up and utter the phrase &quot;Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin&#x27;?&quot;.
**Also played a cub reporter for Busy Buzzi. While she was looking for a scoop, Gibson would come in with one (usually about Steve McQueen) which Buzzi would completely garble up to sound like something out of left field.
*Goldie Hawn is best known as the giggling &quot;dumb blonde&quot;, stumbling over her lines, especially when she introduced Dan&#x27;s &quot;News of the Future&quot;. In the earliest episodes, she recited her dialogue sensibly and in her own voice, but as the series progressed, she adopted a Dumb Dora character with a higher-pitched giggle and a vacant expression, which endeared her to viewers. Frequently did a Donald Duck voice at inappropriate times, such as when she was expected to sing or doing ballet.

*Lily Tomlin:
**Ernestine/Miss Tomlin – An obnoxious telephone operator, she has no concern at all for her customers and constantly mispronounced their names. Her close friend is fellow telephone operator, Phenicia; and her boyfriend, Vito. She would boast of being a high school graduate. Tomlin later performed Ernestine on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Happy New Year, America&quot;. She also played the Ernestine character for a comedy album called &quot;This Is A Recording&quot; and also made guest appearances as the character on shows and TV specials, such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, &quot;Free to Be... a Family&quot;, and &quot;Sesame Street Stays Up Late!&quot;, in the last of which Oscar calls the operator and harangues her into hooking him up with five of his Grouch relatives. At the suggestion of CFG, Ernestine began dialing with her middle finger in Season 4, sometimes blatantly flipping &quot;the bird&quot; to the camera as a result. Censors never caught on – &quot;we know she&#x27;s doing something wrong, we just can&#x27;t put our &quot;finger&quot; on it!&quot;
**Edith Ann – A -year-old child, she ends each of her short monologs with: &quot;And that&#x27;s the truth&quot;, followed by blowing a raspberry. Tomlin performs her skits in an oversized rocking chair that makes her appear small. Tomlin later performed Edith Ann on children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.
**Mrs. Earbore (the &quot;Tasteful Lady&quot;) – A prim society matron, Mrs. Earbore expressed quiet disapproval about a tasteless joke or remark, and then rose from her chair with her legs spread, getting doused with a bucket of water or the sound of her skirt ripping.
**Dotty – A crass and rude grocery checker who tended to annoy her customers at the store where she worked.
**Lula – A loud and boisterous woman with a Marie Antoinette hair-do who always loved a party.
**Suzie Sorority of the Silent Majority – clueless sorority college student who ended each bit with &quot;Rah!&quot;
**The Babbler – A character given to speaking exuberantly and at great length while digressing after every few words and never staying on one subject, producing an unbroken, incomprehensible monolog.

*Judy Carne had two characters known for their robotic speech and movement:
**Mrs. Robot in &quot;Robot Theater&quot; – A female companion to Arte Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;.
**The Talking Judy Doll – She is usually played with by Arte Johnson, who never heeded her warning: &quot;Touch my little body, and I hit you!&quot;
**The Sock-It-To-Me Girl in which she would usually end up being splashed with water and/or falling through a trap door and/or getting conked on the head by a large club or mallet and/or knocked out by a boxing glove on a spring.
*Jo Anne Worley sometimes sings off-the-wall songs using her loud operatic voice or displaying an advanced state of pregnancy, but is better remembered for her mock outrage at &quot;chicken jokes&quot; and her melodic outcry of &quot;Bo-ring!&quot;. At the cocktail parties, she would talk about her never-seen married boyfriend/lover &quot;Boris&quot; (who, according to her in a Season 3 episode, was finally found out by his wife).
*Alan Sues:
**Big Al – A clueless and fey sports anchor, he loves ringing his &quot;Featurette&quot; bell, which he calls his &quot;tinkle&quot;.
** He would dress in drag as his former co-star, Jo Anne Worley, including skits where he appeared as a &quot;fairy godmother&quot;. imitating Worley&#x27;s boisterous laugh and offering help or advice to a Cinderella-type character in a conversation full of double entendres.
**Uncle Al, the Kiddies&#x27; Pal – A short-tempered host of a children&#x27;s show, he usually goes on the air with a hangover: &quot;Oh, kiddies, Uncle Al had a lot of medicine last night.&quot; Whenever he got really agitated, he would yell to &quot;Get Miss Twinkle on the phone!&quot;
**Grabowski – a benchwarmer football player obviously not cut out for the sport. Example lines included &quot;He pushed me! He pushed me!... they &quot;all&quot; pushed me!&quot; and &quot;No, you can&#x27;t wear your ballet slippers on the field, Grabowski!&quot;
**Boomer – A self-absorbed &quot;jock&quot; bragging about his athletic exploits.
**Ambiguously gay saloon patron – while Dan and Dick ordered whiskey, he would saunter up to the bar and ask for a fruit punch or frozen daiquiri.
**In the last season where he was a regular, he would be the one who got water thrown on him after a ticking alarm clock went off (replacing Judy Carne as the one who always got drenched). 
*Pamela Rodgers – &quot;Your man in Washington&quot;; she would give &#x27;reports&#x27; from the Capitol that were usually double entendres to give the impression that the Congressmen were fooling around with her.
*Jeremy Lloyd – scrunched himself into an ultra-short character a la Toulouse-Lautrec.
*Dennis Allen:
**Lt. Peaches of the Fuzz – a stumble-bum police officer.
**Chaplain Bud Homily – a droll clergyman who often falls victim to his own sermons.
**Eric Clarified (a play on news commentator Eric Sevareid) – a correspondent for &quot;Laugh-In Looks at the News&quot; who further muddles up obfuscatory government statements he has been asked to clarify. Rowan would often throw to another correspondent (played by Sues) to analyze Eric Clarified&#x27;s statements in turn. 
*Barbara Sharma:
**The Burbank Meter Maid – a dancing meter maid who tickets anything from trees to baby carriages. 
**An aspiring actress who often plays foil in cocktail-party segments to another &quot;high-society&quot; character (Tomlin).
**In season four, a Ruby Keeler-esque dancer (and arch-nemesis of Johnson&#x27;s Wolfgang) who often praises Vice President Spiro Agnew.
*Johnny Brown lent his impersonations of Ed Sullivan, Alfred Hitchcock, Ralph Kramden and the Kingfish from &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;.
*Ann Elder as Pauline Rhetoric (a play on NBC reporter Pauline Frederick), the chief interviewer for the &quot;Laugh-In News&quot; segments.
*Moosie Drier and Todd Bass – Drier did the &quot;kids news for kids&quot; segment of the Laugh-In news. Bass teamed with Drier in Season 6 to read letters from a treehouse
*Larry Hovis – the Senator, the Texan, David Brinkley, Father Time
*Richard Dawson – W.C. Fields, Groucho Marx, Hawkins the Butler, who always started his piece by asking &quot;Permission to ...?&quot; and proceeded to fall over.
*Roddy Maude-Roxby, Pigmeat Markham – Here Come Da Judge (Roxby for Season 1, Markham for Season 2)
*Dave Madden – would always throw confetti after &quot;a naughty thought&quot;, usually a punch line that was a double-entendre. Once while kissing Carne, confetti erupted around him.
*Jud Strunk – sports news segment (&quot;reporting from the sports capital of Farmington, Maine&quot;), Vidal Bassoon (play on Vidal Sassoon) with the Bald News (who tears of a wig to reveal a bald cap each time).
*Patti Deutsch - Sister Mary Youngman (a nun who tells jokes a la Henny Youngman), Heavy Helen who presents the Hippy news.

===Memorable moments===

The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition.

During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking &quot;Sock it to &quot;me&quot;?&quot; Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon&#x27;s opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined. According to George Schlatter, the show&#x27;s creator, &quot;Humphrey later said that not doing it may have cost him the election&quot;, and &quot;[Nixon] said the rest of his life that appearing on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; is what got him elected. And I believe that. And I&#x27;ve had to live with that.&quot; In an episode of the ill-fated 1977 revival, Rich Little as Nixon says, &quot;I invited the American people to sock-it-to-me... you can stop now&quot;.

After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, Goldie Hawn made a guest appearance in the third episode of the fourth season. She began the episode as an arrogant snob of an actress; however, a bucket of water thrown at her transformed her back to her giggling dumb blonde persona.

On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Babbler and Ernestine shticks) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him &quot;an irresistable letter&quot; in which he promised to fly Buckley out to Burbank &quot;in an airplane with two right wings&quot;. At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing: &quot;You can&#x27;t be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one.&quot;

The 100th episode featured John Wayne, Tiny Tim and the return of several former cast members. Wayne, with his ear cupped, read the line &quot;and me, I&#x27;m Gary Owens&quot; instead of Owens himself. Wayne also shook Tiny Tim&#x27;s hand, pretending that his grip was too overpowering.

==Catchphrases==
In addition to those already mentioned, the show created numerous catchphrases (for a full description of characters and recurring characters, see above sections.):
*&quot;Look &quot;that&quot; up in your &quot;Funk and Wagnalls&quot;!&quot; -- said primarily by cast members. &quot;F &amp; W&quot; was a lesser-known, cheaply made and sold in supermarkets,&lt;ref name=&quot;atmore/encyclopedia-cents&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as a door-buster, set of encyclopedia volumes whose phonetically tricky name was aimed at the NBC censors to poke fun of them by both &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Originally coined by Pigmeat Markham.
*&quot;Sock it to me!&quot;—got the most exposure from this show. It had been used in two songs released in 1966 - two years before &quot;Laugh-In&quot; went on the air in 1968 as a series. The first was &quot;Sock It To Me, Baby!&quot; by Mitch Ryder &amp; The Detroit Wheels and the second was &quot;Respect&quot; by Aretha Franklin. She repeatedly sang the phrase in her chart-topping hit. The phrase was retired after Season 3, when Carne left the series.
*&quot;You bet your sweet bippy!&quot;—said primarily by Dick Martin.
*&quot;Beautiful downtown Burbank&quot;—cast and guests. A tongue-in-cheek reference to the Los Angeles suburb in which the NBC studios were located and where the show was filmed. The same phrase was frequently used by Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.
*&quot;Here come de Judge!&quot;—this Pigmeat Markham sing-song phrase was brought to the show by Sammy Davis Jr. in season 1. He wore an American judge&#x27;s robe with a British judge&#x27;s white wig and had a new rhyme with each appearance. Used primarily in Seasons 1–3.
*&quot;Verrry in-te-res-ting.&quot;—done in a thick German accent by Wolfgang (Johnson) the soldier.
*&quot;Blow in my/his/her ear and I/he/she will follow you anywhere.&quot;—cast and guests. 
*&quot;One ringy-dingy ... two ringy-dingys ...&quot;—used solely by Ernestine (Lily Tomlin), the obnoxious telephone operator. She would mimic the rings while waiting for someone to pick up the receiver. 
*&quot;A gracious good afternoon. This is Miss Tomlin of the telephone company. Have I reached the party to whom I am speaking?&quot;—Ernestine&#x27;s greeting to people she would call. She always mispronounced the names of famous people, such as: Gore Vidal, who was &quot;Mr. Veedle&quot; or &quot;Gory&quot;, William F. Buckley was &quot;Mr. F&#x27;buckley&quot;, Richard Nixon was simply &quot;Milhous&quot;.
*&quot;I just wanna swing!&quot;—Gladys Ormphby&#x27;s catchphrase.
*&quot;Ring my chimes!&quot;—Flip Wilson.
*&quot;Was that another chicken joke?&quot; –- Jo Anne Worley&#x27;s outraged cry. A spoof of people&#x27;s complaints about Polish jokes.
*&quot;Think about it&quot;—used by cast members after a pun, especially one that stumped the censors.
*&quot;Now, that&#x27;s a no-no!&quot;—cast and guests. 
*&quot;And that&#x27;s the truth – PFFFFT!&quot;—Edith Ann.
*&quot;Go to your room!&quot; -– cast members and guests. Used as a response to a particularly bad joke.
*&quot;Want a Walnetto?&quot;—a pickup line first used by Tryone on Gladys. (Anything he said to her resulted in a purse drubbing.)
*&quot;Oh... &quot;that&quot; Henny Youngman!&quot; -– preceded by cast members quoting a series of his punchlines in succession, but without the jokes leading up to them. 
*&quot;He pushed me!&quot; –- usually said by Sues when another cast member would bump him.
*&quot;Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin –- uttered by Gibson randomly between sketches.
*&quot;How does that grab you?&quot; and &quot;BORRRRING!!!&quot;—loudly sung by Jo Anne Worley. 
*&quot;I/he/she am/is/was was a much better person for that.&quot; –- cast and guests. 
*&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll drink to that&quot;, &quot;I did not know that!&quot;, &quot;Whatever turns you on&quot; –- Dick Martin.
*&quot;Goodnight, Lucy.&quot; -– During the first three seasons, Laugh-In was scheduled opposite Lucille Ball&#x27;s third television series, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy.&quot; At the end of the show, one or more cast members would say, &quot;Goodnight, Lucy.&quot; 
*&quot;Goodnight, Dick.&quot; –- the closing portion of each episode of Seasons 1 and 2 which began with the cast and celebrities taking turns saying &quot;Goodnight, Dick!&quot;. Occasionally, one of the celebrities would say &quot;Who&#x27;s Dick?&quot;. This shtick was revived in the 6th season, usually after the end credits.
*&quot;Gotcha!&quot;—cast and guests. 
*&quot;Wr-r-r-ong!&quot; –- uttered first by Otto Preminger in a cameo. Subsequent cameo actors would repeat the line, mimicking Preminger&#x27;s delivery of it.
*&quot;I think I&#x27;ve got it too.&quot; –- running gag where the person would say this and start scratching themselves as if they caught a skin disease. 
*&quot;That&#x27;s not funny&quot;—cast members and guests. 
*&quot;Wacker.&quot; –- a surname that was frequently used in sketches beginning in Season 2. It originated after Bobby Darin had done a skit with Martin and proceeded to call him &#x27;Wacker&#x27; throughout the rest of the episode.
*&quot;Foonman&quot; - another surname frequently used in skits after Season 4.
*&quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; (paying homage to the game show) -- a running gag during the first two seasons. Celebrities made cameos claiming to be a celebrity of the opposite gender then state, &quot;...and I&#x27;ve REALLY got a secret!&quot;. 
*&quot;Morgul the Friendly Drelb&quot; –- a pink Abominable Snowman-like character that was introduced in the second episode. It bombed so badly that his name was used in various announcements by Owens for the rest of the series. The name was usually used after the introduction of the cast - &quot;Yours truly, Gary Owens, and Morgul as the Friendly Drelb!&quot;

==Merchandise tie-ins and spin-offs==

A chain of Laugh-In restaurants opened in several states during 1968–69; primarily in Michigan, Ohio and Florida. Psychedelically-themed like the show, they offered such menu items as Bippy Burgers, Is That A Chicken Joke Chicken, Fickle Finger Of Fate Fries, Beautiful Downtown Burbank Burgers, Fickle Finger Franks, Verrrry Interesting Sandwiches, I&#x27;ll Drink To That beverages, Sock It To Me soups, Laugh-In Fortune Cookies and Here Come Da Fudge sundaes. Staff often rode around on red tricycles wearing yellow raincoats and hats. All locations were closed by the mid-1970s. Menus, French fry bags, sandwich wraps, napkins, salt and pepper shakers and other memorabilia are still sold on EBay.

A humor magazine tie-in, &quot;Laugh-In Magazine&quot;, was published for one year (12 issues: October 1968 through October 1969—no issue was published December 1968), and a 1968-1972 syndicated&lt;ref name=&quot;Apeldoorn/Doty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sundays and daily newspaper comic strip was drawn, without actors likeness, by Roy Doty and eventually collected for a paperback reprint.&lt;ref name=&quot;osu/cartoons/Laugh in&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drelb/Laugh-In #1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Laugh-In&quot; trading cards from Topps had a variety of items, such as a card with a caricature of Jo Anne Worley with a large open mouth. With a die-cut hole, the card became interactive; a finger could be inserted through the hole to simulate Worley&#x27;s tongue. Little doors opened on Joke Wall cards to display punchlines.

On &quot;Letters to Laugh-In&quot;, a short-lived spin-off daytime show hosted by Gary Owens, cast members read jokes sent in by viewers, which were scored by applause meter. The eventual winning joke was read by actress Jill St. John: &quot;What do you get when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter? A 500 pound sandwich that sticks to the roof of your mouth!&quot;

A cross-promotional episode of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (&quot;The Biggest Star in Hollywood&quot;, February 1969) features Judy Carne, Arte Johnson, Gary Owens, and producer George Schlatter playing themselves in a story about Jeannie being sought after to appear on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;.

In 1969, a &quot;Laugh-In&quot; View-Master packet was issued by General Aniline and Film (GAF); The packet featured 21 3D images from the show.

The horror spoof film &quot;The Maltese Bippy&quot; (1969,) starring Dan Rowan and Dick Martin as low-budget moviemakers, was loosely related to the series. Pamela Rodgers was the only &quot;Laugh-In&quot; cast member to co-star in the film. The film received only a token release by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer—it never even appeared in many key cities—and its disappointing performance resulted in no further Rowan &amp; Martin films.

In 1969, the 1969 Pontiac GTO 2 Door Hardtop &quot;The Judge&quot; was an options package: rear spoiler, striped body paint and “The Judge” decals, and engines: 366 hp Ram Air III, or 370 hp Ram Air IV.

In 1969, Sears, Roebuck and Company produced a 15-minute short, &quot;Freeze-In&quot;, which starred series regulars Judy Carne and Arte Johnson. Made to capitalize on the popularity of the series, the short was made for Sears salesmen to introduce the new Kenmore freezer campaign. A dancing, bikini-clad Carne provided the opening titles with tattoos on her body.

Two LPs of material from the show were released: the first on Epic Records (FXS-15118, 1968); the second, which did not feature Rowan or Martin, was entitled &quot;Laugh-In &#x27;69&quot; and released on Reprise Records (RS 6335, 1969).

&quot;Murder on High C&quot;, a 1975 episode of the TV series &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot;, which starred former cast member Teresa Graves, featured a number of other &quot;Laugh-In&quot; cast members, including the villain (Arte Johnson), Johnny Brown, Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Gary Owens and Joanne Worley.

===DVD releases===
On June 24, 2003, and then February 24, 2004, Rhino Entertainment Company (under its &quot;Rhino Retrovision&quot; classic TV entertainment brand), under license from the rightsholder at the time, SFM Entertainment, released two respective &quot;The Best Of&quot; releases of the show, each containing six episodes presented in its original, uncut broadcast version. In 2003, Rhino, through direct-response marketing firm Guthy-Renker, also released a series of DVDs subtitled &quot;The Sock-It-To-Me Collection&quot;, with each DVD containing two episodes.

On June 19, 2017, Time Life, another direct-response marketer, released &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1, in a deal with current rightsholder Proven Entertainment. The 38-disc set contains all 140 episodes of the series, complete and uncut, restored and remastered as well as many bonus features and a special 32-page collector&#x27;s book.

On September 5, 2017, Time Life began releasing individual complete season sets on DVD, beginning with the first season. This was followed by the second season on January 9, 2018, and the third season on March 6, 2018. The fourth season was released on May 8, 2018. Season 5 was released on July 10, 2018. Finally, Season 6 was released on September 4, 2018.

==Revival==
In 1977, Schlatter and NBC briefly revived the property as a series of specials – titled simply &quot;Laugh-In&quot; – with a new cast. The standout was a then-unknown Robin Williams, whose starring role on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; one year later prompted NBC to rerun the specials as a summer series in 1979. Also featured were Wayland Flowers and Madame (as well as his other puppet, &quot;Jiffy&quot;), former child evangelist Marjoe Gortner, former &quot;Barney Miller&quot; actress June Gable, &quot;Good Times&quot; actor Ben Powers, Bill Rafferty of &quot;Real People&quot; and comedian Ed Bluestone. Barry Goldwater appeared in three episodes. Rowan and Martin, who owned part of the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; franchise, were not involved in this project. They sued Schlatter for using the format without their permission, and won a judgment of $4.6 million in 1980.

In 1987, George Schlatter attempted a revival of the program called &quot;George Schlatter&#x27;s Comedy Club&quot;, the weekly half-hour program that appeared in syndication through King World Productions during the 1987-1988 television season. Featuring stand-up comedy routines alongside quick comedy sketches similar to &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, the series was hosted by Schlatter himself.

In 2019, Netflix produced a special tribute to the original series entitled, &quot;Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate&quot;. Tomlin, Buzzi and Worley appeared in the special.

== Retrospective criticism==

Critics&#x27; views in retrospect, while noting that the show was groundbreaking and unique, have also indicated that it has not aged well. Various aspects of the show are now recognized as being racist in current times and other portrayals stereotyped gay people and women. 
While the show included Black actors and made occasional comments on racism, at the same time the show also featured White actors portraying Asian people in &quot;yellowface&quot; and offensive portrayals of Native Americans.
The show&#x27;s humor was generally appreciated at the time and some skits and jokes were even quite progressive; however, other aspects are often not seen as humorous in the context of modern day standards.

==International and American re-broadcasts==
* The first four seasons were broadcast on BBC2 from January 1969 to November 1971. Some episodes from seasons 1, 2 and 3 were retransmitted during late 1983 and early 1984. Early broadcasts had to be shown with a black border, as technology was not available to render the 525-line NTSC video recording as a full-screen 625-line PAL picture. This issue was fixed for later broadcasts.
* The series was broadcast on RTÉ One.
* The series originally aired on the 0-10 Network in the 1960s and 1970s. It later appeared in re-runs on the Seven Network in the early 1980s.
* CTV aired the series at the same time as the NBC run.

1983 saw the first 70 one-hour shows syndicated to broadcast stations (the pilot, first three seasons and the first four episodes of season 4). Alternate recut half-hour shows (seasons 1–5, not including the pilot) were syndicated through Lorimar Television to local stations in 1983 and later on Nick at Nite in 1987 through August 1990.

The Vivendi Universal-owned popular arts/pop culture entertainment cable network Trio started airing the show in its original one-hour form in the early 2000s; the same abbreviated 70 episode package was run.

In September 2016, digital sub-network Decades started airing the show twice a day in its original one-hour format, complete with the NBC Peacock opening and &#x27;snake&#x27; closing. The entire 6 season run was supplied by Proven Entertainment.

In 2018, the original series became available in full on Amazon Prime Video.

In 2020, the partially complete series became available on-demand on Tubi.

, four episodes air per weeknight on the Z Living channel.

<text>Chilperic I ( 539 – September 584) was the king of Neustria (or Soissons) from 561 to his death. He was one of the sons of the Frankish king Clotaire I and Queen Aregund.

==Life==
Immediately after the death of his father in 561, he endeavoured to take possession of the whole kingdom, seized the treasure amassed in the royal town of Berny and entered Paris. His brothers, however, compelled him to divide the kingdom with them, and Soissons, together with Amiens, Arras, Cambrai, Thérouanne, Tournai and Boulogne fell to Chilperic&#x27;s share. His eldest brother Charibert received Paris, the second-eldest brother Guntram received Burgundy with its capital at Orléans, and Sigebert received Austrasia. On the death of Charibert in 567, Chilperic&#x27;s estates were augmented when the brothers divided Charibert&#x27;s kingdom among themselves and agreed to share Paris and the territory around it.


Not long after his accession, however, he was at war with Sigebert, with whom he would long remain in a state of—at the very least—antipathy. This started when Sigebert marched against the Avars and defeated them possibly in Thuringia and possibly pushed them out of the Elbe. Chilperic, seeing that his brother was far from his lands, attacked Reims and took it. Soon Sigebert returned however and took Reims and marched to Soissons, where he defeated, seized the city, and imprisoned Chilperic&#x27;s eldest son, Theudebert. The war flared in 567, at the death of Charibert. Chilperic immediately invaded Sigebert&#x27;s new lands, but Sigebert defeated him. Chilperic later allied with Guntram against Sigebert (573), but Guntram changed sides due to fear of a large army Sigebert gathered past the Rhine and he crossed through Burgundy to bypass Chilperic&#x27;s strong defenses. Chilperic again lost the war.


When Sigebert married Brunhilda, daughter of the Visigothic sovereign in Spain (Athanagild), Chilperic also wished to make a brilliant marriage. He had already repudiated his first wife, Audovera, and had taken as his concubine a serving-woman called Fredegund. He accordingly dismissed Fredegund, and married Brunhilda&#x27;s sister, Galswintha. But he soon tired of his new partner, and one morning Galswintha was found strangled in her bed. A few days afterwards Chilperic married Fredegund.

This murder was the cause of more long and bloody wars, interspersed with truces, between Chilperic and Sigebert, usually ending in a status quo in Tours and Poitiers. In early December 575, Sigebert was struck down by two assassins working for Fredegund, who were clerks promised that their parents would be very wealthy as she knew this was move was very risky. At the very moment when he had Chilperic at his mercy, as he was besieged in Tournai and Rouen and Thibert, a son of Chilperic was killed near Paris while Sigebert illegally entered and seized the city. Chilperic then made war with the protector of Sigebert&#x27;s wife and son, Guntram. Chilperic got the loyalty from the nobles who&#x27;ve sided with Sigebert, took from Austrasia Tours and Poitiers and some places in Aquitaine like Saintes and the territory in Auvergene which a large battle was done against Mummol, who was serving under Guntram., and fostered discord in the kingdom of the east during the minority of Childebert II.
In 578, Chilperic sent an army to fight the Breton ruler Waroch II of the Bro-Wened along the Vilaine. The Frankish army consisted of units from the Poitou, Touraine, Anjou, Maine and Bayeux. The &quot;Baiocassenses&quot; (men from Bayeux) were Saxons and they in particular were routed by the Bretons. The armies fought for three days before Waroch submitted, did homage for Vannes, sent his son as a hostage, and agreed to pay an annual tribute. He subsequently broke his oath but Chilperic&#x27;s dominion over the Bretons was relatively secure, as evidenced by Venantius Fortunatus&#x27;s celebration of it in a poem.

Most of what is known of Chilperic comes from &quot;The History of the Franks&quot; by Gregory of Tours. Gregory detested Chilperic, calling him &quot;the Nero and Herod of his time&quot; (VI.46): he had provoked Gregory&#x27;s wrath by wresting Tours from Austrasia, seizing ecclesiastical property, and appointing as bishops counts of the palace who were not clerics. Gregory also objected to Chilperic&#x27;s attempts to teach a new doctrine of the Trinity, although some scholars dispute the extent to which Gregory disliked Chilperic.

According to Gregory of Tours, Chilperic also engaged in forced conversion of Jews.

Chilperic&#x27;s reign in Neustria saw the introduction of the Byzantine punishment of eye-gouging. Yet, he was also a man of culture: he was a musician of some talent, and he wrote verse (modelled on that of Sedulius); he attempted to reform the Frankish alphabet; and he worked to reduce the worst effects of Salic law upon women. 

In September 584, while returning from a hunting expedition at his royal villa of Chelles, Chilperic was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant. He was buried in the Saint Vincent Basilica of Paris, later incorporated in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

==Family==
Chilperic I&#x27;s first marriage was to Audovera. They had five children:

*Theudebert (killed in battle, 573)
*Merovech (killed by a servant at his request in 577),p – married the widow Brunhilda (his aunt by marriage) and became his father&#x27;s enemy
*Clovis (assassinated by Fredegund in 580)
*Basina (d. aft. 590) – a nun; led a revolt in the abbey of Poitiers
*Childesinda (died young from dysentery)

His short second marriage to Galswintha produced no children.

His concubinage and subsequent marriage to Fredegund in about 568 produced six more legitimate offspring:

*Rigunth (c. 569 – after 589), betrothed to Reccared but never married
*Chlodebert (c. 570/72 – 580), died young
*Samson (c. 573 – late 577), died young
*Dagobert (c. 579/80 – 580), died young
*Theuderic (c. 582 – 584), died young
*Chlothar II (before September 584 – 18 October 629), Chilperic&#x27;s successor in Neustria, later sole king of the Franks

==Etymology==
Chilperic&#x27;s name in Frankish meant &quot;powerful supporter&quot;, akin to German &quot;hilfreich&quot; &quot;auxiliary&quot; (cf. German &quot;Hilfe&quot; &quot;help, aid&quot; and &quot;reich&quot; &quot;rich, orig. powerful&quot;)

An operetta on the subject, &quot;Chilpéric&quot;, was created by Hervé, first performed in 1864.

<text>Chlothar I, sometime called &quot;the Old&quot; (French: le Vieux), (died December 561) also anglicised as Clotaire from the original French version, was a king of the Franks of the Merovingian dynasty and one of the four sons of Clovis I.

With his eldest brother Theuderic (c. 485 – 533/34) being the son of Clovis I and his first wife, Chlothar followed his two elder brothers Chlodomer (495–524) and Childebert I (496–558) as third surviving son of Clovis I and his second wife Queen Clotilde, lastly followed by their sister Clotilde (500–531). The name &#x27;Chlothar&#x27; means &quot;glory&quot;.

In 511, Clothar I and his three brothers Theuderic, Chlodomer and Childebert inherited their shares of their father&#x27;s kingdom. Chlothar spent most of his life in a campaign to expand his territories at the expense of his relatives and neighbouring realms in all directions.

His brothers avoided outright war by cooperating with Chlothar&#x27;s attacks on neighbouring lands in concert or by invading lands when their rulers died. The spoils were shared between the participating brothers. By the end of his life, Chlothar had managed to reunite Francia by surviving his brothers and seizing their territories after they died. But upon his own death, the Kingdom of the Franks was once again divided between his own four surviving sons. A fifth son had rebelled and was killed, along with his family.

==Customs and inheritance==
Chlothar&#x27;s father, Clovis I, had converted to Nicene Christianity, but Chlothar, like other Merovingians, did not consider that the Christian doctrine of monogamy should be expected of royalty: he had five wives, more from political expediency, for the purpose of forming alliances, than for personal motives. Although at the instigation of his queens he gave money for several new ecclesiastical edifices, he was a less than enthusiastic Christian and succeeded in introducing taxes on ecclesiastical property.

Frankish customs of the day allowed for the practice of polygamy, especially among royalty. So it was not uncommon for a king to have multiple wives and several competing heirs upon his death. This was a major deviation from the monogamy of late Roman customs, influenced by the Church. Frankish rulers followed this practice mainly to increase their influence across larger areas of land in the wake of the Roman empire&#x27;s collapse. The aim was to maintain peace and ensure the preservation of the kingdom by appeasing local leaders. In the Germanic tradition succession fell, not to sons, but to younger brothers, uncles, and cousins. But under Salic law, Clovis I instituted the custom of sons being the primary heirs in all respects. However, it was not a system of primogeniture, with the eldest son receiving the vast majority of an inheritance, rather the inheritance was split evenly between all the sons. Therefore, the greater Frankish Kingdom was often splintered into smaller sub-kingdoms.

==Marriages and children==
According to Gregory of Tours, &quot;The King Chlothar had seven sons of various women, namely: with Ingund he had Gunthar, Childeric, Charibert, Guntram, Sigebert, and a daughter named Chlothsind; of Aregund, sister of Ingund he had Chilperic; and of Chunsine he had Chram.&quot;
Chlothar&#x27;s first marriage was to Guntheuc, widow of his brother Chlodomer, sometime around 524. They had no children. His second marriage, which occurred around 532, was to Radegund, daughter of Bertachar, King of Thuringia, whom he and his brother Theuderic defeated. She was later canonized. They also had no children. His third and most successful marriage was to Ingund, by whom he had five sons and two daughters:
*Gunthar, predeceased father
*Childeric, predeceased father
*Charibert, King of Paris
*Guntram, King of Burgundy
*Sigebert, King of Austrasia
*Chlothsind, married Alboin, King of the 

Chlothar likely had an illegitimate son named Gondovald with an unnamed woman, born sometime in the late 540s or early 550s. Since Chlothar had sown children all throughout Gaul this was not unlikely. The boy was given a literary education and allowed to grow his hair long, a symbol of belonging to royalty. Although Chlothar would offer no more aid or privilege to the boy, his mother took him to the court of Childebert, who recognized him as his nephew and agreed to keep him in court.

His next marriage was to a sister of Ingund, Aregund, with whom Chlothar had a son, Chilperic, King of Soissons. His last wife was Chunsina (or Chunsine), with whom he had one son, Chram, who became his father&#x27;s enemy and predeceased him. Chlothar may have married and repudiated Waldrada.

A false genealogy found in the Brabant trophies, made in the ninth century during the reign of Charles the Bald, invents a daughter of Chlothar&#x27;s named Blithilde who supposedly married the saint and bishop Ansbert of Rouen. The Duke Arnoald, father of Arnulf of Metz, was said to have been born of this marriage, thus connecting the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties and creating the appearance that the Carolingian ruled by right of inheritance. It also linked them to the Romans by their affiliation with the senatorial family Ferreoli.

===Marriage with Guntheuc===
Chlothar married Guntheuc, Queen of Orléans and widow of Chlodomer, his brother. This union gave Chlothar access to Chlodomer&#x27;s treasury and ensured Guntheuc&#x27;s position as sole heiress to King Godegisel lands; Frankish law allowed a woman to inherit land if she had no sons.

===Marriage with Aregund===
Chlothar&#x27;s wife Ingund requested that he find a husband worthy of her sister, Aregund. Finding no one suitable, Chlothar took Aregund as one of his own wives. The year was c. 533–538. She remained his wife until the death of her sister, Ingund, in 546, after which she fell out of favor with Chlothar.

===Princess Radegund===

In 538, Radegund was brought to Soissons to marry Chlothar, as &quot;not illegitimate but legitimate queen,&quot; who could help consolidate his dominance over Thuringia.

While her title and status were necessary for Chlothar to attain authority over Thuringia, Radegund remained in simple clothing and was not treated in the customary manner of a queen. This was largely due to her Christian faith; she did not want to appear luxurious.

Radegund did not eat to excess. She insisted that much of her food be given to the poor. She spent most of her time praying and singing psalms but spent very little time with the king. Her allegiance was to God first and to Chlothar second. Chlothar became irritated and had many disputes with her.

She retired to a convent and went on to found the abbey in Poitiers St. Croix, the first nunnery in Europe. She was canonized Saint Radegund.

==Accession and campaigns==

===Accession===
Upon his father&#x27;s death on 27 November 511, he received as his share of the kingdom: the town of Soissons, which he made his capital; the cities of Laon, Noyon, Cambrai, and Maastricht; and the lower course of the river Meuse. He was very ambitious and sought to extend his domain.

Because of the rights of mothers, queens were granted a portion of their son&#x27;s kingdom. Clovis I, who had two wives, divided his kingdom into two for each of his wives, then parceled out pieces to his respective sons. The eldest, Theuderic, son of the first wife, had the benefit of receiving one half of the kingdom of Francia, Reims. Chlothar shared the second half of the kingdom with his brothers Childebert and Chlodomer. Chlothar received the northern portion, Childebert the central kingdom of Paris, and Chlodomer the southern Kingdom of Orléans. The domain inherited by Chlothar consisted of two distinct parts: one in Gaulic Belgium, corresponding to the kingdom of the Salian Franks, where he established his capital at Soissons and included the dioceses of Amiens, Arras, Saint-Quentin and Tournai; and the other in Aquitane including the dioceses of Agen, Bazas, and Périgueux.

===First Burgundian War===
In 516, Gundobad, king of Burgundy, died, and the throne passed to his son Sigismund, who converted to Catholicism. Sigismund adopted an extreme anti-Arian policy, going so far as to execute his Arian son Sigeric, who was the grandson of the Ostrogoth King Theoderic the Great. Sigismund also nearly prompted the Franks to launch an offensive against him, but he avoided a conflict by giving one of his daughters, Suavegotha, in marriage to Chlothar&#x27;s older half-brother, Theuderic I.

In 523, at the instigation of their mother, Clotilde, Chlothar, Childebert, and Chlodomer joined forces in an expedition against the Burgundians. The Burgundian army was defeated, and Sigismund was captured and executed. Sigismund&#x27;s brother Godomar replaced him on the throne, with the support of the aristocracy, and the Franks were forced to leave.

In 524, Chlothar, his brothers and Theuderic, began a new campaign, advancing to the Isère Valley. But on 25 June 524, they suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Vézeronce, and Chlodomer was killed. The Franks left Burgundy, and Godomar resumed his rule until 534.

===Thuringian conquest===
In 531, Hermanafrid, king of the Thuringians, promised to give Chlothar&#x27;s half-brother, Theuderic, part of the Kingdom of Thuringia if he would help to depose Baderic, Hermanafrid&#x27;s rival and brother. Theuderic accepted. However, having been injured after a victory, he appealed to Chlothar to continue the war. Hermanafrid died around this time, and the goal became simply to conquer Thuringia.

The alliance, along with the aid of his nephew Theudebert I, conquered Thuringia, and it became a part of the Frankish domain. During the division of the spoils, Chlothar and Theuderic argued fiercely over the hand of Princess Radegund, but eventually Chlothar won the dispute on the grounds that it had been his men who had captured her.

===Acquisition of the kingdom of Orléans===

Chlothar was the chief instigator in the murder of his brother Chlodomer&#x27;s children in 524, and his share of the spoils consisted of the cities of Tours and Poitiers. Chlothar&#x27;s brother, Chlodomer was killed on 25 June 524 during an expedition against the Burgundians at the Battle of Vezeronce. Upon Chlodomer&#x27;s death, his three sons, Theodebald, Gunther, and Clodoald, were entrusted to care of their grandmother, hence the young princes were raised in Paris by Chlodomer&#x27;s mother, Chlotilde.

To prevent the kingdom of Orleans from returning to his nephews, Chlothar joined with his brother Childebert in 532 to threaten the young heirs with death unless they agreed to join a monastery. They sent Arcadius, grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris, to their mother, Clotilde, with a pair of scissors and a sword. He gave the queen an ultimatum: the boys could either live as monks or die.

Germanic traditions gave Queen Clotilde, as the mother, the right as head of her household. However, among kings the lineage passed to younger brothers before it passed to the next generation. Due to tribal politics, shearing of the boys&#x27; hair could lead to a civil war; long hair was a symbol of Frankish royalty, and to remove it was considered a grave insult. But Theodebald, Gunthar, and Clodoald could someday lay claim to the throne, and it was Chlothar and Childebert&#x27;s duty to pass authority on to them.

Clotilde was disgusted and shocked at the demands relayed by Arcadius and stated that she would rather see her grandsons dead than see their hair shorn.
The two uncles went through with their plan to murder the children. Chlothar stabbed Theodebald in the armpit. Gunthar threw himself at the feet of Childebert, who began to cry and almost gave in to the pleas of his nephew. Chlothar, however, demanded that Childebert carry through with the murder, stating that it was the only way to consolidate power. Childebert gave Gunthar up to Chlothar, who stabbed him. Theodebald and Gunthar were ten and seven years old respectively.

Clodoald remained alive by managing to escape, hidden by loyal supporters. He renounced all claims and chose a monastic life. Childebert and Chlothar could then freely share their acquired territory. Meanwhile, Theuderic captured a parcel consisting of Auxerrois, Berry and Sens.

===Second Burgundian war===
In 532, Childebert and Chlothar seized Autun. They hunted for Godomar III, brother of Sigismund, with the help of his father and ally, the king of the Ostrogoths Theoderic the Great.

The death of Athalaric, the grandson and successor of Theodoric the Great, in 534, generated a succession crisis in the Ostrogothic kingdom, the Burgundian ally. Chlothar, Theudebert, and Childebert took the opportunity to invade the Burgundian kingdom, now devoid of Ostrogothic protection. The Burgundian kingdom was overtaken and divided between the three Frankish rulers. Chlothar received Grenoble, Die and many of the neighbouring cities.

===First Visigoth war===

Over the years, the Spanish Visigoths had made many incursions into Frankish territories and had taken lands. Clovis had reconquered them and even made further conquests of Gothic territories. Chlothar sent his eldest sons to reclaim lost territories. Although there was some success, for some unknown reason Gunthar, his second eldest, ended his campaign and returned home. Theudebert, the eldest, continued the war and took the strongholds of Dio-et-Valquières and Cabrières. Most of the lost Frankish lands were recovered.

===Civil war===
Chlothar attempted to take advantage of Theuderic&#x27;s illness during this time, trying to attain his kingdom with the help of Childebert. However Theudebert, who was busy securing Arles, rushed back to his father Theuderic&#x27;s aid. Theuderic died a few days later. And Theudebert, supported by his vassals, managed to keep his kingdom and restrained his uncles from taking over.

Childebert and Theudebert joined forces and declared war on Chlothar. They initially defeated him, forcing him to take refuge in a forest for protection against the alliance. While Chlothar was besieged, a storm ravaged equipment, roads, and horses and disorganized the allied army. Childebert and Theudebert were forced to abandon the siege and make peace with Chlothar.

===Ceding of Provence===
In 537, a conflict broke out between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogothic kingdom. To ensure Frankish neutrality in the conflict, King Vitiges offered Provence, which the Frankish Kings shared between them, along with the northern Alps with sovereignty over the Alemanni, by grabbing the upper Rhine valley, Main, and high Danube. When the Ostrogoths ceded Provence to the Franks, he received the cities of Orange, Carpentras, and Gap.

===Second Visigoth war===
In spring 542, Childebert and Chlothar, accompanied by three of his sons, led an army into Visigoth Hispania. They seized Pamplona and Zaragoza but were finally forced to abandon after conquering most of the country. Since most of the king&#x27;s army was still with Theudis and there was still enough power to be shown, they were ceded some major lands beyond the Pyrénées, although not as much as they had occupied.

===Tuscan tribute===
The murder of Amalasuntha, the daughter of Theodoric the Great, and of Audofleda, sister of Clovis I, at the hands of King Theodahad of Tuscany caused Chlothar to threaten invasion if he did not receive a payment. The agreement that averted the war was for the Tuscan king to offer gold and land. However, Childebert and Theudebert cheated Chlothar, Childebert taking the money and Theudebert the land that Theodahad&#x27;s successor, Vitiges turned over. Chlothar&#x27;s treasury was still much larger than either Childebert&#x27;s or Theudebert&#x27;s.

===Acquisition of Metz===
Theudebald, Chlothar&#x27;s great-nephew and the grandson of the late Theuderic, died childless in 555. So Chlothar immediately went to Metz to take possession of the kingdom from his late nephew, but under Salic Law he had to share it with his brother. So he married Waldrada, Theudebald&#x27;s widow and the daughter of the Lombard king Wacho. This ensured the smooth succession to the kingdom of Metz, as well as an alliance with the Lombards, established since the reign of Theudebert. But the bishops condemned this incestuous marriage and forced Chlothar to divorce her. They gave her in marriage to the Bavarian Duke Garibald. To compensate for the breakdown of the marriage with Vuldetrade (Waldrada), Chlothar gave Chlothsind, his daughter, to the Lombard prince and future king, Alboin. Condat the Domesticus, great administrator of the palace of King Theudebald, retained his position after the annexation of the kingdom of Metz.

===Saxon war===
In 555, Chlothar attacked and conquered the Saxons, who had revolted, in the upper valley of the Weser, Elbe, and the coast of the North Sea. As a submission, Chlothar required them to pay a substantial annual tribute and for some time exacted from the Saxons an annual tribute of 500 cows.

Between 555 and 556, the Saxons revolted again, perhaps instigated by Childebert. Faced with the Saxon revolt and threat of a massacre, Chlothar preferred peace talks. He offered to forego battle if they would accept his demand to continue to pay him tribute, despite a previous rejection. But his men, aggressive, eager for battle, contested the decision. Talks were cut short when the soldiers forced him, with insults and death threats, to take on the Saxons. After an incredibly bloody battle, the Saxons and Franks made peace.

===Submission of Auvergne===
Auvergne, a once prosperous Roman province, which had resisted the Visigoths and Franks, had hoped they could avoid destruction by offering their loyalty. Theuderic had devastated much of the land, and Theudebert pacified the land by marrying a Gallo-Roman woman of Senatorial descent. In anticipation of the death of Theodebald, Chlothar sent his son Chram to take possession of the area. In time, Chram came to control a larger area and desired to break away from his father entirely. To achieve this, he joined politically with Childebert who encouraged his dissent. In time his influence was expanded over Poitiers, Tours, Limoges, Clermont, Bourges, Le Puy, Javols, Rodez, Cahors, Albi, and Toulouse.

===War with Chram===
Chlothar again engaged in war with the Saxons. He sent his sons Charibert and Guntram to lead an army against Chram. They marched to Auvergne and Limoges and finally found Chram in Saint-Georges-Nigremont. Their armies met at the foot of a &quot;black mountain&quot; where they demanded that Chram relinquish land belonging to their father. He refused, but a storm prevented the battle. Chram sent a messenger to his half-brothers, falsely informing them of the death of Chlothar at the hand of the Saxons. Charibert and Guntram immediately marched to Burgundy. The rumor that Chlothar had died in Saxony spread throughout Gaul, even reaching the ears of Childebert. It is possible that Childebert was behind the rumor as well. Chram then took the opportunity to extend his influence to Chalon-sur-Saône. He besieged the city and won. Chram married Chalda, daughter of Wiliachaire (Willacharius), Count of Orléans, which was under Childebert&#x27;s authority.

===Unification of all Francia===

On 23 December 558, Childebert died childless after a long illness. This allowed Chlothar to reunite the Greater Frankish Kingdom, as his father Clovis had done, and seize the treasure of his brother.

The news of Childebert&#x27;s death had caused many kingdoms to unify under Chlothar. Paris, which had fought against him, submitted to his rule. Chram therefore called on the Bretons to allow him refuge. He had made such an agreement with his father-in-law Willacharius, Count of Orléans, although he was currently taking refuge himself in the Basilica of St. Martin of Tours. Chram was caught and subsequently burned &quot;for the sins of the people and the scandals that were perpetrated by Wiliachaire and his wife.&quot; Chlothar then restored the Basilica.

Between 1 September and 31 August 559, with the help of the Bretons, Chram plundered and destroyed a large number of places belonging to his father. Chlothar, accompanied by his son Chilperic, advanced to Domnonée and arrived there in November or December of 560. During the battle, located near the coast, Conomor was defeated and killed when he attempted to flee. Conomor owned land on both sides of the Channel, and Chram perhaps intended to flee from Chlothar to take refuge in England with the support of Conomor. Chram fled for the sea, but first attempted to rescue his wife and daughters. He was then captured and immediately sentenced to death. He and his wife and daughters were locked in a shack and were strangled and burned. Overwhelmed with remorse, Clothar went to Tours to implore forgiveness at the tomb of St Martin and died shortly afterwards at the royal palace at Compiègne.

== Relations with the church ==
In 561, Chlothar attempted to raise taxes on churches, despite the exemption granted by Roman law which had been routinely confirmed by past kings. Indeed, Childeric I had granted immunities to ecclesiastics. The Bishop of Tours, Injuriosus refused, left his diocese, and abandoned Chlothar. At the death of the bishop, the king replaced him with a member of his household named Baudin. Similarly, Chlothar exiled the bishop of Trier, Nizier, because of its inflexibility on canon law. Thus the tax on churches held.

Ingund and Chlothar made many additions to churches, including the decorations of the tomb of Saint-Germain Auxerre; the basilica are preserved with a given royal chalice.

=== Female monasticism ===
Chlothar financed the construction of the monastery of Sainte-Croix in Poitiers, which folds Radegund. He transferred reliquaries that the queen had accumulated during her stay with the king to the monastery of St. Croix.

==Death==
At the end of his reign, the Frankish kingdom was at its peak, covering the whole of Gaul (except Septimania) and part of present-day Germany. Chlothar died at the end of 561 of acute pneumonia at the age of 64, leaving his kingdom to his four sons. They went to bury him at Soissons in the Basilica of St. Marie, where he had started to build the tomb of St. Médard.

== Succession ==

<text>Pär Fabian Lagerkvist (23 May 1891 – 11 July 1974) was a Swedish author who received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Lagerkvist wrote poetry, plays, novels, short stories, and essays of considerable expressive power and influence from his early 20s to his late 70s. One of his central themes was the fundamental question of good and evil, which he examined through such figures as Barabbas, the man who was freed instead of Jesus, and Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew. As a moralist, he used religious motifs and figures from the Christian tradition without following the doctrines of a church.

==Biography and works==
Lagerkvist was born in Växjö (Småland). He received a traditional religious education – he would later say, with little exaggeration, that he &quot;had had the good fortune to grow up in a home where the only books known were the Bible and the Book of Hymns&quot;. In his teens he broke away from Christian beliefs, but, unlike many other writers and thinkers in his generation, he did not become vehemently critical of religious beliefs as such. Though he was politically a socialist for most of his life, he never indulged in the idea that &quot;religion is the opium of the people&quot;. Much of his writing is informed by a lifelong interest in man and his symbols and gods, and in the position of Man (both as individual and mankind) in a world where the Divine is no longer present, no longer speaking.

In his early years Lagerkvist supported modernist and aesthetically radical views, as shown by his manifesto &quot;Ordkonst och bildkonst&quot; (&quot;Word Art and Picture Art&quot;, 1913) and the play &quot;Den Svåra Stunden&quot; (&quot;The Difficult Hour&quot;).

One of the author&#x27;s earliest works is &quot;Ångest&quot; (&quot;Anguish&quot;, 1916), a violent and disillusioned collection of poems. His anguish was derived from his fear of death, the World War, and personal crisis. He tried to explore how a person can find a meaningful life in a world where a war can kill millions for very little reason. &quot;Anguish, anguish is my heritage / the wound of my throat / the cry of my heart in the world.&quot; (&quot;Anguish&quot;, 1916.) &quot;Love is nothing. Anguish is everything / the anguish of living.&quot; (&quot;Love is nothing&quot;, 1916.) This pessimism, however, slowly faded, as testified by his subsequent works, &quot;Det eviga leendet&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Smile&quot;, 1920), the autobiographical novel &quot;Gäst hos verkligheten&quot; (&quot;Guest of Reality&quot;, 1925) and the prose monologue &quot;Det besegrade livet&quot; (&quot;The defeated Life&quot;, 1927), in which the faith in man is predominant. From &quot;The Eternal Smile&quot; on, his style largely abandoned the expressionist pathos and brusque effects of his early works and there was a strong striving for simplicity, classical precision and clean telling, sometimes appearing close to naivism. The content, however, was never truly naive. A Swedish critic remarked that &quot;Lagerkvist and John the Evangelist are two masters at expressing profound things with a highly restricted choice of words&quot;. 

Ten years after &quot;Ångest&quot;, Lagerkvist married for the second time, a union which was to provide a pillar of safety in his life until the death of his wife forty years later. &quot;Hjärtats sånger&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Heart&quot;) (1926) appeared at this time, bearing witness to his pride and love for his consort. This collection is much less desperate in its tone than &quot;Ångest&quot;, and established him as one of the foremost Swedish poets of his generation. 

His prose novella &quot;Bödeln&quot; (&quot;The Hangman&quot;, 1933), later adapted for the stage (&quot;The Hangman&quot;, 1933; play, 1934), shows his growing concern with the totalitarianism and brutality that began to sweep across Europe in the years prior to World War II. Nazism was one of the main targets of the work and &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; responded with a very dismissive review. Criticism against Fascism is also present in the play &quot;Mannen utan själ&quot; (&quot;The Man Without a Soul&quot;, 1936).

In September 1940 Lagerkvist was elected a member of the Swedish Academy, succeeding Verner von Heidenstam on chair 8 in December the same year.

Lagerkvist&#x27;s 1944 novel &quot;Dvärgen&quot; (&quot;The Dwarf&quot;), a searching, ironic tale about evil, was the first to bring him positive international attention outside of the Nordic countries. The work was followed in 1949 by the unusual, lyrical play &quot;Låt människan leva&quot; (&quot;Let Man Live&quot;).

&quot;Barabbas&quot; (1950), which was immediately hailed as a literary masterpiece (by fellow Nobel laureate André Gide, among others) is probably Lagerkvist&#x27;s most famous work. The novel is based on a Biblical story. Jesus of Nazareth was sentenced to die by the Roman authorities immediately before the Jewish Passover, when it was customary for the Romans to release someone convicted of a capital offense. When the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate offers to free either Jesus or Barabbas (a convicted thief and murderer), a Jerusalem mob demands the release of Barabbas, who later watches Jesus as he bears the cross to Golgotha, witnesses the crucifixion, and then spends the rest of his life trying to understand why he was chosen to live rather than Jesus. A movie based upon the novel was filmed in 1961, with Anthony Quinn playing the title role.

In 1951 Pär Lagerkvist was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the artistic vigour and true independence of mind with which he endeavours in his poetry to find answers to the eternal questions confronting mankind.&quot;. He had first been proposed for the prize in 1947. Following the publication of &quot;Barabbas&quot;, Lagerkvist had been one of the favourites to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950. In 1951 the Nobel committee for literature received nine nominations for Lagerkvist, including nominations from the French authors and previous laureates André Gide and Roger Martin du Gard, and the Swedish Academy decided to award him the prize.

Lagerkvist died in Stockholm in 1974 at the age of 83, his wife having died in 1967.

<doc id="105999" wikidata="Q309922" url="?curid=105999" title="Chlothar III">
<text>Chlothar III (also spelled &quot;Chlotar&quot;, &quot;Clothar&quot;, &quot;Clotaire&quot;, &quot;Chlotochar&quot;, or &quot;Hlothar&quot;; 652–673) was King of the Franks, ruling in
Neustria and Burgundy from 657 to his death. He also briefly ruled Austrasia.

He was the eldest son of King Clovis II, and his queen Balthild and succeeded his father under the regency of his mother. Only a month beforehand, according to the near-contemporary &quot;Life of Eligius&quot; by the courtier Audoin (bishop) of Rouen, Saint Eligius had prophesied the death of Clovis, Balthild&#x27;s downfall, and Chlothar&#x27;s short reign.

Few things are known about the time of Chlothar&#x27;s reign. The &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; reports that in the early 660s a Frankish army invaded Provence and then Italy. This force came upon the camp of the Lombard king Grimoald I of Benevento, at Rivoli near Asta. Grimuald pretended to flee. The Franks looted the camp and celebrated. Then, after midnight, Grimuald attacked and drove them back to Neustria.

After the death of Saint Eligius in 661, the &quot;Life of Eligius&quot; records that a plague reduced the population of France&#x27;s cities. A plague in the British Isles, according to Bede, did the same there in 664.

During the regency, Austrasians requested a king of their own and, in 662, Chlothar&#x27;s court sent another son of Clovis II, Childeric II, to be king there.

Also during his reign, the mayor of the palace Erchinoald died and a council of Franks elected Ebroin to replace him. Ebroin&#x27;s early administrative authority was significant: Bede tells the story of how, in 668, the newly appointed Theodore of Canterbury could only travel through the Frankish kingdoms from Rome with the mayor&#x27;s permission. Chlothar may have been more politically active after this time, as he reached the age of majority in 669. The nearest contemporary chronicle, the Liber Historiae Francorum of 727, relates only that he ruled for four years (presumably a reference to his active years 669–673) and then died. He is confirmed as still being in the sixteenth year of his reign in a chronological note in a Victorian Easter table of 673. His brother Theuderic III succeeded him as king later that same year.

<doc id="106000" wikidata="Q234640" url="?curid=106000" title="Clara Bow">
<text>Clara Gordon Bow (; July 29, 1905 – September 27, 1965) was an American actress who rose to stardom during the silent film era of the 1920s and successfully made the transition to &quot;talkies&quot; in 1929. Her appearance as a plucky shopgirl in the film &quot;It&quot; brought her global fame and the nickname &quot;The It Girl&quot;. Bow came to personify the Roaring Twenties and is described as its leading sex symbol.

Bow appeared in 46 silent films and 11 talkies, including hits such as &quot;Mantrap&quot; (1926), &quot;It&quot; (1927), and &quot;Wings&quot; (1927). She was named first box-office draw in 1928 and 1929 and second box-office draw in 1927 and 1930. Her presence in a motion picture was said to have ensured investors, by odds of almost two-to-one, a &quot;safe return&quot;. At the apex of her stardom, she received more than 45,000 fan letters in a single month, in January 1929.

Two years after marrying actor Rex Bell in 1931, Bow retired from acting and became a rancher in Nevada. Her final film, &quot;Hoop-La&quot;, was released in 1933. In September 1965, Bow died of a heart attack at the age of 60.

==Early life==
Bow was born in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, at 697 Bergen Street, in a &quot;bleak, sparsely furnished room above [a] dilapidated Baptist Church&quot;. Her birth year, according to the US Censuses of 1910 and 1920, was 1905. In US census records, enumerated April 15, 1910, and January 7, 1920, Bow&#x27;s age is stated 4 and 14 years, respectively. The 1930 census stated an age of 23, and on her gravestone of 1965, the inscription says 1907, but 1905 is the year accepted by a majority of sources.

Bow was her parents&#x27; third child. Her two older sisters, born in 1903 and 1904, had died in infancy. Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become pregnant again, for fear the next baby might die as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around . Years later, Clara wrote: &quot;I don&#x27;t suppose two people ever looked death in the face more clearly than my mother and I the morning I was born. We were both given up, but somehow we struggled back to life.&quot;

Bow&#x27;s parents were descended from English and Scots-Irish immigrants who had come to America the generation before. Bow said that her father, Robert Walter Bow (1874–1959), &quot;had a quick, keen mind... all the natural qualifications to make something of himself, but didn&#x27;t... everything seemed to go wrong for him, poor darling&quot;. By the time Clara was four and a half, her father was out of work. Between 1905 and 1923, the family lived at 14 different addresses, but seldom outside Prospect Heights, with Clara&#x27;s father often absent. &quot;I do not think my mother ever loved my father&quot;, she said. &quot;He knew it. And it made him very unhappy, for he worshipped her always.&quot;

When Bow&#x27;s mother was 16, she fell from a second-story window and suffered a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with &quot;psychosis due to epilepsy&quot;. From her earliest years, Bow had learned how to care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be &quot;mean to me—and she often was&quot;, but &quot;she didn&#x27;t mean to be and that it was because she couldn&#x27;t help it&quot;. Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; &quot;As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn&#x27;t take care of me&quot;. 

Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow&#x27;s mother told her she &quot;would be much better off dead&quot;. One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother in her room. In the morning, Bow&#x27;s mother had no recollection of the episode. Later, she was committed to a &quot;sanatarium&quot; by Robert Bow.

Clara spoke about the incident later:

According to Bow&#x27;s biographer, David Stenn, Bow was raped by her father at age sixteen while her mother was institutionalized. On January 5, 1923, Sarah died at the age of 43 from her epilepsy. When relatives gathered for the funeral, Bow was so upset that she &quot;went crazy&quot; and tried to jump into the grave to be with her, shouting that they were &quot;hypocrites&quot; and that they hadn&#x27;t loved or cared for her mother while she was alive.

Bow attended P.S. 111, P.S. 9, and P.S. 98. &quot;P.S.&quot; stands for &quot;Public School&quot; in New York City. As she grew up, she felt shy among other girls, who teased her for her worn-out clothes and &quot;carrot-top&quot; hair. She said about her childhood, &quot;I never had any clothes. ... And lots of time didn&#x27;t have anything to eat. We just lived, that&#x27;s about all. Girls shunned me because I was so poorly dressed.&quot;

From first grade, Bow preferred the company of boys, stating, &quot;I could lick any boy my size. My right arm was quite famous. My right arm was developed from pitching so much ... Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I got a lot of credit from the gang for that.&quot; A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death, something that haunted her. She heard his screams and ran to his aid, rolling him up in carpet to stop the fire, but he died in her arms. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. &quot;I wore sweaters and old skirts ... didn&#x27;t want to be treated like a girl&quot;. Her mother had a long spell of good health, and changed Bow&#x27;s appearance, cutting her hair more femininely. Bow said that &quot;there was one boy who had always been my pal ... he kissed me ... I wasn&#x27;t sore. I didn&#x27;t get indignant. I was horrified and hurt ... I knew I could never go back to being a tomboy.&quot;

Bow&#x27;s interest in sports and her physical abilities led her to plan for a career as an athletics instructor. She won five medals at the &quot;cinder tracks&quot; and credited her cousin Homer Baker—the national half-mile ( 800 m) champion in 1913 and 1914 and 660-yard ( m) world-record holder—for being her trainer. The Bows and Bakers shared a house—still standing—at 33 Prospect Place in 1920.

==Career==
===1921-1922: Early years===
In the early 1920s roughly 50 million Americans—half the population at that time—attended the movies every week. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a &quot;boy&quot; in her old gang became &quot;impossible&quot;. She did not have any girlfriends, and school was a &quot;heartache&quot; and her home was &quot;miserable&quot;. On the silver screen she found consolation; &quot;For the first time in my life I knew there was beauty in the world. For the first time I saw distant lands, serene, lovely homes, romance, nobility, glamor&quot;. And further; &quot;I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen ... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn&#x27;t analyze it, but I could always feel it&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;d go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I&#x27;d seen, living them before the glass.&quot; At 16, Bow says she &quot;knew&quot; she wanted to be a motion pictures actress, even if she was a &quot;square, awkward, funny-faced kid.&quot;

Against her mother&#x27;s wishes but with her father&#x27;s support, Bow competed in Brewster publications&#x27; magazine&#x27;s annual nationwide acting contest, &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot;, in fall 1921. In previous years, other contest winners had found work in the movies. In the contest&#x27;s final screen test, Bow was up against an already scene-experienced woman who did &quot;a beautiful piece of acting&quot;. A set member later stated that when Bow did the scene, she actually became her character and &quot;lived it&quot;. In the January issues 1922 of &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot;, the contest jury, Howard Chandler Christy, Neysa McMein, and Harrison Fisher, concluded:

Bow won an evening gown and a silver trophy, and the publisher committed to help her &quot;gain a role in films&quot;, but nothing happened. Bow&#x27;s father told her to &quot;haunt&quot; Brewster&#x27;s office, located in Brooklyn, until they came up with something. &quot;To get rid of me, or maybe they really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy&quot;, Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in &quot;Beyond the Rainbow&quot;, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with her ability to produce tears on cue, but was cut from the final print. &quot;I was sick to my stomach&quot;, she recalled and thought her mother was right about the movie business.

Bow dropped out of school in her senior year, after she was notified about winning the &quot;Fame and Fortune Contest&quot;, possibly in October 1921, and got an ordinary office job. However, movie ads and newspaper editorial comments from 1922 to 1923 suggest that Bow was not cut from &quot;Beyond the Rainbow&quot;. .

===1922-1924: Early silent films===
Encouraged by her father, Bow continued to visit studio agencies asking for parts. &quot;But there was always something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat.&quot; Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot;, saw Bow in &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot; magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she &quot;sneaked&quot; from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was the girl in the magazine. Clifton decided to take Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would &quot;fit the part&quot;. Bow later learned that one of Brewsters&#x27; subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.

&quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot;, shot on location in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and produced by independent &quot;The Whaling Film Corporation&quot;, documented life, love, and work in the whale-hunter community. The production relied on a few less-known actors and local talents. It premiered at the Olympia Theater in New Bedford, on September 25, 1922, and went on general distribution on March 4, 1923. Bow was billed 10th in the film, but shone through:
* &quot;Miss Bow will undoubtedly gain fame as a screen comedienne&quot;.
* &quot;Clara Bow who has reached the front rank of motion picture principal player ... [has] scored a tremendous hit in &quot;Down To The Sea In Ships&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;With her beauty, her brains, her personality and her genuine acting ability it should not be many moons before she enjoys stardom in the fullest sense of the word. You must see &#x27;Down to the Sea in Ships&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;In movie parlance, she &#x27;stole&#x27; the picture ...&quot;


By mid-December 1923, primarily due to her merits in &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot;, Bow was chosen the most successful of the 1924 WAMPAS Baby Stars. Three months before &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; was released, Bow danced on a table, uncredited in &quot;Enemies of Women&quot; (1923). During the year she made a short film, &quot;The Pill Pounder&quot; (1923). In spring Bow got a part in &quot;The Daring Years (1923)&quot;, where she befriended actress Mary Carr, who taught her how to use make-up. In the summer, she got a &quot;tomboy&quot; part in &quot;Grit&quot;, a story that dealt with juvenile crime and was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Bow met her first boyfriend, cameraman Arthur Jacobson, and she got to know director Frank Tuttle, with whom she worked in five later productions. Tuttle remembered:

&quot;Grit&quot; was released on January 7, 1924. The &quot;Variety&quot; review said, &quot;Clara Bow lingers in the eye, long after the picture has gone.&quot; While shooting &quot;Grit&quot; at Pyramid Studios, in Astoria, New York, Bow was approached by Jack Bachman of independent Hollywood studio Preferred Pictures. He wanted to contract her for a three-month trial, fare paid, and $50 a week. &quot;It can&#x27;t do any harm,&quot; he said. &quot;Why can&#x27;t I stay in New York and make movies?&quot; Bow asked her father, but he told her not to worry. On July 21, 1923, she befriended Louella Parsons, who interviewed her for the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot;. In 1931, when Bow came under tabloid scrutiny, Parsons defended her and stuck to her first opinion on Bow:

The interview also revealed that Bow already was cast in &quot;Maytime&quot; and liked chop suey restaurants.

===1923-1925: Preferred Pictures===
On July 22, 1923, Bow left New York, her father, and her boyfriend behind for Hollywood. As chaperone for the journey and her subsequent southern California stay, the studio appointed writer/agent Maxine Alton, whom Bow later branded a liar. In late July, Bow entered studio chief B. P. Schulberg&#x27;s office wearing a simple high-school uniform in which she &quot;had won several gold medals on the cinder track&quot;. She was tested and a press release from early August says Bow had become a member of Preferred Pictures&#x27; &quot;permanent stock&quot;. 

Bow signed with Preferred Pictures, also working with other studios. Alton and Bow rented an apartment at The Hillview near Hollywood Boulevard. Preferred Pictures was run by Schulberg, who had started as a publicity manager at Famous Players–Lasky, but in the aftermath of the power struggle around the formation of United Artists, ended up on the losing side and lost his job. He founded Preferred in 1919 as a result, at the age of 27.

&quot;Maytime&quot; was Bow&#x27;s first Hollywood picture, an adaptation of the popular operetta &quot;Maytime&quot;, in which she essayed &quot;Alice Tremaine&quot;. Before the film was finished, Schulberg announced that Bow was given the lead in the studio&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Poisoned Paradise&quot;. But first she was lent to First National Pictures to co-star in the adaptation of Gertrude Atherton&#x27;s 1923 best seller &quot;Black Oxen&quot;, shot in October, and to co-star with Colleen Moore in &quot;Painted People&quot;, shot in November. Director Frank Lloyd was casting for the part of high-society flapper Janet Oglethorpe, and more than 50 women auditioned, most with previous screen experience. Bow reminisced: &quot;but he had not found exactly what he wanted and finally somebody suggested me to him ... When I came into his office a big smile came over his face and he looked just tickled to death.&quot; Lloyd told the press, &quot;Bow is the personification of the ideal aristocratic flapper, mischievous, pretty, aggressive, quick-tempered and deeply sentimental.&quot; It was released on January 4, 1924.

&quot;The flapper, impersonated by a young actress, Clara Bow, ... had five speaking titles, and every one of them was so entirely in accord with the character and the mood of the scene that it drew a laugh from what, in film circles, is termed a &#x27;hard-boiled&#x27; audience.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that &quot;Clara Bow, the prize vulgarian of the lot. She was amusing and spirited but she never belonged in the picture&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;the horrid little flapper is adorably played&quot;.

Colleen Moore made her flapper debut in a successful adaptation of the daring novel &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;, released November 12, 1923, six weeks before &quot;Black Oxen&quot;. Both films were produced by First National Pictures, and while &quot;Black Oxen&quot; was still being edited and &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; not yet released, Bow was requested to co-star with Moore as her kid sister in &quot;Painted People&quot; (&quot;The Swamp Angel&quot;). Moore essayed the baseball-playing tomboy and Bow, according to Moore, said &quot;I don&#x27;t like my part, I wanna play yours.&quot; 

Moore, a well-established star earning $1200 a week—Bow got $200—took offense and blocked the director from shooting close-ups of Bow. Moore was married to the film&#x27;s producer and Bow&#x27;s protests were futile. &quot;I&#x27;ll get that bitch&quot;, she told her boyfriend Jacobson, who had arrived from New York. Bow had sinus problems and decided to have them attended to that very evening. With Bow&#x27;s face now in bandages, the studio had no choice but to recast her part.

In May, Moore renewed her efforts in &quot;The Perfect Flapper&quot;, produced by her husband. Despite good reviews she suddenly withdrew. &quot;No more flappers ... they have served their purpose ... people are tired of soda-pop love affairs&quot;, she told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which had commented a month earlier, &quot;Clara Bow is the one outstanding type. She has almost immediately been elected for all the recent flapper parts&quot;. In November 1933, looking back to this period of her career, Bow described the atmosphere in Hollywood as like a scene from a movie about the French Revolution, where &quot;women are hollering and waving pitchforks twice as violently as any of the guys ... the only ladies in sight are the ones getting their heads cut off.&quot;

By New Year 1924 Bow had defied the possessive and brought her father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: &quot;I didn&#x27;t care a rap, for (her), nor B. P. Schulberg, nor my motion picture career, nor Clara Bow, I just threw myself into his arms and kissed and kissed him, and we both cried like a couple of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful.&quot; Bow felt &quot;Mrs Smith&quot;, the pseudonym Alton used, had misused her trust: &quot;She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn&#x27;t getting over and that nothing but her clever management kept me going.&quot; 

Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting &quot;his big star&quot; into a scandal. When Bow found out, &quot;She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn&#x27;t run her private life.&quot; Jacobson concluded, &quot;[Clara] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn&#x27;t cross her and you didn&#x27;t do her wrong.&quot; On September 7, 1924, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, in a significant article &quot;A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, but oh, how she can act!&quot;, her father is titled &quot;business manager&quot; and Jacobson referred to as her brother.
Bow appeared in eight releases in 1924, two were released the same day. In &quot;Poisoned Paradise&quot;, released on February 29, 1924, Bow got her first lead; &quot;the clever little newcomer whose work wins fresh recommendations with every new picture in which she appears&quot;. Atypical of that time, her character, &quot;skilled in the art of self-defense, preparedness and all the other devices with which the modern flapper is endowed,&quot; fearlessly beats off the villain. In &quot;Daughters of Pleasure&quot;, also released on February 29, 1924, Bow and Marie Prevost &quot;flapped unhampered as flappers De luxe ... I wish somebody could star Clara Bow. I&#x27;m sure her &#x27;infinite variety&#x27; would keep her from wearying us no matter how many scenes she was in.&quot; 

Lent out to Universal, Bow top-starred, for the first time, in the prohibition, bootleg drama/comedy &quot;Wine&quot;, released on August 20, 1924. The picture exposes the widespread liquor traffic in the upper classes, and Bow portrays an innocent girl who develops into a wild &quot;red-hot mama&quot;, &quot;a naughty, inebriated flapper&quot;. Carl Sandburg reviewed it on September 29 saying; &quot;If not taken as information, it is cracking good entertainment&quot;. Alma Whitaker of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; observed on September 7, 1924:

Bow remembered: &quot;All this time I was &#x27;running wild&#x27;, I guess, in the sense of trying to have a good time ... maybe this was a good thing, because I suppose a lot of that excitement, that joy of life, got onto the screen.&quot; In 1925, Bow appeared in 14 productions: six for her contract owner, Preferred Pictures, and eight as an &quot;out-loan&quot;. &quot;Motion Picture Classic&quot; magazine wrote in June that &quot;Clara Bow ... shows alarming symptoms of becoming the sensation of the year&quot;, and featured her on the cover.

Preferred Pictures loaned Bow to producers &quot;for sums ranging from $1500 to $2000 a week&quot; while paying Bow a salary of $200 to $750 a week. The studio, like any other independent studio or theater at that time, was under attack from &quot;The Big Three&quot;, MPAA, which had formed a trust to block out Independents and enforce the monopolistic studio system. On October 21, 1925, Schulberg filed Preferred Pictures for bankruptcy, with debts at $820,774 and assets $1,420.

Three days later it was announced that Schulberg would join with Adolph Zukor to become associate producer of Paramount Pictures, &quot;catapulted into this position because he had Clara Bow under personal contract&quot;.

Adolph Zukor, Paramount Picture CEO, wrote in his memoirs: &quot;All the skill of directors and all the booming of press-agent drums will not make a star. Only the audiences can do it. We study audience reactions with great care.&quot; Adela Rogers St. Johns had a different take. In 1950, she wrote, &quot;If ever a star was made by public demand, it was Clara Bow.&quot; Louise Brooks in 1980 stated: &quot;[Bow] became a star without nobody&#x27;s help&quot;.

&quot;The Plastic Age&quot; was Bow&#x27;s final effort for Preferred Pictures and her biggest hit up to that time. Bow starred as the good-bad college girl, Cynthia Day, against Donald Keith. It was shot on location at Pomona College in the summer of 1925, and released on December 15. Due to block booking, it was not shown in New York until July 21, 1926. &quot;Photoplay&quot; was displeased: &quot;The college atmosphere is implausible and Clara Bow is not our idea of a college girl.&quot; Theater owners were happy, the manager of The Liberty Theater saying that &quot;The picture is the biggest sensation we ever had in our theater ... It is 100 per cent at the box-office.&quot; Some critics felt Bow had conquered new territory, &quot;[Bow] presents a whimsical touch to her work that adds greater laurels to her fast ascending star of screen popularity.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; singled out Bow, complimenting her on saving the picture as, &quot;Only the amusing and facile acting of Clara Bow rescues the picture from the limbo of the impossible.&quot;

Bow began to date her co-star Gilbert Roland, who became her first fiancé. In June 1925, Bow was credited for being the first to wear hand-painted legs in public, and was reported to have many followers at the Californian beaches. Throughout the 1920s, Bow played with gender conventions and sexuality in her public image. Along with her tomboy and flapper roles, she starred in boxing films and posed for promotional photographs as a boxer. By appropriating traditionally androgynous or masculine traits, Bow presented herself as a confident, modern woman.

===1925-1928: Paramount Pictures===
&quot;Rehearsals sap my pep&quot;, Bow explained in November 1929, and from the beginning of her career she relied on immediate direction: &quot;Tell me what I have to do and I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; Bow was keen on poetry and music, but according to Rogers St. Johns, her attention span did not allow her to appreciate novels. Bow&#x27;s focal point was the scene, and her creativity made directors call in extra cameras to cover her spontaneous actions, rather than holding her down.

Years after Bow left Hollywood, director Victor Fleming compared Bow to a Stradivarius violin: &quot;Touch her, and she responded with genius.&quot; Director William Wellman was less poetic: &quot;Movie stardom isn&#x27;t acting ability—its personality and temperament ... I once directed Clara Bow (&quot;Wings&quot;). She was mad and crazy, but WHAT a personality!&quot;. And in 1981, Budd Schulberg described Bow as &quot;an easy winner of the dumbbell award&quot; who &quot;couldn&#x27;t act,&quot; and compared her to a puppy that his father B. P. Schulberg &quot;trained to become Lassie.&quot;

Bow appeared in eight releases in 1926: five for Paramount, including the film version of the musical &quot;Kid Boots&quot; with Eddie Cantor, and three loan-outs that had been filmed in 1925. In late 1925, Bow returned to New York to co-star in the Ibsenesque
drama &quot;Dancing Mothers&quot;, as the good/bad &quot;flapperish&quot; upper-class daughter Kittens. Alice Joyce starred as her dancing mother, with Conway Tearle as &quot;bad-boy&quot; Naughton. The picture was released on March 1, 1926. Local reviews were very positive; &quot;Clara Bow, known as the screen&#x27;s perfect flapper, does her stuff as the child, and does it well&quot;, and &quot;her remarkable performance in Dancing Mothers ... &quot;. Louise Brooks remembered her in Brownlow&#x27;s book; &quot;She was absolutely sensational in the United States ... in &quot;Dancing Mothers&quot; ... she just swept the country ... I know I saw her ... and I thought ... wonderful.&quot;

On April 12, 1926, Bow signed her first contract with Paramount: &quot;to retain your services as an actress for the period of six months from June 6, 1926 to December 6, 1926, at a salary of $750.00 per week&quot;. Bow negotiated her Paramount contract to not have a morals clause. In Victor Fleming&#x27;s comedy-triangle &quot;Mantrap&quot; Bow, as Alverna the manicurist, cures lonely hearts Joe Easter (Ernest Torrence) of the great northern, as well as pill-popping New York divorce attorney runaway Ralph Prescott (Percy Marmont). Bow commented: &quot;(Alverna] ... was bad in the book, but—darn it!—of course, they couldn&#x27;t make her that way in the picture. So I played her as a flirt.&quot; 

The film was released on July 24, 1926, to rave reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;Clara Bow just walks away with the picture from the moment she walks into camera range&quot;, while &quot;Photoplay&quot; told readers that &quot;When she is on the screen nothing else matters. When she is off, the same is true.&quot; Carl Sandburg wrote that it was &quot;The smartest and swiftest work as yet seen from Miss Clara Bow.&quot; and Sam Carver of the Newman Theater was quoted in &quot;The Reel Journal&quot; as saying that &quot;Clara Bow is taking the place of Gloria Swanson...(and)...filling a long need for a popular taste movie actress.&quot;

On August 16, 1926, Bow&#x27;s agreement with Paramount was renewed into a five-year deal: &quot;Her salary will start at $1700 a week and advance yearly to $4000 a week for the last year.&quot; Bow added that she intended to leave the motion picture business at the expiration of the contract, i.e., in 1931. In 1927 Bow appeared in six Paramount releases: &quot;It&quot;, &quot;Children of Divorce&quot;, &quot;Rough House Rosie&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, &quot;Hula&quot; and &quot;Get Your Man&quot;. In the Cinderella based story &quot;It&quot;, the poor shop-girl Betty Lou Spence (Bow) conquers the heart of her employer Cyrus Waltham (Antonio Moreno). The personal quality—&quot;It&quot;— provides the magic to make it happen. The film gave Bow her nickname, &quot;The &#x27;It&#x27; Girl.&quot; Reviews were nothing less than outstanding: &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;(Bow)...is vivacious and, as Betty Lou, saucy, which perhaps is one of the ingredients of &quot;It&quot;.&quot; 

&quot;The Film Daily&quot; wrote that &quot;Clara Bow gets a real chance and carries it off with honors...(and)...she is really the whole show&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;You can&#x27;t get away from this Clara Bow girl. She certainly has that certain &#x27;It&#x27;...and she just runs away with the film.&quot; Carl Sandburg wrote that &quot;&#x27;It&#x27; is smart, funny and real. It makes a full-sized star of Clara Bow.&quot; Dorothy Parker is often said to have referred to Bow when she wrote, &quot;It, hell; she had Those.&quot; Parker in actuality was not referring to Bow or to Bow&#x27;s character in the film &quot;It&quot;, but to a different character, Ava Cleveland, in the novel of the same name.

In 1927, Bow starred in &quot;Wings&quot;, a war picture rewritten to accommodate her, as she was Paramount&#x27;s biggest star, but was not happy about her part: &quot;[&quot;Wings&quot; is]...a man&#x27;s picture and I&#x27;m just the whipped cream on top of the pie.&quot; The film went on to win the first Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1928, Bow appeared in four Paramount releases: &quot;Red Hair&quot;, &quot;Ladies of the Mob&quot;, &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot;, and &quot;Three Week-Ends&quot;, all of which are lost. Adela Rogers St. Johns, a noted screenwriter who had done a number of pictures with Bow, wrote about her:

Bow&#x27;s bohemian lifestyle and &quot;dreadful&quot; manners were considered reminders of the Hollywood elite&#x27;s uneasy position in high society. Bow fumed: &quot;They yell at me to be dignified. But what are the dignified people like? The people who are held up as examples for me? They are snobs. Frightful snobs ... I&#x27;m a curiosity in Hollywood. I&#x27;m a big freak, because I&#x27;m myself!&quot; MGM executive Paul Bern said Bow was &quot;the greatest emotional actress on the screen, ... she is sentimental, simple, childish and sweet and the hard-boiled attitude is a defense mechanism.&quot;

===1929-1933: Sound films===
With &quot;talkies&quot; &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Night Kid&quot;, all released in 1929, Bow kept her position as the top box-office draw and queen of Hollywood. Neither the quality of Bow&#x27;s voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: &quot;I hate talkies ... they&#x27;re stiff and limiting. You lose a lot of your cuteness, because there&#x27;s no chance for action, and action is the most important thing to me.&quot; 

A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in &quot;The Wild Party&quot; because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. &quot;I can&#x27;t buck progress ... I have to do the best I can,&quot; she said. In October 1929 Bow described her nerves as &quot;all shot&quot;, saying that she had reached &quot;the breaking point&quot;, and &quot;Photoplay&quot; cited reports of &quot;rows of bottles of sedatives&quot; by her bed. &quot;Now they&#x27;re having me sing. I sort of half-sing, half-talk, with hips-and-eye stuff. You know what I mean—like Maurice Chevalier. I used to sing at home and people would say, &#x27;Pipe down! You&#x27;re terrible!&#x27; But the studio thinks my voice is great.&quot;

With &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot;, &quot;True to the Navy&quot;, &quot;Love Among the Millionaires&quot;, and &quot;Her Wedding Night&quot;, Bow was second at the box-office only to Joan Crawford in 1930. With &quot;No Limit&quot; and &quot;Kick In&quot;, Bow held the position as fifth at box-office in 1931, but the pressures of fame, public scandals, and overwork, took their toll on Bow&#x27;s fragile emotional health.

A damaging court trial charged her secretary Daisy DeVoe with financial mismanagement, by Paramount-friendly officials: Los Angeles District Attorney Buron Fitts, Assistant District Attorney David Clark, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William C. Doran.

According to the 1930 census, Bow lived at 512 Bedford Drive, together with her secretary and hairdresser, Daisy DeBoe (later DeVoe), in a house valued $25,000 with neighbors titled &quot;Horse-keeper&quot;, &quot;Physician&quot;, &quot;Builder&quot;. Bow stated she was 23 years old, i.e., born 1906, contradicting the censuses of 1910 and 1920.

As she slipped closer to a major breakdown her manager, B.P. Schulberg, began referring to her as &quot;Crisis-a-day-Clara&quot;. In April, Bow was taken to a sanatorium and, at her request, Paramount released her from her final undertaking: &quot;City Streets&quot; (1931). At 25 her career was essentially over. B. P. Schulberg tried to replace Bow with his girlfriend Sylvia Sidney, but Paramount went into receivership, lost its position as the biggest studio (to MGM), and fired Schulberg. David Selznick explained:

Bow left Hollywood for Rex Bell&#x27;s ranch in Nevada, her &quot;desert paradise&quot;, in June and married him in then small-town Las Vegas in December. In an interview on December 17, Bow detailed her way back to health: sleep, exercise, and food, and the day after it she returned to Hollywood &quot;for the sole purpose of making enough money to be able to stay out of it.&quot; Soon every studio in Hollywood (except Paramount) and even overseas wanted her services. Mary Pickford stated that Bow &quot;was a very great actress&quot; and wanted her to play her sister in &quot;Secrets&quot; (1933), 

Howard Hughes offered her a three-picture deal, and MGM wanted her to star in &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; (1932). Bow agreed to the script, but eventually rejected the offer since Irving Thalberg required her to sign a long-term contract. On April 28, 1932, Bow signed a two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for &quot;Call Her Savage&quot; (1932) and &quot;Hoop-La&quot; (1933). Both were successful. &quot;Variety&quot; favored &quot;Hoop-La&quot;. The October 1934, &quot;Family Circle&quot; Film Guide rated the film as &quot;pretty good entertainment&quot; and stated: &quot;This is the most acceptable bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done.&quot; However, they noted, &quot;Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn&#x27;t weigh two pounds soaking wet.&quot; Bow commented on her revealing costume in &quot;Hoop-La&quot;: &quot;Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore. He knew darn well I was doing it because we could use a little money these days. Who can&#x27;t?&quot;

Bow reflected on her career:

==Retirement and later years==
Bow and actor Rex Bell (later a lieutenant governor of Nevada) had two sons, Tony Beldam (born 1934, changed name to Rex Anthony Bell, Jr., died 2011) and George Beldam, Jr. (born 1938). Bow retired from acting in 1933. In September 1937, she and Bell opened The &#x27;It&#x27; Cafe in the Hollywood Plaza Hotel at 1637 N Vine Street near Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. It closed in 1943. Her last public performance, albeit fleeting, came in 1947 on the radio show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;. Bow was the mystery voice in the show&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Hush&quot; contest.

===Health issues===
Bow eventually began showing symptoms of psychiatric illness. She became socially withdrawn and, although she refused to socialize with her husband, she also refused to let him leave the house alone. In 1944, while Bell was running for the U.S. House of Representatives, Bow attempted suicide. A note was found in which Bow stated she preferred death to a public life.

In 1949, she checked into The Institute of Living to be treated for her chronic insomnia and diffuse abdominal pains. Shock treatment was tried and numerous psychological tests performed. Bow&#x27;s IQ was measured &quot;bright normal&quot;, while others claimed she was unable to reason, had poor judgment and displayed inappropriate or even bizarre behavior. Her pains were considered delusional and she was diagnosed with schizophrenia; however, she experienced neither auditory nor visual hallucinations. Analysts tied the onset of the illness, as well as her insomnia, to the &quot;butcher knife episode&quot; back in 1922, but Bow rejected psychological explanations and left the institute. She did not return to her family. After leaving the institution, Bow lived alone in a bungalow, which she rarely left, until her death.

==Death==
Bow spent her last years in Culver City, under the constant care of a nurse, Estalla Smith, living off an estate worth about $500,000 at the time of her death. In 1965, at age 60, she died of a heart attack, which her autopsy attributed to atherosclerosis. She was interred in the Freedom Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Heritage at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Her pallbearers were Harry Richman, Richard Arlen, Jack Oakie, Maxie Rosenbloom, Jack Dempsey, and Buddy Rogers.

==Legacy==
Film historian Leonard Maltin said in 1999: &quot;You think of Greta Garbo, Lillian Gish, all these great names, great actresses. Clara Bow was more popular in terms of box-office dollars, in terms of consistently bringing audiences into the theaters. She was right on top.&quot; In 1999 the American Film Institute excluded Bow from its finalized &quot;100 Years...100 Stars&quot; list, although she was on the list of nominees.

Film historian Kevin Brownlow did not mention Bow in his 1968 book on silent films, &quot;The Parade&#x27;s Gone By&quot;. Louise Brooks, who received an entire chapter in the book, wrote to Brownlow, &quot;You brush off Clara Bow for some old nothing like Brooks. Clara made three pictures that will never be surpassed: &quot;Dancing Mothers&quot;, &quot;Mantrap&quot;, and &quot;It&quot;.&quot; In a conversation with filmmaker Thomas Hamilton, Brownlow explained that he had planned to include a chapter on Bow but was unable to secure an interview with the reclusive star before her death, and since all chapters were based on first-hand accounts, it would have been inconsistent to include a chapter based on second-hand anecdotes. Brownlow made up for this omission by including an entire segment about Bow in his television documentary &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980), for which he interviewed Brooks.

==Awards and honors==
* For her contributions to the film industry, Bow was awarded a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 1500 Vine Street.
* In 1994, she was honored with an image on a United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.

==Filmography==
==In popular culture==
* Max Fleischer&#x27;s cartoon character Betty Boop was modelled after Bow&#x27;s appearance and after the voice of entertainer Helen Kane (the &quot;boop-boop-a-doop-girl&quot;).
* Bow&#x27;s mass of tangled red hair was one of her most famous features. When fans of the new star found out she put henna in her hair, sales of the dye tripled.
* An autographed picture of Bow is offered as a consolation prize of a beauty contest in the 1931 George Gershwin musical &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;.
* During her lifetime, Bow was the subject of wild rumors regarding her sex life; many of them were untrue. A tabloid called &quot;The Coast Reporter&quot; published lurid allegations about her in 1931, accusing her of exhibitionism, incest, lesbianism, bestiality, drug addiction, alcoholism, and having contracted a venereal disease. The publisher of the tabloid then tried to blackmail Bow, offering to cease printing the stories for $25,000, which led to his arrest by federal agents and, later, an eight-year prison sentence.
* The lead character of Peppy Miller from the 2011 film &quot;The Artist&quot; was inspired principally by Clara Bow, and in playing the part, actress Bérénice Bejo invoked many of Bow&#x27;s screen mannerisms.
* Bow inspired the name of the player character Laura Bow in the video games &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; and &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot;.
* On July 5, 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Silver Bullet Entertainment and MJW Media were producing a film based on David Stenn&#x27;s biography, &quot;Clara Bow: Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot;.
* Bow is mentioned in the Prince song &quot;Condition of the Heart&quot; from his 1985 album &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot;.
*&quot;Clara Bow&quot; is also the title of a song on alternative rock-band 50 Foot Wave&#x27;s debut album &quot;50 Foot Wave&quot;. 
*The song &quot;Picture Show&quot; in the Broadway musical &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; mentions &quot;Clara Bow&quot;, the &quot;It Girl&quot;, to reference a movie star.
*The 16th track and closing song on Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2024 studio album, &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot;, is titled &quot;Clara Bow&quot;, and references the struggles of stardom encountered by Bow.

===Fictional portrayals===
* Bow was played by Jennifer Tilly in the motion picture &quot;Return to Babylon&quot; (2013).
* Margot Robbie plays a fictionalized character based on Bow in the 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;.

<text>Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a soil. Soil pH is a key characteristic that can be used to make informative analysis both qualitative and quantitatively regarding soil characteristics. pH is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the activity of hydronium ions ( or, more precisely, ) in a solution. In soils, it is measured in a slurry of soil mixed with water (or a salt solution, such as  ), and normally falls between 3 and 10, with 7 being neutral. Acid soils have a pH below 7 and alkaline soils have a pH above 7. Ultra-acidic soils (pH &lt; 3.5) and very strongly alkaline soils (pH &gt; 9) are rare.

Soil pH is considered a master variable in soils as it affects many chemical processes. It specifically affects plant nutrient availability by controlling the chemical forms of the different nutrients and influencing the chemical reactions they undergo. The optimum pH range for most plants is between 5.5 and 7.5; however, many plants have adapted to thrive at pH values outside this range.

==Classification of soil pH ranges==

The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:
0 to 6=acidic&lt;br&gt;7=neutral&lt;br&gt;8 and above=alkaline

==Determining pH==
Methods of determining pH include:
*Observation of soil profile: certain profile characteristics can be indicators of either acid, saline, or sodic conditions. Examples are:
**Poor incorporation of the organic surface layer with the underlying mineral layer – this can indicate strongly acidic soils;
**The classic podzol horizon sequence, since podzols are strongly acidic: in these soils, a pale eluvial (E) horizon lies under the organic surface layer and overlies a dark B horizon;
**Presence of a caliche layer indicates the presence of calcium carbonates, which are present in alkaline conditions;
**Columnar structure can be an indicator of sodic condition.
*Observation of predominant flora. Calcifuge plants (those that prefer an acidic soil) include &quot;Erica&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and nearly all other Ericaceae species, many birch (&quot;Betula&quot;), foxglove (&quot;Digitalis&quot;), gorse (&quot;Ulex&quot; spp.), and Scots Pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;). Calcicole (lime loving) plants include ash trees (&quot;Fraxinus&quot; spp.), honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera&quot;), &quot;Buddleja&quot;, dogwoods (&quot;Cornus&quot; spp.), lilac (&quot;Syringa&quot;) and &quot;Clematis&quot; species.
*Use of an inexpensive pH testing kit, where in a small sample of soil is mixed with indicator solution which changes colour according to the acidity.
*Use of litmus paper. A small sample of soil is mixed with distilled water, into which a strip of litmus paper is inserted. If the soil is acidic the paper turns red, if basic, blue.
*Certain other fruit and vegetable pigments also change color in response to changing pH. Blueberry juice turns more reddish if acid is added, and becomes indigo if titrated with sufficient base to yield a high pH. Red cabbage is similarly affected.
*Use of a commercially available electronic pH meter, in which a glass or solid-state electrode is inserted into moistened soil or a mixture (suspension) of soil and water; the pH is usually read on a digital display screen.
* In the 2010s, spectrophotometric methods were developed to measure soil pH involving addition of an indicator dye to the soil extract. These compare well to glass electrode measurements but offer substantial advantages such as lack of drift, liquid junction and suspension effects.

Precise, repeatable measures of soil pH are required for scientific research and monitoring. This generally entails laboratory analysis using a standard protocol; an example of such a protocol is that in the USDA Soil Survey Field and Laboratory Methods Manual. In this document the three-page protocol for soil pH measurement includes the following sections: Application; Summary of Method; Interferences; Safety; Equipment; Reagents; and Procedure.

==Factors affecting soil pH==
The pH of a natural soil depends on the mineral composition of the parent material of the soil, and the weathering reactions undergone by that parent material. In warm, humid environments, soil acidification occurs over time as the products of weathering are leached by water moving laterally or downwards through the soil. In dry climates, however, soil weathering and leaching are less intense and soil pH is often neutral or alkaline.

=== Sources of acidity ===
Many processes contribute to soil acidification. These include:
* Rainfall: Average rainfall has a pH of 5.6 and is moderately acidic due to dissolved atmospheric carbon dioxide () that combines with water to form carbonic acid (). When this water flows through the soil it results in the leaching of basic cations as bicarbonates; this increases the percentage of and relative to other cations.
* Root respiration and decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms release which increases the carbonic acid () concentration and subsequent leaching.
* Plant growth: Plants take up nutrients in the form of ions (e.g. , , , ), and they often take up more cations than anions. However, plants must maintain a neutral charge in their roots. In order to compensate for the extra positive charge, they will release ions from the root. Some plants also exude organic acids into the soil to acidify the zone around their roots to help solubilize metal nutrients that are insoluble at neutral pH, such as iron (Fe).
* Fertilizer use: Ammonium () fertilizers react in the soil by the process of nitrification to form nitrate (), and in the process release ions.
* Acid rain: The burning of fossil fuels releases oxides of sulfur and nitrogen into the atmosphere. These react with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid in rain.
* Oxidative weathering: Oxidation of some primary minerals, especially sulfides and those containing , generate acidity. This process is often accelerated by human activity: 
** Mine spoil: Severely acidic conditions can form in soils near some mine spoils due to the oxidation of pyrite.
** Acid sulfate soils formed naturally in waterlogged coastal and estuarine environments can become highly acidic when drained or excavated.

=== Sources of alkalinity ===
Total soil alkalinity increases with:
* Weathering of silicate, aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals containing , , and ;
* Addition of silicate, aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals to soils; this may happen by deposition of material eroded elsewhere by wind or water, or by mixing of the soil with less weathered material (such as the addition of limestone to acid soils);
* Addition of water containing dissolved bicarbonates (as occurs when irrigating with high-bicarbonate waters).

The accumulation of alkalinity in a soil (as carbonates and bicarbonates of Na, K, Ca and Mg) occurs when there is insufficient water flowing through the soils to leach soluble salts. This may be due to arid conditions, or poor internal soil drainage; in these situations most of the water that enters the soil is transpired (taken up by plants) or evaporates, rather than flowing through the soil.

The soil pH usually increases when the total alkalinity increases, but the balance of the added cations also has a marked effect on the soil pH. For example, increasing the amount of sodium in an alkaline soil tends to induce dissolution of calcium carbonate, which increases the pH. Calcareous soils may vary in pH from 7.0 to 9.5, depending on the degree to which or dominate the soluble cations.

== Effect of soil pH on plant growth ==

=== Acid soils ===
High levels of aluminium occur near mining sites; small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal-fired power plants or incinerators. Aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time.

Acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium; however, the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air. Plants grown in acid soils can experience a variety of stresses including aluminium (Al), hydrogen (H), and/or manganese (Mn) toxicity, as well as nutrient deficiencies of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg).

Aluminium toxicity is the most widespread problem in acid soils. Aluminium is present in all soils to varying degrees, but dissolved Al3+ is toxic to plants; Al3+ is most soluble at low pH; above pH 5.0, there is little Al in soluble form in most soils. Aluminium is not a plant nutrient, and as such, is not actively taken up by the plants, but enters plant roots passively through osmosis. Aluminium can exist in many different forms and is a responsible agent for limiting growth in various parts of the world. Aluminium tolerance studies have been conducted in different plant species to see viable thresholds and concentrations exposed along with function upon exposure. Aluminium inhibits root growth; lateral roots and root tips become thickened and roots lack fine branching; root tips may turn brown. In the root, the initial effect of Al3+ is the inhibition of the expansion of the cells of the rhizodermis, leading to their rupture; thereafter it is known to interfere with many physiological processes including the uptake and transport of calcium and other essential nutrients, cell division, cell wall formation, and enzyme activity.

Proton (H+ ion) stress can also limit plant growth. The proton pump, H+-ATPase, of the plasmalemma of root cells works to maintain the near-neutral pH of their cytoplasm. A high proton activity (pH within the range 3.0–4.0 for most plant species) in the external growth medium overcomes the capacity of the cell to maintain the cytoplasmic pH and growth shuts down.

In soils with a high content of manganese-containing minerals, Mn toxicity can become a problem at pH 5.6 and lower. Manganese, like aluminium, becomes increasingly soluble as pH drops, and Mn toxicity symptoms can be seen at pH levels below 5.6. Manganese is an essential plant nutrient, so plants transport Mn into leaves. Classic symptoms of Mn toxicity are crinkling or cupping of leaves.

===Nutrient availability in relation to soil pH===
Soil pH affects the availability of some plant nutrients:

As discussed above, aluminium toxicity has direct effects on plant growth; however, by limiting root growth, it also reduces the availability of plant nutrients. Because roots are damaged, nutrient uptake is reduced, and deficiencies of the macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium) are frequently encountered in very strongly acidic to ultra-acidic soils (pH&lt;5.0). When aluminum levels increase in the soil, it decreases the pH levels. This does not allow for trees to take up water, meaning they cannot photosynthesize, leading them to die. The trees can also develop yellowish colour on their leaves and veins.

Molybdenum availability is increased at higher pH; this is because the molybdate ion is more strongly sorbed by clay particles at lower pH.

Zinc, iron, copper and manganese show decreased availability at higher pH (increased sorption at higher pH).

The effect of pH on phosphorus availability varies considerably, depending on soil conditions and the crop in question. The prevailing view in the 1940s and 1950s was that P availability was maximized near neutrality (soil pH 6.5–7.5), and decreased at higher and lower pH. Interactions of phosphorus with pH in the moderately to slightly acidic range (pH 5.5–6.5) are, however, far more complex than is suggested by this view. Laboratory tests, glasshouse trials and field trials have indicated that increases in pH within this range may increase, decrease, or have no effect on P availability to plants.

== Water availability in relation to soil pH ==

Strongly alkaline soils are sodic and dispersive, with slow infiltration, low hydraulic conductivity and poor available water capacity. Plant growth is severely restricted because aeration is poor when the soil is wet; while in dry conditions, plant-available water is rapidly depleted and the soils become hard and cloddy (high soil strength). The higher the pH in the soil, the less water available to be distributed to the plants and organisms that depend on it. With a decreased pH, this does not allow for plants to uptake water like they normally would. This causes them to not be able to photosynthesize.

Many strongly acidic soils, on the other hand, have strong aggregation, good internal drainage, and good water-holding characteristics. However, for many plant species, aluminium toxicity severely limits root growth, and moisture stress can occur even when the soil is relatively moist.

==Plant pH preferences==
In general terms, different plant species are adapted to soils of different pH ranges. For many species, the suitable soil pH range is fairly well known. Online databases of plant characteristics, such as &quot;USDA PLANTS&quot; and &quot;Plants for a Future&quot; can be used to look up the suitable soil pH range of a wide range of plants. Documents like &quot;Ellenberg&#x27;s indicator values for British plants&quot; can also be consulted.

However, a plant may be intolerant of a particular pH in some soils as a result of a particular mechanism, and that mechanism may not apply in other soils. For example, a soil low in molybdenum may not be suitable for soybean plants at pH 5.5, but soils with sufficient molybdenum allow optimal growth at that pH. Similarly, some calcifuges (plants intolerant of high-pH soils) can tolerate calcareous soils if sufficient phosphorus is supplied. Another confounding factor is that different varieties of the same species often have different suitable soil pH ranges. Plant breeders can use this to breed varieties that can tolerate conditions that are otherwise considered unsuitable for that species – examples are projects to breed aluminium-tolerant and manganese-tolerant varieties of cereal crops for food production in strongly acidic soils.

The table below gives suitable soil pH ranges for some widely cultivated plants as found in the &quot;USDA PLANTS Database&quot;. Some species (like &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; and &quot;Opuntia ficus-indica&quot;) tolerate only a narrow range in soil pH, whereas others (such as &quot;Vetiveria zizanioides&quot;) tolerate a very wide pH range.

In natural or near-natural plant communities, the various pH preferences of plant species (or ecotypes) at least partly determine the composition and biodiversity of vegetation. While both very low and very high pH values are detrimental to plant growth, there is an increasing trend of plant biodiversity along the range from extremely acidic (pH 3.5) to strongly alkaline (pH 9) soils, i.e. there are more calcicole than calcifuge species, at least in terrestrial environments. Although widely reported and supported by experimental results, the observed increase of plant species richness with pH is still in need of a clearcut explanation. Competitive exclusion between plant species with overlapping pH ranges most probably contributes to the observed shifts of vegetation composition along pH gradients.

==pH effects on soil biota==
Soil biota (soil microflora, soil animals) are sensitive to soil pH, either directly upon contact or after soil ingestion or indirectly through the various soil properties to which pH contributes (e.g. nutrient status, metal toxicity, humus form). According to the various physiological and behavioural adaptations of soil biota, the species composition of soil microbial and animal communities varies with soil pH. Along altitudinal gradients, changes in the species distribution of soil animal and microbial communities can be at least partly ascribed to variation in soil pH. The shift from toxic to non-toxic forms of aluminium around pH5 marks the passage from acid-tolerance to acid-intolerance, with few changes in the species composition of soil communities above this threshold, even in calcareous soils. Soil animals exhibit distinct pH preferences when allowed to exert a choice along a range of pH values, explaining that various field distributions of soil organisms, motile microbes included, could at least partly result from active movement along pH gradients. Like for plants, competition between acido-tolerant and acido-intolerant soil-dwelling organisms was suspected to play a role in the shifts in species composition observed along pH ranges.

The opposition between acido-tolerance and acido-intolerance is commonly observed at species level within a genus or at genus level within a family, but it also occurs at much higher taxonomic rank, like between soil fungi and bacteria, here too with a strong involvement of competition.
It has been suggested that soil organisms more tolerant of soil acidity, and thus living mainly in soils at pH less than 5, were more primitive than those intolerant of soil acidity. A cladistic analysis on the collembolan genus Willemia showed that tolerance to soil acidity was correlated with tolerance of other stress factors and that stress tolerance was an ancestral character in this genus. However the generality of these findings remains to be established.

At low pH, the oxidative stress induced by aluminium (Al3+) affects soil animals the body of which is not protected by a thick chitinous exoskeleton like in arthropods, and thus are in more direct contact with the soil solution, e.g. protists, nematodes, rotifers (microfauna), enchytraeids (mesofauna) and earthworms (macrofauna).

Effects of pH on soil biota can be mediated by the various functional interactions of soil foodwebs. It has been shown experimentally that the collembolan &quot;Heteromurus nitidus&quot;, commonly living in soils at pH higher than 5, could be cultured in more acid soils provided that predators were absent. Its attraction to earthworm excreta (mucus, urine, faeces), mediated by ammonia emission, provides food and shelter within earthworm burrows in mull humus forms associated with less acid soils.

==Effects of soil biota on soil pH==
Soil biota affect soil pH directly through excretion, and indirectly by acting on the physical environment. Many soil fungi, although not all of them, acidify the soil by excreting oxalic acid, a product of their respiratory metabolism. Oxalic acid precipitates calcium, forming insoluble crystals of calcium oxalate and thus depriving the soil solution from this necessary element. On the opposite side, earthworms exert a buffering effect on soil pH through their excretion of mucus, endowed with amphoteric properties.

By mixing organic matter with mineral matter, in particular clay particles, and by adding mucus as a glue for some of them, burrowing soil animals, e.g. fossorial rodents, moles, earthworms, termites, some millipedes and fly larvae, contribute to decrease the natural acidity of raw organic matter, as observed in mull humus forms.

==Changing soil pH==

===Increasing pH of acidic soil===
Finely ground agricultural lime is often applied to acid soils to increase soil pH (liming). The amount of limestone or chalk needed to change pH is determined by the mesh size of the lime (how finely it is ground) and the buffering capacity of the soil. A high mesh size (60 mesh = 0.25 mm; 100 mesh = 0.149 mm) indicates a finely ground lime that will react quickly with soil acidity. The buffering capacity of a soil depends on the clay content of the soil, the type of clay, and the amount of organic matter present, and may be related to the soil cation exchange capacity. Soils with high clay content will have a higher buffering capacity than soils with little clay, and soils with high organic matter will have a higher buffering capacity than those with low organic matter. Soils with higher buffering capacity require a greater amount of lime to achieve an equivalent change in pH. The buffering of soil pH is often directly related to the quantity of aluminium in soil solution and taking up exchange sites as part of the cation exchange capacity. This aluminium can be measured in a soil test in which it is extracted from the soil with a salt solution, and then is quantified with a laboratory analysis. Then, using the initial soil pH and the aluminium content, the amount of lime needed to raise the pH to a desired level can be calculated.

Amendments other than agricultural lime that can be used to increase the pH of soil include wood ash, industrial calcium oxide (burnt lime), magnesium oxide, basic slag (calcium silicate), and oyster shells. These products increase the pH of soils through various acid–base reactions. Calcium silicate neutralizes active acidity in the soil by reacting with H+ ions to form monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute.

===Decreasing the pH of alkaline soil===
The pH of an alkaline soil can be reduced by adding acidifying agents or acidic organic materials. Elemental sulfur (90–99% S) has been used at application rates of – it slowly oxidises in the soil to form sulfuric acid. Acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea, can help to reduce the pH of soil because ammonium oxidises to form nitric acid. Acidifying organic materials include peat or sphagnum peat moss.

However, in high-pH soils with a high calcium carbonate content (more than 2%), attempting to reduce the pH with acids can be very costly and ineffective. In such cases, it is often more efficient to add phosphorus, iron, manganese, copper, or zinc instead because deficiencies of these nutrients are the most common reasons for poor plant growth in calcareous soils.

<text>Childebert I (  496 – 13 December 558) was a Frankish King of the Merovingian dynasty, as third of the four sons of Clovis I who shared the kingdom of the Franks upon their father&#x27;s death in 511. He was one of the sons of Saint Clotilda, born at Reims. He reigned as King of Paris from 511 to 558 and Orléans from 524 to 558.

==Biography==

In the partition of the realm, Childebert received as his share the town of Paris, the country to the north as far as the river Somme, to the west as far as the English Channel, and the Armorican peninsula (modern Brittany). His brothers ruled in different lands: Theuderic I in Metz, Chlodomer in Orléans, and Chlothar I in Soissons.

In 523, Childebert participated with his brothers in a war against Godomar of Burgundy. Chlodomer died in the Battle of Vézeronce (524). Thereafter, concerned that the three sons of Chlodomer would inherit the kingdom of Orléans, Chlothar conspired with Childebert to oust them. They sent a representative to their mother, Clotilde. The representative presented a pair of scissors and a sword, offering her the choice to shear the three young boys, thereby depriving them of the long hair considered a symbol of royal power, or to have them killed. She famously replied, &quot;It is better for me to see them dead rather than shorn, if they are not raised to the kingship&quot;. After the murder of Chlodomer&#x27;s two elder children—the third, Clodoald, escaping to a monastic life—Childebert annexed the cities of Chartres and Orléans.

He took part in later various expeditions against the kingdom of Burgundy. He besieged Autun in 532 and, in 534, having conquered the kingdom along with his brother Chlothar and Theuderic&#x27;s son Theudebert I, received as his share of the spoils of that kingdom the towns of Mâcon, Geneva and Lyons. When Witiges, the king of the Ostrogoths, ceded Provence to the Franks in 535, the possession of Arles and Marseille was guaranteed to Childebert by his brothers. The annexation of that province was completed, with Clotaire&#x27;s help, in the winter of 536–537.

In 531, he received pleas from his sister Chrotilda, wife of King Amalaric of the Visigoths. The Arian king of Hispania, Chrotilda claimed, was grossly mistreating her, a Catholic. Childebert went down with an army and defeated the Gothic king. Amalaric retreated to Barcelona, where he was assassinated. Chrotilda died on her return journey to Paris of unknown causes.

Childebert made other expeditions against the Visigoths. In 542, he took possession of Pamplona with the help of his brother Clotaire and besieged Zaragoza, but was forced to retreat. From this expedition he brought back to Paris a precious relic, the tunic of Saint Vincent, in honour of which he built at the gates of Paris the famous monastery of Sainte-Croix-et-Saint-Vincent, known later as St-Germain-des-Prés.

He died on 13 December 558, and was buried in the abbey he had founded, where his tomb has been discovered. St-Germain-des-Prés became the royal necropolis for the Neustrian kings until 675. He left two daughters, Chrodoberge and Chrodesinde, by his wife Ultragotha. Childebert was an acquisitive monarch. He expanded his domains in more foreign wars than any of his brothers, fighting in Burgundy (more than once), Spain (more than once), Provence and elsewhere in Gaul. Gregory of Tours, a contemporary Neustrian, cites Childebert as saying: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Would that I could set eyes on the Auvergne Limagne, which is spoken of so highly&quot;). Childbert was also one of the more religious of the sons of Clovis, cooperating with his brothers, rescuing his sister, and constructing the famous monastery of Saint Vincent to house his relics.

<text>Childebert II (c.570–596) was the Merovingian king of Austrasia (which included Provence at the time) from 575 until his death in March 596, and the king of Burgundy from 592 to his death, as the adopted son of his uncle Guntram.

==Childhood==
Born c. 570, Childebert was the son of Sigebert I and Brunhilda of Austrasia. When his father was assassinated in 575 by two slaves of Queen-consort Fredegund of Soissons, Childebert was taken from Paris by Gundobald (according to one story, after being lowered from a window in a bag by his mother), one of his faithful lords, to Metz (the Austrasian capital), where he was recognized as sovereign. He was then only five years old, and during his long minority the power was disputed between his mother Brunhilda and the nobles, with Brunhilda being dominant until Childebert came of age in 585.

Chilperic I, king at Paris, and the Burgundian king Guntram sought an alliance with Childebert, who was adopted by both in turn. Because Guntram was lord of half of Marseille the district of Provence became a centre of a brief dispute between the two.

Guntram allied with Dynamius of Provence, who instigated the canons of the Diocese of Uzès to elect their deacon Marcellus, as bishop in opposition to their already-elected bishop Jovinus, a former governor of Provence. While Jovinus and Theodore, Bishop of Marseille, were travelling to the court of Childebert, Guntram had them arrested. Dynamius, meanwhile, blocked Gundulf, a duke of an important senatorial family and Childebert&#x27;s former &quot;domesticus&quot;, from entering Marseille on behalf of Childebert. Eventually he was forced to yield, though he later arrested Theodore again and had him sent to Guntram. Childebert replaced him in Provence by Nicetius (585). Despite his revolt, Childebert formally restored Dynamius to favour on 28 November 587.

==Heir, king and war leader==
With the assassination of Chilperic in 584 and the dangers occasioned to the French monarchy by the expedition of Gundoald in 585, Childebert threw himself unreservedly to the side of Guntram. By the Treaty of Andelot of 587, Childebert was recognised as Guntram&#x27;s heir, and with his uncle&#x27;s help in 587 he quelled the revolt of Dukes Rauching, Ursio, and Berthefried, and succeeded in seizing the castle of Woëvre. Many attempts were made on his life by Fredegund, wife of Chilperic, who was anxious to secure Guntram&#x27;s inheritance for her son Clotaire II. Childebert II had relations with the Byzantine Empire, and fought on several occasions in the name of the Emperor Maurice against the Lombards in Italy, with limited success.

With Guntram, he authorized the Irish monk Saint Colomban to found the abbey of Luxeuil and two other monasteries in the heart of the Vosges and to work with his monks in the various missions and foundations in all the Frankish kingdoms.

On the death of Guntram in 592, Childebert annexed the kingdom of Burgundy, and even contemplated seizing Clotaire&#x27;s estates and becoming sole king of the Franks. However, he and his young wife Faileuba died after being poisoned in 596. He and Faileuba had: the older, Theudebert II, inherited Austrasia with its capital at Metz, and the younger, Theuderic II, received Guntram&#x27;s former kingdom of Burgundy, with its capital at Orléans.

<doc id="106004" wikidata="Q7458476" url="?curid=106004" title="Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction">
<text>Sexual themes are frequently used in science fiction or related genres. Such elements may include depictions of realistic sexual interactions in a science fictional setting, a protagonist with an alternative sexuality, a sexual encounter between a human and a fictional extraterrestrial, or exploration of the varieties of sexual experience that deviate from the conventional.

Science fiction and fantasy have sometimes been more constrained than non-genre narrative forms in their depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction (SF) and soft science fiction also offer the freedom to imagine alien or galactic societies different from real-life cultures, making it a tool to examine sexual bias, heteronormativity, and gender bias and enabling the reader to reconsider their cultural assumptions.

Prior to the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre speculative fiction due to the relatively high number of minors in the target audience. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New Wave and feminist science fiction authors imagined cultures in which a variety of gender models and atypical sexual relationships are the norm, and depictions of sex acts and alternative sexualities became commonplace.

There is also science fiction erotica, which explores more explicit sexuality and the presentation of themes aimed at inducing arousal.

==Critical analysis==
As genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem even more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterization and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Sex is often linked to disgust in science fiction and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also offer more freedom than do non-genre literatures to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculine superiority that permeate some cultures.

In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that Darko Suvin has called &quot;cognitive estrangement&quot;: the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose difference forces us to reconsider our own world with an outsider&#x27;s perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes science fiction an incisive tool to examine sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures (for example, mythological deities and heroic archetypes) who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. Science fiction has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex.

&quot;Uranian Worlds&quot;, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.

===Themes explored===
Some of the themes explored in speculative fiction include:
* Sex with aliens, machines and sex robots
* Reproductive technology including cloning, artificial wombs, parthenogenesis, and genetic engineering
* Sexual equality of men and women
* Male- and female-dominated societies, including single-gender worlds
* Polyamory
* Changing gender roles
* Homosexuality and bisexuality
* Androgyny and sex changes
* Sex in virtual reality
* Other advances in technology for sexual pleasure such as teledildonics
* Asexuality
* Mpreg, an abbreviation of male pregnancy
* Sexual taboos and morality
* Sex in zero gravity
* Birth control and other, more radical measures to prevent overpopulation

==SF literature==

===Proto SF===

&quot;True History,&quot; a Greek-language tale by Assyrian writer Lucian (120-185 CE), has been called the first ever science fiction story. The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the Moon, which is inhabited by a society of men who are at war with the Sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son, the prince, in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the Moon&#x27;s soil.

In other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or &quot;beastliness,&quot; as in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms. Early works that showed sexually open characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu (collected in &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot;).

The 1915 utopian novel &quot;Herland&quot; by Charlotte Perkins Gilman depicts the visit by three men to an all-female society in which women reproduce by parthenogenesis.

===Pulp era (1920–30s)===

During the pulp era, explicit sexuality of any kind was not characteristic of genre science fiction and fantasy. The frank treatment of sexual topics of earlier literature was abandoned. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published, such as Kay Tarrant, assistant editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines&#x27; contents. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. In this sense, genre science fiction reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices. This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.

H. P. Lovecraft seminal short story, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, first published in the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1928, launched what developed into the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, a shared fictional universe taken up by various other writers and considerably affecting the entire field of Fantasy. Bobby Derie&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;Sex and The Cthulhu Mythos&quot; treats extensively the various sexual aspects of this &quot;Mythos&quot;:&quot;H. P. Lovecraft was one of the most asexual beings in history - at least by his own admission. Whether we accept this view of his own sexual instincts or not, there is no denying that sexuality - normal and aberrant - underlies a number of significant tales in the Lovecraft oeuvre. The impregnation of a human woman by Yog-Sothoth in &quot;&quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; and the mating of humans with strange creatures from the sea in &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;&quot; are only two such examples.&quot;&quot;Sex and The Cthulhu Mythos&quot; examines the significant uses of love, gender, and sex in the work of H. P. Lovecraft, moving on to some of his leading disciples and noting that &quot;The work of such significant writers of the Lovecraft tradition as Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Ramsey Campbell, W. H. Pugmire, and Caitlín R. Kiernan, features far more explicit sexuality than anything Lovecraft could have imagined&quot;. Finally, Derie goes on to study sexual themes in other venues, such as Lovecraftian occultism, Japanese manga and anime, and even Lovecraftian fan fiction.

In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932), natural reproduction has been abolished, with human embryos being raised artificially in &quot;hatcheries and conditioning centres.&quot; Recreational sex is promoted, often as a group activity; what passes for a religious ceremony consists of six men and six women meeting once a week to hold an &quot;orgy porgy&quot;. To prepare for this life, little boys and girls are made to play sexual games with each other as part of the official curriculum in what passes for kindergartens and elementary schools. On the other hand, marriage, pregnancy, natural birth, and parenthood are considered too vulgar to be mentioned in polite conversation. An important part of the plot concerns the &quot;Savage Reservation&quot; in New Mexico, where marriage, pregnancy and motherhood are still practiced by the local Native Americans. Linda, a woman from &#x27;civilized&#x27; London who was marooned there and sticking to her accustomed sexual mores, is persecuted as &quot;a whore&quot; by the local women whose husbands she seduced. John, Linda&#x27;s son who grew up on the Reservation but was always alienated from its society, comes to London and there falls deeply in love with a girl - seeking a happy loving consummation with her and then violently assaulting her from jealousy when she behaves according to her society&#x27;s sexual mores.

One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is &quot;Odd John&quot; (1935) by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he has consensual intercourse with his mother and that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals. John eventually concludes that any sexual interaction with &quot;normal&quot; humans is akin to bestiality.

&quot;War with the Newts&quot;, a 1936 satirical science fiction novel by Czech author Karel Čapek, concerns the discovery in the Pacific of a sea-dwelling race, an intelligent breed of newts – who are initially enslaved and exploited by humans and later rebel and go war against them. The book includes a detailed appendix entitled &#x27;The Sex Life of the Newts&#x27;, which examines the Newts&#x27; sexuality and reproductive processes in a pastiche of academese. This is one of the first attempts to speculate on what form sex might have among non-human intelligent beings.

C.L. Moore&#x27;s 1934 story &quot;Shambleau&quot; begins in what seems a classical damsel in distress situation: the protagonist, space adventurer Northwest Smith, sees a &quot;sweetly-made girl&quot; pursued by a lynch mob intent on killing her and intervenes to save her. But once he takes her to his room, she turns to be a disguised alien creature who spreads her inhuman long tendrils of hair, trapping Smith in a kind of psychic bondage and drawing out his life, and but for his partner arriving and killing her, it would have ended with his death. The story has little explicit sex, and no other physical contact than that of the hair of the &quot;girl&quot; with Smith&#x27;s body; yet the story clearly explores sexual themes in a way highly daring for its time.

In C.S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, a prominent place is given among the cast of villains to a monstrous lesbian – Miss Hardcastle, Security Chief of the satanic &quot;Institute&quot; which quite literally intends to take over the world. Hardcastle is presented as an inveterate sadist who takes pleasure in torturing &quot;fluffy&quot; young women and inflicting on them burns with a lighted cigarette.

===Golden Age (1940–50s)===

Regarding the aversion to sexual material in science fiction magazines well into the 1950s, Sam Moskowitz reported:
Writing in the December, 1945, &quot;Fantasy Times&quot;, Thomas S. Gardner, Ph.D., said: “Sex should be incorporated into science fiction as a standard life pattern and treated from all phases just as political systems are discussed... But just mention sex and one has not only a figurative fight but a literal fight on his hands. Sex is very, very tabu, and can cause the most violent disagreements possible. Just why that is so is hard to understand.” G. Legman, erotica authority, presented his theory. “The reason for this [aversion to sex] is neither due to oversight nor external censorship, but the fact that the largest percentage of the audience for … pulp science fiction literature is composed of adolescent boys (who continue reading it even after they are grown up), who are terrified of women, sex, and pubic hair.” The foregoing might explain the policy that kept sex out of science fiction, but it fails to explain the absolute rejection of such material until Philip José Farmer’s &quot;The Lovers&quot;. The answer most probably is that science fiction is a literature of ideas. The people who read it are entertained and even find escape through mental stimulation. Sex, vulgar or artistic, is available to them in countless forms if they wish it, but the type of intellectual speculation they enjoy is presented only in science fiction.

As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, writers were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work.

William Tenn wrote in 1949 &quot;Venus and the Seven Sexes&quot; – featuring the Plookhs, natives of the planet Venus, who require the participation of seven different sexes in order to reproduce and who get corrupted by human film director Hogan Shlestertrap. The rather satirical story might be the first case of an author speculating of creatures having more than two sexes, an idea later taken up by various others.

Philip José Farmer wrote &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1952), arguably the first science fiction story to feature sex as a major theme, and &quot;Strange Relations&quot; (1960), a collection of five stories about human/alien sexual relations. In his novel &quot;Flesh&quot; (1960; expanded 1968), a hypermasculine antlered man ritually impregnates legions of virgins in order to counter declining male fertility.

Theodore Sturgeon wrote many stories that emphasised the importance of love regardless of the current social norms, such as &quot;The World Well Lost&quot; (1953), a classic tale involving alien homosexuality, and the novel &quot;Venus Plus X&quot; (1960), in which a contemporary man awakens in a futuristic place where the people are hermaphrodites.

When Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; was originally published in 1951, it was censored by the publisher to remove various references to sex. The opening scene, where the protagonist is called urgently to HQ on an early morning hour, was re-written to remove all mention of his being in bed with a girl he had casually picked up. The published version did mention that the book&#x27;s alien invaders cause human beings whose bodies they take over to lose sexual feeling – but removed a later section mentioning that after some time on Earth the invaders &quot;discovered sex&quot; and started engaging in wild orgies and even broadcasting them on TV in areas under their control. Thirty years later, with changing mores, Heinlein published the book&#x27;s full, unexpurgated text. Heinlein&#x27;s time-travel short story &quot;All You Zombies&quot; (1959) chronicles a young man (later revealed to be intersex) taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger, female self before he underwent a sex change. He then turns out to be the offspring of that union, with the paradoxical result that he is both his own mother and father. In &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973), Heinlein&#x27;s recurring protagonist Lazarus Long – who never grows old and has an extremely long and eventful life – travels backward in time to the period of his own childhood. As an unintentional result, he falls in love with his own mother. He has no guilt feeling about pursuing and eventually consummating that relationship – considering her simply as an extremely attractive young woman named Maureen who just happens to have given birth to him thousands of years ago (as far as his personal timeline is concerned). The sequel, &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; (1987) takes place after Maureen had discovered the true identity of her lover – and shows that for her part, she was more amused than shocked or angry. 
Poul Anderson&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;War of the Wing-Men&quot;, centers on a species of winged intelligent creatures and sexual differences are central to its plot. Of the two mutually-hostile societies featured in the book, one practices monogamous marriage, while in the other there are every spring several days of a wild indiscriminate orgy – and a complete celibacy for the rest of the year. Ironically, both societies alike consider themselves chaste and the other depraved: &quot;We keep faithful to our mates while they fuck around indiscriminately – disgusting!&quot;; &quot;We keep sex where it belongs, to one week per year where you are not really yourself. They do it all over the year- disgusting!&quot;. Humans who land on the planet intervene in the centuries-long war, by showing members of the two societies that they are not all that different from each other.

Another Poul Anderson novel of the same period, &quot;Virgin Planet&quot; (1959), deals in a straightforward manner with homosexuality and polyamory on an exclusively female world. The plot twist is that the protagonist is the only male on a world of women, and though quite a few of them are interested in sex with him, it is never consummated during his sojourn on the planet.

A mirror image was presented by A. Bertram Chandler in &quot;Spartan Planet&quot; (1969), featuring an exclusively male world, where by definition homosexual relations are the normal (and only) sexual relations. The plot revolves around the explosive social upheaval resulting when the planet is discovered by a spaceship from the wider galaxy, whose crew includes both men and women.

Until the late 1960s, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, nor openly investigated sexual questions.

More conventionally, A. Bertram Chandler&#x27;s books include numerous episodes of free fall sex, his characters (male and female alike) strongly prone to extramarital relations and tending to while away the boring months-long Deep Space voyages by forming complicated love triangles.

==Plots and themes==
===New Wave era (1960–70s)===
By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called &quot;the New Wave,&quot; a movement more skeptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in &quot;inner space&quot; instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Notable authors who often wrote on sexual themes included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr., and Samuel R. Delany. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential &quot;New Worlds&quot; magazine) and Ursula K. Le Guin, sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace.

In Brian Aldiss&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;The Interpreter&quot; (in the US published as &quot;Bow Down to Nul&quot;), Earth is a backwater colony planet in the galactic empire of the Nuls, a giant, three-limbed, civilised alien race. The plot, dealing with complicated relations between humans and their Nul rulers, touches among other things on Nul sex. The Nul wear no clothes, but their equivalent of hands and arms are wide membranes which are normally held in a fixed position before the body, not moving even when the &quot;fingers&quot; are manipulating a tool. Only in a sexual context are the hands moved aside, to reveal the genital organs behind – the equivalent of humans undressing. In one scene, the human protagonist is able to tune to an erotic (or pornographic) Nul sensory device, made for internal Nul consumption and not intended for humans, which replicates the wild ecstasy felt by Nuls when daring to move aside their membrane hands and reveal their bodies to each other – similar in some ways to human sexual arousal but also very different.

Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966) both depict heterosexual group marriages and public nudity as desirable social norms, while in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973), the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex. Heinlein&#x27;s character Lazarus Long, travelling back in time to the period of his own childhood, discovers, to his surprise and (initial) shame, a sexual desire of his own mother – but overcoming this initial shame, he comes to think of her simply as &quot;Maureen&quot;, an attractive young woman who is far from indifferent to him.

Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s Nebula Award-winning short story &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah&quot; (1967) posits the development of neutered human astronauts, and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. In his 1975 science fiction novel entitled &quot;Dhalgren&quot;, Delany colors his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sex is not the focus of the novel, although it does contain some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in science fiction. Delany depicts, mostly with affection, characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours, with the effect of revealing to the reader the fact that these kinds of people exist in the real world. In later works, Delany blurs the line between science fiction and gay pornography. Delany faced resistance from book distribution companies for his treatment of these topics.

In 1968, Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonflight&quot; launched the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series, depicting the lives of humans living in close partnership with dragons. In a key scene, the young golden Dragon Queen takes off on her mating flight, pursued by the male dragons – until finally one of them catches up with her and they engage in passionate mating high up in the air, their necks and wings curled around each other. On the ground the woman and man who are these dragons&#x27; riders share their passion telepathically – and inevitably wildly embrace and kiss, embarking in parallel human mating.

Ursula K. Le Guin explores radically alternative forms of sexuality in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969) and again in &quot;Coming of Age in Karhide&quot; (1995), which imagine the sexuality of an alien &quot;human&quot; species in which individuals are neither &quot;male&quot; nor &quot;female,&quot; but undergo a monthly sexual cycle in which they randomly experience the activation of either male or female sexual organs and reproductive abilities; this makes them in a sense bisexual, and in other senses androgynous or hermaphroditic. It is common for an individual of that species to undergo at some moment of life pregnancy and birth-giving, while at another time having the male role and impregnating somebody else. In the novel, the Genthian political leader, who appears externally male, becomes pregnant.

Le Guin has written considerations of her own work in two essays, &quot;Is Gender Necessary?&quot; (1976) and &quot;Is Gender Necessary? Redux&quot; (1986), which respond to feminist and other criticism of &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. In these essays, she makes it clear that the novel&#x27;s assumption that Gethenians would automatically find a mate of the gender opposite to the gender they were becoming produced an unintended heteronormativity. Le Guin has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities science fiction allows for non-traditional sexuality, such as the sexual bonding between clones in &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (1968) and the four-way marriages in &quot;Mountain Ways&quot; (1996).

The complicated plot of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s 1970 fantasy novel &quot;The Guns of Avalon&quot; includes the protagonist Corwin meeting and making love to Dara, who seems a normal (and very attractive) young woman. But at the end of the book, when she walks the powerfully magical &quot;Pattern&quot; she is changing, her hair &quot;crackling with static electricity&quot; and then she seems to grow horns and hoofs, then becomes an enormous cat, then &quot;a bright winged thing of indescribable beauty&quot; followed by &quot;a tower of ashes&quot;. Finally, she again becomes a recognizable Dara, but &quot;tall and magnificent, both beautiful and somehow horrible at the same time, her arms raised in exultation and inhuman laughter flowing from her lips&quot;. Shocked, Corwin wonders &quot;had I truly held, caressed, made love to - &quot;that&quot;?&quot;. While Corwin struggles with feeling mightily repelled and simultaneously attracted as never before, the changed Dara declares herself his mortal enemy and nemesis - and disappears. Zelazny&#x27;s publishers had no problem with this final scene and its ambiguous sexual connotations, but they did object to an earlier sex scene - straightforward but explicit by 1970s American publishing standards - between Corwin and the seemingly normal Dara. Zelazny was amused when the book&#x27;s editor asked him to remove it &quot;so that sales to libraries would not be jeopardized&quot;. That deleted scene has never appeared with the novel, even in later editions when mores had become more elastic, but has been printed for the first time in &quot;The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain&quot;.

In his 1972 novel &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot;, Isaac Asimov describes an alien race with three sexes, all of them necessary for sexual reproduction. One sex produces a form of sperm, another sex provides the energy needed for reproduction, and members of the third sex bear and raise the offspring. All three genders are included in sexual and social norms of expected and acceptable behavior. In this same novel, the hazards and problems of sex in microgravity are described, and while people born on the Moon are proficient at it, people from Earth are not.

Similarly, Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Three Worlds to Conquer&quot; depicts centaur-like beings living on Jupiter who have three genders: female, male and &quot;demi-male&quot;. In order to conceive, a female must have sex with both a male and a demi-male within a short time of each other. In the society of the protagonist, there are stable, harmonious three-way families, in effect a formalized Menage a Trois, with the three partners on equal terms with each other. An individual in that society feels a strong attachment to all three parents – mother, father and demi-father – who all take part in bringing up the young. Conversely, among the harsh invaders who threaten to destroy the protagonist&#x27;s homeland and culture, males are totally dominant over both females and demi-males; the latter are either killed at birth or preserved in subjugation for reproduction – which the protagonist regards as a barbaric aberration.

In Anderson&#x27;s satirical story &quot;A Feast for the Gods&quot;, the Greek god Hermes visits modern America and has casual sex with an American woman, who tells him that she is &quot;on the pill&quot; and does not take seriously Hermes telling her that &quot;The Embrace of a God is always fertile&quot;. She ends up pregnant and destined to give birth to a modern demi god.

Feminist science fiction authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models are the norm. Joanna Russ&#x27;s award-winning short story &quot;When It Changed&quot; (1972), portraying a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, and her novel &quot;The Female Man&quot; (1975), were enormously influential. Russ was largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction.

The bisexual female writer Alice Bradley Sheldon, who used James Tiptree, Jr. as her pen name, explored the sexual impulse as her main theme. Some stories by Tiptree portray humans becoming sexually obsessed with aliens, such as &quot;And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill&#x27;s Side&quot; (1972), or aliens being sexually abused. &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; (1973) is an early precursor of cyberpunk that depicts a relationship via a cybernetically controlled body. In her award-winning novella &quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot; (1976), Tiptree presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically &quot;male&quot; problems such as war but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning, and consider men to be comical.

In Robert Silverberg&#x27;s novelette &quot;The Way to Spook City&quot; the protagonist meets and has an affair with a woman named Jill, who seems completely human – and convincingly, passionately female human. Increasingly in love with her, he still has a nagging suspicion that she is in fact a disguised member of the mysterious extraterrestrial species known as &quot;Spooks&quot;, who had invaded and taken over a large part of the United States. Until the end, he repeatedly grapples with two questions: Is she human or a Spook? And if she is a Spook, could the two of them nevertheless build a life together?

In the centuries-long, futile space war described in Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;The Forever War&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s increasing feeling of alienation is manifested, among other things, when he is appointed as the commanding officer of a &quot;strike force&quot; whose soldiers are exclusively homosexual, and who resent being commanded by a heterosexual. Later in the book, he finds that while he was fighting in space, humanity has begun to clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself simply &quot;Man&quot;. Luckily for the protagonist, &quot;Man&quot; has established several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans, just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. In one of these colonies, the protagonist is happily reunited with his long-lost beloved and they embark upon monogamous marriage and on having children through sexual reproduction and female pregnancy – an incredibly archaic and old-fashioned way of life for most of that time&#x27;s humanity.

Elizabeth A. Lynn&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;A Different Light&quot; (1978) features a same-sex relationship between two men and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore chain A Different Light. Lynn&#x27;s The Chronicles of Tornor (1979–80) series of novels, the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first fantasy novels to include gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background. Lynn also wrote novels depicting sadomasochism.

John Varley, who also came to prominence in the 1970s, is another writer who examined sexual themes in his work. In his &quot;Eight Worlds&quot; suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex quickly, easily and completely reversibly – leading to a casual attitude with people changing their sex back and forth as the sudden whim takes them. Homophobia is shown as initially inhibiting the uptake of this technology, as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality becoming the default mode for society. Sexual themes are central to the story &quot;Options&quot;: a married woman, Cleo, living in King City, undergoes a change to male despite her husband&#x27;s objections. As &quot;Leo&quot; she finds out what it means to be a man in her society and even becomes her husband&#x27;s best friend. She also learns that people are adopting new names that are historically neither male nor female. She eventually returns to female as &quot;Nile&quot;. Varley&#x27;s Gaea trilogy (1979-1984) features lesbian protagonists.

Female characters in science fiction films, such as &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), continued to be often portrayed as simple sex kittens.

===Modern SF (post-New Wave)===
After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 70s, sex in genre science fiction gained wider acceptance and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional science fiction stories with little comment.

In 1968 Jack Vance introduced the Planet of Adventure, inhabited by four different alien races, each with its own distinct society and culture. One of these – the predatory, part feline, part bird-like Dirdir – is described as having a very complex sexuality, with many different genders that leads to many different combinations of gender-compatibility when it comes to sex and breeding, though each breeding still seems to involve only two individuals.

Jack L. Chalker&#x27;s Well World series, launched in 1977, depicts a world – designed by the super science of a vanished extraterrestrial race, the Markovians – which is divided into numerous &quot;hexes&quot;, each inhabited by different sentient race. Anyone entering one of these hexes is transformed into a member of the local race. This plot device gives a wide scope for exploring the divergent biology and cultures of the various species – including their sex life. For example, a human entering a hex inhabited by an insectoid intelligent race is transformed into a female of that species, feels sexual desire for a male and mates with him. Too late does she discover that in this species, pregnancy is fatal – the mother being devoured from the inside by her larvae.

In a later part, a very macho villain gains control of a supercomputer whose power includes the ability to &quot;redesign&quot; people&#x27;s bodies to almost any specification. He uses the computer to give himself a &quot;super-virile&quot; body, capable of a virtually unlimited number of erections and ejaculations – and then proceeds to transform his male enemies into beautiful women and induce in them a strong sexual desire towards himself. However, a computer breakdown restores to these captives their normal minds. Though they are still in women&#x27;s bodies, these bodies were designed with great strength and stamina, so as to enable them to undergo repeated sexual encounters. Thus, they are well-equipped to chase, catch and suitably punish their abuser.

In Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;Jem&quot;, humans exploring the eponymous planet Jem discover by experience that local beings emit a milt which has a strong aphrodisiac effect on humans. Characters who were hitherto not at all drawn to each other find themselves suddenly involved in wild, uncontrollable sex. At the ironic ending, their descendants who colonize the planet and build up a distinctive society and culture develop the custom of celebrating Christmas by deliberately stimulating the local beings into emitting the milt, and then taking off their clothes and engaging in a wild indiscriminate orgy – their copulations accompanied by a chorus of the planet&#x27;s enslaved indigenous beings who were taught to sing &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, with the song&#x27;s Christian significance long forgotten.

Also set on an alien planet, Octavia E. Butler&#x27;s acclaimed short story &quot;&quot;Bloodchild&quot;&quot; (1984) depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler&#x27;s &quot;pregnant man story,&quot; &quot;Bloodchild&quot; won the Nebula Award, Hugo Award, and Locus Award. Other of Butler&#x27;s works explore miscegenation, non-consensual sex, and hybridity.

In Robert Silverberg&#x27;s 1982 novella &quot;Homefaring&quot;, the protagonist enters the mind of an intelligent lobster of the very far future and experiences all aspects of lobster life, including sex: &quot;He approached a female, knowing precisely which one was the appropriate one, and sang to her, and she acknowledged his song with a song of her own, and raised her third pair of legs for him, and let him plant his gametes beside her oviducts. There was no apparent pleasure in it, as he remembered pleasure from his time as a human. Yet it brought him a subtle but unmistakable sense of fulfillment, of the completion of biological destiny, that had a kind of orgasmic finality about it, and left him calm and anchored at the absolute dead center of his soul&quot;. When finally returning to his human body and his human lover, he keeps longing for the lobster life, to &quot;his mate and her millions of larvae&quot;.

Quentin and Alice, the extremely shy and insecure protagonists of Lev Grossman&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Magicians&quot;, spend years as fellow students at a School of Magic without admitting to being deeply in love with each other. Only the experience of being magically turned into foxes enables them at last to break through their reserve: &quot;Increasingly, Quentin noticed one scent more than the others. It was a sharp, acrid, skunky musk that probably would have smelled like cat piss to a human being, but to a fox it was like a drug. He tackled the source of the smell, buried his snuffling muzzle in her fur, because he had known all along, with what was left of his consciousness, that what he was smelling was Alice. Vulpine hormones and instincts were powering up, taking over, manhandling what was left of his rational human mind.&quot;

The next sequence depicts animal sex: &quot;He locked his teeth in the thick fur of her neck. It didn&#x27;t seem to hurt her any, or at least not in a way that was easily distinguishable from pleasure. He caught a glimpse of Alice&#x27;s wild, dark fox eyes rolling with terror and then half shutting with pleasure. Their tiny quick breathes puffed white in the air and mingled and disappeared. Her white fox fur was coarse and smooth at the same time, and she made little yipping sounds every time he pushed himself deeper inside her. He never wanted to stop&quot;. When resuming their human bodies, Quentin and Alice are initially even more shy and awkward with each other, and only after going through some harrowing magical experiences are they finally able to have human sex.

Lois McMaster Bujold explores many areas of sexuality in the multiple award-winning novels and stories of her Vorkosigan Saga (1986-ongoing), which are set in a fictional universe influenced by the availability of uterine replicators and significant genetic engineering. These areas include an all-male society, promiscuity, monastic celibacy, hermaphroditism, and bisexuality.

In the Mythopoeic Award-winning novel &quot;Unicorn Mountain&quot; (1988), Michael Bishop includes a gay male AIDS patient among the carefully drawn central characters who must respond to an irruption of dying unicorns at their Colorado ranch. The death of the hedonistic gay culture, and the safe sex campaign resulting from the AIDS epidemic, are explored, both literally and metaphorically.

Sex has a major role in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s 1990 novel &quot;A World of Difference&quot;, taking place on the planet Minerva (a more habitable analogue of Mars). Minervan animals (including the sentient Minervans) are hexameristically radially symmetrical. This means that they have six eyes spaced equally all around, see in all directions and have no &quot;back&quot; where somebody could sneak on them unnoticed. Females (referred to as &quot;mates&quot; by the Minervans) give birth to litters that consist of one male and five females, and the &quot;mates&quot; always die after reproducing because of torrential bleeding from the places where the six fetuses were attached; this gives a population multiplication of 5 per generation if all females live to adolescence and reproduce.

Females reach puberty while still hardly out of childhood, and typically experience sex only once in the lifetime – leading to pregnancy and death at birth-giving. Thus, in Minervan society male dominance seems truly determined by a biological imperative – though it takes different forms in various Minervan societies: in some females are considered expendable and traded as property, in other they are cherished and their tragic fate mourned – but still, their dependent status is taken for granted. The American women arriving on Minerva and discovering this situation consider it intolerable; a major plot element is their efforts, using the resources of Earth medical science, to find a way of saving the Minervan females and letting them survive birth-giving. At the end, they do manage to save a particularly sympathetic Minervan female – potentially opening the way for a complete upheaval in Minervan society.

Sex is also an important ingredient in another of Harry Turtledove&#x27;s works, the Worldwar Series of Alternative History, based on the premise of reptile extraterrestrials, nicknamed &quot;The Lizards&quot;, invading Earth in 1942, forcing humans to terminate the Second World War and unite against this common enemy. As depicted by Turtledove, the &quot;Lizards&quot; have no concept whatever that sex ought to be private, and they engage in it in public as in any other activity. This leads to human beings in areas occupied by them feeling shocked and outraged by the &quot;immorality&quot; of their new masters - especially that the invaders, preferring hot climates, prioritize conquest of the Arab and Islamic countries. For their part, the invaders are genuinely puzzled by the Humans&#x27; insistence on having privacy for sex and their outrage when reptile warriors walk in on them when engaged in it. As gradually becomes clear, on their home planet, the &quot;Lizards&quot; have a clearly defined mating season, when normal activity ceases and they engage in a days-long, indiscriminate orgy; as their young can fend for themselves from the moment of hatching from the egg, there is no of parental care and they have no marriages or families, and thus there is no reason to establish paternity. Outside the mating season, sex does not occur among them and does not concern them. However, when arriving on Earth they soon discover that ginger, an innocuous spice to humans, acts as a powerful narcotic on the invaders&#x27; physiology - and that it causes their females to become sexually active and emit pheromones, out of the normal season. This causes an unaccustomed disruption of their daily activity, with females who had taken ginger suddenly becoming sexual, males and females then feeling compelled to immediately engage in mating before they could resume their daily work. This also arises the phenomenon of females deliberately taking ginger in return for payment - prostitution having been completely unknown in their society before their arrival on Earth.

In the far future human colony of Frederik Pohl&#x27;s &quot;The World at the End of Time&quot;, the common way to produce new humans is for a geneticist to take DNA samples from two or more &quot;parents&quot; – regardless of their being male or female. The DNA is then combined in a laboratory, and the parents arrive to pick up the baby nine months later. The few couples who prefer to do it in the old fashioned way, a man sexually impregnating a woman, are considered strange but harmless eccentrics.

&quot;Glory Season&quot; (1993) by David Brin is set on the planet Stratos, inhabited by a strain of human beings designed to conceive clones in winter, and normal children in summer. All clones are female, because males cannot reproduce themselves individually. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity; women are sexually receptive in winter, and men in summer. (This unusual heterogamous reproductive cycle is known to be evolutionarily advantageous for some species of aphids.) The novel treats themes of separatist feminism and biological determinism.

Elizabeth Bear&#x27;s novel &quot;Carnival&quot; (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men.

The fantasy world of Scott Lynch&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Red Seas Under Red Skies&quot; offers a new variation on the long-established genre of pirate literature – depicting a pirate ship which is run on the basis of complete gender equality. The pirate crew is composed of a roughly equal number of men and women, and crew members may freely engage in sex – homosexual or heterosexual, as they choose – when off duty. Since shipboard life offers little chance of privacy, the sound of people having a noisy orgasm is a normal part of night time routine on board the &quot;Poison Orchid&quot;.

However, any attempt at a sexual act without the other person&#x27;s sexual consent is punished immediately and severely. The formidable Captain Zamira Drakasha is raising her two children aboard, and is well able to combine being a deadly fighter and strict disciplinarian with her role as a loving and doting mother – but having children aboard is a privilege reserved to the Captain alone; other female pirates who get pregnant must leave their children on shore.

The plot of &quot;The Tamír Triad&quot; by Lynn Flewelling has a major transsexual element. To begin with the protagonist, Prince Tobin, is to all appearances a male – both in his own perception and in that of others. Boys who swim naked together with Tobin have no reason to doubt his male anatomy. Yet, due to the magical reasons which are an important part of the plot, in the underlying, essential identity Tobin had always been a disguised girl. In the series&#x27; cataclysmic scene of magical change, this becomes an evident physical fact, and Prince Tobin becomes Queen Tamír, shedding the male body and gaining a fully functioning female one. Yet, it takes Tamír a considerable time and effort to come to terms with her female sexuality.

In &quot;Lateral Magazine&quot;, &quot;The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction&quot;:In another twist of today&#x27;s society, &quot;Nontraditional Love&quot; by Rafael Grugman (2008) puts together an upside-down society where heterosexuality is outlawed, and homosexuality is the norm. A &#x27;traditional&#x27; family unit consists of two dads with a surrogate mother. Alternatively, two mothers, one of whom bears a child. In a nod to the always-progressive Netherlands, this country is the only country progressive enough to allow opposite sex marriage. This is perhaps the most obvious example of cognitive estrangement. It puts the reader in the shoes of the oppressed by modelling an entire world of opposites around a fairly &quot;normal&quot; everyday heterosexual protagonist. A heterosexual reader would not only be able to identify with the main character but be immersed in a world as oppressive and bigoted as the real world has been for homosexuals and the queer community throughout history.The 2018 Fantasy novel &quot;Stone Unturned&quot;, set in Lawrence Watt-Evans&#x27; magical world of Ethshar, begins with the young wizard Morvash of the Shadows discovering that some of the statues in his uncle&#x27;s house were real people turned to stone, and sets out to do the right thing. What Morvash considered the most disturbing of these statues &quot;was hidden away in a sort of marble grotto in the garden behind the house, and depicted a young man and a young woman in what might politely be called an intimate embrace, or a compromising position. They were not in the sort of elegant pose that artists use for erotica, with graceful lines displaying the female&#x27;s curves and the male&#x27;s muscles. They were in an earthier position. The woman — a girl, really — was on her back, with her knees drawn up to her chest and her head raised as her blank stone eyes stared perpetually at the man&#x27;s belly. Her mouth was open as if panting. Her partner was kneeling between her legs, leaning forward over her, one hand grabbing her shoulder, the other occupied elsewhere. His eyes were closed, but his mouth was also open; Morvash thought it was more of a moan than a pant. He could almost smell the sweat. Neither wore any clothing whatsoever, nor were there any artfully-placed draperies or fig leaves to obscure the details. Had the wizard responsible for this petrifaction timed it deliberately, or had he caught them in this position by accident?&quot;

Eventually, it turns out that the couple were Prince Marek of Melitha and Darissa the Witch&#x27;s Apprentice, who had fallen deeply in love with each other during a war that threatened their kingdom and who sought to celebrate victory with a bout of intensive love-making in the privacy of the Prince&#x27;s bedchamber – but were surprised and turned into stone by a wizard in the employ of the Prince&#x27;s envious sister, who sought to seize the throne. Afterwards, the couple spent forty petrified years, dimly conscious, perpetually caught in their sexual act and forming a prized item in Lord Landessin&#x27;s sculpture collection. When the wizard Morvash finally manages to bring them back to life, they find themselves lying on the floor in a big hall, surrounded by various other people who were also revived from petrifaction, and hasten to disengage and look for something to cover their nakedness. After various other adventures, they finally get married and fully clothed mount the throne of Melitha as King and Queen.

<text>The Kansas City Knights were an American Basketball Association minor league basketball team based in Kansas City, Missouri. They have not played since the 2004–05 season.

== Franchise history ==
The Knights were one of the ABA&#x27;s charter franchises and began play during the 2000–01 season. In 2001–02, the following season, the Knights posted a league best 35–5 record that year and ended up winning the ABA championship under head coach and University of Kansas alumnus Kevin Pritchard.

Soon after winning the title, the ABA took the year off to re-organize. The ABA then resumed play in the 2003–2004 season. The Knights competed in the ABA for the 2003–04 and the 2004-05 seasons before going dark for 2005–06. It was announced via a press release on the team&#x27;s website that the team would suspend operations until a suburban arena was built in Johnson County, KS. The team intended to play at an interim location once ground was broken on the new arena, but plans for the arena remain in limbo and there has been no word from the team&#x27;s owners since. However, operation of the youth developmental &quot;Knights Academy&quot; program is ongoing.

Since the Knights folded, several ABA teams have appeared and disappeared in the Kansas City area. None of these teams are related to the Knights or have been as successful. The most recent ABA team in the Kansas City area was the Kansas City Soul, who folded in 2014.

<text>Emery Worldwide Airlines was the cargo airline subsidiary of U.S. based Emery Worldwide, and “one of the nation&#x27;s major cargo airlines”.

==History==
Emery Worldwide Airlines began operations in the early 1980s with a fleet composed mainly of Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-8 freighter aircraft. It flew scheduled nighttime routes to and from Emery Worldwide’s freight sortation hub in Dayton, OH, and connecting flights to Emery&#x27;s European hub in Maastricht, Netherlands.

Two of its cargo planes crashed in early 2000. Flight 17 crashed on February 16, killing its 3 crew members, and on April 26, another of its jets crash-landed in Nashville, TN. Both crashes were attributed to improper maintenance.

Following an FAA investigation that discovered more than 100 violations of safety regulations, Emery Worldwide Airlines had its planes grounded on August 13, 2001. It officially ceased operating on December 5, 2001.

At the time of its closing, Emery Worldwide Airlines operated 37 freighter aircraft, including Douglas DC-8 and DC-10 aircraft.

==Fleet==

Emery Worldwide Airlines had in the past operated the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*May 3, 1991: A Boeing 727 crew had to abort mid-takeoff roll at Bradley International Airport in Connecticut when an engine compressor disk came loose destroying the engine nacelle and severing oil, hydraulic, and fuel lines. The resulting fire consumed the plane and cargo. 3 crew members were on board. No fatalities.
*December 9, 1996: A Douglas C-47A (registered N75142) crashed on an emergency return approach to Boise Airport in Idaho, killing both crew. Contracted by Desert Air, it was on a cargo flight to its base in Salt Lake City when the starboard engine caught fire shortly after take-off and the decision was made to return to Boise.
*February 16, 2000: Flight 17, a Douglas DC-8-71F (registered N8079U) crashed on take-off on a scheduled cargo flight from Sacramento Mather Airport in California with three crew members aboard. Bound for Dayton, Ohio, the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post-crash fire; there were no survivors. The accident was caused by improper maintenance.
*April 26, 2001: A Douglas DC-8-71F (registered N8076U) landed with a left main landing gear up at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee. The aircraft sustained minor damage and the three-member crew was not injured. Post-accident investigation found improper maintenance to the left main landing gear was at fault.

<doc id="106008" wikidata="Q732607" url="?curid=106008" title="Bituminous coal">
<text>Bituminous coal, or black coal, is a type of coal containing a tar-like substance called bitumen or asphalt. Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown; often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams. It is typically hard but friable. Its quality is ranked higher than lignite and sub-bituminous coal, but lesser than anthracite. It is the most abundant rank of coal, with deposits found around the world, often in rocks of Carboniferous age. Bituminous coal is formed from sub-bituminous coal that is buried deeply enough to be heated to or higher.

Bituminous coal is used primarily for electrical power generation and in the steel industry. Bituminous coal suitable for smelting iron (&quot;coking coal&quot; or &quot;metallurgical coal&quot;) must be low in sulfur and phosphorus. It commands a higher price than other grades of bituminous coal (thermal coal) used for heating and power generation.

Within the coal mining industry, this type of coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous mixture of gases that can cause underground explosions. Extraction of bituminous coal demands the highest safety procedures involving attentive gas monitoring, good ventilation and vigilant site management.

==Properties==

Bituminous coal is a particular &quot;rank&quot; of coal, as determined by the amount and type of carbon present in the coal and the amount of energy it can produce when burned. It is higher in rank than sub-bituminous coal but lower in rank than anthracite. Bituminous coal is the most abundant rank of coal.

Coal rank is based on several characteristics of the coal. The &quot;fixed carbon content&quot; refers to the percentage of the coal that is neither moisture, nor ash, nor volatile matter. When evaluated on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis, the fixed carbon content is the fraction of the coal that is not volatile organic matter. An &quot;agglomerating&quot; coal is a coal that softens when heated, forming a hard, gray, porous coke that resists crushing. &quot;Vitrinite reflectance&quot; is a measure of how reflective a polished surface of an average particle of &quot;vitrinite&quot; in the coal is. It is determined by how much of the carbon has condensed to an aromatic form from the heat and pressure of deep burial.

In the United States, bituminous coal is defined as agglomerating coal yielding at least 10,500 Btu/lb (24,400 kJ/kg) of energy on combustion (on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis), with a fixed carbon content less than 86% (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis.) Coal with a higher fixed carbon content is classified as anthracite, while agglomerating coal yielding less than 10,500 Btu/lb (24,400 kJ/kg) or nonagglomerating coal yielding less than 11,500 Btu/lb (26,700 kJ/kg) is classified as sub-bituminous coal. In the international market, bituminous coal is defined as coal with a vitrinite reflectance between 0.5 and 1.9. Vitrinite reflectance is also routinely measured for U.S. coal as a check on its rank classification

Bituminous coal is dark brown to black, hard, but friable. It is commonly composed of thin bands of alternating bright and dull material. Though bituminous coal varies in its chemical composition, a typical composition is about 84.4% carbon, 5.4% hydrogen, 6.7% oxygen, 1.7% nitrogen, and 1.8% sulfur, on a weight basis. Its bank density (the density of a coal seam prior to breaking up during mining) is about 1346 kg/m3 (84 lb/ft3) while the bulk density of extracted coal is up to 833 kg/m3 (52 lb/ft3). Bituminous coal characteristically burns with a smoky flame and softens and swells during combustion. It gets its name from this tendency to form a softened, sticky mass when heated, which reflects the presence of bitumen (mineral tar) in the coal.

Though almost all agglomerating coal is of bituminous rank, some bituminous coal is not agglomerating. Non-agglomerating bituminous coal includes cannel coal and boghead coal. These are nonbanded and nonreflective, and break with a conchoidal fracture. Both are &quot;sapropelic&quot;, in contrast with most bituminous coal, which is &quot;humic&quot; (composed of decayed woody tissue of plants). Cannel coal is composed mostly of plant spores, while boghead coal is composed mostly of nonspore algal remains.

===Subranks===
In the United States, bituminous coal is further divided into subranks based on its heating value and fixed carbon content.

Thus bituminous coal is divided into high-, medium-, and low-volatile categories based on fixed carbon content, and high-volatile bituminous coal is further subdivided by energy content.

ISO classification of bituminous coal is based on vitrinite reflectance. This classification divides medium rank coal (approximately equivalent to bituminous coal) into four subranks. In order of increasing rank, these are:
* Medium D: Vitrinite reflectance of 0.5 to 0.6. Corresponds approximately to ASTM high volatile C bituminous or sub-bituminous A.
* Medium C: Vitrinite reflectance of 0.6 to 1.0. Corresponds approximately to ASTM high volatile C to high volatile B bituminous.
* Medium B : Vitrinite reflectance of 1.0 to 1.4. Corresponds approximately to ASTM high volatile A to medium volatile bituminous.
* Medium A: Vitrinite reflectance of 1.4 to 2.0. Corresponds approximately to ASTM low volatile bituminous.

==Uses==
Bituminous coal is used primarily for electrical power generation and in the manufacture of steel.

===Coking coal===
Coking coal (metallurgical coal or &quot;met coal&quot;) is used in the manufacture of steel. A good coking coal must have excellent agglomeration properties, a high carbon content, and a low content of sulfur, phosphorus, and ash. The best unblended coking coal is high quality medium-volatile bituminous coal. However, since single coals with all the necessary properties are scarce, coking coal is usually a blend of high-volatile bituminous coal with lesser amounts of medium- and low-volatile bituminous coal.
Smithing coal is bituminous coal of the highest quality, as free of ash and sulfur as possible, used to manufacture coke for use by blacksmiths.

Coking coal commands a higher price than coal used for energy production. , coking coal in the U.S. sold for about , compared with for bituminous coal generally. The cost of coking coal is about 3.5 times as high as the cost of coal used for electrical power (which includes lower ranks of coal, such sub-bituminous coal and lignite, as well as noncoking bituminous coal.)

===Thermal coal===

Bituminous coal which lacks the qualities required for use as metallurgical coal is graded as thermal coal. This is used primarily for electrical power generation. The ideal thermal coal is easily ignited but has a high heat content.

===Activated carbon===
Bituminous coal is used for the production of activated carbon. The coal is first coked, removing volatiles, then steam treated to activate it. Chemical processes for activating coke produced from bituminous coal have also been investigated.

==Origin==

Like other ranks of coal, bituminous coal forms from thick accumulations of dead plant material that are buried faster than they can decay. This usually takes place in peat bogs, where falling plant debris is submerged in standing water. The stagnant water excludes oxygen, creates an acidic environment, and slows decay. The dead plant material is converted to peat.

Peat is mostly a mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin that originally made up the woody tissue of the plants. Lignin has a weight composition of about 54% carbon, 6% hydrogen, and 30% oxygen, while cellulose has a weight composition of about 44% carbon, 6% hydrogen, and 49% oxygen. Bituminous coal has a composition of about 84.4% carbon, 5.4% hydrogen, 6.7% oxygen, 1.7% nitrogen, and 1.8% sulfur, on a weight basis. This implies that chemical processes during coalification remove most of the oxygen and much of the hydrogen, leaving carbon, a process called &quot;carbonization&quot;.

During coalification, the maturing coal increases in carbon content, decreases in hydrogen and volatiles, increases in its heating value, and becomes darker and more lustrous. Chemical changes include dehydration (which removes oxygen and hydrogen as water), decarboxylation (which removes oxygen as carbon dioxide), and demethanation (which removes hydrogen as methane). By the time the coal reaches bituminous rank, most dehydration and decarboxylation has already taken place, and maturation of bituminous coal is characterized by demethanation. During coalification at bituminous rank, coal approaches its maximum heating value and begins to lose most of its volatile content.

As carbonization proceeds, aliphatic compounds (carbon compounds characterized by chains of carbon atoms) are replaced by aromatic compounds (carbon compounds characterized by rings of carbon atoms) and aromatic rings begin to fuse into polyaromatic compounds (linked rings of carbon atoms). The structure increasingly resembles graphene, the structural element of graphite. This is accompanied by an increase in vitrinite reflectance, used to assess coal rank.

During coalification, the pressure of burial reduces the volume of the original peat by a factor of 30 as it is converted to coal. However, the increase in rank of maturing coal mostly reflects the maximum temperature the coal reaches. Neither the maximum pressure, nor the nature of the original plant material, nor the length of burial is nearly as important. The temperature range for maturation of bituminous coal is from . The bitumen that characterizes bituminous coal forms under approximately the same conditions at which petroleum is formed in petroleum source rocks. Bituminization is accompanied by peak methane generation in medium to low volatile bituminous coal. This makes these bituminous coals &quot;gassy&quot; and precautions must be taken against methane explosions. If the coal reaches temperatures above about , bitumen breaks down (&quot;debituminization&quot;) and the coal matures to anthracite.

==Occurrence and production==
Coal deposits are widely distributed worldwide, and range in age from the Devonian (about 360 to 420 million years ago) to Neogene deposits just a few million years old. However, 90% of all coal beds were deposited in the Carboniferous and Permian periods, which represent just 2% of the Earth&#x27;s geologic history. Vast deposits of coal formed in wetlands—called coal forests—that covered much of the Earth&#x27;s tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times. Bituminous coal is predominantly Carboniferous in age.

Most bituminous coal in the United States is between 100 and 300 million years old. Vast deposits of bituminous coal of Pennsylvanian age is found in the Appalachian and Interior Provinces of North America. Mining is done via both surface and underground mines. Historically, the many seams scattered over rugged terrain in the Appalachians have been conducive to mining by small companies, while the great extent and gentle dip of beds further west favors very large-scale operations. The Appalachian coal is notably low in sulfur and is often of metallurgical grade, while the Interior Province coal is much higher in sulfur.

The belt of Carboniferous coal fields extends into central Europe, and much of this is bituminous coal. Bituminous coal fields are found in Poland and the Czech Republic, and the Polish deposits are one of the most important of that nation&#x27;s natural resources. The Czech deposits have been exploited since prehistoric times. The European deposits include the Coal Measures of Britain, which account for most of Britain&#x27;s coal production and which are mostly bituminous coal. The Westfield coal basin is the largest in Britain. Other significant bituminous coal deposits are found through much of Europe, including France, Germany, and northern Italy.
Coal deposition was interrupted by the Permian-Triassic extinction event, but resumed later in the Middle Triassic. Extensive bituminous coal deposits of Permian age are found in Siberia, east Asia, and Australia. These include the Minusinsky coal basin in Siberia, the Queensland, Bowen, and Sydney Basins in Australia, and the extensive bituminous coal reserves of China.

A second peak in coal deposition began in the Cretaceous, though most of this is lower rank coal rather than bituminous. In the United States, Cretaceous bituminous coals occur in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. In Canada, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin of Alberta and British Columbia hosts major deposits of bituminous coal that formed in swamps along the western margin of the Western Interior Seaway. They range in age from latest Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous in the Mist Mountain Formation, to Late Cretaceous in the Gates Formation. The Intermontane and Insular Coalfields of British Columbia also contain deposits of Cretaceous bituminous coal.

, the countries with the greatest estimated ultimately recoverable resources of bituminous coal were the US, 161.6 Gt; India, 99.7 Gt; China, 78.4 Gt; Australia, 51.3 Gt; South Africa, 38.7 Gt; the UK, 26.8 Gt; Germany, 25.2 Gt; Colombia, 7.8 Gt; Indonesia, 5.6 Gt; and France, 4.4 Gt

, total world production of bituminous coal (coking coal plus other bituminous coal) was 6.220 Gt. The leading producer is China, with India and the United States a distant second and third.

U.S. production of bituminous coal was 238 million short tons in 2020 and represented 44% of all U.S. coal production. Bituminous coal is mined in 18 states, but the five states of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, and Indiana produce 74% of U.S. coal.

==Hazards and their mitigation==
Maturation of bituminous coal at medium and low volatile subrank is accompanied by peak methane generation. This makes these bituminous coals &quot;gassy&quot; and precautions must be taken against methane explosions. Imidazolium-based ionic liquid solvents can reduce spontaneous combustion, which accounts for 2 to 3 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions.

Bituminous coal was once extensively used for home heating in the US. However, bituminous coal is a relatively dirty fuel. The reduction in the use of bituminous coal between 1945 and 1960 is estimated to have saved at least 1,923 lives of all ages and 310 infant lives per winter month. Bituminous coal quality is improved with floatation methods, which increase the fraction of vitrinite to yield a cleaner-burning product.

The bioconversion of bituminous coal to methane is being actively researched as a clean coal technology.

<text>An index fund (also index tracker) is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to follow certain preset rules so that it can replicate the performance (&quot;track&quot;) of a specified basket of underlying investments. While index providers often emphasize that they are for-profit organizations, index providers have the ability to act as &quot;reluctant regulators&quot; when determining which companies are suitable for an index. Those rules may include tracking prominent indices like the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average or implementation rules, such as tax-management, tracking error minimization, large block trading or patient/flexible trading strategies that allow for greater tracking error but lower market impact costs. Index funds may also have rules that screen for social and sustainable criteria.

An index fund&#x27;s rules of construction clearly identify the type of companies suitable for the fund. The most commonly known index fund in the United States, the S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, is based on the rules established by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices for their S&amp;P 500 Index. Equity index funds would include groups of stocks with similar characteristics such as the size, value, profitability and/or geographic location of the companies. A group of stocks may include companies from the United States, Non-US Developed, emerging markets or frontier market countries. Additional index funds within these geographic markets may include indexes of companies that include rules based on company characteristics or factors, such as companies that are small, mid-sized, large, small value, large value, small growth, large growth, the level of gross profitability or investment capital, real estate, or indexes based on commodities and fixed-income. Companies are purchased and held within the index fund when they meet the specific index rules or parameters and are sold when they move outside of those rules or parameters. Think of an index fund as an investment utilizing rules-based investing. Some index providers announce changes of the companies in their index before the change date whilst other index providers do not make such announcements.

The main advantage of index funds for investors is they don&#x27;t require much time to manage as the investors don&#x27;t have to spend time analyzing various stocks or stock portfolios. Most investors also find it difficult to beat the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Some legal scholars have previously suggested a value maximization and agency-costs theory for understanding index funds stewardship.
Investors, academicians, and authors such as Warren Buffett, John C. Bogle, Jack Brennan, Paul Samuelson, Burton Malkiel, David Swensen, Benjamin Graham, Gene Fama, William J. Bernstein, and Andrew Tobias have long been strong proponents of index funds.

==Market size==
, index funds made up 20.2% of equity mutual fund assets in the US. Index domestic equity mutual funds and index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have benefited from a trend towards more index-oriented investment products. From 2007 through 2014, index domestic equity mutual funds and ETFs received $1 trillion in new net cash, including reinvested dividends. Index-based domestic equity ETFs have grown particularly quickly, attracting almost twice the flows of index domestic equity mutual funds since 2007. In contrast, actively managed domestic equity mutual funds experienced a net outflow of $659 billion, including reinvested dividends, from 2007 to 2014. Passively managed funds, such as index funds, consistently outperform actively managed funds. 

==Origins==
The first theoretical model for an index fund was suggested in 1960 by Edward Renshaw and Paul Feldstein, both students at the University of Chicago. While their idea for an &quot;Unmanaged Investment Company&quot; garnered little support, it did start off a sequence of events in the 1960s.

Qualidex Fund, Inc., a Florida Corporation, chartered on 05/23/1967 (317247) by Richard A. Beach (BSBA Banking and Finance, University of Florida, 1957) and joined by Walton D. Dutcher Jr., filed a registration statement (2-38624) with the SEC on October 20, 1970 which became effective on July 31, 1972. &quot;The fund organized as an open-end, diversified investment company whose investment objective is to approximate the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Stock Average&quot;, thereby becoming the first index fund.

In 1973, Burton Malkiel wrote &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot;, which presented academic findings for the lay public. It was becoming well known in the popular financial press that most mutual funds were not beating the market indices. Malkiel wrote:

John Bogle graduated from Princeton University in 1951, where his senior thesis was titled &quot;The Economic Role of the Investment Company&quot;. Bogle wrote that his inspiration for starting an index fund came from three sources, all of which confirmed his 1951 research: Paul Samuelson&#x27;s 1974 paper, &quot;Challenge to Judgment&quot;; Charles Ellis&#x27; 1975 study, &quot;The Loser&#x27;s Game&quot;; and Al Ehrbar&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine article on indexing. Bogle founded The Vanguard Group in 1974; as of 2009 it was the largest mutual fund company in the United States.

Bogle started the First Index Investment Trust on December 31, 1975. At the time, it was heavily derided by competitors as being &quot;un-American&quot; and the fund itself was seen as &quot;Bogle&#x27;s folly&quot;. In the first five years of Bogle&#x27;s company, it made 17 million dollars. Fidelity Investments Chairman Edward Johnson was quoted as saying that he &quot;[couldn&#x27;t] believe that the great mass of investors are going to be satisfied with receiving just average returns&quot;. Bogle&#x27;s fund was later renamed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which tracks the Standard and Poor&#x27;s 500 Index. It started with comparatively meager assets of $11 million but crossed the $100 billion milestone in November 1999; this astonishing increase was funded by the market&#x27;s increasing willingness to invest in such a product. Bogle predicted in January 1992 that it would very likely surpass the Magellan Fund before 2001, which it did in 2000.

John McQuown and David G. Booth of Wells Fargo, and Rex Sinquefield of the American National Bank in Chicago, established the first two Standard and Poor&#x27;s Composite Index Funds in 1973. Both of these funds were established for institutional clients; individual investors were excluded. Wells Fargo started with $5 million from their own pension fund, while Illinois Bell put in $5 million of their pension funds at American National Bank. In 1971, Jeremy Grantham and Dean LeBaron at Batterymarch Financial Management &quot;described the idea at a Harvard Business School seminar in 1971, but found no takers until 1973. Two years later, in December 1974, the firm finally attracted its first index client.&quot;

In 1981, Booth and Sinquefield started Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), and McQuown joined its board of directors. DFA further developed indexed-based investment strategies. Vanguard started its first bond index fund in 1986.

Frederick L. A. Grauer at Wells Fargo harnessed McQuown and Booth&#x27;s indexing theories, which led to Wells Fargo&#x27;s pension funds managing over $69 billion in 1989 and over $565 billion in 1998. In 1996, Wells Fargo sold its indexing operation to Barclays Bank of London, which it operated under the name Barclays Global Investors (BGI). Blackrock, Inc. acquired BGI in 2009; the acquisition included BGI&#x27;s index fund management (both its institutional funds and its iShares ETF business) and its active management.

==Economic theory==
Economist Eugene Fama said, &quot;I take the market efficiency hypothesis to be the simple statement that security prices fully reflect all available information.&quot; 
A precondition for this &quot;strong version&quot; of the hypothesis is that information and trading costs, the costs of getting prices to reflect information, are always 0.
A weaker and economically more sensible version of the efficiency hypothesis says that prices reflect information to the point where the marginal benefits of acting on information (the profits to be made) do not exceed marginal costs.

Economists cite the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) as the fundamental premise that justifies the creation of the index funds. The hypothesis implies that fund managers and stock analysts are constantly looking for securities that may out-perform the market; and that this competition is so effective that any new information about the fortune of a company will rapidly be incorporated into stock prices. It is postulated therefore that it is very difficult to tell ahead of time which stocks will out-perform the market. By creating an index fund that mirrors the whole market the inefficiencies of stock selection are avoided.

In particular, the EMH says that economic profits cannot be wrung from stock picking. This is not to say that a stock picker cannot achieve a superior return, just that the excess return will on average not exceed the costs of winning it (including salaries, information costs, and trading costs). The conclusion is that most investors would be better off buying a cheap index fund. Note that return refers to the ex-ante expectation; ex-post realisation of payoffs may make some stock-pickers appear successful. In addition, there have been many criticisms of the EMH.

==Tracking==
Tracking can be achieved by trying to hold all of the securities in the index, in the same proportions as the index. Other methods include statistically sampling the market and holding &quot;representative&quot; securities. Many index funds rely on a computer model with little or no human input in the decision as to which securities are purchased or sold and are thus subject to a form of passive management.

==Fees==
The lack of active management generally gives the advantage of much lower fees compared to actively managed mutual funds and, in taxable accounts, lower taxes. In addition it is usually impossible to precisely mirror the index as the models for sampling and mirroring, by their nature, cannot be 100% accurate. The difference between the index performance and the fund performance is called the &quot;tracking error&quot;, or, colloquially, &quot;jitter&quot;.

Index funds are available from many investment managers. Some common indices include the S&amp;P 500, the Nikkei 225, and the FTSE 100. Less common indexes come from academics like Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, who created &quot;research indexes&quot; in order to develop asset pricing models, such as their Three Factor Model. The Fama–French three-factor model is used by Dimensional Fund Advisors to design their index funds. Robert Arnott and Professor Jeremy Siegel have also created new competing fundamentally based indexes based on such criteria as dividends, earnings, book value, and sales.

==Indexing methods==

===Traditional indexing===
Indexing is traditionally known as the practice of owning a representative collection of securities, in the same ratios as the target index. Modification of security holdings happens only periodically, when companies enter or leave the target index.

===Synthetic indexing===
Synthetic indexing is a modern technique of using a combination of equity index futures contracts and investments in low-risk bonds to replicate the performance of a similar overall investment in the equities making up the index. Although maintaining the future position has a slightly higher cost structure than traditional passive sampling, synthetic indexing can result in more favourable tax treatment, particularly for international investors who are subject to U.S. dividend withholding taxes. The bond portion can hold higher yielding instruments, with a trade-off of corresponding higher risk.

===Enhanced indexing===
Enhanced indexing is a catch-all term referring to improvements to index fund management that emphasize performance, possibly using active management. Enhanced index funds employ a variety of enhancement techniques, including customized indexes (instead of relying on commercial indexes), trading strategies, exclusion rules, and timing strategies. The cost advantage of indexing could be reduced or eliminated by employing active management. Enhanced indexing strategies help in offsetting the proportion of tracking error that would come from expenses and transaction costs. These enhancement strategies can be:
* Lower cost, issue selection, yield curve positioning.
* Sector and quality positioning and call exposure positioning.

==Advantages==

===Low costs===
Because the composition of a target index is a known quantity, relative to actively managed funds, it costs less to run an index fund. Typically expense ratios of an index fund range from 0.10% for U.S. Large Company Indexes to 0.70% for Emerging Market Indexes. The expense ratio of the average large cap actively managed mutual fund as of 2015 is 1.15%. If a mutual fund produces 10% return before expenses, taking account of the expense ratio difference would result in an after expense return of 9.9% for the large cap index fund versus 8.85% for the actively managed large cap fund.

===Simplicity===
The investment objectives of index funds are easy to understand. Once an investor knows the target index of an index fund, what securities the index fund will hold can be determined directly. Managing one&#x27;s index fund holdings may be as easy as every six months or every year.

===Lower turnovers===
Turnover refers to the selling and buying of securities by the fund manager. Selling securities in some jurisdictions may result in capital gains tax charges, which are sometimes passed on to fund investors. Even in the absence of taxes, turnover has both explicit and implicit costs, which directly reduce returns on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Because index funds are passive investments, the turnovers tend to be lower than actively managed funds.

===No style drift===
Style drift occurs when actively managed mutual funds go outside of their described style (i.e., mid-cap value, large cap income, etc.) to increase returns. Such drift hurts portfolios that are built with diversification as a high priority. Drifting into other styles could reduce the overall portfolio&#x27;s diversity and subsequently increase risk. With an index fund, this drift is not possible and accurate diversification of a portfolio is increased.

==Disadvantages==

===Losses to arbitrageurs===
Index funds must periodically &quot;rebalance&quot; or adjust their portfolios to match the new prices and market capitalization of the underlying securities in the stock or other indexes that they track. This allows algorithmic traders (80% of the trades of whom involve the top 20% most popular securities) to perform index arbitrage by anticipating and trading ahead of stock price movements caused by mutual fund rebalancing, making a profit on foreknowledge of the large institutional block orders. This results in profits transferred from investors to algorithmic traders, estimated to be at least 21 to 28 basis points annually for S&amp;P 500 index funds, and at least 38 to 77 basis points per year for Russell 2000 funds. In effect, an index, and consequently, all funds tracking an index are announcing ahead of time the trades that they are planning to make, allowing value to be siphoned by arbitrageurs, in a legal practice known as &quot;index front running&quot;. Algorithmic high-frequency traders all have advanced access to the index re-balancing information, and spend large sums on fast technology to compete against each other to be the first—often by a few microseconds—to make these arbitrages. Losses to arbitrageurs appear as &quot;tracking error&quot;, the difference between the performance of the index and the fund which is attempting to follow it.

John Montgomery of Bridgeway Capital Management says that the resulting &quot;poor investor returns&quot; from trading ahead of mutual funds is &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; that &quot;shockingly, people are not talking about.&quot; Related &quot;time zone arbitrage&quot; against mutual funds and their underlying securities traded on overseas markets is likely &quot;damaging to financial integration between the United States, Asia and Europe.&quot;

===Common market impact===
One problem occurs when a large amount of money tracks the &quot;same&quot; index. According to theory, a company should not be worth more when it is in an index. But due to supply and demand, a company being added can have a demand shock, and a company being deleted can have a supply shock, and this will change the price. This does not show up in tracking error since the index is also affected. A fund may experience less impact by tracking a less popular index.

===Possible tracking error from index===
Since index funds aim to match market returns, both under- and over-performance compared to the market is considered a &quot;tracking error&quot;. For example, an inefficient index fund may generate a positive tracking error in a falling market by holding too much cash, which holds its value compared to the market.

According to The Vanguard Group, a well-run S&amp;P 500 index fund should have a tracking error of 5 basis points or less, but a Morningstar survey found an average of 38 basis points across all index funds.
===Asset manager capitalism===
Benjamin Braun suggests that, since American stock ownership is concentrated on few big asset managers which are very diversified and do not have a direct interest in the performance of the companies, this emerging &quot;asset manager capitalism&quot; is distinct from the earlier shareholder primacy.
The asset managers usually vote with company managers.
Also, as funds invest in most companies in the sector, they would benefit from monopolistic prices.
In an extreme case, there could be economy-wide monopolies where asset managers have &quot;bought the economy&quot;.
In a regime of common ownership, while asset ownership is diversified, it is a small part of the population who invest in funds and a top 1% of the wealth distribution owning 50% of corporate equity and mutual funds.
Wage stagnation would be an expected externality.
Asset managers have an incentive to increase the assets value and influence monetary policy.

==Diversification==
Diversification refers to the number of different securities in a fund. A fund with more securities is said to be better diversified than a fund with smaller number of securities. Owning many securities reduces volatility by decreasing the impact of large price swings above or below the average return in a single security. A Wilshire 5000 index would be considered diversified, but a bio-tech ETF would not.

Since some indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100, are dominated by large company stocks, an index fund may have a high percentage of the fund concentrated in a few large companies. This position represents a reduction of diversity and can lead to increased volatility and investment risk for an investor who seeks a diversified fund.

Some advocate adopting a strategy of investing in every security in the world in proportion to its market capitalization, generally by investing in a collection of ETFs in proportion to their home country market capitalization. A global indexing strategy may have lower variance in returns than one based only on home market indexes, because there may be less correlation between the returns of companies operating in different markets than between companies operating in the same market.

==Asset allocation and achieving balance==
Asset allocation is the process of determining the mix of stocks, bonds and other classes of investable assets to match the investor&#x27;s risk capacity, which includes attitude towards risk, net income, net worth, knowledge about investing concepts, and time horizon. Index funds capture asset classes in a low-cost and tax-efficient manner and are used to design balanced portfolios.

A combination of various index mutual funds or ETFs could be used to implement a full range of investment policies from low to high risk.

==Pension investment in index funds==

Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) suggests that up to 15% of overall assets held by large pension funds and national social security funds are invested in various forms of passive strategies including index funds, as opposed to the more traditional actively managed that still constitute the largest share of institutional investments The proportion invested in passive funds varies widely across jurisdictions and fund type.

The relative appeal of index funds, ETFs and other index-replicating investment vehicles has grown rapidly for various reasons ranging from disappointment with underperforming actively managed mandates to the broader tendency towards cost reduction across public services and social benefits that followed the 2008-2012 Great Recession. Public-sector pensions and national reserve funds have been among the early adopters of index funds and other passive management strategies.

==Comparison of index funds with index ETFs==

In the United States, mutual funds price their assets by their current value every business day, usually at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, when the New York Stock Exchange closes for the day. Index ETFs, in contrast, are priced during normal trading hours, usually 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. Index ETFs are also sometimes weighted by revenue rather than market capitalization.

== Tax considerations ==
=== International tax considerations ===
Typically mutual funds supply the correct tax reporting documents for only one country, which can cause tax problems for shareholders citizen to or resident of another country, either now or in the future.

==== Implications for US investors ====
US citizens/taxpayers living at home or abroad should particularly consider whether their investment in an ex-US fund (meaning the fund is administered by a foreign investment company) not providing annual 1099 forms (which report distributed income and capital gains/losses) or annual PFIC annual information statements will be subject to punitive US taxation under section 1291 of the US tax code. Note that if a PFIC annual information statement is provided, a careful filing of form 8621 is required to avoid punitive US taxation.

=== U.S. capital gains tax considerations ===
U.S. mutual funds are required by law to distribute realized capital gains to their shareholders. If a mutual fund sells a security for a gain, the capital gain is taxable for that year; similarly a realized capital loss can offset any other realized capital gains.

Scenario: An investor entered a mutual fund during the middle of the year and experienced an overall loss for the next six months. The mutual fund itself sold securities for a gain for the year, therefore must declare a capital gains distribution. The IRS would require the investor to pay tax on the capital gains distribution, regardless of the overall loss.

A small investor selling an ETF to another investor does not cause a redemption on ETF itself; therefore, ETFs are more immune to the effect of forced redemption causing realized capital gains.

<text>Domus Dei (Hospital of Saint Nicholas and Saint John the Baptist) was an almshouse and hospice at Old Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. It is now also known as the Royal Garrison Church and is an English Heritage property and a Grade II listed building.

== History ==
The hospice was established by Peter des Roches (sometimes wrongly named as de Rupibus), Bishop of Winchester and William of Wrotham in around 1212 A.D.

In 1450 an unpopular advisor to the king, Bishop Adam Moleyns of Chichester was conducting a service at the chapel of Domus Dei when a number of naval seamen (resentful of being only partially paid and only provided with limited provisions) burst into the church, dragged out the bishop and murdered him.

As a result of this the entire town of Portsmouth was placed under the Greater Excommunication, an interdict which lasted until 1508, removed at the request of Bishop Foxe of Winchester.

In 1540, like many other chantry buildings, it was seized by King Henry VIII and until 1560 was used as an armoury. After 1560, a mansion built close by the south-side became the home of the local military governor.

In 1662 the mansion hosted the wedding of King Charles II and Princess Catherine of Braganza.

Towards the end of the seventeenth century it fell into disrepair until it was restored in 1767 to become the Garrison church. Once again, the Church fell into disrepair and in 1865 a new restoration project began under the direction of G. E. Street which lasted ten years.

On 10 January 1941 the buildings of Domus Dei were partially destroyed in an attack by German bombers, when all the stained glass windows were blown out and the nave was rendered roofless by incendiary bombs and a single high explosive bomb. New glazing was subsequently fitted. Apart from the East window with its traditional design, all the other windows show much of the British Army&#x27;s relationship to the Church and the City of Portsmouth. The chancel is intact, but the nave remains roofless.

The aisles but not the central nave were re-roofed in 1995. In October 2021, the building was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

<text>Auguste Antoine Piccard (28 January 1884 – 24 March 1962) was a Swiss physicist, inventor and explorer known for his record-breaking hydrogen balloon flights, with which he studied the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and became the first person to enter the Stratosphere. Piccard was also known for his invention of the first bathyscaphe, &quot;FNRS-2&quot;, with which he made a number of unmanned dives in 1948 to explore the ocean&#x27;s depths.

Piccard&#x27;s twin brother Jean Felix Piccard is also a notable figure in the annals of science and exploration, as are a number of their relatives, including Jacques Piccard, Bertrand Piccard, Jeannette Piccard and Don Piccard.

==Biography==
Piccard and his twin brother Jean Felix Piccard were born in Basel, Switzerland, on 28 January 1884.

Showing an intense interest in science as a child, he attended the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich and became a professor of physics in Brussels at the Free University of Brussels in 1922, the same year his son Jacques Piccard was born. He was a member of the Solvay Congress of 1922, 1924, 1927, 1930 and 1933.

In 1930, an interest in ballooning and a curiosity about the upper atmosphere led him to design a spherical, pressurized aluminum gondola that would allow ascent to a great altitude without requiring a pressure suit. Supported by the Belgian &quot;Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique&quot; (FNRS), Piccard constructed his gondola.
An important motivation for his research in the upper atmosphere was measurements of cosmic radiation, which were supposed to give experimental evidence for the theories of Albert Einstein, whom Piccard knew from the Solvay conferences and who was a fellow alumnus of ETH.

On 27 May 1931, Auguste Piccard and Paul Kipfer took off from Augsburg, Germany in a hydrogen balloon, and reached a record altitude of (FAI Record File Number 10634). During this flight, they became the first human beings to enter the stratosphere, and were able to gather substantial data on the upper atmosphere, as well as measure cosmic rays.

In the mid-1930s, Piccard&#x27;s interests shifted when he realized that a modification of his high-altitude balloon cockpit would allow descent into the deep ocean. By 1937, he had designed the bathyscaphe, a small steel gondola built to withstand great external pressure. Construction began, but was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Resuming work in 1945, he completed the bubble-shaped cockpit that maintained normal air pressure for a person inside the capsule even as the water pressure outside increased to over . Above the heavy steel capsule, a large flotation tank was attached and filled with a low density liquid for buoyancy. Liquids are relatively incompressible and can provide buoyancy that does not change as the pressure increases. And so, the huge tank was filled with gasoline, not as a fuel, but as flotation. To make the now floating craft sink, tons of iron were attached to the float with a release mechanism to allow resurfacing. This craft was named &quot;FNRS-2&quot; and made a number of unmanned dives in 1948 before being given to the French Navy in 1950. There, it was redesigned, and in 1954, it took a man safely down . 

Piccard and his son, Jacques, built a second bathyscaphe and together they dove to a record-breaking depth of in 1953.

Auguste Piccard died on 24 March 1962 of a heart attack at his home in Lausanne, Switzerland; he was 78 years old.

== References in popular culture ==
* Auguste Piccard was the inspiration for Professor Cuthbert Calculus in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Piccard held a teaching appointment in Brussels where Hergé spotted his unmistakable figure in the street. This connection was confirmed by Hergé in an interview with Numa Sadoul:
* Gene Roddenberry named Captain Jean-Luc Picard in &quot;Star Trek&quot; after one or both of the twin brothers Auguste and Jean Felix Piccard, and derived &quot;Jean-Luc Picard&quot; from their names.
* Will Gregory&#x27;s opera, &quot;Piccard in Space&quot;, premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on 31 March 2011. The libretto, by Hattie Naylor, focuses on Auguste Piccard&#x27;s first balloon ascent with his assistant Paul Kipfer, and on the theories of Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton, who both appear as characters in the drama.
* In 2016, the exploits of Piccard and his son Jacques were featured in an American television commercial for Hennessy cognac.

<text>Reproductive technology encompasses all current and anticipated uses of technology in human and animal reproduction, including assisted reproductive technology (ART), contraception and others. It is also termed Assisted Reproductive Technology, where it entails an array of appliances and procedures that enable the realization of safe, improved and healthier reproduction. While this is not true of all people, for an array of married couples, the ability to have children is vital. But through the technology, infertile couples have been provided with options that would allow them to conceive children.

==Overview==
===Assisted reproductive technology===

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is the use of reproductive technology to treat low fertility or infertility. Modern technology can provide infertile couples with assisted reproductive technologies. The natural method of reproduction has become only one of many new techniques used today. There are millions of couples that do not have the ability to reproduce on their own because of infertility and therefore, must resort to these new techniques. The main causes of infertility are that of hormonal malfunctions and anatomical abnormalities. ART is currently the only form of assistance for individuals who, for the time being, can only conceive through surrogacy methods). Examples of ART include &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization (IVF) and its possible expansions, including:

* artificial insemination
* artificial reproduction
* cloning (see human cloning for the special case of human beings)
* cytoplasmic transfer
* cryopreservation of sperm, oocytes, embryos
* embryo transfer
* fertility medication
* hormone treatment
* in vitro fertilization
* intracytoplasmic sperm injection
*in vitro generated gametes
* preimplantation genetic diagnosis

=== Role of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) ===
In 1981, after the birth of Elizabeth Carr, the first baby in the United States to be conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF). Her birth gave hope to many couples struggling with infertility. Dr. Howard Jones brought together the leading practitioners of the five US-based IVF programs (Norfolk, Vanderbilt, University of Texas at Houston, and the University of Southern California, Yale) to discuss the establishment of a national registry for in vitro fertilization attempts and outcomes. 2 years later, in 1985 the society for assisted reproductive technology (SART) was founded as a special interest entity within the American Fertility Society. SART has not only informed the evolution of infertility care but also improved success of antiretroviral therapy.

===Prognostics===
Reproductive technology can inform family planning by providing individual prognoses regarding the likelihood of pregnancy. It facilitates the monitoring of ovarian reserve, follicular dynamics and associated biomarkers in females, as well as semen analysis in males.

===Contraception===

Contraception, also known as &quot;birth control&quot;, is a form of reproductive technology that enables people to prevent pregnancy. There are many forms of contraception, but the term covers any method or device which is intended to prevent pregnancy in a sexually active woman. Methods are intended to &quot;prevent the fertilization of an egg or implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus.&quot; Different forms of birth control have been around since ancient times, but widely available effective and safe methods only became available during the mid-1900s.

===Others===
The following reproductive techniques are not currently in routine clinical use; most are still undergoing development: 
*artificial wombs
* germinal choice technology
* &quot;in vitro&quot; parthenogenesis
* reprogenetics

====Same-sex procreation====
Research is currently investigating the possibility of same-sex procreation, which would produce offspring with equal genetic contributions from either two females or two males. This form of reproduction has become a possibility through the creation of either female sperm (containing the genetic material of a female) or male eggs (containing the genetic material of a male). Same-sex procreation would remove the need for lesbian and gay couples to rely on a third party donation of a sperm or an egg for reproduction.
The first significant development occurred in 1991, in a patent application filed by U.Penn. scientists to fix male sperm by extracting some sperm, correcting a genetic defect in vitro, and injecting the sperm back into the male&#x27;s testicles. While the vast majority of the patent application dealt with male sperm, one line suggested that the procedure would work with XX cells, i.e., cells from an adult woman to make female sperm.

In the two decades that followed, the idea of female sperm became more of a reality. In 1997, scientists partially confirmed such techniques by creating chicken female sperm in a similar manner. They did so by injecting blood stem cells from an adult female chicken into a male chicken&#x27;s testicles. In 2004, other Japanese scientists created two female offspring by combining the eggs of two adult mice.

In 2008, research was done specifically for methods on creating human female sperm using artificial or natural Y chromosomes and testicular transplantation. A UK-based group predicted they would be able to create human female sperm within five years. So far no conclusive successes have been achieved.

In 2018 Chinese research scientists produced 29 viable mice offspring from two mother mice by creating sperm-like structures from haploid Embryonic stem cells using gene editing to alter imprinted regions of DNA. They were unable to get viable offspring from two fathers. Experts noted that there was little chance of these techniques being applied to humans in the near future.

== Ethics ==

Recent technological advances in fertility treatments introduce ethical problems, such as the affordability of the various procedures. The exorbitant prices can limit who has access. The cost of performing ART per live birth varies among countries. The average cost per IVF cycle in the United States is USD 9,266. However, the cost per live birth for autologous ART treatment cycles in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom ranged from approximately USD 33,000 to 41,000 compared to USD 24,000 to 25,000 in Scandinavia, Japan, and Australia

The funding structure for IVF/ART is highly variable among different nations. For example, no federal government reimbursement exists for IVF in the United States, although certain states have insurance mandates for ART

Many issues of reproductive technology have given rise to bioethical issues, since technology often alters the assumptions that lie behind existing systems of sexual and reproductive morality. Other ethical considerations arise with the application of ART to women of advanced maternal age, who have higher changes of medical complications (including pre-eclampsia), and possibly in the future its application to post-menopausal women. Also, ethical issues of human enhancement arise when reproductive technology has evolved to be a potential technology for not only reproductively inhibited people but even for otherwise re-productively healthy people.

==In fiction==

*Films and other fiction depicting contemporary emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.
*Science fiction has tackled the themes of creating life through non-conventional methods since Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. In the 20th century, Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932) was the first major fictional work to anticipate the possible social consequences of reproductive technology. Its largely negative view was reversed when the author revisited the same themes in his utopian final novel, &quot;Island&quot; (1962).

== Advancements in Reproductive Technology ==
Cryopreservation of Oocytes

Cryopreservation techniques have significantly evolved in recent decades, enabling the long-term storage of human oocytes and embryos for fertility preservation. The introduction of vitrification, a rapid-freezing method that prevents the formation of ice crystals, has markedly improved post-thaw survival rates and oocyte viability. This method employs high concentrations of cryoprotectants to ensure cellular integrity while maintaining spindle structure and chromosomal alignment.

* Applications: Vitrification is widely used in cancer patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatments, women delaying childbearing for personal or medical reasons, and individuals participating in donor egg programs.
* Challenges: Despite its efficacy, vitrification necessitates precise protocols to mitigate osmotic stress during the introduction and removal of cryoprotectants. Research continues to focus on optimizing cryoprotectant formulations and reducing toxicity.

Ovarian Reserve Assessment

Accurate assessment of ovarian reserve has become a cornerstone of individualized reproductive treatment plans. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) are the primary markers used to evaluate the remaining oocyte pool. AMH, secreted by granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles, offers a cycle-independent, minimally invasive method for predicting ovarian response in assisted reproductive technology (ART).

* Age-Related Decline: Ovarian reserve diminishes progressively with age, with a notable acceleration after the mid-30s. This decline impacts both the quantity and chromosomal quality of oocytes, emphasizing the importance of early fertility counseling.
* Emerging Technologies: Advances in molecular biology, such as single-cell transcriptomics, are being explored to refine ovarian reserve assessments and predict reproductive outcomes more accurately.

Ethical Considerations

The use of reproductive technologies, particularly for non-medical fertility preservation, has raised ethical questions. Critics argue that societal pressures may drive unnecessary interventions, while proponents highlight the empowerment of individuals in making reproductive choices. Balancing accessibility and ethical integrity remains a key challenge for the field.

<text>Meridian is the eighth most populous city in the U.S. state of Mississippi, with a population of 35,052 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Lauderdale County and the principal city of the Meridian, Mississippi Micropolitan Statistical Area. Along major highways, the city is east of Jackson; southwest of Birmingham, Alabama; northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana; and southeast of Memphis, Tennessee.

Established in 1860, at the junction of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi, Meridian built an economy based on the railways and goods transported on them, and it became a strategic trading center. During the Civil War, General William Tecumseh Sherman burned much of the city to the ground in the Battle of Meridian (February 1864). Rebuilt after the war, the city entered a &quot;Golden Age&quot;. It became the largest city in Mississippi between 1890 and 1930, and a leading center for manufacturing in the South, with 44 trains arriving and departing daily. Union Station, built in 1906, is now a multi-modal center, with access to Amtrak and Greyhound Buses averaging 242,360 passengers per year. Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry, the city has diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010. The population within the city limits, according to 2008 census estimates, is 38,232, but a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force, feeds the economy of the city.

The area is served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which employ over 4,000 people. NAS Meridian is home to the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state. Students in Training Air Wing ONE (Strike Flight Training) train in the T-45C Goshawk training jet. Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in 1935. The field is now home to the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non-military employer in the region, employing 2,610 people. Among the city&#x27;s many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center, the Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries, one for whites and one for African Americans. The Carnegie Branch Library, now demolished, was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era.

The Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Experience (the MAX) is located in downtown Meridian. Jimmie Rodgers, the &quot;Father of Country Music&quot;, was born in Meridian. Highland Park houses a museum which displays memorabilia of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam-engine era. The park is also home to the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel, a National Historic Landmark. It is the world&#x27;s only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence.

Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan Akin; James Chaney, an activist who was one of three civil rights workers murdered in 1964; singer Paul Davis; and Hartley Peavey, founder of Peavey Electronics headquartered in Meridian. The federal courthouse was the site of the 1966–1967 trial of suspects in the murder of Chaney and two other activists. For the first time, an all-white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Previously inhabited by the Choctaw Native Americans, the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian removal. After the treaty was ratified, European-American settlers began to move into the area.

After receiving a federal land grant of about , Richard McLemore, the first settler of Meridian, began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area. Most of McLemore&#x27;s land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. Ragsdale, a lawyer from Alabama. John T. Ball, a merchant from Kemper County, bought the remaining . Ragsdale and Ball, now known as the founders of the city, began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections.

There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement. Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name &quot;Meridian,&quot; believing the term to be synonymous with &quot;junction&quot;; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred &quot;Sowashee&quot; (meaning &quot;mad river&quot; in Choctaw, from the name of a nearby creek); and Ragsdale proposed &quot;Ragsdale City.&quot; Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between &quot;Meridian&quot; and &quot;Sowashee&quot; each day. Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left &quot;Meridian&quot; on the station permanently. The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10, 1860.

=== Civil War and Reconstruction era ===
At the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Meridian was still a small village. But the Confederates made use of its strategic position at the railroad junction and constructed several military installations there to support the war. During the Battle of Meridian in 1864, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman led troops into the city, destroying the railroads in every direction, as well as an arsenal and immense storehouses; his forces burned many of the buildings to the ground. Sherman is reported to have said afterwards, &quot;Meridian, with its depots, store-houses, arsenal, hospitals, offices, hotels, and cantonments no longer exists.&quot; Despite the destruction, workers rapidly repaired the railroad lines and they were back in operation 26 working days after the battle.

Race relations were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen being allowed to choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.

=== Golden Age and the Great Depression ===
The town boomed in the aftermath of the Civil War, and experienced its &quot;Golden Age&quot; from 1880 to 1910. The railroads in the area provided for both passenger transportation and industrial needs, stimulating industry, businesses and a population boom. Related commercial activity increased in the downtown area. Between 1890 and 1930, Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South.

The wealth generated by this strong economy resulted in residents constructing many fine buildings, now preserved as historic structures, including the Grand Opera House in 1890, the Wechsler School in 1894, two Carnegie libraries in 1913, and the Threefoot Building, Meridian&#x27;s tallest skyscraper, in 1929.

The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government&#x27;s efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s. Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression, the city continued to attract new businesses. With escapism becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression, the S. H. Kress &amp; Co. building, built to &quot;provide luxury to the common man,&quot; opened in downtown Meridian, as did the Temple Theater, which was first used as a movie house. The federal courthouse was built in 1933 as a WPA project.

After a brief slowdown of the economy at the end of the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region&#x27;s rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city&#x27;s population declined as workers left for other areas.

=== Civil Rights movement ===
During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a community center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans in the area to prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.

Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of &quot;depriving the victims of their civil rights&quot;. Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted &quot;a white official in a civil rights killing.&quot;

In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service.

=== Modern history ===
Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985.
Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown. This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian&#x27;s Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann&#x27;s Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the &quot;Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.&quot;

After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.

===Hotels===
Given Meridian&#x27;s site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels. Even before Meridian reached its &quot;Golden Age,&quot; several large hotels, including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels, were built before the start of the 20th century. With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906, many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers. The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905, and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910. Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907, and Union Hotel was built in 1908. Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District.

As the city grew, the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy, as evidenced by the 11-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The E.F. Young Hotel was built in 1931. A staple in the African-American business district that developed west of the city&#x27;s core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.

As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, most hotels moved outside of downtown. Rehabilitation of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel. The Threefoot Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose, but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations. The Threefoot Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building&#x27;s renovation, featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events.

===Historic districts===
Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts, the Meridian Urban Center Historic District and the Union Station Historic District. Many architectural styles are present in the districts, most from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Italianate, Art Deco, Late Victorian, and bungalow. The districts are:

 East End Historic District – roughly bounded by 18th St, 11th Ave, 14th St, 14th Ave, 5th St, and 17th Ave.

 Highlands Historic District – roughly bounded by 15th St, 34th Ave, 19th St, and 36th Ave.

 Meridian Downtown Historic District – runs from the former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad north to 6th St between 18th and 26th Ave, excluding Ragsdale Survey Block 71.

: Meridian Urban Center Historic District – roughly bounded by 21st and 25th Aves, 6th St, and the railroad.

: Union Station Historic District – roughly bounded by 18th and 19th Aves, 5th St, and the railroad.

Along major highways, the city is east of Jackson, Mississippi; west of Birmingham, Alabama; northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana; southeast of Memphis, Tennessee; and west of Atlanta, Georgia. The area surrounding the city is covered with oak and pine forests, and its topography consists of clay hills and the bottom lands of the head waters of the Chickasawhay River.

The natural terrain of the area has been modified in the urban core of the city by grading, but maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city, and small lakes and woodlands lie in the northern and southern portions of the city. Sowashee Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and is fed by Gallagher&#x27;s Creek, which flows through the center of the city. Loper&#x27;s Creek runs through the far-western part of the city, while smaller creeks including Shearer&#x27;s Branch, Magnolia Creek, and Robbins Creek are dispersed throughout the city.

These are most common during the spring months with a secondary peak during the fall months. These storms also bring the risk of tornadoes. 

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 35,052 people, 15,947 households, and 9,285 families residing in the city.

The city&#x27;s growth has reflected the push and pull of many social and economic factors. The total population increased in each census from the city&#x27;s founding until 1970, although varying from rates as high as 165% to as low as 0.2%. In the 1970 census the population decreased, then slightly increased by 1980, after which the population slowly declined, increasing again since the turn of the 21st century. Between 1980 and 2000, the population declined more than 14%. As of the census of 2000, the city&#x27;s population was 39,968, and the population density was . In 2008, the city was the sixth largest in the state. The population increased as of 2010.

Meridian is the principal city in the Meridian micropolitan area, which as of 2009 consisted of three counties – Clarke, Kemper, and Lauderdale – and had a population of 106,139. There is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius.

While the overall population growth of the city has varied, there has been a steady growth in the number and percentage of non-white residents. The only decline in this group was between 1960 and 1970, when the city&#x27;s overall population declined markedly. In the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of the city was 61.55% African American, 35.71% White, 0.9% Asian, 0.2% Native American, &lt;0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.59% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.75% of the population.
According to the 2000 Census, of the 17,890 housing units inside city limits, 15,966 were occupied, 10,033 of them by families. 31.1% of occupied households had children under the age of 18, 36.2% were married couples living together, 23.3% consisted of a female householder with no husband present, and 37.2% were non-families. 33.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 3.06. The average household size has steadily decreased since 1970, when it was 3.04. Meridian&#x27;s median age has increased from 30.4 in 1970 to 34.6 in 2000.

The median income for a household in the city was $25,085, and the median income for a family was $31,062. Males had a median income of $29,404 versus $19,702 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,255. About 24.6% of families and 28.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.8% of those under age 18 and 22.0% of those age 65 or over.

===Religion===
The population of Meridian and its surrounds is fairly observant, with 65.2% of Lauderdale County affiliated with some type of religious congregation, compared to the national average of 50.2%. Of the affiliated in 2000, 30,068 (59.0%) were in the Southern Baptist Convention, 9,469 (18.6%) were with the United Methodist Church, and 1,872 (3.7%) were associated with the Catholic Church.

Immigrant Jews from Germany and eastern Europe were influential in commercial development of the city, building businesses and services. Congregation Beth Israel was founded in 1868, just before the city&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age.&quot; Meridian once had the largest Jewish community in the state, with 575 Jewish people living in the city in 1927. Today, fewer than 40 Jews live in Meridian, most of whom are elderly. Romani people also call Meridian home, including Kelly Mitchell, Queen of the Gipsy Nation, from whom the city may have derived the nickname &quot;Queen City&quot;.

==Economy==

Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city&#x27;s economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.

Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in 1996 by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April 2010, the city&#x27;s civilian labor force was only 15,420 people, there is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County&#x27;s workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles.

In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,465 people, followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943. There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. In December 2010, Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882.

Retail is another major employer in the county, with 5,280 people employed in April 2010. Nearly $2 billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city. The Uptown Meridian offers over one hundred shopping venues, including department stores, specialty shops, restaurants, eateries, and United Artists Theatres. Phase I of the construction of Meridian Crossroads, a shopping center in the Bonita Lakes area, was completed in November 2007, providing a major boost to retail in the area. Also, the shopping district on North Hills Street has continued to expand, and in March 2007, additional retail and office space was opened near the Highway 19 Walmart Supercenter.

The area is also served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which supply over 4,000 jobs to residents of the surrounding area. NAS Meridian provides training for naval carrier pilots and other enlisted personnel. Also housed at the base is the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA), which provides narcotics training for law enforcement in many southeastern states. Containing the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state, the city is the leader in a nine county regional response team and a twenty-nine county regional response task force. Key Field is the site of the famous flight by brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in 1935. Key Field is now home to the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. The site also contains an exhibit reviewing the history of aviation, and is the home of Meridian&#x27;s Aviation Museum.

The total manufacturing employment of Lauderdale County in April 2010 was 2,850 people. Peavey Electronics Corporation, which has manufactured guitars, amplifiers, and sound equipment since 1965, operates its headquarters in the city. Other businesses in the area include Avery Dennison, Structural Steel Services, Bimbo Bakeries USA, Tower Automotive, and Teikuro Corporation. The city is also home to four industrial parks.

In downtown, the MSU Riley Center provides revenue from tourism, arts, and entertainment sales. The Riley Center attracts more than 60,000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances. Loeb&#x27;s Department Store on Front St has remained a Mississippi clothing landmark, having passed through four generations of family ownership. The store has been selling fine men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing since 1887, when the store was first opened by Alex Loeb.

==Culture==

One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodeled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.

The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) was founded as Meridian&#x27;s and Lauderdale County&#x27;s official arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual Threefoot Festival, several workshops, and other special events each year. MCA is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South&#x27;s oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi&#x27;s most-attended community theatre. The Meridian Symphony Orchestra (MSO) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963. In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, Elena Nikolaidi, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who has been with the orchestra since 1991. The MSO celebrated its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman.
The city&#x27;s former Grand Opera House was built in 1889 by two half brothers, Israel Marks and Levi Rothenberg. During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works, the first being a German company&#x27;s rendition of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;. After closing in the late 1920s due to the Great Depression, the opera house was abandoned for nearly 70 years. A $10 million grant in 2000 by the Riley Foundation, a local foundation chartered in 1998, sparked the building&#x27;s restoration while $15 million came from a combination of city, county, and federal grants. The opera house&#x27;s renovation was completed in September 2006 under the new name &quot;Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts.&quot; The Riley Center, which includes a 950-seat auditorium for live performances, a 200-seat studio theater, and of meeting space, attracts more than 60,000 visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances.

Meridian is considered an architectural treasure trove being one of the USA&#x27;s most intact cities from the end of the nineteenth and start of the twentieth centuries. Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort-designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit&#x27;s famed Fisher Building. Noted California architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of post office built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed during a 1960s remodeling, and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.

Meridian has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center (MAEC). The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in 2001 and in 2006 promised $4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $8 million. The city donated $50,000 to the cause in September 2007. The MAEC, as proposed, would be located on at Bonita Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre, an indoor concert hall, and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists. The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana&#x27;s building. That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $300,000. In February 2009, the MAEC revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame. The first star on the walk was dedicated to Jimmie Rodgers, a Meridian native. In September of the same year, the second star was revealed, recognizing B.B. King, a famous blues musician from Mississippi. On June 1, 2010, authors Tennessee Williams, Eudora Welty, and William Faulkner were added to the walk. Sela Ward was added to the walk on June 24, 2010. The MAEC plans to add many more Mississippi-born stars to the Walk of Fame; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Buffett, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty, and others.
Another location in the city used for large productions is the Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a 778-pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater Organs still in their original installations in the state. With seating for 1800 persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At the time, it was one of the largest stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating 1576 persons, the Temple is used year-round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, Hamasa Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies.
Highland Park houses a Jimmie Rodgers museum which displays the original guitar of &quot;The Singing Brakeman&quot; and other memorabilia of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam-engine era. In addition to the museum building itself, there are outside memorials, and a vintage steam locomotive on display. A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of Jimmie Rodgers and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi. The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta. Also, a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of Rodgers on June 1, 2010. Each year since 1953, the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death.

The park is home to a 19th-century carousel manufactured around 1895 by Gustav Dentzel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Highland Park Dentzel Carousel has been in operation since 1909, is a National Historic Landmark, and is the world&#x27;s only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence. Its house is the only remaining original carousel building built from a Dentzel blueprint. Around Town Carousels Abound is a public arts project of 62 carousel horses, representing the historic carousel. Sixty-two pieces have been sponsored by local businesses and citizens, and design of the horses was conceived and painted by local artists. They are placed throughout the city and county.

===Recreation===

The city contains several recreational parks, including Highland Park, Bonita Lakes, and Okatibbee Lake. Highland Park contains picnic shelters, swimming pools, tennis courts, a baseball field, softball fields, and a playground, all open year-round to visitors. Bonita Lakes is a city-owned, park including three lakes. The park also includes the Long Creek Reservoir and Lakeview Municipal Golf Course, along with nature trails, a jogging and walking track, biking paths, horseback riding trails, pavilions, picnic facilities, boat ramps, paddle boats, concessions, and fishing. Along with the lakes, the Bonita Lakes area includes Uptown Meridian, Bonita Lakes Crossing, and Bonita Lakes Plaza. Okatibbee Lake is a establishment containing a lake which offers boating, fishing, swimming, water skiing, picnicking, hunting, hiking and camping. Splashdown Country Water Park, a 25-room motel, and cabins are located on the lake.
Since 1992, Meridian has been a host of the State Games of Mississippi, a statewide annual multi-sport event modeled after the Olympic Games. The organization is a member of the National Congress of State Games, which is affiliated with the U.S. Olympic Committee. In its first year 1,200 athletes competed in twelve sports, and since then over 70,000 athletes have participated in the Games. In 2009, more than 4500 athletes participated in 27 sports. All competitors in the games can compete in the Southeast Sports Festival, while medalists may move up to the bi-annual State Games of America.

Originally the games were held in one weekend in June, but as more sports were added, the event was expanded to two weekends. Opening ceremonies always begin on the third Friday in June in downtown Meridian. The games are held at several sports parks, including Northeast Park, Sammie Davidson Complex, and other various fields throughout the city. Northeast Park is an park on Highway 39 that contains 10 tennis courts, four softball fields, three soccer fields, an asphalt track, and a large picnic pavilion. The Sammie Davidson Sports Complex includes six tennis courts, four softball fields, and a half-mile track. Other sports fields include the Meridian Jaycee Soccer Complex, Sykes Park, and Phil Hardin Park.

There are several golf courses in the city, including the aforementioned Lakeview Municipal Golf Course, an 18-hole course open to the public daily. Briarwood County Club, located on Highway 39 North, is a private club with golf, swimming, fishing, and dining facilities. Other golf courses serving the city include Northwood Country Club, Okatibbee Creek Golf Center, and Ponta Creek Golf Course.

==Government and infrastructure==


Meridian has operated under the mayor-council or &quot;strong mayor&quot; form of government since 1985. A mayor is elected every four years by the population at-large. The five members of the city council are elected every four years from each of the city&#x27;s five wards, considered single-member districts. The mayor, the chief executive officer of the city, is responsible for administering and leading the day-to-day operations of city government. The city council is the legislative arm of the government, setting policy and annually adopting the city&#x27;s operating budget.

City Hall, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located at 601 23rd Avenue. The current mayor is Jimmie Smith. Members of the city council include Dr. George M. Thomas, representative from Ward 1, Dwayne Davis, representative from Ward 2, Joseph Norwood, representative from Ward 3, Romande Gail Walker, representative from Ward 4, and Tyeasha &quot;Ty&quot; Bell Lindsey, representative from Ward 5. The council clerk is Jo Ann Clark. In total, the city employs 570 people.

The city has a Department of Homeland Security (DHS), becoming the only local DHS in the state. The team oversees an area of nine counties. Upon receiving $2.5 million in grants from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and other organizations, the department began training law enforcement offices from other Southern states in passenger rail rescue as well as offering civilian classes in basic handguns, Boy Scout first aid and hunting, and firearms training. The DHS helps during times of crisis such as Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, when the department helped establish and support shelters for 700 evacuees. The city now serves as the leader of one of the task forces in the Mississippi DHS, a combination of three nine-county teams.

Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full-time officers as well as part-time and reserve staff available. In 2009, the department&#x27;s Criminal Investigations Division responded to 4000 cases, 2000 of which were felonies. In 2000, 2094 crimes were reported, up slightly from 2008 crimes the preceding year. Meridian has been described as &quot;the safest city in Mississippi with more than 30,000 people.&quot; The East Mississippi Correctional Facility is located in unincorporated Lauderdale County, near Meridian. It is operated by the GEO Group on behalf of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. The chief of the Meridian Fire Department is Anthony Clayton. The fire department responded to more than 1600 calls in 2009, including 123 structural fires and 609 emergency service calls. The Mississippi Department of Mental Health operates the East Mississippi State Hospital in Meridian. The United States Postal Service operates the Meridian, North Meridian, and the West Meridian Station post offices.

In state politics, the Mississippi Senate district map divides the city into three sections. The northern tip of the city is in the 31st State Senate District and seats Terry Clark Burton (Republican party). A strip of the city from the southwest corner up to the northeast corner comprises part of the 32nd State Senate District and seats Sampson Jackson, II (Democratic party). The western and southeastern portions of the city lie in the 33rd State Senate District and seats Videt Carmichael (Republican party). In the Mississippi House of Representatives districts, the city is divided into four districts. The southern and eastern portions of the city reside in House District 81 and are represented by Steven A. Horne (Republican party). The city&#x27;s core makes up the entirety of House District 82 and is represented by Wilbert L. Jones (Democratic party). Surrounding House District 82 is House District 83, represented by Greg Snowden (Republican party). The western section of the city, along with a small section in the north, lie in House District 84 and are represented by Tad Campbell (Republican party).

On the national level, the city is located in Mississippi&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, represented by Michael Guest (Republican party), who has been in office since 2019. Lauderdale County, home to Meridian, has voted for the Republican candidate in every United States presidential election since 1972. Before the shift to the Republican Party, white area voters supported Democratic Party candidates, as for decades since the late 19th century, it was a one-party state.

== Transportation ==
===Railroads and public transit===

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Crescent &quot; train connects Meridian with the cities of New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington, D.C.; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Union Station Multi-Modal Transportation Center (MMTC) is located at 1901 Front Street, part of the Meridian Downtown Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally built in 1906, but later demolished in 1966 then rebuilt in 1997, the station includes several modes of transportation including Amtrak, Norfolk Southern rail corridor, Greyhound buses, Trailways and other providers of transit services. The number of passengers on Amtrak trains, Greyhound buses, and Meridian Transit System buses averages 242,360 per year in 2007. The Meridian Transit System ceased operations in 2012 due to lack of funding support for local match by the mayoral administration.

===Air===
The city is served by Meridian Regional Airport, located at Key Field, 2811 Airport Boulevard South, southwest of the city. At , the airport&#x27;s runway is the longest public runway in Mississippi. The airport, which has been in service since 1930, offers daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth.

During the Great Depression, residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance, but in 1935 Brothers Fred and Al Key, managers of the airport, thought of a way to keep the airport operating. From June 4 until July 1, 1935, the brothers flew over the city in their plane, the &quot;Ole Miss.&quot; The record they established in their 27 days aloft, totaling 653 hours and 34 minutes, attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running. Key Field is therefore named after the brothers, whose flight endurance record remains unbroken in conventional flight.

== Education ==

Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools. Although there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students. The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884. The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year $30,000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools. From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks.

From this early district and later additions, the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size, which now includes six elementary schools, three middle schools, and three high schools. The city also contains several private schools, including Lamar School, Community Christian School, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School. The campus of Meridian High School, the main high school in the district, occupies , including six buildings and 111 classrooms. The school is made up of grades 9–12 and enrolls approximately 1,500 students.

Meridian is home to two post-secondary educational institutions. Meridian Community College, founded in 1937, is located at 910 Highway 19 N and offers free tuition for four semesters to graduates from the Meridian Public and Lauderdale County School Districts as well as homeschooled children who reside inside Lauderdale County. Originally known as Meridian Junior College and located at Meridian High School, the college moved to its present location in 1965. After desegregation laws were passed, MJC merged with T.J. Harris Junior College in 1970, which had previously enrolled African-American students. The name change from Meridian Junior College to Meridian Community College took place in 1987 &quot;to more accurately reflect the diversity of opportunities it provides for a growing community area.&quot; Mississippi State University also operates a campus in the city. As of the Fall 2008 semester, 763 students from 33 counties throughout the state and several in Alabama attended the college.

Meridian is served by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.

==Media==

The only daily newspaper printed in the city is &quot;The Meridian Star&quot;, which has been in operation since 1898. The paper was originally named &quot;The Evening Star&quot; but was renamed in 1915 and has been Meridian&#x27;s only daily newspaper since 1921. With a daily circulation of about 12,000 in March 2010, the paper serves Lauderdale County as well as adjacent portions of western Alabama and eastern Mississippi.

Although the &quot;Meridian Star&quot; is now the only newspaper printed in the city, there have been a few other historical newspapers. One such paper is the &quot;Memo Digest&quot;, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. Other newspapers in the city have included &quot;The Colored Messenger&quot;, &quot;The State&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Mercury&quot;, &quot;The Blade&quot;, &quot;Weekly Echo&quot;, &quot;Fair Play&quot;, &quot;Headlight&quot;, &quot;Meridian Morning Sun&quot;, &quot;Teacher and Preacher&quot;, and &quot;Clarion&quot;.

The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area (DMA), which includes 72,180 households with televisions. WTOK-TV broadcasts as an ABC affiliate from the city, headquartered at 815 23rd Avenue. WTOK operates two digital subchannels, WTOK-DT2, a MyNetworkTV affiliate, and WTOK-DT3, Meridian&#x27;s CW. WMDN-TV is the market&#x27;s CBS affiliate. WGBC-TV is the affiliate network carrying both FOX (WGBC-DT1) and NBC (WGBC-DT2) programming. Both stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Crestview Circle in unincorporated Lauderdale County, south of Meridian. Together, WGBC and WMDN are known as &quot;The Meridian Family of Stations.&quot; WMAW-TV is the local affiliate of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.

The city is also the principal city in the Meridian Arbitron Radio Market, which includes 64,500 people over the age of 12. WUCL (FM 105.7), headquartered at 3436 Highway 45 North, takes the largest share of ratings in the market at 14.8% in Fall 2009. In the same period, WZKS (FM 104.1) was second with 11.1%, and WMOX (AM 1010) was third with 7.4%. Other popular stations in the market include WKZB (FM 97.9), WOKK (FM 97.1), WEXR (FM 106.9), WYHL (AM 1450), and WJXM (FM 95.1). Mississippi Public Broadcasting can be found on WMAW-FM (FM 88.1).

<text>The Minor Arcana, sometimes known as the Lesser Arcana, are the suit cards in a cartomantic tarot deck.

Ordinary tarot cards first appeared in northern Italy in the 1440s and were designed for tarot card games. They typically have four suits each of 10 unillustrated pip cards numbered one (ace) to ten, along with 4 court cards (face cards). Tarot games are still widely played in central and southern Europe; French Tarot is the second most popular card game in France after Belote.

By contrast, cartomantic tarot cards emerged in France in the late 18th century, popularised by occultists such as Etteilla. The terms &quot;Major&quot; and &quot;Minor Arcana&quot; originate with Jean-Baptiste Pitois (1811–1877), &quot;nom de plume&quot; Paul Christian.

In their contemporary versions, the Minor Arcana are often illustrated—a convention popularized by the Rider–Waite tarot in 1910. Used in a tarot card reading in conjunction with the Major Arcana, the cards of the Minor Arcana suggest subtleties and details, and signify day-to-day insights.

Cartomantic tarot cards derived from Latin-suited packs typically have a Minor Arcana of 56 cards, with 14 cards in each suit: Wands (alternately batons, clubs, staffs, or staves), Cups (chalices, goblets, or vessels), Swords (or blades), and Coins (pentacles, disks, or rings). The four court cards are commonly: page (jack or knave), knight, queen, and king. Some variations have princess and prince cards replacing the page and knight cards; the historical Visconti-Sforza Tarot expands the court with two additional cards: the damsel and the mounted lady. While the historical Tarot of Marseilles contains 56 cards, later packs based on the French suits of clubs (♣), hearts (), spades (♠), and diamonds () have only three court cards per suit, with a jack in addition to the queen and king.

==Symbolism==
In divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot, the Minor Arcana are believed to represent relatively mundane features of life. The court cards may represent the people whom one meets.

Each suit also has distinctive characteristics and connotations commonly held to be as follows:

<text>The Major Arcana are the named cards in a cartomantic tarot pack. There are usually 22 such cards in a standard 78-card pack, typically numbered from 0 to 21 (or 1 to 21, with the Fool being left unnumbered). Although the cards correspond to the trump cards of a pack used for playing tarot card game, the term &#x27;Major Arcana&#x27; is rarely used by players and is typically associated exclusively with use for divination by occultists.

The Major Arcana are complemented by the Minor Arcana—the 56 unnamed cards of the tarot deck, which more directly correspond to the contemporary standard 52-card deck.

==History==
Prior to the 17th century, tarot cards were solely used for playing games and the Fool and 21 trumps had simple allegorical or esoteric meaning, mostly originating in elite ideology in the Italian courts of the 15th century when it was invented. The occult significance began to emerge in the 18th century, when Antoine Court de Gébelin, a Swiss clergyman and Freemason, published two essays on Tarot in his &quot;Le Monde Primitif&quot; (The Primeval World), a never-completed encyclopedia. In the first essay, &quot;Du Jeu des Tarots&quot; (The Game of Tarots), Court de Gébelin assigned Egyptian, kabbalistic, and divine significance to the tarot trumps.

Etteilla created a method of divination using tarot; Éliphas Lévi worked to break away from the Egyptian nature of the divinatory tarot, bringing it back to the Tarot de Marseille, creating a &quot;tortuous&quot; kabbalistic correspondence, and even suggested that the Major Arcana represent stages of life. Marquis Stanislas de Guaita established the Major Arcana as an initiatory sequence to be used to establish a path of spiritual ascension and evolution. In 1980 Sallie Nichols, a Jungian psychologist, wrote of the tarot as having deep psychological and archetypal significance, even encoding the entire process of Jungian individuation into the tarot trumps.

These various interpretations of the Major Arcana developed in stages, all of which continue to exert significant influence on practitioners&#x27; explanations of the Major Arcana.

==List of the Major Arcana==
Like the early Italian-suited packs on which they were originally based, in a cartomantic pack each Major Arcanum depicts a scene, mostly featuring a person or several people, with many symbolic elements. In many decks, each has a number (usually in Roman numerals) and a name, though not all decks have both, and some have only a picture. 

Every tarot deck is different and carries a different connotation with the art, however most symbolism remains the same. The earliest, pre-cartomantic, decks bore unnamed and unnumbered pictures on their &quot;trionfi&quot; or trumps (probably because a great many of the people using them at the time were illiterate), and the order of cards was not standardized. 

Strength is traditionally the eleventh card and Justice the eighth, but the influential Rider–Waite Tarot switched the position of these two cards in order to make them a better fit with the astrological correspondences worked out by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, under which the eighth card is associated with Leo and the eleventh with Libra. Today many decks use this numbering, particularly in the English-speaking world.

==Esotericism==
By the 19th century, the Tarot was being claimed as a &quot;Bible of Bibles&quot;, an esoteric repository of all the significant truths of creation. The trend was started by prominent Freemason and Protestant cleric Antoine Court de Gébelin who suggested that the tarot had an ancient Egyptian origin, and mystic divine and kabbalistic significance. A contemporary of his, Louis-Raphaël-Lucrèce de Fayolle, comte de Mellet, added to Court de Gébelin&#x27;s claims by suggesting (attacked as being erroneous) that the tarot was associated with Romani people and was in fact the imprinted book of Hermes Trismegistus. 

These claims were continued by Etteilla. Etteilla is primarily recognized as the founder and propagator of the divinatory tarot, but he also participated in the propagation of the occult tarot by claiming the tarot had an ancient Egyptian origin and was an account of the creation of the world and a book of eternal medicine. Éliphas Lévi revitalized the occult tarot by associating it with the mystical Kabbalah and making it a &quot;prime ingredient in magical lore&quot;. As Decker, Depaulis, and Dummett note, &quot;it is to him (Lévi) that we owe its (the Tarot&#x27;s) widespread acceptance as a means of discovering hidden truths and as a document of the occult... Lévi&#x27;s writings formed the channel through which the Western tradition of magic flowed down to modern times.&quot;

As the following quote by P. D. Ouspensky (Pyotr Demianovich Ouspensky) (1878–1947) shows, the association of the tarot with Hermetic, kabbalastic, magical mysteries continued at least to the early 20th century.

Claims such as those initiated by early Freemasons today found their way into academic discourse. Semetsky, for example, explained that tarot makes it possible to mediate between humanity and the godhead, or between god/spirit/consciousness and profane human existence. Christina Nicholson used the tarot to illustrate the deep wisdom of feminist theology. Santarcangeli wrote of the wisdom of the fool, and Sallie Nichols spoke about the archetypal power of individuation boiling beneath the powerful surface of the tarot archetypes.

==Fortune telling==
Now popularly associated in English-speaking countries with divination, fortune telling, or cartomancy, Tarot was not invented as a mystical or magical tool of divination, but as an instrument for playing card games with a permanent trump suit. The people who published esoteric commentary of the tarot (e.g. Antoine Court de Gébelin and the Comte de Mellet) also published commentary on divinatory tarot. There is a line of development of the cartomantic tarot that occurred in parallel with the imposition of hermetic mysteries on the formerly mundane pack of cards that can usefully be distinguished. It was the Comte de Mellet who initiated this development by suggesting, entirely incorrectly, that ancient Egyptians had used the tarot for fortune telling and provided a method purportedly used in ancient Egypt. 

Following the Comte de Mellet, Etteilla invented a method of cartomancy, assigning a divinatory meaning to each of the cards (both upright and reversed), publishing &quot;La Cartonomancie française&quot; (a book detailing the method), and creating the first tarot decks exclusively intended for cartomantic practice. Etteilla&#x27;s original method was designed to work with a common pack of cards known as the Piquet pack because Piquet was the most popular game played with 32 cards. In 1783, two years after Antoine Court de Gébelin published &quot;Le Monde Primitif&quot;, he turned to the development of a cartomantic method using the standard (i.e. Marseilles) tarot deck. His work was published in the book &quot;Manière de se récréer avec le jeu de cartes nommées tarots&quot; and the creation of a society for tarot cartomancy, the Société littéraire des associés libres des interprètes du livre de Thot. The society subsequently published &quot;Dictionnaire synonimique du livre de Thot&quot;, a book that &quot;systematically tabulated all the possible meanings which each card could bear, when upright and reversed.&quot;

Following Etteilla, tarot cartomancy was moved forward by Marie-Anne Adelaid Lenormand (1768–1830) and others. Lenormand was the first well known cartomancer and claimed to be the confidante of Empress Josephine and other local luminaries. She was so popular, and cartomancy with tarot became so well established in France following her work, that a special deck entitled the &quot;Grand Jeu de Mlle Lenormand&quot; was released in her name two years after her death. This was followed by many other specially designed cartomantic tarot decks, mostly based on Etteilla&#x27;s Egyptian symbolism, but some providing other (for example biblical or medieval) flavours as well. Tarot as a cartomantic and divinatory tool is well established and new books expounding the mystical utility of the cartomantic tarot are published all the time.

===Mysticism===
By the early 19th century Masonic writers and Protestant clerics had established claims that the tarot trumps were authoritative sources of ancient hermetic wisdom, of Christian gnosis and revelatory tools of divine cartomantic inspiration. In 1870 Jean-Baptiste Pitois (better known as Paul Christian) wrote a book entitled &quot;Histoire de la magie, du monde surnaturel et de la fatalité à travers les temps et les peuples&quot;. In that book, Christian identifies the tarot trumps as representing the &quot;principle scenes&quot; of ancient Egyptian initiatory &quot;tests&quot;. Christian provides an extended analysis of ancient Egyptian initiation rites that involves Pyramids, 78 steps, and the initiatory revelation of secrets. Decker, Depaulis, and Dummett write:

Christian attempted to give authority to his analysis by falsely attributing an account of ancient Egyptian initiation rites to Iamblichus, but it is clear that Christian was the source of any initiatory relevance to the tarot trumps. Nevertheless, Christian&#x27;s fabricated history of tarot initiation were quickly reinforced with the formation of an occult journal in 1889 entitled &quot;L&#x27;Initiation&quot;, the publication of an essay by Oswald Wirth (Joseph Paul Oswald Wirth) (1860–1943) in &quot;Le Tarot des Bohémiens&quot; by Papus (Gérard Anaclet Vincent Encausse) (1865–1916) that stated that the tarot is nothing less than the sacred book of occult initiation, the publication of a book by François-Charles Barlet (Albert Faucheux) (1838–1921) entitled, not surprisingly, &quot;L&#x27;Initiation&quot;, and the publication of &quot;Le Tarot des Bohémians&quot; by Papus. Subsequent to this activity the initiatory relevance of the tarot was firmly established in the minds of occult practitioners.

The emergence of the tarot as an initiatory tool was coincident with the flowering of initiatory esoteric orders and secret brotherhoods during the middle of the 19th century. For example, Marquis Stanislas de Guaita founded the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross in 1888 along with several key commentators on the initiatory tarot, e.g. Papus, François-Charles Barlet, and Joséphin Péladan (1858–1918). These orders placed great emphasis on secrets, advancing through the grades, and initiatory tests and so it is not surprising that, already having the tarot to hand, they read into the tarot initiatory significance. 

Doing so lent an air of divine, mystical, and ancient authority to their practices and allowed them to continue to expound on the magical and mystical significance of the presumably ancient and hermetic tarot. Be that as it may this activity established the tarot&#x27;s significance as a device and book of initiation not only in the minds of occult practitioners, but also in the minds of new age practitioners, Jungian psychologists, and general academics.

<text>The Rider–Waite Tarot is a widely popular deck for tarot card reading, first published by William Rider &amp; Son in 1909, based on the instructions of academic and mystic A. E. Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, both members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Also known as the Waite–Smith, Rider–Waite–Smith, or Rider Tarot, the deck has been published in numerous editions and inspired a wide array of variants and imitations. Estimates suggest over 100 million copies of the deck circulate across over 20 countries.

== Overview ==
The Rider–Waite tarot deck has 78 cards: 56 Minor Arcana, and 22 Major Arcana. The Minor Arcana generally correspond to the suits of Spanish or Italian playing cards. The Major Arcana, corresponding to the trump cards of gaming tarot, have unique designs numbered from 0 (The Fool) to 21 (The World).

While the images are simple, the details and backgrounds feature abundant symbolism. Some imagery remains similar to that found in earlier decks, but overall the Waite–Smith card designs are substantially different from their predecessors. Christian imagery was removed from some cards, and added to others. For example, the &quot;Papess&quot; became the &quot;High Priestess&quot; and no longer features a Papal tiara. The &quot;Lovers&quot; card, previously depicting a medieval scene of a clothed man and woman receiving a blessing from a noble or cleric was changed to a depiction of the naked Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the ace of cups featuring a dove carrying Sacramental bread. The Minor Arcana are illustrated with allegorical scenes by Smith, where earlier decks, with a few rare exceptions, had simple designs for the Minor Arcana.

The symbols and imagery used in the deck were influenced by the 19th-century magician and occultist Eliphas Levi, as well as by the teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In order to accommodate the astrological correspondences taught by the Golden Dawn, Waite introduced several innovations to the deck. He switched the order of the Strength and Justice cards so that Strength corresponded with Leo and Justice corresponded with Libra. He based the Lovers card on Italian tarot decks, which have two persons and an angel, to reinforce its correspondence with Gemini.

== Publication ==

The cards were first published in December 1909, by the publisher William Rider &amp; Son of London. The first printing was extremely limited and featured card backs with a roses and lilies pattern. In March 1910, a much larger printing featured better quality card stock and a &quot;cracked mud&quot; card back design. This edition, often referred to as the &quot;A&quot; deck, was published from 1910 to 1920. Rider continued publishing the deck in various editions until 1939, then again from 1971 to 1977.

All of the Rider editions up to 1939 were available with a small guide written by A. E. Waite providing an overview of the traditions and history of the cards, texts about interpretations, and extensive descriptions of their symbols. The first version of this guide was published during 1909 and was titled &quot;The Key to the Tarot&quot;. In 1911, a revised version, &quot;The Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, was issued, featuring black-and-white plates of all seventy-eight of Smith&#x27;s illustrations.

In 2009, U.S. Games Systems published a commemorative deck titled &quot;The Smith-Waite Centennial Deck&quot; as part of The Pamela Colman Smith Commemorative Set celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the 1909 deck. This deck notably places Smith&#x27;s name first and omits the publisher&#x27;s name (Rider). In this vein, some contemporary tarot readers call the original deck and its various iterations the &quot;Smith-Waite deck&quot; in order to give proper credit to Smith&#x27;s contribution to the deck.

== Copyright status ==
The original version of the Rider–Waite Tarot is in the public domain in all countries that have a copyright term of 70 years or fewer after the death of the last co-author. This includes the United Kingdom, where the deck was originally published.

In the United States, the deck became part of the public domain in 1966 (publication + 28 years + renewed 28 years). U.S. Games Systems has a copyright claim on their updated version of the deck published in 1971, but this only applies to new material added to the pre-existing work (e.g. designs on the card backs and the box).

<text>The Magician (I), also known as The Magus or The Juggler, is the first trump or Major Arcana card in most traditional tarot decks. It is used in game playing and divination.

Within the card game context, the equivalent is the Pagat which is the lowest trump card, also known as the &quot;atouts&quot; or &quot;honours&quot;. In the occult context, the trump cards are recontextualized as the Major Arcana and granted complex esoteric meaning. The Magician in such context is interpreted as the first numbered and second total card of the Major Arcana, succeeding the Fool, which is unnumbered or marked 0. The Magician as an object of occult study is interpreted as symbolic of power, potential, and the unification of the physical and spiritual worlds.

== Iconography ==
In French &quot;Le Bateleur&quot;, &quot;the mountebank&quot; or the &quot;sleight of hand artist&quot;, is a practitioner of stage magic. The Italian tradition calls him &quot;Il Bagatto&quot; or &quot;Il Bagatello&quot;. The Mantegna Tarocchi image that would seem to correspond with the Magician is labeled &quot;Artixano&quot;, the Artisan; he is the second lowest in the series, outranking only the Beggar. Visually the 18th-century woodcuts reflect earlier iconic representations, and can be compared to the free artistic renditions in the 15th-century hand-painted tarots made for the Visconti and Sforza families. In the painted cards attributed to Bonifacio Bembo, the Magician appears to be playing with cups and balls.

In esoteric decks, occultists, starting with Oswald Wirth, turned &quot;Le Bateleur&quot; from a mountebank into a magus. The curves of the magician&#x27;s hat brim in the Marseilles image are similar to the esoteric deck&#x27;s mathematical sign of infinity. Similarly, other symbols were added. The essentials are that the magician has set up a temporary table outdoors, to display items that represent the suits of the Minor Arcana: Cups, Coins, Swords (as knives). The fourth, the baton (Clubs) he holds in his hand. The baton was later changed to represent a literal magician&#x27;s wand.

The illustration of the tarot card &quot;The Magician&quot; from the Rider–Waite tarot deck was developed by A. E. Waite for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1910. Waite&#x27;s magician features the infinity symbol over his head, and an ouroboros belt, both symbolizing eternity. The figure stands among a garden of flowers, to imply the manifestation and cultivation of desires.

==In the tarot game==
In most tarot games, the &quot;Bagatto&quot; is the lowest ranking trump card but worth a lot of points. Therefore, many players want to take a trick when it is played. In most games played out of Italy, winning the last trick with it awards bonus points.

In tarocchini, the &quot;Bégato&quot; still serves as the lowest trump, but it has an added ability. During score counting, it and the Fool can function as limited wild cards known as counters (&quot;contatori&quot;). They can be used separately or together to fill missing gaps in combinations, though not to fill in two consecutive gaps in sequential combinations, or to replace the highest trump or kings. Both cards can be used in every sequence, but as the Fool cannot be captured while the Magician is vulnerable to capture, the player holding the Magician would want to use it only judiciously.

In Sicilian tarocchi, the Bagatto is the second lowest trump, outranking an unnumbered trump called &quot;Miseria&quot; of no significance.

==Symbolism==
===Rider–Waite===
The Magician is depicted with one hand pointing upwards towards the sky and the other pointing down to the earth, interpreted widely as an &quot;as above, so below&quot; reference to the spiritual and physical realms. On the table before him are a wand, a pentacle, a sword, and a cup, representing the four suits of the Minor Arcana. Such symbols signify the classical elements of fire, earth, air, and water, &quot;which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills&quot;. The Magician&#x27;s right hand, pointed upwards, holds a double-ended white wand; the ends are interpreted much like the hand gestures, in that they represent the Magician&#x27;s status as conduit between the spiritual and the physical. His robe is similarly also white, a symbol of purity yet also of inexperience, while his red mantle is understood through the lens of red&#x27;s wildly polarised colour symbolism—both a representative of willpower and passion, and one of egotism, rage, and revenge. In front of the Magician is a garden of Rose of Sharon and lily of the valley demonstrating the &quot;culture of aspiration&quot;, or the Magician&#x27;s ability to cultivate and fulfill potential.

The Magician is associated with the planet Mercury, and hence the signs of Gemini and Virgo in astrology.

===Marseilles===
Although the Rider–Waite Tarot deck is the most often used in occult contexts, other decks such as the Tarot of Marseilles usually used for game-playing have also been read through a symbolic lens. Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s reading of the Magician as &quot;Le Bateleur&quot; draws attention to individual details of the Marseilles card, such as the fingers, table, and depiction of the plants, in addition to the elements shared between the Rider–Waite and Marseilles decks. The Magician in the Marseilles deck is depicted with six fingers on his left hand rather than five, which Jodorowsky interprets as a symbol of manipulating and reorganizing reality. Similarly, the table he stands behind has three legs rather than four; the fourth leg is interpreted as being outside the card, a metafictional statement that &quot;[i]t is by going beyond the stage of possibilities and moving into the reality of action and choice that The Magician gives concrete expression to his situation&quot;.

Rather than flowers, the Magician of the Marseilles deck is depicted with a small plant between his feet. The plant has a yonic appearance and has been interpreted as the sex organs of either a personal mother or the abstract concept of Mother Nature.

== Divination ==
Like the other cards of the Major Arcana, the Magician is the subject of complex and extensive analysis as to its occult interpretations. On the broad level, the Magician is interpreted with energy, potential, and the manifestation of one&#x27;s desires; the card symbolizes the meetings of the physical and spiritual worlds (&quot;as above, so below&quot;) and the conduit converting spiritual energy into real-world action.

Tarot experts have defined the Magician in association with the Fool, which directly precedes it in the sequence; Rachel Pollack refers to the card as &quot;in the image of the trickster-wizard&quot;. A particularly important aspect of the card&#x27;s visual symbolism in the Rider–Waite deck is the magician&#x27;s hands, with one hand pointing towards the sky and the other towards the earth. Pollack and other writers understand this as a reflection of the Hermetic concept of &quot;as above, so below&quot;, where the workings of the macrocosm (the universe as a whole, understood as a living being) and the microcosm (the human being, understood as a universe) are interpreted as inherently intertwined with one another. To Pollack, the Magician is a metaphysical lightning rod, channeling macrocosmic energy into the microcosm.

According to A. E. Waite&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;The Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, the Magician card is associated with the divine motive in man. In particular, Waite interprets the Magician through a Gnostic lens, linking the card&#x27;s connection with the number eight (which the infinity symbol is visually related to) and the Gnostic concept of the Ogdoad, spiritual rebirth into a hidden eighth celestial realm. Said infinity symbol above the Magician&#x27;s head is also interpreted as a symbol of the Holy Spirit, the prophetic and theophanic aspect of the Trinity.

Like other tarot cards, the symbolism of the Magician is interpreted differently depending on whether the card is drawn in an upright or reversed position. While the upright Magician represents potential and tapping into one&#x27;s talents, the reversed Magician&#x27;s potential and talents are unfocused and unmanifested. The reversed Magician can also be interpreted as related to black magick and to madness or mental distress. A particularly important interpretation of the reversed Magician relates to the speculated connection between the experiences recognized in archaic societies as shamanism and those recognized in technological societies as schizophrenia; the reversed Magician is perceived as symbolizing the degree to which those experiences and abilities are unrecognized and suppressed, and the goal is to turn the card &#x27;upright&#x27;, or re-focus those experiences into their positive form.

==In art==
&quot;The Surrealist (Le surréaliste)&quot;, 1947, is a painting by Victor Brauner. The Juggler provided Brauner with a key prototype for his self-portrait: the Surrealist&#x27;s large hat, medieval costume, and the position of his arms all derive from this figure who, like Brauner&#x27;s subject, stands behind a table displaying a knife, a goblet, and coins.

<text>Wrigley (South Slavey language: &quot;Pehdzeh Ki&quot; &quot;clay place&quot;) is a &quot;Designated Authority&quot; in the Dehcho Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. The Slavey Dene community is located on the east bank of the Mackenzie River, just below its confluence with the Wrigley River and about northwest of Yellowknife.

Originally situated at Fort Wrigley, downstream, the community relocated to its present location in 1965, in part because it was more easily accessible due to the World War II era Wrigley Airport built for the Canol Project and also due to the swampy nature of the land around Fort Wrigley. Today the community can be reached via the Mackenzie Highway. The population continues to maintain a traditional lifestyle, trapping, hunting, and fishing.

The community was named for Joseph Wrigley who was the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Chief Commissioner for British North America (1884–1891).

The Franklin Mountains, which are also on the east bank of the Mackenzie River, overlook the community. Cap Mountain, , is the highest peak in the range and is within walking distance of the community.

<doc id="106075" wikidata="Q1964135" url="?curid=106075" title="The High Priestess">
<text>The High Priestess (II) is the second Major Arcana card in cartomantic Tarot decks. It is based on the 2nd trump of Tarot card packs. In the first Tarot pack with inscriptions, the 18th-century woodcut Tarot de Marseilles, this figure is crowned with the Papal tiara and labelled &quot;La Papesse&quot;, the Popess, a possible reference to the legend of Pope Joan.

In the creation of the Rider–Waite Tarot deck, the Popess of the playing card packs was changed into The High Priestess of cartomantic cards. She wears a crown similar to the one used by the goddess Hathor, and is depicted with Marian imagery. A. E. Waite, the co-creator of the Rider–Waite deck, speculated that the card was connected to the ancient cult of Astarte or Mary as a representation of the Mother goddess.

==History==
===&quot;La Papesse&quot;===
This Tarot card was originally called &quot;La Papesse&quot;, or &quot;The Popess&quot;. Some of the cards directly linked the woman on the cards to the papacy by showing the woman wearing a &quot;triregnum&quot; or Papal Tiara. There are also some modern versions of the Tarot of Marseilles which include the keys to the kingdom that are a traditional symbol of the papacy. In Protestant post-reformation countries, Tarot cards in particular used images of the legendary Pope Joan, linking in to the mythology of how Joan, disguised as a man, was elected to the papacy and was only supposedly discovered to be a woman when she gave birth.

===Other variants===
In the Rider–Waite Tarot, illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith, the Popess was changed into The High Priestess sitting between the pillars of Boaz and Jachin (which has a particular meaning to Freemasonry). She wears a crown similar to the Egyptian goddess Hathor and is depicted with the Marian imagery of a blue mantle and the moon at her feet. A. E. Waite, the co-creator of the Rider–Waite deck, dismissed the idea that the card originally depicted Pope Joan and speculated that it was instead connected to the ancient cult of Astarte.

Other variants that came after Rider–Waite are the Virgin Mary, Isis, the metaphorical Bride of Christ or Holy Mother Church. In Swiss Troccas decks, she is called &quot;Junon&quot; (&quot;Juno&quot;), the Roman Queen of the Gods. The &quot;Flemish Deck&quot; by Vandenborre (c. 1750-1760) refers to this card as &quot;Le Espagnol Capitano Eracasse&quot; (&quot;The Spanish Captain Fracasse&quot;), after a version of Il Capitano, a character from &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;Arte&quot;.

===Sister Manfreda===
&quot;La Papessa&quot; in the Visconti-Sforza Tarot has been identified as a depiction of Sister Manfreda, an Umiliata nun and a relative of the Visconti family who was elected Pope by the heretical Guglielmite sect of Lombardy. In &quot;The Tarot Cards Painted by Bonifacio Bembo&quot;, Gertrude Moakley writes:

This identification has been supported by other Tarot historians, such as Michael Dummett in his book &quot;The Visconti-Sforza Tarot Cards&quot;.

==Symbolism==

===Rider–Waite symbolism===
In the Rider–Waite–Smith tarot, the basis for many modern tarot decks, The High Priestess is identified with the Shekhinah, the female indwelling presence of the divine. She wears plain blue robes and sits with her hands in her lap. She has a lunar crescent at her feet, &quot;a horned diadem on her head, with a globe in the middle place&quot; similar to the crown of the ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor, but with the horns having a shape more like half-crescents, and a large cross on her breast, the balance between the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air. The scroll in her hands, partly covered by her mantle, bears the letters TORA (meaning &quot;divine law&quot;), that symbolizes the memory we carry inside about the past, present and future, named Akasha. She is seated between the white and black pillars—&#x27;J&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; for Jachin and Boaz—of the mystic Temple of Solomon. The veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palm leaves (male) and pomegranates (female), growing on a tree shaped like the Tree of Life.

The motif that hangs behind the High Priestess’s throne, veiling whatever mysteries she guards, is suggested in the pattern of The Empress&#x27; gown. The two are sisters, one bringing life into the world, the other inviting the living to the esoteric mysteries. Further behind appears a body of water, likely the sea, with water flowing through most cards of the Rider–Waite–Smith tarot.

===Tarot of Marseilles symbolism===
In the Tarot of Marseilles it is noticeable that she wears a blue cape and red robe, in contrast to The Pope, wearing a red cape and blue robe.

== Interpretation ==
The modern interpretation of the High Priestess represents the unknown, mystery, intuition, spiritual knowledge, and the subconscious mind. She is an esoteric figure, unlike The Hierophant. Reversed, the High Priestess can be interpreted as secrecy and disconnection from your intuition.

According to A. E. Waite&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;The Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, the High Priestess card is associated with:

In astrology, the High Priestess&#x27;s primary correspondence is to the Moon. On the Tree of Life, she is on the path leading from Kether to Tiphareth.

<text>The Pictorial Key to the Tarot is a divinatory tarot guide, with text by A. E. Waite and illustrations by Pamela Colman Smith. Published in conjunction with the Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck, the pictorial version (released 1910, dated 1911) followed the success of the deck and Waite&#x27;s (unillustrated 1909) text &quot;The Key to the Tarot&quot;. Both Waite and Smith were members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Waite was very concerned with the accuracy of the symbols used for the deck, and he did much research into the traditions, interpretations, and history behind the cards. 

The book (which Waite himself called &quot;a monograph&quot;) consists of three parts.
# Part I, &quot;The Veil and Its Symbols&quot;, is a short overview of the traditional symbols associated with each card, followed by a history of the Tarot. Waite dismissed as baseless the belief that the Tarot was Egyptian in origin, and noted that no evidence of the cards exists prior to the 15th century.
# Part II, &quot;The Doctrine of the Veil&quot;, contains 78 black and white plates of Smith&#x27;s illustrations for the Rider–Waite–Smith deck, and a discussion of the unique symbols chosen for each card. Waite drew upon the earlier Tarot of French occultist Eliphas Levi, at times retaining his changes to the traditional deck (as with the Chariot card, which both Waite and Levi picture being drawn by two sphinx, instead of horses), at other times criticizing him (as with the Hermit card, which Waite thought Levi misinterpreted).
# Part III, &quot;The Outer Methods of the Oracles&quot;, concerns matters of divination with the cards, including a description of the famous Celtic Cross Tarot layout, which the book helped popularize.

In 1916, American author L. W. de Laurence published an exact facsimile copy of the book under the title &quot;The Illustrated Key to the Tarot: The Veil of Divination, Illustrating the Greater and Lesser Arcana&quot; without giving any credit to Waite or Smith.

<text>Jared Mason Diamond (born September 10, 1937) is an American scientist, historian, and author. In 1985 he received a MacArthur Genius Grant, and he has written hundreds of scientific and popular articles and books. His best known is &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; (1997), which received multiple awards including the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. In 2005, Diamond was ranked ninth on a poll by &quot;Prospect&quot; and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; of the world&#x27;s top 100 public intellectuals. 

Originally trained in biochemistry and physiology, Diamond has published in many fields, including anthropology, ecology, geography, and evolutionary biology. In 1999, he received the National Medal of Science, an honor bestowed by the President of the United States and the National Science Foundation. He was a professor of geography at UCLA until his retirement in 2024.

==Early life and education ==
Diamond was born on September 10, 1937 in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were both Eastern European Jewish immigrants. His father, Louis Diamond, was a physician who emigrated from Chișinău in present-day Moldova, then known as Bessarabia. His mother, Flora , was a teacher, linguist, and concert pianist. Diamond began studying piano at age six; years later, he would propose to his wife after playing Brahms&#x27; Intermezzo in A major for her.

By the age of seven he developed an interest in birdwatching. This became one of his major life passions and resulted in a number of works published in ornithology. He attended the Roxbury Latin School and studied biochemical sciences at Harvard College, graduating in 1958. He later studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated from Cambridge with a Ph.D. in 1961; his thesis was on the physiology and biophysics of membranes in the gallbladder.

==Career==
After graduation from Cambridge, Diamond returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow until 1965, and, in 1968, became a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School. While in his twenties he developed a second, parallel, career in ornithology and ecology, specialising in New Guinea and nearby islands, which he began visiting from 1964. Later, in his fifties, Diamond developed a third career in environmental history and became a professor of geography at UCLA, his position. He also teaches at LUISS Guido Carli in Rome. He is a lecturer on the biodiversity management course at the European Institute of Innovation for Sustainability (EIIS) in Rome. He won the National Medal of Science in 1999. He has been invited to give two TED talks, &quot;Why do societies collapse&quot; (2008), and &quot;How societies can grow old better (2013).

Diamond originally specialized in salt absorption in the gall bladder. He has also published scholarly works in the fields of ecology and ornithology, but is arguably best known for authoring a number of popular science and history books combining topics from diverse fields other than those he has formally studied. Because of this academic diversity, Diamond has been described as a polymath.

==Selected popular works==
Diamond has written scores of academic peer-reviewed articles for publications such as the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;. He has also written scores of popular science articles in publications such as &quot;Discover&quot;, as well as several bestselling popular books, notably &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; (1991); &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; (1997, awarded a Pulitzer Prize); &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot; (2012), and &quot;Upheaval&quot; (2019). &quot;For a full list, see &quot;.

=== &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; (1991) ===
Diamond&#x27;s first popular book, &quot;The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal&quot; (1991), examines human evolution and its relevance to the modern world, incorporating evidence from anthropology, evolutionary biology, genetics, ecology, and linguistics. The book traces how humans evolved to be so different from other animals, despite sharing over 98% of our DNA with our closest animal relatives, the chimpanzees. The book also examines the animal origins of language, art, agriculture, smoking and drug use, and other apparently uniquely human attributes. It was well received by critics and won the 1992 Rhône-Poulenc Prize for Science Books and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize.

=== &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; (1997) ===
His second and best known popular science book, &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies&quot;, was published in 1997. It asks why Eurasian peoples conquered or displaced Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of vice versa. It argues that this outcome was not due to genetic advantages of Eurasian peoples themselves but instead to features of the Eurasian continent, in particular, its high diversity of wild plant and animal species suitable for domestication and its east/west major axis that favored the spread of those domesticates, people, technologies—and diseases—for long distances with little change in latitude.

The first part of the book focuses on reasons why only a few species of wild plants and animals proved suitable for domestication. The second part discusses how local food production based on those domesticates led to the development of dense and stratified human populations, writing, centralized political organization, and epidemic infectious diseases. The third part compares the development of food production and of human societies among different continents and world regions. &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; became an international best-seller, was translated into 33 languages, and received several awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, an Aventis Prize for Science Books and the 1997 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science. A television documentary series based on the book was produced by the National Geographic Society in 2005.

The book is controversial among anthropologists. 

=== &quot;Why is Sex Fun?&quot; (1997) ===

In his third book, &quot;Why is Sex Fun?&quot;, also published in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features of human sexuality that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers as well as by mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.

=== &quot;Collapse&quot; (2005) ===
Diamond&#x27;s next book, &quot;&quot;, published in 2005, examines a range of past societies in an attempt to identify why they either collapsed or continued to thrive and considers what contemporary societies can learn from these historical examples. As in &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, he argues against explanations for the failure of past societies based primarily on cultural factors, instead focusing on ecology. Among the societies mentioned in the book are the Norse and Inuit of Greenland, the Maya, the Anasazi, the indigenous people of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Japan, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and modern Montana.

The book concludes by asking why some societies make disastrous decisions, how big businesses affect the environment, what our principal environmental problems are today, and what individuals can do about those problems. Like &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, &quot;Collapse&quot; was translated into dozens of languages, became an international best-seller, and was the basis of a television documentary produced by the National Geographic Society. &quot;Collapse&quot; was also nominated for the Royal Society Prize for Science Books. When it was nominated, Diamond was the only author to have won the award twice previously, though he did not win a third time.

Fifteen archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, and historians from the American Anthropological Association criticized Diamond&#x27;s methods and conclusions, working together with the larger association to publish the book &quot;Questioning Collapse&quot; as a counter to Diamond&#x27;s claims. In response, Diamond, as an editor at the time for the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, published an official review in the journal negatively covering the book, without mentioning that the book was a critique of his own work. The authors and the publisher, Cambridge University Press, called out Diamond for his conflict of interest on the subject.

=== &quot;Vengeance is Ours&quot; controversy (2008) ===
In 2008, Diamond published an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; entitled &quot;Vengeance Is Ours&quot;, describing the role of revenge in tribal warfare in Papua New Guinea. A year later, two indigenous people mentioned in the article filed a lawsuit against Diamond and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, claiming the article defamed them. In 2013, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that the lawsuit &quot;was withdrawn by mutual consent after the sudden death of their lawyer.&quot;

=== &quot;Natural Experiments of History&quot; (2010) ===
In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) &quot;Natural Experiments of History&quot;, a collection of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of history that he advocates. The book&#x27;s title stems from the fact that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed. The book&#x27;s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions on how to address those difficulties.

=== &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot; (2012) ===
In &quot;The World Until Yesterday&quot;, published in 2012, Diamond asks what the western world can learn from traditional societies. It surveys 39 traditional small-scale societies of farmers and hunter-gatherers with respect to how they deal with universal human problems. The problems discussed include dividing space, resolving disputes, bringing up children, treatment of elders, dealing with dangers, formulating religions, learning multiple languages, and remaining healthy. The book suggests that some practices of traditional societies could be usefully adopted in the modern industrial world today, either by individuals or else by society as a whole.

=== &quot;Upheaval&quot; (2019) ===
In &quot;&quot; Diamond examines whether nations can find lessons during crises in a way like people do. The nations considered are Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, and the U.S. Diamond identifies four modern threats: nuclear weapons, climate change, limited resources, and extreme inequality.

Anand Giridharadas, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, claimed the book contained many factual inaccuracies. Daniel Immerwahr, reviewing for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, reports that Diamond has &quot;jettisoned statistical analysis&quot; and the associated rigour, even by the standards of his earlier books, which have themselves sometimes been challenged on this basis.

==Personal life==
Diamond is married to Marie Cohen, granddaughter of Polish politician Edward Werner. They have twin sons, born in 1987. Although Diamond is a non practicing Jew and has described religion as irrational, he and his wife attend High Holiday services.

== Reception ==
While Diamond&#x27;s writings have received considerable praise, they are controversial among anthropologists, with his argumentation having been described as &quot;shallow&quot;, with criticism suggesting that Diamond overemphasises the importance of environmental factors like geography and climate over other influences.

<text>A pollinator is an animal that moves pollen from the male anther of a flower to the female stigma of a flower. This helps to bring about fertilization of the ovules in the flower by the male gametes from the pollen grains.

Insects are the major pollinators of most plants, and insect pollinators include all families of bees and most families of aculeate wasps; ants; many families of flies; many lepidopterans (both butterflies and moths); and many families of beetles. Vertebrates, mainly bats and birds, but also some non-bat mammals (monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents) and some lizards pollinate certain plants. Among the pollinating birds are hummingbirds, honeyeaters and sunbirds with long beaks; they pollinate a number of deep-throated flowers. Humans may also carry out artificial pollination.

A pollinator is different from a pollenizer, a plant that is a source of pollen for the pollination process.

==Background==
Plants fall into pollination syndromes that reflect the type of pollinator being attracted. These are characteristics such as: overall flower size, the depth and width of the corolla, the color (including patterns called nectar guides that are visible only in ultraviolet light), the scent, amount of nectar, composition of nectar, etc. For example, birds visit red flowers with long, narrow tubes and much nectar, but are not as strongly attracted to wide flowers with little nectar and copious pollen, which are more attractive to beetles. When these characteristics are experimentally modified (altering colour, size, orientation), pollinator visitation may decline.

Although non-bee pollinators have been seen to be less effective at depositing pollen than bee pollinators one study showed that non-bees made more visits than bees resulting in non-bees performing 38% of visits to crop flowers, outweighing the ineffectiveness of their ability to pollinate.

It has recently been discovered that cycads, which are not flowering plants, are also pollinated by insects. In 2016, researchers showed evidence of pollination occurring underwater, which was previously thought not to happen.

==Types of pollinators==
=== Insects ===
==== Bees ====

The most recognized pollinators are the various species of bees, which are plainly adapted to pollination. Bees typically are fuzzy and carry an electrostatic charge. Both features help pollen grains adhere to their bodies, but they also have specialized pollen-carrying structures; in most bees, this takes the form of a structure known as the scopa, which is on the hind legs of most bees, and/or the lower abdomen (e.g., of megachilid bees), made up of thick, plumose setae. Honey bees, bumblebees, and their relatives do not have a scopa, but the hind leg is modified into a structure called the corbicula (also known as the &quot;pollen basket&quot;). Most bees gather nectar, a concentrated energy source, and pollen, which is high protein food, to nurture their young, and transfer some among the flowers as they are working. Euglossine bees pollinate orchids, but these are male bees collecting floral scents rather than females gathering nectar or pollen. Female orchid bees act as pollinators, but of flowers other than orchids. Eusocial bees such as honey bees need an abundant and steady pollen source to multiply.
Honey bees travel from flower to flower, collecting nectar (later converted to honey), and pollen grains. The bee collects the pollen by rubbing against the anthers. The pollen collects on the hind legs, in a structure referred to as a &quot;pollen basket&quot;. As the bee flies from flower to flower, some of the pollen grains are transferred onto the stigma of other flowers. Nectar provides the energy for bee nutrition; pollen provides the protein. When bees are rearing large quantities of brood (beekeepers say hives are &quot;building&quot;), bees deliberately gather pollen to meet the nutritional needs of the brood.

Good pollination management seeks to have bees in a &quot;building&quot; state during the bloom period of the crop, thus requiring them to gather pollen, and making them more efficient pollinators. Thus, the management techniques of a beekeeper providing pollination services are different from, and to some extent in tension with, those of a beekeeper who is trying to produce honey. Millions of hives of honey bees are contracted out as pollinators by beekeepers, and honey bees are by far the most important commercial pollinating agents, but many other kinds of pollinators, from blue bottle flies, to bumblebees, orchard mason bees, and leaf cutter bees are cultured and sold for managed pollination.

Other species of bees differ in various details of their behavior and pollen-gathering habits, and honey bees are not native to the Western Hemisphere; all pollination of native plants in the Americas and Australia historically has been performed by various native bees. It has also been found that non-native plants may have positive effects on native bee pollinators while also influencing their foraging patterns and bee–plant networks.

==== Butterflies and moths ====

Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) may also pollinate to various degrees. They are not major pollinators of food crops, but various moths are important pollinators of other commercial crops such as tobacco. Pollination by certain moths may be important, however, or even crucial, for some wildflowers mutually adapted to specialist pollinators. Spectacular examples include orchids such as &quot;Angraecum sesquipedale&quot;, dependent on a particular hawk moth, Morgan&#x27;s sphinx. &quot;Yucca&quot; species provide other examples, being fertilised in elaborate ecological interactions with particular species of yucca moths.

==== Flies ====
Many bee flies, and some Tabanidae and Nemestrinidae are particularly adapted to pollinating fynbos and Karoo plants with narrow, deep corolla tubes, such as &quot;Lapeirousia&quot; species. Part of the adaptation takes the form of remarkably long probosces. This also applies to empidine dance flies (Empidinae) that visit a wide range of flowering plants, some species of which can pollinate the woodland geranium (&quot;Geranium sylvaticum&quot; L.) as effectively as bees.
Carrion flies and flesh flies in families such as Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae are important for some species of plants whose flowers exude a fetid odor. The plants&#x27; ecological strategy varies; several species of &quot;Stapelia&quot;, for example, attract carrion flies that futilely lay their eggs on the flower, where their larvae promptly starve for lack of carrion. Other species do decay rapidly after ripening, and offer the visiting insects large masses of food, as well as pollen and sometimes seed to carry off when they leave.

Hoverflies are important pollinators of flowering plants worldwide. Often hoverflies are considered to be the second most important pollinators after wild bees. Although hoverflies as a whole are generally considered to be nonselective pollinators, some species have more specialized relationships. The orchid species &quot;Epipactis veratrifolia&quot; mimics alarm pheromones of aphids to attract hover flies for pollination. Another plant, the slipper orchid in southwest China, also achieves pollination by deceit by exploiting the innate yellow colour preference of syrphids.

Some male dacine fruit flies are exclusive pollinators of some wild &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; orchids that lack nectar and have a specific chemical attractant and reward (methyl eugenol, raspberry ketone or zingerone) present in their floral fragrances.

==== Other insects ====

Many insects other than bees accomplish pollination by visiting flowers for nectar or pollen, or commonly both. Many do so adventitiously, but the most important pollinators are specialists for at least parts of their life cycles for at least certain functions.

Prominent among Hymenoptera other than bees are predatory aculeate wasps (especially Crabronidae, Sphecidae, Vespidae, and Pompilidae). The term &quot;pollen wasps&quot;, in particular, is widely applied to the Masarinae, a subfamily of the Vespidae; they are remarkable among solitary wasps in that they specialise in gathering pollen for feeding their larvae, carried internally and regurgitated into a mud chamber prior to oviposition. Also, males of many species of bees and wasps, though they do not gather pollen, rely on flowers as sources of energy (in the form of nectar) and also as territories for meeting fertile females that visit the flowers.

Some Diptera (flies) may be the main pollinators at higher elevations of mountains, whereas bumblebee species are typically the only other pollinators in alpine regions at timberline and beyond.

Some adult mosquitoes, if they feed on nectar, may act as pollinators; &quot;Aedes communis&quot;, a species found in North America, is known to pollinate &quot;Platanthera obtusata&quot;, commonly referred as the blunt-leaved orchid.

Beetles of species that specialise in eating pollen, nectar, or flowers themselves, may be important cross-pollinators of some plants such as members of the Araceae and Zamiaceae, that produce prodigious amounts of pollen. Others, for example the Hopliini, specialise on flowers of Asteraceae and Aizoaceae.

Minute midges and flower-thrips can occur in vast numbers, moving between flowers and plant individuals, enabling some species to contribute to the pollination of tree-crops such as cacao, &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; L. (Malvaceae) and elderflower &quot;Sambucus nigra&quot; L. (Adoxaceae). Ants also pollinate some kinds of flowers, but for the most part they are parasites, consuming nectar and/or pollen without conveying useful amounts of pollen to a stigma. Other insect orders are rarely pollinators, and then typically only incidentally (e.g., Hemiptera such as Anthocoridae and Miridae).

A strategy of great biological interest is that of sexual deception, where plants, generally orchids, produce remarkably complex combinations of pheromonal attractants and physical mimicry that induce male bees or wasps to attempt to mate with them, conveying pollinia in the process. Examples are known from all continents apart from Antarctica, though Australia appears to be exceptionally rich in examples.

Whole groups of plants, such as certain fynbos &quot;Moraea&quot; and &quot;Erica&quot; species produce flowers on sticky peduncles or with sticky corolla tubes that only permit access to flying pollinators, whether bird, bat, or insect.

=== Other invertebrates ===
Experimental evidence has shown invertebrates (mostly small crustaceans) acting as pollinators in underwater environments. Beds of seagrass have been shown to reproduce this way in the absence of currents. It is not yet known how important invertebrate pollinators might be for other species. Later, &quot;Idotea balthica&quot; was discovered to help &quot;Gracilaria gracilis&quot; reproduce – the first known case of an animal helping algae reproduce.

===Vertebrates===
Bats are important pollinators of some tropical flowers, visiting to take nectar. Birds, particularly hummingbirds, honeyeaters and sunbirds also accomplish much pollination, especially of deep-throated flowers. Other vertebrates, such as kinkajous, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents and lizards have been recorded pollinating some plants.

Humans can be pollinators, as many gardeners have discovered that they must hand pollinate garden vegetables, whether because of pollinator decline or simply to keep a strain genetically pure. This can involve using a small brush or cotton swab to move pollen, or to simply tap or shake tomato blossoms to release the pollen for the self-pollinating flowers. Tomato blossoms are self-fertile, but (with the exception of potato-leaf varieties) have the pollen inside the anther, and the flower requires shaking to release the pollen through . This can be done by wind, by humans, or by a sonicating bee (one that vibrates its wing muscles while perched on the flower), such as a bumblebee. Sonicating bees are extremely efficient pollinators of tomatoes, and colonies of bumblebees are quickly replacing humans as the primary pollinators for greenhouse tomatoes.

== Floral and non-floral resources ==
Pollinators require a variety of resources. Most native bees in North America are solitary, ground-nesting species that collect a variety of natural resources including pollen, nectar, leaves, petals and resins to be used as sources of food, supplies for their larva, or nest linings. Floral diet diversity has been seen to increase immunocompetence levels in honeybees (Apis mellifera) where diets that consisted of a wide variety of flowering species induced higher glucose oxidase activity, which honeybees&#x27; produce to sterilize their colony. More than 30% of global bee species depend on non-floral resources for nest building, protection, health, pest resistance, and alternative food sources. Non-floral resources include leaves, soil, plant resins and secretions, and are often provided by woody-vegetation.

==Pollinator population declines and conservation==
Pollinators provide a key ecosystem service vital to the maintenance of both wild and agricultural plant communities. In 1999 the Convention on Biological Diversity issued the São Paulo Declaration on Pollinators, recognizing the critical role that these species play in supporting and maintaining terrestrial productivity as well as the survival challenges they face due to anthropogenic change. Today pollinators are considered to be in a state of decline; some species, such as Franklin&#x27;s bumble bee (&quot;Bombus franklini&quot;) have been red-listed and are in danger of extinction. Although managed bee hives are increasing worldwide, these can not compensate for the loss of wild pollinators in many locations.

A 2017 report done for the Center of Biological Diversity utilized data documented in the United States on native bee species and found that nearly 1 in 4 (347 species of 1,437 species) is imperiled and at increasing risk of extinction. More than half of the native bee species is in decline and 40% of global insect pollinators (primarily native bees) are highly threatened.

Declines in the health and population of pollinators pose what could be a significant threat to the integrity of biodiversity, to global food webs, and to human health. At least 80% of our world&#x27;s crop species require pollination to set seed. A 2021 study estimated that without pollinators, fertility would be reduced by 80% in half all wild plant species and one-third of all wild plant species would fail to produce any seeds at all.

An estimated one out of every three bites of food comes to us through the work of animal pollinators. The quality of pollinator service has declined over time and this had led to concerns that pollination will be less resistant to extinction in the future.

A 2022 study concludes that the decline of pollinator populations is responsible for 500,000 early human deaths per year by reducing the supply of healthy foods. A decline of pollinators has caused 3-5% loss of fruits, vegetables and nuts. Lower consumption of these healthy foods translates to 1% of all deaths, according to the authors.

=== Pesticide usage ===
Neonicotinoids (Neonics) are a class of synthetic insecticides that are the most widely applied pesticides today due to its water solubility and ability to treat a wide variety of pests. Neonics are highly environmentally persistent, and may contaminate terrestrial and aquatic habitats for as much as six years. Exposed honeybees&#x27; (Apis mellifera) have been seen to have lower reproductive output, reduction in nest building or failed to build nests, reduced foraging abilities, and weakened immunity.

===Strategy===
Researchers are still trying to determine how to scientifically best restore and maintain the diverse pollinator habitats found around the world. Many studies conclude that restoration and conservation are key to maintaining biodiversity and pollinator populations. According to the Kansas National Park Service, native tallgrass prairie was widespread through North America and home to over 300 species of flowering plants. This habitat is crucial to wild pollinators and now only covers 4% of its original 170-million acre range. By restoring wild pollinators natural habitat and maintaining Earth&#x27;s biodiversity, populations are assumed to increase. In recent times, environmental groups have put pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency to ban neonicotinoids, a type of insecticide.

On June 20, 2014, President Barack Obama issued a presidential memorandum entitled &quot;Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators&quot;. The President&#x27;s memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force, to be co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The memorandum stated:

In May 2015, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a &quot;National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators&quot;. The national strategy outlined a comprehensive approach to tackling and reducing the impact of multiple stressors on pollinator health, including pests and pathogens, reduced habitat, lack of nutritional resources, and exposure to pesticides. 

The national strategy laid out federal actions to achieve three goals:

Many of the priority projects that the national strategy identified focused on the I-35 corridor, which extends for from Texas to Minnesota. The area through which that highway travels provides spring and summer breeding habitats in the United States&#x27; key monarch migration corridor. 

The Pollinator Health Task Force simultaneously issued a &quot;Pollinator Research Action Plan&quot;. The Plan outlined five main action areas, covered in ten subject-specific chapters. The action areas were: (1) Setting a Baseline; (2) Assessing Environmental Stressors; (3) Restoring Habitat; (4) Understanding and Supporting Stakeholders; (5) Curating and Sharing Knowledge.

In June 2016, the Task Force issued a &quot;Pollinator Partnership Action Plan&quot;. That Plan provided examples of past, ongoing, and possible future collaborations between the federal government and non-federal institutions to support pollinator health under each of the national strategy&#x27;s goals.

==== North America ====
The North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) aims to promote pollinator health across the North America and has organized annual conferences since 1997, creates task forces to implement specific objectives that includes public education and policy research, and is developing strategic plans for conservation that looks to establish partnership between government entities. 11 pollinator-protection agreements have been signed between NAPCC and federal government agencies, responsible for more than 1.5 billion acres of land protections and management.

==== Europe ====
Along with the European Green Deal, which contains initiatives that support pollinator populations, the European Union has implemented the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 which includes the EU Pollinators Initiative that sets long-term objectives to reverse pollinator decline in diversity and numbers by 2030. This initiative includes: (1) improving knowledge of pollinator decline, its causes and consequences; (2) tackling the causes of pollinator decline; and (3) raising awareness, engaging society-at-large and promoting collaboration.

==== South America ====
The Healthy Hives Latin America 2020 (Salud Apícola 2020 Latinoamérica) program is a collaboration between the Bayer Bee Care Center and the Fraunhofer Chile Research Foundation, that works alongside local researchers at universities and beekeepers&#x27; associations. The program focuses on increasing the number of healthy worker bees and their colonies by monitoring honey bee health and the contributing factors. This includes educating beekeepers and research collaborations to jointly work on honey bee health. Founded in 2015 with a preliminary project in Chile, the program has expanded to Colombia, Argentina, and Costa Rica.

==== Global ====
The ‘Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators&#x27; (Promote Pollinators) was initiated in 2016 during the Convention on Biological Diversity&#x27;s Conference of the Parties (CBD COP13) and is a growing alliance of countries and observers who support the notion that country-led politics can lead to policy measures and innovative action to protect pollinators&#x27;. Their supporters are growing steadily, in which 30 countries currently participate.

== Structure of plant-pollinator networks ==
Wild pollinators often visit many plant species and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting out of the interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure was found to be similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.

The structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This allows pollinator species to survive together under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.

Such a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover, could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed.

<text>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (subtitled A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years in Britain) is a 1997 transdisciplinary nonfiction book by the American author Jared Diamond. The book attempts to explain why Eurasian and North African civilizations have survived and conquered others, while arguing against the idea that Eurasian hegemony is due to any form of Eurasian intellectual, moral, or inherent genetic superiority. Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback loops. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.

In 1998, it won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. A documentary based on the book, and produced by the National Geographic Society, was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.

== Synopsis ==

The prologue opens with an account of Diamond&#x27;s conversation with Yali, a Papua New Guinean politician. The conversation turned to the differences in power and technology between Papua New Guineans and the Europeans who dominated the region for two centuries, differences that neither of them considered due to European genetic superiority. Yali asked, using the local term &quot;cargo&quot; for inventions and manufactured goods, &quot;Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?&quot;

Diamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: &quot;People of Eurasian origin... dominate... the world in wealth and power.&quot; Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, &quot;have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.&quot;

The peoples of other continents (sub-Saharan Africans, Indigenous people of the Americas, Aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa&#x27;s indigenous Khoisan peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and Bantu. He believes this is due to these societies&#x27; technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last ice age.

=== Title ===
The book&#x27;s title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations and maintained dominance though sometimes being vastly outnumbered, so that imperialism was enabled by guns, germs, and steel.

Diamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable agricultural societies ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized states capable of dominating others.

=== Summary ===
Diamond argues that Eurasian civilization is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.

The first step towards civilization is the move from nomadic hunter-gatherer to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a climate dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to food surpluses. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which in turn lead to the organization of nation-states and empires.

Although agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has barley, two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich pulses for food; flax for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.

As early Western Asian civilizations developed trading relationships, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, such as horses and donkeys for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the llama and alpaca as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to extinction, probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the Pleistocene, and the only domesticated animals in New Guinea came from the East Asian mainland during the Austronesian settlement around 4,000–5,000 years ago. Biological relatives of the horse, including zebras and onagers, proved untameable; and although African elephants can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity. Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 &quot;candidates&quot;) as an instance of the Anna Karenina principle: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He argues that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.

Eurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; bullocks for tillage of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.
Eurasia&#x27;s large landmass and long east–west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided more plant and animal species suitable for domestication. Equally important, its east–west orientation has allowed groups of people to wander and empires to conquer from one end of the continent to the other while staying at the same latitude. This was important because similar climate and cycle of seasons let them keep the same &quot;food production system&quot; – they could keep growing the same crops and raising the same animals all the way from Scotland to Siberia. Doing this throughout history, they spread innovations, languages and diseases everywhere.

By contrast, the north–south orientation of the Americas and Africa created countless difficulties adapting crops domesticated at one latitude for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the Rocky Mountains to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia&#x27;s east–west orientation: in the first millennium BCE, the Mediterranean areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia&#x27;s animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the first millennium CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.

The plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made division of labor possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and scribes accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using guns and steel, particularly after the devastation of native populations by the epidemic diseases from germs.

Eurasia&#x27;s dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. Smallpox, measles, and influenza were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans. Natural selection endowed most Eurasians with genetic variations making them less susceptible to some diseases, and constant circulation of diseases meant adult individuals had developed immunity to a wide range of pathogens. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around. The &quot;trade&quot; in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia, where endemic malaria and yellow fever made these regions notorious as the &quot;white man&#x27;s grave&quot;. Some researchers say syphilis was known to Hippocrates, and others think it was brought from the Americas by Columbus and his successors. The European diseases from germs obliterated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of Europeans could maintain dominance.

Diamond proposes geographical explanations for why western European societies, rather than other Eurasian powers such as China, have been the dominant colonizers. He said Europe&#x27;s geography favored balkanization into smaller, closer nation-states, bordered by natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and coastline. Advanced civilization developed first in areas whose geography lacked these barriers, such as China, India and Mesopotamia. There, the ease of conquest meant they were dominated by large empires in which manufacturing, trade and knowledge flourished for millennia, while balkanized Europe remained more primitive.

However, at a later stage of development, western Europe&#x27;s fragmented governmental structure actually became an advantage. Monolithic, isolated empires without serious competition could continue mistaken policies – such as China squandering its naval mastery by banning the building of ocean-going ships – for long periods without immediate consequences. In Western Europe, by contrast, competition from immediate neighbors meant that governments could not afford to suppress economic and technological progress for long; if they did not correct their mistakes, they were out-competed and/or conquered relatively quickly. While the leading powers alternated, a constant was rapid development of knowledge which could not be suppressed. For instance, the Chinese Emperor could ban shipbuilding and be obeyed, ending China&#x27;s Age of Discovery, but the Pope could not keep Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; from being republished in Protestant countries, or Kepler and Newton from continuing his progress; this ultimately enabled European merchant ships and navies to navigate around the globe. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged desertification, and hurt soil fertility.

=== Agriculture ===

&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; argues that cities require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.

The crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, teosinte.

Also important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of &quot;large&quot; domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species endemic to Eurasia. Of the remaining nine, only two (the llama and alpaca both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.

Due to the Anna Karenina principle, surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, antelope, cape buffalo, and African elephant were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The Holocene extinction event eliminated many of the megafauna that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and Diamond argues that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (such as the Americas and Australia).

Smaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and guinea pigs may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain a large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.

=== Geography ===
Diamond argues that geography shaped human migration, not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun. The dominant Out of Africa theory holds that modern humans developed east of the Great Rift Valley of the African continent at one time or another. The Sahara kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the Nile River valley became accommodating. Diamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.

Diamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian, especially Chinese. The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe&#x27;s many natural barriers allowed the development of competing nation states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.

=== Germs ===
In the later context of the European colonization of the Americas, 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been killed off by diseases brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in Australia and South Africa. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were devastated by smallpox, measles, influenza, and other diseases.

Diamond questions how diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans, and posits that most of these diseases were developed and sustained only in large dense populations in villages and cities. He also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through natural selection (such as the Black Death and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for Native American hunter-gatherers and farmers.

He mentions the tropical diseases (mainly malaria) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.

=== Success and failure ===
&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; focuses on why some populations succeeded. Diamond&#x27;s later book, &quot;&quot;, focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.

== Intellectual background ==
In the 1930s, the Annales School in France undertook the study of long-term historical structures by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.

In 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of &quot;why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?&quot; in &quot;The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal&quot; (part four).

== Reception ==

=== Praise ===
Many noted that the large scope of the work makes some oversimplification inevitable while still praising the book as a very erudite and generally effective synthesis of multiple different subjects. Paul R. Ehrlich and E. O. Wilson both praised the book.

Northwestern University economic historian Joel Mokyr interpreted Diamond as a geographical determinist but added that the thinker could never be described as &quot;crude&quot; like many determinists. For Mokyr, Diamond&#x27;s view that Eurasia succeeded largely because of a uniquely large stock of domesticable plants is flawed because of the possibility of crop manipulation and selection in the plants of other regions: the drawbacks of an indigenous North American plant such as sumpweed could have been bred out, Mokyr wrote, since &quot;all domesticated plants had originally undesirable characteristics&quot; eliminated via &quot;deliberate and lucky selection mechanisms&quot;. Mokyr dismissed as unpersuasive Diamond&#x27;s theory that breeding specimens failing to fix characteristics controlled by multiple genes &quot;lay at the heart of the geographically challenged societies&quot;. Mokyr also states that in seeing economic history as centered on successful manipulation of environments, Diamond downplays the role of &quot;the option to move to a more generous and flexible area&quot;, and speculated that non-generous environments were the source of much human ingenuity and technology. However, Mokyr still argued that &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; is &quot;one of the more important contributions to long-term economic history and is simply mandatory to anyone who purports to engage Big Questions in the area of long-term global history&quot;. He lauded the book as full of &quot;clever arguments about writing, language, path dependence and so on. It is brimming with wisdom and knowledge, and it is the kind of knowledge economic historians have always loved and admired.&quot;

Berkeley economic historian Brad DeLong described the book as a &quot;work of complete and total genius&quot;. Harvard International Relations (IR) scholar Stephen Walt in a &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article called the book &quot;an exhilarating read&quot; and put it on a list of the ten books every IR student should read. Tufts University IR scholar Daniel W. Drezner listed the book on his top ten list of must-read books about international economic history.

International Relations scholars Iver B. Neumann (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that &quot;while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.&quot; According to the two writers, &quot;Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones&quot;, and note that Diamond &quot;immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew&quot;. But Neumann and Wigen also stated, &quot;Until somebody can come up with a better way of interpreting and adding to Diamond&#x27;s material with a view to understanding the same overarching problematique, his is the best treatment available of the ecological preconditions for why one part of the world, and not another, came to dominate.&quot; Historian Tonio Andrade writes that Diamond&#x27;s book &quot;may not satisfy professional historians on all counts&quot; but that it &quot;does make a bold and compelling case for the different developments that occurred in the Old World versus the New (he is less convincing in his attempts to separate Africa from Eurasia).&quot;

Historian Tom Tomlinson wrote that the magnitude of the task makes it inevitable that Professor Diamond would &quot;[use] very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument&quot;, but ultimately commended the book. Taking the account of prehistory &quot;on trust&quot; because it was not his area of expertise, Tomlinson stated that the existence of stronger weapons, diseases, and means of transport is convincing as an &quot;immediate cause&quot; of Old World societies and technologies being dominant, but questioned Diamond&#x27;s view that the way this has transpired has been through certain environments causing greater inventiveness which then caused more sophisticated technology. Tomlinson noted that technology spreads and allows for military conquests and the spread of economic changes, but that in Diamond&#x27;s book this aspect of human history &quot;is dismissed as largely a question of historical accident&quot;. Writing that Diamond gives meager coverage to the history of political thought, the historian suggested that capitalism (which Diamond classes as one of 10 plausible but incomplete explanations) has perhaps played a bigger role in prosperity than Diamond argues.

Tomlinson speculated that Diamond underemphasizes cultural idiosyncrasies as an explanation, and argues (with regards to the &quot;germs&quot; part of Diamond&#x27;s triad of reasons) that the Black Death of the 14th century, as well as smallpox and cholera in 19th century Africa, rival the Eurasian devastation of indigenous populations as overall &quot;events of human diffusion and coalescence&quot;. Tomlinson also found contentious Diamond&#x27;s view that humanity&#x27;s future can one day be foreseen with scientific rigor since this would involve a search for general laws that new theoretical approaches deny the possibility of establishing: &quot;The history of humans cannot properly be equated with the history of dinosaurs, glaciers or nebulas, because these natural phenomena do not consciously create the evidence on which we try to understand them&quot;. Tomlinson still described these flaws as &quot;minor&quot;, however, and wrote that &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; &quot;remains a very impressive achievement of imagination and exposition&quot;.

Another historian, professor J. R. McNeill, complimented the book for &quot;its improbable success in making students of international relations believe that prehistory is worth their attention&quot;, but likewise thought Diamond oversold geography as an explanation for history and under-emphasized cultural autonomy. McNeill wrote that the book&#x27;s success &quot;is well-deserved for the first nineteen chapters–excepting a few passages–but that the twentieth chapter carries the argument beyond the breaking point, and excepting a few paragraphs, is not an intellectual success.&quot; But McNeill concluded, &quot;While I have sung its praises only in passing and dwelt on its faults, [...] overall I admire the book for its scope, for its clarity, for its erudition across several disciplines, for the stimulus it provides, for its improbable success in making students of international relations believe that prehistory is worth their attention, and, not least, for its compelling illustration that human history is embedded in the larger web of life on earth.&quot; Tonio Andrade described McNeill&#x27;s review as &quot;perhaps the fairest and most succinct summary of professional world historians&#x27; perspectives on &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;&quot;.

In 2010, Tim Radford of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the book &quot;exhilarating&quot; and lauded the passages about plants and animals as &quot;beautifully constructed&quot;.

A 2023 study in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; assessed Diamond&#x27;s claims about topography influencing Chinese unification and contributing to European fragmentation. The study&#x27;s model found that topography was a sufficient condition for the varied outcomes in Asia and Europe, but that it was not a necessary condition.

=== Criticism ===
The anthropologist Jason Antrosio described &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; as a form of &quot;academic porn&quot;, writing, &quot;Diamond&#x27;s account makes all the factors of European domination a product of a distant and accidental history&quot; and &quot;has almost no role for human agency—the ability people have to make decisions and influence outcomes. Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate.&quot; He added, &quot;Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history. He has tremendously distorted the role of domestication and agriculture in that history. Unfortunately his story-telling abilities are so compelling that he has seduced a generation of college-educated readers.&quot;

In his last book, published in 2000, the anthropologist and geographer James Morris Blaut criticized &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, among other reasons, for reviving the theory of environmental determinism, and described Diamond as an example of a modern Eurocentric historian. Blaut criticizes Diamond&#x27;s loose use of the terms &quot;Eurasia&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot;, which he believes misleads the reader into presuming that Western Europe is responsible for technological inventions that arose in the Middle East and Asia.

Anthropologist Kerim Friedman wrote, &quot;While it is interesting and important to ask why technologies developed in some countries as opposed to others, I think it overlooks a fundamental issue: the inequality within countries as well as between them.&quot; Timothy Burke, an instructor in African history at Swarthmore College wrote: &quot;Anthropologists and historians interested in non-Western societies and Western colonialism also get a bit uneasy with a big-picture explanation of world history that seems to cancel out or radically de-emphasize the importance of the many small differences and choices after 1500 whose effects many of us study carefully.&quot;

Economists Daron Acemoğlu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson have written extensively about the effect of political institutions on the economic well-being of former European colonies. Their writing finds evidence that, when controlling for the effect of institutions, the income disparity between nations located at various distances from the equator disappears through the use of a two-stage least squares regression quasi-experiment using settler mortality as an instrumental variable. Their 2001 academic paper explicitly mentions and challenges the work of Diamond, and this critique is brought up again in Acemoğlu and Robinson&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;Why Nations Fail&quot;.

The book &quot;Questioning Collapse&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by fifteen archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, and historians criticizing various aspects of Diamond&#x27;s books &quot;&quot; and &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot;. The book was a result of 2006 meeting of the American Anthropological Association in response to the misinformation they felt Diamond&#x27;s popular science publications were causing and the association decided to combine experts from multiple fields of research to cover the claims made in Diamond&#x27;s and debunk them. The book includes research from indigenous peoples of the societies Diamond discussed as collapsed and also vignettes of living examples of those communities, in order to showcase the main theme of the book on how societies are resilient and change into new forms over time, rather than collapsing.

=== Awards and honors ===
&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; won the 1997 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science. In 1998, it won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, in recognition of its powerful synthesis of many disciplines, and the Royal Society&#x27;s Rhône-Poulenc Prize for Science Books.

== Publication ==
&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; was first published by W. W. Norton in March 1997. It was published in Great Britain with the title &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years&quot; by Vintage in 1998. It was a selection of Book of the Month Club, History Book Club, Quality Paperback Book Club, and Newbridge Book Club.

In 2003 and 2007, updated English-language editions were released without changing any conclusions.

The National Geographic Society produced a documentary, starring Jared Diamond, based on the book and of the same title, that was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.

<doc id="106089" wikidata="Q1058884" url="?curid=106089" title="Who's on First?">
<text>&quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; is a comedy routine made famous by American comedy duo Abbott and Costello. The premise of the sketch is that Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello. However, the players&#x27; names can simultaneously serve as the basis for questions (e.g., &quot;&quot;Who&quot; is the first baseman?&quot;) and responses (e.g., &quot;The first baseman&#x27;s name is &quot;Who&quot;.&quot;), leading to reciprocal misunderstanding and growing frustration between the performers. Although it is commonly known as &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;, Abbott and Costello frequently referred to it simply as &quot;Baseball&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; is descended from minstrel and turn-of-the-century wordplay sketches. One of the most famous was developed by Weber and Fields and called &quot;I Work On Watt Street&quot;. Other examples include &quot;The Baker Scene&quot; (the comedian &quot;loafs&quot; at a bakery located on Watt Street) and &quot;Who Dyed&quot; (the business owner is named &quot;Who&quot;). In the 1930 movie &quot;Cracked Nuts&quot;, comedians Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this: &quot;What is next to Which.&quot; &quot;What is the name of the town next to Which?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; In British music halls, comedian Will Hay performed a routine in the early 1930s (and possibly earlier) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named Howe, who came from Ware, but now lives in Wye. By the early 1930s, a &quot;Baseball Routine&quot; had become a standard bit in burlesque in the United States. Abbott&#x27;s wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello.

Bud Abbott stated that it was taken from an older routine called &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, a performance of which can be heard in an episode of the radio comedy program &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot; from the 1940s. After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936, he and Costello continued to hone the sketch. It was a big hit in the fall of 1937, when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called &quot;Hollywood Bandwagon&quot;.

In February 1938, Abbott and Costello joined the cast of &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; radio program and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience on March 24 of that year. The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer John Grant, who became the team&#x27;s chief collaborator, and Will Glickman, a staff writer on the Smith show. Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like Dizzy and Daffy Dean to set up the routine&#x27;s premise. This version, with extensive wordplay based on most of the fictional baseball team&#x27;s players having &quot;strange nicknames&quot; that seemed to be questions, became known as &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; Some versions continue with references to Enos Slaughter, which Costello misunderstands as &quot;He knows&quot; Slaughter. By 1944, Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted.

Abbott and Costello performed &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; hundreds of times in their careers. Although it was rarely performed precisely the same way twice, the routine follows a definite structure. They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times. An abridged version was featured in the team&#x27;s 1940 film debut, &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot;. The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot; and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition. They also performed &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; several times on radio and television (notably in &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; episode &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Home&quot;).

In 1956, a gold record of &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; was placed in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. A video (taken from &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot;) now plays continuously on screens at the Hall.

In the 1970s, Selchow and Righter published a &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; board game.

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; named the routine Best Comedy Sketch of the 20th Century.

An early radio recording from October 6, 1938, was placed in the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry in 2002.

In 2005, the line &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; was included on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 memorable movie quotations.

==Sketch==
The names given in the routine for the players at each position are:

The name of the shortstop is not given until the very end of the routine and the right fielder is never identified. In the Selchow and Righter board game, the right fielder&#x27;s name is &quot;Nobody&quot;.

At one point in the routine, Costello thinks that the first baseman is named &quot;Naturally&quot;:

Abbott&#x27;s explanations leave Costello hopelessly confused and infuriated, until the end of the routine when Costello appears to parody Abbott by saying what appears to be gibberish to him, but accidentally getting it right:

That is the most commonly heard ending. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a &quot;Damn&quot;&quot; have also turned up on occasion, depending on the perceived sensibilities of the audience. (The performance in the film &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot; ends with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;.)

The skit was usually performed on the team&#x27;s radio series at the start of the baseball season. In one instance it serves as a climax for a broadcast which begins with Costello receiving a telegram from Joe DiMaggio asking Costello to take over for him due to his injury. (In this case, the unidentified right fielder would have been Costello himself. While Joe DiMaggio was best known as a center fielder, when Abbott and Costello honed the sketch in 1936–37, Joe DiMaggio had played a number of games at right field (20 in 1936).)

==Writing credit==
&quot;Who&#x27;s On First?&quot; evolved from earlier wordplay sketches but it is not known who transposed the basic wordplay to baseball, although numerous people have claimed or been given credit for it. Such claims typically lack reasonable corroboration. For example, a 1993 obituary of comedy sketch writer Michael J. Musto (1919–1993) states that, shortly after Abbott and Costello teamed up, they paid Musto $15 to write the script. Several 1996 obituaries of songwriter Irving Gordon (1915–1996) mention that he had written the sketch. Musto would have been 17 when Abbott and Costello teamed in 1936, but a script entitled &quot;The Baseball Rookie,&quot; with the names of Costello and Joe Lyons, his straight man before Abbott, dates even earlier, perhaps to 1934, when Musto would have been 15 and Gordon would have been 19.

==Copyright infringement case==
In 2015, the heirs of Abbott and Costello filed a federal copyright infringement lawsuit in the Southern District of New York claiming unauthorized use of over a minute of the comedy routine in the play &quot;Hand to God&quot;. The suit named producer Kevin McCollum, playwright Robert Askins, and the promoters as defendants. The defense claimed that the underlying &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; routine was in the public domain because the original authors, Abbott and Costello, were not the ones who filed a copyright renewal, but the court did not see the need to make a final determination on that. The court ruled against the heirs, saying that the use by the play was transformative.

On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court in 2016 but for the other reason. The one minute of the routine used in the play did &quot;not&quot; constitute transformative fair use, since it was a significant portion and was taken word for word. But that was moot since the court also found that the heirs had failed to establish that they owned the copyright. (The court did not reach the issue of whether the routine had entered the public domain since the parties had apparently stipulated that they believed its copyright term was coterminous with &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot;, where it had first been published for purposes of copyright law at that time).
The U.S. Supreme Court denied &quot;certiorari&quot; on the case in 2017.

==Derivatives and references in popular culture==

The sketch has been reprised, updated, alluded to and parodied many times over the decades in all forms of media. Some examples include:

* The comedy troupe The Credibility Gap (1968–1979) did a rock group variation on this routine involving a promoter, played by Harry Shearer and a newspaper advertising salesman, played by David L. Lander, confusing the night&#x27;s acts as proper nouns. The acts were The Who, The Guess Who and Yes.
* Eugene Levy and Tony Rosato performed a variation on this theme on the TV series &quot;SCTV&quot; (1976–1984), with the rock groups The Band, The Who and Yes. The final punchline changed to &quot;This is for the birds (The Byrds)!&quot; &quot;Ah, they broke up long ago!&quot;
* Episode six of the fourth season of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1981) is entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;. It revolves around Mr. Carlson being mistaken for Herb Tarlek, and to &quot;prove Andy wrong&quot; Les Nessman is then convinced to act as Mr. Carlson. When a thug named Dave shows up to confront Johnny Fever about an unpaid gambling debt, Johnny claims Andy Travis&#x27;s identity, while Mr. Carlson refers to Andy as &quot;Johnny&quot; ... with painful consequences for Andy.
*Author and poet Shel Silverstein&#x27;s poem &quot;The Meehoo with an Exactlywatt&quot;, featured in his 1981 poetry collection &quot;A Light in the Attic&quot;, is stated in the afterword by Silverstein himself to have been inspired by Abbott and Costello&#x27;s routine.
* The biography of Lou Costello written by his daughter Chris is titled &quot;Lou&#x27;s on First&quot; (1982).
* In the mid-1980s, Johnny Carson&#x27;s spoof of then-president Ronald Reagan preparing for a press briefing included &quot;Hu is on the phone&quot;, a reference to fictional Chinese leader Chung Dong Hu. Reagan also misunderstands references to Secretary of the Interior James Watt (misheard as &quot;what&quot;) and PLO leader Yassir Arafat (misheard as &quot;Yes sir&quot;).
* In the 1988 film &quot;Rain Man&quot;, the film&#x27;s titular character, played by Dustin Hoffman, stims by reciting the skit to himself whenever his brother Charlie, played by Tom Cruise, makes him anxious by meddling with his personal effects.
* In the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; segment &quot;Woodstock Slappy&quot; (1994), Slappy and Skippy Squirrel attend the 1969 Woodstock Festival, where they pay homage to the routine. Similar to the SCTV version, Slappy confuses The Who, The Band and Yes for proper nouns.
* In the &quot;Invasion of the Neptune Men&quot; episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1998, during one host segment, Mike and the &#x27;Bots put on a Who&#x27;s on First-themed skit concerning Japanese Noh Theater.
* Mad Magazine&#x27;s February 1999 issue featured an article (written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Mort Drucker) of Abbott and Costello trying to organize MTV&#x27;s music video library, with Costello getting confused by the names of songs such as &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot;, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, &quot;What You Want&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;, &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Quit Playing Games&quot;. The names of bands U2 and No Doubt also cause confusion.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Marge Simpson in: &#x27;Screaming Yellow Honkers&#x27;, (1999) Superintendent Chalmers and Principal Skinner attempt to perform the routine, but Chalmers gives up after Skinner explains the joke with his first line: &quot;Not the pronoun, but rather a player with the unlikely name of &quot;Who&quot; is on first.&quot;
* In &quot;The PJ&#x27;s&quot; episode &quot;The HJs&quot;, (2000) Thurgood reopens the apartment building&#x27;s radio station and forms an unexpected comedy team with the community&#x27;s beloved crack addict, Smokey. They parody the comedy bit with Smokey saying, &quot;Who&#x27;s on crack, Say What&#x27;s on smack, and I Don&#x27;t Know is on freebase.&quot;
* In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Extra Large Medium&quot;, Peter Griffin, in his psychic routine, attempts to solve a case for the police (namely, a person being buried alive with a bomb attached to him) by &quot;summoning the spirit&quot; of Lou Costello. He and the police officer, Joe Swanson, then reenact the routine when it&#x27;s revealed the person&#x27;s name is Melvin Hu. Unfortunately, they do the scene so long that the bomb explodes and kills him, at which time Peter dropped the act and admitted he wasn&#x27;t a psychic. 
* In 2002, playwright Jim Sherman wrote a variation called &quot;Hu&#x27;s on First&quot; featuring George W. Bush being confused when Condoleezza Rice tells him that the new leader of China is named Hu, pronounced similarly to the word &quot;Who&quot;. Bush also misunderstands Rice&#x27;s references to Yassir Arafat (&quot;yes, sir&quot;) and Kofi Annan (&quot;coffee&quot;).. He also hears Rice introduce herself, particularly using her last name, while talking on the phone and immediately craves rice, wanting to order some to eat.
*In the &quot;Get Fuzzy&quot; comic for September 12, 2005, an injured Rob asks Satchel to use speed dial to call &quot;Dr Watt&quot;, who is second on the speed dial list after Dr. Hu. Satchel gleefully replies &quot;Third Base!&quot;, much to Rob&#x27;s annoyance.
* In the 2007 film Rush Hour 3, LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) visits a Kung Fu studio where he meets Master Yu and an instructor named Mi. Carter, Yu and Mi engage in a comedic back and forth in which they confuse the names Yu and Mi with the words &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot;.
* In 2007, Canadian Internet comedy group LoadingReadyRun released a parody called &quot;It&#x27;s Very Simple&quot;.
* &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, in December 2012, featured a variation of the routine called &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?: The Sequel&quot;. Depicted with vintage touches (black and white images, retro costumes, etc.), the skit finds host Jimmy Fallon in the Bud Abbott role and announcer Steve Higgins as Lou Costello. The twist here is that &quot;Who&quot;, &quot;What&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; actually join in on the quick repartee, with the players respectively played by Billy Crystal, &quot;Late Night&quot; head writer A. D. Miles and Jerry Seinfeld.
* In &quot;Bojack Horseman&quot; episode &quot;Downer Ending&quot;, (2014) a group of characters encounter a doctor named Allan Hu, which Bojack at first confuses with BBC television show Doctor Who; which Bojack&#x27;s roommate Todd Sanchez further confuses for Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman. In utter confusion,Todd at one point says &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, to which all the characters simultaneously exclaim &quot;Third base!&quot;.
* The October 19, 2014, strip of the comic &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; sees Rat ask Goat &quot;Whose drummer was Keith Moon?&quot; Goat responds that he is correct, although Rat does not understand that Goat is telling him Moon was the drummer for The Who. It leads to a routine of more confusions, including Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, Steve Howe of Yes and Pete Townshend – also of The Who. Thinking Goat is asking what band Townshend is the guitarist for, an exasperated Rat screams &quot;I don&#x27;t know!&quot; Goat replies &quot;Third base!&quot; The final panel sees the still-exasperated Rat threatening to hit the comic&#x27;s author Stephan Pastis with a baseball bat, asking &quot;When would you like this hit?&quot;. Pastis responds &quot;Winwood&#x27;s the guitarist for Traffic.&quot;
* The 2015 puzzle video game &quot;Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes&quot; features a module officially referred to on page 9 of the Bomb Defusal Manual V1 as Who&#x27;s on First. Its description reads: &quot;This contraption is like something out of a sketch comedy routine, which might be funny if it wasn&#x27;t connected to a bomb. I’ll keep this brief, as words only complicate matters&quot;. The module works similarly to the routine, in which the Defuser must recite the word that appears on the module&#x27;s display to the Expert. The Expert must then follow the steps in the manual to tell the Defuser which button to press. The reference comes in the form of the words that appear on the module&#x27;s buttons, some of them being homophones of other words that may appear, an example being the words there, they&#x27;re and their, thus resulting in a similar confusion to that of the sketch.
* In 2017, &quot;Studio C&quot; made a spin-off of this as a sketch in their seventh season, titled &quot;Detective Doctor, At Your Service&quot;, where several characters have names such as Detective Doctor, Doctor Hisbrother and Officer Wounded, making the scene of an attempted murder much more confusing to deal with.
* Emcee duo Blanche Debris and Jonny Porkpie did an adaptation of the sketch at the 2017 Burlesque Hall of Fame weekender and reunion, recontextualized as the lineup for a burlesque show.
* In season 11 of &quot;All That&quot; (2019), the &quot;Good Burger&quot; sketch used the routine, in which Kel Mitchell&#x27;s character Ed became confused when musical guest H.E.R. walked in to place an order after she told him who she was.

* A variant of unknown origin, called &quot;Abbot and Costello do Hebrew&quot;, is popular in the Jewish American community. Its humor draws from the homophonic similarity of a number of words in English – hu, he, me, ma and dag are homophones of the Hebrew words for he, she, who, what and fish respectively.
* The skit is an easter egg on Google Assistant, Siri, Amazon Alexa and Bixby. Asking Google Assistant &quot;OK Google, Who&#x27;s on first?&quot; will lead to the response &quot;Yes, he is.&quot; or &quot;Exactly.&quot; Siri responds &quot;Correct. Who is on first.&quot; Alexa responds &quot;That&#x27;s what I keep telling you. Who&#x27;s on first, What&#x27;s on second.&quot; Bixby responds &quot;I think Who gets the ball and throws it to What.&quot;
* There are several American restaurants named &quot;Who&#x27;s on First&quot;, located on 1st Street or 1st Avenue of their respective cities, including New York City, Waconia, MN and Snohomish, WA
* In the spring split of 2022, League Championship Series casters Azael and Captain Flowers performed a spin-off of the skit using &quot;River&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, the tags of two players from the esports team Dignitas as well as the river location and blue jungle camp on Summoner&#x27;s Rift.

==Real-life parallels==
On several occasions, players with names phonetically similar to the characters in the sketch reached the appropriate bases as runners, or defended them as infielders:
* On October 3, 1920, Allie Watt played one game at second base for the Washington Senators so that, for a brief time, &quot;Watt&#x27;s on second&quot;.
*During a May 31, 1966, game against the Minnesota Twins, relief-pitcher Eddie Watt of the Baltimore Orioles led off the 5th inning with his only career double, again creating a &quot;Watt&#x27;s on second&quot; situation.
*In September 2007, Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Chin-Lung Hu, a late-season callup from Las Vegas, got his first major league hit against the Arizona Diamondbacks, a single; Dodgers announcer Vin Scully said &quot;Shades of Abbott and Costello, I can finally say, &#x27;Hu is on first base.

<text>George Edward Clinton (born July 22, 1941) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer and bandleader. His Parliament-Funkadelic collective (which primarily recorded under the distinct band names Parliament and Funkadelic) developed an influential and eclectic form of funk music during the 1970s that drew on Afrofuturism, outlandish fashion, psychedelia, and surreal humor. He launched his solo career with the 1982 album &quot;Computer Games&quot; and would go on to influence 1990s hip-hop and G-funk.

Clinton is regarded, along with James Brown and Sly Stone, as one of the foremost innovators of funk music. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, alongside 15 other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. In 2019, he and Parliament-Funkadelic were given Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
George Edward Clinton was born in Kannapolis, North Carolina, grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, and as of 2024 has lived in Tallahassee, Florida for thirty years. During his teen years, Clinton formed a doo-wop group inspired by Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers called the Parliaments, while straightening hair at a barbershop in Plainfield, New Jersey.

The West End of Plainfield was once home to a barbershop on 216 Plainfield Avenue known as &quot;Silk Palace&quot;. Owned in part by Clinton, it was staffed by various members of Parliament-Funkadelic, and known as the &quot;hangout for all the local singers and musicians&quot; in Plainfield&#x27;s 1950s and 1960s doo-wop, soul, rock, and proto-funk music scene.

===1960s and 1970s===
For a period in the 1960s Clinton was a staff songwriter for Motown. Despite initial commercial failure and one major hit single (&quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot; in 1967), as well as arranging and producing scores of singles on many of the independent Detroit soul music labels, the Parliaments eventually found success under the names Parliament and Funkadelic in the 1970s (see also P-Funk). These two bands combined the elements of musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Frank Zappa, and James Brown while exploring various sounds, technology, and lyricism. Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic dominated Black music during the 1970s, with over 40 R&amp;B hit singles (including three number ones) and three platinum albums.

From 1971 to late 1973, Clinton and several other members of the band settled in Toronto. During their years in Toronto, they honed their live show and recorded the album &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot;, which was their first to feature Bootsy Collins.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, Clinton began to encounter legal difficulties arising from PolyGram&#x27;s acquisition of Parliament&#x27;s label, Casablanca Records. He recorded several solo albums, although all of these records featured contributions from P-Funk&#x27;s core musicians. This period of Clinton&#x27;s career was marred by multiple legal problems resulting in financial difficulties due to royalty and copyright issues, notably with Bridgeport Music, who Clinton claims fraudulently obtained the copyrights to many of his recordings.

In 1982, Clinton was signed to Capitol Records under two names: his own as a solo artist, and as the P-Funk All-Stars, releasing &quot;Computer Games&quot; under his own name that same year. The single &quot;Loopzilla&quot; hit the Top 20 on the R&amp;B charts, followed by &quot;Atomic Dog&quot;, which reached #1 R&amp;B and #101 on the pop chart. In the next four years, Clinton released three more studio albums &quot;(You Shouldn&#x27;t-Nuf Bit Fish&quot;, &quot;Some of My Best Jokes Are Friends&quot;, and &quot;R&amp;B Skeletons in the Closet&quot;) as well as a live album, &quot;Mothership Connection (Live from the Summit, Houston, Texas)&quot; and charting three singles in the R&amp;B Top 30, &quot;Nubian Nut&quot;, &quot;Last Dance&quot;, and &quot;Do Fries Go with That Shake?&quot;

He is also a notable music producer who works on almost all the albums he performs on, and has produced albums for Bootsy Collins and Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others. In 1985, he was recruited by the Chili Peppers to produce their album &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, because the band members were huge fans of his and of funk in general. Clinton wrote the vocals and lyrics to the title track, which was originally intended by the band to be left as an instrumental piece. The album was not a commercial success at the time. In 1987, Clinton was recruited to write the theme song for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Thinking Right&quot;.

During the mid to late 1980s, many hip-hop and rap artists cited Clinton&#x27;s earlier music as an influence. Along with James Brown, Clinton&#x27;s songs with Parliament-Funkadelic were often sampled by rap producers. &quot;Sure, sample my stuff…&quot; he remarked in 1996; &quot;Ain&#x27;t a better time to get paid than when you&#x27;re my age. You know what to do with money. You don&#x27;t buy as much pussy or drugs with it – you just buy &quot;some&quot;.&quot;

In 1989, Clinton released &quot;The Cinderella Theory&quot; on Paisley Park, Prince&#x27;s record label.

=== 1990s to 2000s ===
Clinton continued his work with Paisley Park with &quot;Hey, Man, Smell My Finger&quot; in 1993. The year 1994 saw Clinton contribute to several tracks on Primal Scream&#x27;s studio album &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. In 1995, Clinton sang &quot;Mind Games&quot; on the John Lennon tribute &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;. Clinton then signed with Sony 550 and released &quot;T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.&quot; &quot;(The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership)&quot; in 1996.

Clinton appeared in films such as &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; (1990), &quot;House Party&quot; (1990), &quot;PCU&quot; (1994), &quot;Good Burger&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Breaks&quot; (1999). In 1994, he appeared as the host of the anthology television film &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot;. In 1997, he appeared as himself in the Cartoon Network show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. Clinton also appeared as the voice of the Funktipus, the DJ of the funk radio station Bounce FM in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, in which his song &quot;Loopzilla&quot; also appeared.

Rapper Dr. Dre often sampled Clinton&#x27;s music, helping to bring about the G-funk era. In 1999, Clinton collaborated with Lil&#x27; Kim and Fred Durst for rap metal group Methods of Mayhem&#x27;s single &quot;Get Naked&quot;.

Displaying his influence on rap and hip hop, Clinton also worked with Tupac Shakur on the song &quot;Can&#x27;t C Me&quot; from the album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;; Ice Cube on the song and video for &quot;Bop Gun (One Nation)&quot; on the &quot;Lethal Injection&quot; album (which sampled Funkadelic&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot;); Outkast on the song &quot;Synthesizer&quot; from the album &quot;Aquemini&quot;; Redman on the song &quot;J.U.M.P.&quot; from the album &quot;Malpractice&quot;; Souls of Mischief on &quot;Mama Knows Best&quot; from the album &quot;&quot;; Killah Priest on &quot;Come With me&quot; from the album &quot;Priesthood&quot;; the Wu-Tang Clan on &quot;Wolves&quot; from the album &quot;8 Diagrams&quot;.

Clinton founded a record label called The C Kunspyruhzy in 2003. He had a cameo appearance in &quot;Where Were We?&quot;, the season two premiere of the CBS television sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, on September 18, 2006.

He appeared on the intro to Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; album, released in 2007. Clinton was also a judge for the 5th annual Independent Music Awards.

On September 16, 2008, Clinton released a solo album, &quot;George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love&quot;, on Shanachie Records. Largely a covers album, &quot;Gangsters&quot; features guest appearances from Sly Stone, El DeBarge, Red Hot Chili Peppers, RZA, Carlos Santana, gospel singer Kim Burrell and more.

On September 10, 2009, Clinton was awarded the Urban Icon Award from Broadcast Music Incorporated. The ceremony featured P-Funk associate Bootsy Collins, as well contemporary performers such as Big Boi from Outkast and Cee-Lo Green from Goodie Mob.

Also in 2009, Clinton was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.

In May 2012, Clinton was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. During the commencement concert, Clinton joined the college&#x27;s P-Funk Ensemble to perform hits like &quot;Testify,&quot; &quot;Give Up the Funk,&quot; and &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot;. He was accompanied by longtime horn players Bennie Cowan and Greg Thomas.

Clinton also appears with Kendrick Lamar on the song &quot;Wesley&#x27;s Theory&quot; from the album &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly.&quot;

In March 2017, Clinton appeared on the Adult Swim television series &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;. &quot;The Outline&quot;″s Samuel Argyle described it as &quot;[t]he episode that makes the most cohesive narrative sense.&quot;

Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic were slated to headline the seventh annual Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho in 2018. The release of a new Parliament album, &quot;Medicaid Fraud Dogg&quot;, was announced in March 2018. It was released May 22, 2018.

In April 2018, Clinton announced that he would retire from touring in May 2019. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Clinton had recently undergone pacemaker surgery, but he said that was not a factor in his decision. He indicated that he expected Parliament-Funkadelic would continue to tour without him, saying &quot;Truth be told, it&#x27;s never really been about me. It&#x27;s always been about the music and the band. That&#x27;s the real P-Funk legacy. They&#x27;ll still be funkin&#x27; long after I stop.&quot; Earlier in 2018, he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he had made a hologram, suggesting that the band could &quot;have it start performing in Vegas&quot;.

In December 2018, the Recording Academy announced that Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic would be given Lifetime Achievement Awards. The awards were presented on May 11, 2019.

<doc id="106104" wikidata="Q218436" url="?curid=106104" title="Population of Canada by province and territory">
<text>Canada is divided into 10 provinces and three territories. The majority of Canada&#x27;s population is concentrated in the areas close to the Canada–US border. Its four largest provinces by area (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta) are also its most populous; together they account for 86.5 percent of the country&#x27;s population. The territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) account for over a third of Canada&#x27;s area but are home to only 0.32 percent of its population, which skews the national population density value.

Canada&#x27;s population grew by 5.24 percent between the 2016 and 2021 censuses. With the exceptions of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Northwest Territories, all territories and provinces increased in population from 2016 to 2021. In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was Yukon with an increase of 12.1 percent between 2016 and 2021, followed by Prince Edward Island with 7.99 percent growth.

Generally, provinces steadily grew in population along with Canada. However, some provinces such as Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. Ontario and Quebec were always the two most populous provinces in Canada, with over 60 percent of the population at any given time. The demographic importance of the West steadily grew over time, while the importance of Atlantic Canada steadily slipped. Canada&#x27;s population has increased every year since Confederation in 1867: see List of population of Canada by year.

Current provinces and territories population growth rate are based on the Statistics Canada 2021 Census of Population.

==Demographic evolution==

===Historical population===

The population of Canada increased every year since Confederation in 1867. The first national census of the country was taken in 1871, and it covered the four provinces which were part of Canada at the time. It recorded a population of 1,620,851 in Ontario, 1,191,516 in Quebec, 387,800 in Nova Scotia and 285,594 in New Brunswick The population of each of these provinces continued to grow every year uninterrupted. However, their growth was slow in the late 19th century because there were few economic opportunities. As a result, many Canadians opted to emigrate in the United States for work. 

This phenomenon hit Quebec especially hard. Approximately 900,000 Quebec residents (French Canadian for the great majority) left for the United States between 1840 and 1930. However, Quebec&#x27;s population losses to emigration during this period were largely offset by its natural population growth. Indeed, until the middle of the 20th century, Quebec had a birth rate considerably higher than most of its contemporary industrialized societies. This period of high French-Canadian population growth is nicknamed (lit: &#x27;the revenge of the cradle&#x27;).

Population growth in the Northwest Territories, and then the Western provinces, picked up when the Canadian government passed the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; in 1872 to encourage the settlement of the Canadian Prairies, and to help prevent the area from being claimed by the United States. The act gave a claimant for free, the only cost to the farmer being a $10 administration fee. Any male farmer who was at least 21 years of age and agreed to cultivate at least of the land and build a permanent dwelling on it (within three years) qualified. The population of the Canadian prairies grew rapidly in the last decade of the 19th century, and the population of Saskatchewan more than quintupled from 91,000 in 1901 to 492,000 in 1911. The vast majority of these people were immigrants from Europe.

Early counts of Northwest Territories&#x27; population tend to exclude the Indigenous citizens of the nations whose countries comprised the territory, such as the Dene of Denendeh or Inuit of Inuit Nunangat. The territory&#x27;s population drops at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries are due to its reduction in size, as Yukon, then Saskatchewan and Alberta were carved out of its territory, and the same with Nunavut a century later. Yukon&#x27;s population spike at the turn of the 20th century is due to the Klondike Gold Rush, when an estimated 100,000 people tried to reach the Klondike goldfields between 1896 and 1899, of whom only around 30,000 to 40,000 eventually did.

Generally, provinces steadily grew in population along with Canada. However, some provinces experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. After peaking in 1891, Prince Edward Island&#x27;s population started to decline every year until 1941, after which the province started growing again. In Saskatchewan, after a rapid population explosion at the beginning of the century that propelled the province to being the 3rd largest in the country, its population declined during the Great Depression, and its growth had been slow ever since. From 1931 to 2016, Saskatchewan&#x27;s population increased by only 19.2 percent, well below the national average. Newfoundland and Labrador, on the other hand, experienced slow but continuous growth until the 1990s, when the cod fisheries collapsed, and their population started to fall.

After the collapse of the Canadian birth rate, most provinces now sustain their population with immigration from the developing world. The number of new immigrants increases every year.
===Demographic weight of provinces and territories===
The demographic weight of each province in Canada has always constituted a sensitive issue. In 1840, the Durham Report recommended that Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec) be united into one province. The newly created Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada was required to have equal representation from Canada East (now Quebec) and Canada West (now Ontario), even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000. Lord Durham had not recommended this approach and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions. The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented sectional equality, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government.

However, the 1851 census revealed that Canada West&#x27;s population had surpassed Canada East&#x27;s. This fact fuelled demands in Canada West for the end of sectional equality and the move toward allocating seats in the legislation on the basis of population, nicknamed &quot;rep by pop&quot;. This was a hotly contested issue at the constitutional conferences leading up to confederation, and the colonies reached a comprise in which the seats in the federal lower house (House of Commons) would be allocated by population, and the seats in the federal upper house (Senate) would be allocated on the basis of three defined regionsOntario, Quebec and the Maritimesthat would each have 24 seats.

Since Confederation, Ontario and Quebec have always been Canada&#x27;s two most populous provinces. However, their combined demographic weight decreased from over 80 percent at Confederation to just over 60 percent in 2016. The Atlantic provinces also lost importance within Canada, from around 20 percent at Confederation to under 7 percent today. The West&#x27;s importance, however, has only increased, from insignificant levels in 1871 to over 30 percent of the country in 2016. In the first half of the 20th century, the most populous western province was Saskatchewan, but its population was later eclipsed by British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba.

The issue of the demographic weight of each province came up during the negotiations for the patriation of the Canadian Constitution, and especially discussions around the amending formula of the constitution. The final formula stipulates that minor changes to the constitution had to be approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of 6 provinces representing at least 50 percent of the Canadian population. This essentially meant that either Ontario or Quebec had to agree to any constitutional amendments that affect all provinces.

Quebec had managed to maintain a stable demographic weight within Canada during the first half of the 20th century due to its high birth rate. However, their importance began to slip as their birth rate started to fall in the 1960s. Quebec wanted to make it up through immigration, and for this purpose created its Ministry of Immigration in 1968, and negotiated for increased powers in this field with the federal government. However, new immigrants to Canada disproportionally go the Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta, fuelling their rise in demographic weight. In response, a Canada–Québec Accord was concluded in 1991 which, among other things, guaranteed Quebec an immigration rate proportional to its demographic weight in Canada. This provision was not fulfilled, as in 2005, immigration to Quebec represented only 16.5 percent of all immigration to Canada. 

Quebec also attempted to maintain its weight within the Canadian House of Commons during the constitutional negotiations of the early 1990s. Under the Charlottetown Accord, in exchange for Quebec losing Senate seats under a Triple-E Senate (dropping from 24 to 6), Quebec was guaranteed never to be allotted less than 25 percent of the seats in the House of Commons. The accord was ultimately defeated in a public referendum.

<text>Wayne Kirkpatrick (born c. 1961) is an American songwriter and musician born in Greenville, MS, who now lives in Nashville, Tennessee. He graduated from Baton Rouge Magnet High School in 1979. His younger brother is American screenwriter and director Karey Kirkpatrick.

Kirkpatrick is known for providing background vocals, playing guitar, playing keyboards or writing songs for other artists. Writing in Contemporary Christian, Country, and Pop styles, his songs have been recorded by Little Big Town, Faith Hill, Garth Brooks, Babyface, Amy Grant, Rich Mullins, Joe Cocker, Kathy Mattea, Martina McBride, Wynonna Judd, Trisha Yearwood, Bonnie Raitt, Susan Ashton, Michael W. Smith, Jill Phillips, Michael Crawford, Peter Frampton, Casting Crowns and Eric Clapton, whose version of Kirkpatrick&#x27;s &quot;Change the World&quot; won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

At the 24th GMA Dove Awards, Kirkpatrick received the award for Producer of the Year.

In 2005, Kirkpatrick started to produce Little Big Town alongside the group starting with their second album &quot;The Road to Here&quot; and also the next two &quot;A Place to Land&quot; and &quot;The Reason Why&quot;. He also co-wrote most of the songs on all three albums with the group.

Also in 2005, &quot;The Road to Here&quot; came out for Little Big Town. Kirkpatrick has writing credit on 12 of the 13 songs. He has solo writing credits on one song, &quot;Looking for the Reason&quot;, with the rest written with him and part/all of the group or with other songwriters. He co-wrote with group members on their highest-charting song &quot;Bring It On Home&quot;, which made it to No. 4 on Hot Country 100 songs chart. Kirkpatrick also wrote Little Big Town&#x27;s &#x27;signature&#x27; song, &quot;Boondocks&quot;, which they use as the closing song at every show.

In 2007, Little Big Town and Kirkpatrick went back into the studio to make a new record, &quot;A Place to Land&quot;. He co-wrote 12 of the 16 tracks on the Deluxe Edition, including the first song that Little Big Town sang together called &quot;Love Profound&quot;.

In 2010, the newest record from Little Big Town, &quot;The Reason Why&quot;, was released which Kirkpatrick co-produced. The record debuted at No. 1, a first for Little Big Town. He co-wrote 7 of the 12 songs with the group, including the hit &quot;Little White Church&quot;.

Kirkpatrick has said that Karen Fairchild, Jimi Westbrook, Kimberly Schlapman and Philip Sweet have made him feel like the fifth member of the band.

In 2000, Kirkpatrick released a solo project entitled &quot;The Maple Room&quot; that included &quot;Wrapped Up in You&quot;, a song that would later become a hit for Garth Brooks, and &quot;My Armageddon&quot;, which was originally slated for Brooks&#x27; &quot;Garth Brooks in ... The Life of Chris Gaines&quot; project. Kirkpatrick served as a primary songwriter on that album, along with Gordon Kennedy and Tommy Sims.

Later in 2000, he teamed up with Kennedy and several other songwriters (Phil Madeira and Billy Sprague) to record &quot;Coming From Somewhere Else&quot;, which was a CD of their own music that had previously been recorded by other artists, including &quot;Change the World&quot;.

Around 2010, Wayne and his brother Karey began working on the musical &quot;Something Rotten!&quot;. In 2015, they were nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score (Music and/or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre (along with many other awards), while Karey was also nominated for a Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical with British author John O&#x27;Farrell.

In 2018, it was announced that Wayne and his brother Karey were working together on the score for the musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire, based on the film of the same name. The show previewed on Broadway in 2020 and closed in 2022.

In September 2023, Kirkpatrick and songwriter and musician Don Chaffer were announced to be working on a musical based on the Bluebird Café in Nashville.

<text>Thelma &amp; Louise is a 1991 American crime drama film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Callie Khouri. The film stars Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis as Louise and Thelma, two friends who embark on a road trip that ends up in unforeseen circumstances. The supporting cast includes Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Christopher McDonald, and Brad Pitt. Filming took place in California and Utah from June to August 1990.
Following its premiere at the 44th Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 1991, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on May 24. It became a critical and commercial success, receiving six nominations at the 64th Academy Awards, with Khouri winning Best Original Screenplay. Scott was nominated for Best Director, and both Sarandon and Davis were nominated for Best Actress.

&quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; has influenced other artistic works, and became a landmark of feminist film. In 2006, the American Film Institute ranked it 78th on its list of most inspiring films. In 2016, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
Two friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer, set out for a weekend vacation at a fishing cabin in the mountains to take a break from their dreary lives in Arkansas. Thelma, a housewife, is married to disrespectful and controlling carpet salesman Darryl, while sharp-tongued Louise works as a waitress in a diner and is dating easygoing musician Jimmy, who is on the road most of the time.

On the way, they stop at a roadhouse bar, where Thelma dances with a flirtatious stranger, Harlan Puckett. He takes her to the parking lot and tries to rape her until Louise intervenes and threatens to shoot him. As the women walk away, Harlan yells he should have continued the rape, causing Louise to fatally shoot him in a fit of rage. The two women immediately drive off.

At a motel, they discuss how to handle the situation. Thelma wants to go to the police, but Louise fears that no one will believe a claim of attempted rape as Thelma was drinking and dancing with Harlan, in addition to having no evidence of the rape; they would be facing a murder charge. They decide to flee to Mexico, but Louise demands they travel there without going through Texas, as something happened to her there several years earlier which she refuses to reveal.

Heading west, they come across an attractive young drifter, J.D., to whom Thelma takes a liking. Louise contacts Jimmy, asking him to wire her life savings to her. He surprises her by delivering the money in person, and they spend the night together. Jimmy proposes to Louise, but she refuses. Meanwhile, J.D. talks his way into Thelma&#x27;s room and they sleep together. She learns he is a convicted armed robber who has violated the terms of his parole. The following morning, the women discover J.D. has stolen Louise&#x27;s savings and fled. Louise is distraught, so a guilt-ridden Thelma takes charge and later robs a nearby convenience store using tactics she learned from J.D.

Meanwhile, the FBI closes in on the duo after witnesses at the bar identify Louise&#x27;s 1966 Ford Thunderbird convertible. Their whereabouts are also questioned by the owner of the fishing cabin after they failed to arrive. Led by Arkansas State Police Investigator Hal Slocumb, the police question J.D. (who was caught) and tap into the phone line at Darryl&#x27;s house. He sympathizes with the pair&#x27;s situation, and understands why they did not report Harlan&#x27;s killing. During a few brief phone conversations with Louise, Hal expresses his concerns and tells her he knows what happened to her in Texas, but is unsuccessful in persuading her to surrender.

Thelma tells Louise she will not go back to Darryl and asks her friend if she intends to cut a deal with the police so she can return to Jimmy. Louise rejects the notion of betraying her friend and promises Thelma they will keep going together. While back on the road, Thelma recalls the incident with Harlan and tries to ask Louise if something similar happened to her in Texas. Louise responds angrily and tells Thelma to never bring it up again.

Later, they are pulled over by a New Mexico state trooper for speeding. Knowing he will soon discover they are wanted for murder and armed robbery, Thelma holds him at gunpoint and locks him in the trunk of his police car while Louise takes his gun and ammunition. Driving further west, they encounter a foul-mouthed truck driver who repeatedly makes obscene gestures at them. They pull over and demand an apology from him; when he refuses, they fire at his fuel tanker, causing it to explode. The women leave him stranded in the desert with the wreckage.

Thelma and Louise are finally cornered by the authorities only a hundred yards from the edge of the Grand Canyon. Hal arrives on the scene, but the women refuse his last attempt to talk them into surrendering. Rather than be captured, Thelma proposes that they &quot;keep going&quot;. Both kiss and hold hands as Louise steps on the gas and, as Hal desperately pursues them on foot, they accelerate over the cliff to their certain deaths.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The idea for &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; originated in the spring of 1988 when Callie Khouri, then a music video producer, was driving home from work to her apartment in Santa Monica. She spent the following six months working on her first screenplay, which was noted to have drawn inspiration from her own experience as well as her friendship with country music singer Pam Tillis. She had intended it to be a low-budget independent film, directed by herself and produced by fellow music video producer Amanda Temple (wife of British filmmaker Julien Temple).

After shopping the project around and finding no takers, Temple showed the script to her friend Mimi Polk Gitlin, who ran Ridley Scott&#x27;s Percy Main Productions (later Scott Free Productions). Gitlin in turn showed the script to Scott, who expressed great enthusiasm for the project. He agreed to produce the film and bought the film rights for $500,000. Pathé Entertainment, then led by Scott&#x27;s friend and collaborator Alan Ladd Jr., came on board as a co-producer and financier.

Scott considered four people for the role of director, all of whom turned down the opportunity. Per Gitlin&#x27;s recollection, three of the candidates were Bob Rafelson, Kevin Reynolds and Richard Donner. Scott was reluctant to direct the film himself but eventually took on the role, having been persuaded by Michelle Pfeiffer.

=== Casting ===
Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster were originally chosen for the leads; both accepted their roles with enthusiasm. As pre-production of the film dragged on, the two eventually dropped out, with Pfeiffer going on to star in &quot;Love Field&quot; and Foster in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Pfeiffer would later admit that passing on the film still kills her. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn then offered to play the leads, but Streep later dropped out due to scheduling conflicts while Hawn was not considered right for the part (Hawn and Streep portrayed the lead duo a year later in &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;). Geena Davis (who had been vigorously pursuing the lead role for nearly a year) and Susan Sarandon were ultimately chosen. The two took extensive driving and shooting lessons in preparation for their roles.

Scott personally convinced Harvey Keitel to take on the role of Hal, the sympathetic Arkansas detective. The two had previously collaborated in Scott&#x27;s feature directorial debut, the 1977 film &quot;The Duellists&quot;. Davis recommended her ex-boyfriend Christopher McDonald for the role of Darryl, Thelma&#x27;s controlling husband. Scott wanted Michael Madsen for Harlan, Thelma&#x27;s would-be rapist, but Madsen was unwilling; he eventually won the role of Jimmy, Louise&#x27;s boyfriend. Brad Pitt auditioned for the hustler J.D.; however Scott thought he was &quot;too young&quot; for the role so they moved on, the part went to Billy Baldwin. Pitt eventually secured the role after both Baldwin and his replacement dropped out. George Clooney, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Grant Show, John Mellencamp, Dylan McDermott, James LeGros, and Dermot Mulroney were also considered for the role of J.D. Davis did test scenes with Clooney, Show, Ruffalo and Pitt; her advice to the directors was to choose Pitt.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; began on June 11, 1990, and concluded on August 31, 1990. Although the setting for the film is a fictional route between Arkansas and the Grand Canyon, it was filmed almost entirely in the states of California and Utah. The primary filming locations were rural areas around Bakersfield, California and Moab, Utah. The Grand Canyon scenes were filmed just south of Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah. Parts of the film were also shot at Shafer Overlook, Monument Valley, La Sal Mountains, La Sal Junction, Cisco, Old Valley City Reservoir, Thompson Springs, Arches National Park, and Crescent Junction in Utah. Of filming his love scenes with Davis, Pitt said that it was awkward being nearly naked with everybody standing.

=== Soundtrack ===
Pete Haycock on slide guitar contributed to &quot;Thunderbird&quot;, the theme music for the film. In addition to Glenn Frey&#x27;s &quot;Part of Me, Part of You&quot;, which became the film&#x27;s primary theme song, the soundtrack included songs performed by Chris Whitley (&quot;Kick The Stones&quot;), Martha Reeves (&quot;Wild Night&quot; written by Van Morrison), Toni Childs (&quot;House Of Hope&quot;), Marianne Faithfull (&quot;Ballad of Lucy Jordan&quot; written by Shel Silverstein), Charlie Sexton (&quot;Badlands&quot;), Grayson Hugh (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Untie You From Me&quot;), B.B. King (&quot;Better Not Look Down&quot; written by Joe Sample &amp; Will Jennings), Michael McDonald (&quot;No Lookin&#x27; Back&quot;), The Temptations (&quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; written by Smokey Robinson &amp; Bobby Rogers), and Johnny Nash (&quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;).

== Release ==
&quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; was screened out of competition as the closing film at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Theatrical release was delayed due to financial turmoil at MGM-Pathé. The film eventually opened in American theaters on May 24, 1991 and was a box office success, grossing $45 million within the country.

===Home media===

The film was released on VHS on January 8, 1992 by MGM/UA Home Video. It proved especially successful in the home video market; with 380 000 copies being shipped throughout the United States, it became the most rented movie of 1992.

In February 2023, The Criterion Collection announced the film would be joining the collection in May that year.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
Upon release, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; received largely positive reviews, which several publications described as &quot;rave&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had only praise for the film in her review:

Roger Ebert also praised the film, writing, &quot;What sets &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; aside from the great central tradition of the road picture -- a tradition roomy enough to accommodate &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;Midnight Run&quot; and &quot;Rain Man&quot; -- is that the heroes are women this time: Working-class girlfriends from a small Arkansas town, one a waitress, the other a housewife, both probably ready to describe themselves as utterly ordinary, both containing unexpected resources.&quot; He added, &quot;This film shows a great sympathy for human comedy&quot;, and &quot;Sarandon and Davis find in Callie Khouri&#x27;s script the materials for two plausible, convincing, lovable characters. And as actors they work together like a high-wire team, walking across even the most hazardous scenes without putting a foot wrong.&quot; However, Ebert deducted half a star from his four-star review on the basis of &quot;the last shot before the titles begin. It&#x27;s a freeze frame that fades to white, which is fine, except it does so with unseemly haste ... It&#x27;s unsettling to get involved in a movie that takes 128 minutes to bring you to a payoff that the filmmakers seem to fear.&quot;

The film also received harsh criticism from those who thought it was biased against men and that its depictions of men were unfairly negative. In response to these criticisms, Maslin and Khouri claimed that &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; was being subjected to a double standard, as unethical behavior in male-driven road movies had not provoked a similar level of backlash. Maslin argued that viewers were simply offended at how &quot;men in this story don&#x27;t really matter... They are treated as figures in the landscape through which these characters pass, and as such they are essentially powerless. For male characters, perhaps, this is a novelty, but women in road movies have always been treated in precisely the same way.&quot; In response to claims that the film had no sympathetic male characters, Khouri pointed to the character of Hal Slocumb, the Arkansas detective who shows empathy for Thelma and Louise’s situation. Khouri said that Hal represents &quot;the moral sense of the audience&quot;. She also said she wrote the script in &quot;a conscious effort to counter&quot; Hollywood&#x27;s tendency to portray women as &quot;bimbos, whores and nagging wives.&quot; Khouri added, &quot;If [critics are] feeling threatened, [they&#x27;re] identifying with the wrong character.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Simultaneously funny, heartbreaking, and peppered with action, Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; is a potent, well-acted road movie that transcends the feminist message at its core.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 88 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film placed second to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; as the best film of 1991 in a poll of 81 critics.

===Accolades===
American Film Institute
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers - #78
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Heroes and Villains - #24
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Thrills - #76

The British Film Institute published a book about the film in 2000 as part of a Modern Classics series. On the Writers Guild of America Award&#x27;s list of 101 best screenplays, it made No.72.

== Legacy ==
The final scene, where the title characters embrace before committing suicide by driving off a cliff, has become iconic. Numerous homages and parodies of the scene have appeared, including alternate film endings, cartoon parodies, video game &quot;Easter eggs&quot;, and as a tragic ending to television series, music videos, and commercials. After the film&#x27;s release, there were reports of a few incidents where people appeared to copycat Thelma and Louise&#x27;s suicides by driving off the edge of the Grand Canyon.

After watching the film, singer-songwriter Tori Amos wrote &quot;Me and a Gun&quot;, the story of her rape several years earlier.

=== Feminism ===
Many critics and writers have remarked on the strong feminist overtones of &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. Film critic B. Ruby Rich praises the film as an uncompromising validation of women&#x27;s experiences, while Kenneth Turan calls it a &quot;neo-feminist road movie&quot;. Jessica Enevold argues that the film constitutes &quot;an attack on conventional patterns of chauvinist male behavior toward females&quot;. In addition, it &quot;exposes the traditional stereotyping of male–female relationships&quot; while rescripting the typical gender roles of the road movie genre.

In her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, film critic Sheila Benson objected to the characterization of the film as feminist, arguing that it is more preoccupied with revenge and violence than feminist values.

In an article commemorating the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2011, Raina Lipsitz of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; called it &quot;the last great film about women&quot; and said that it heralded the achievements of women that caused 1992 to become &quot;the year of the woman&quot;. However, she also said that women-themed films have since been losing ground.

== Stage adaptation ==
In early 2021, it was announced that Khouri was adapting the film as a stage musical alongside Halley Feiffer, with original songs by Neko Case, and Trip Cullman attached to direct. In January 2023, a workshop reading was held starring Amanda Seyfried and Evan Rachel Wood.

<doc id="106121" wikidata="Q11199149" url="?curid=106121" title="Modesty">
<text>Modesty, sometimes known as demureness, is a mode of dress and deportment which intends to avoid the encouraging of sexual attraction in others. The word &quot;modesty&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot; which means &#x27;keeping within measure&#x27;.

In this use, revealing certain body parts is considered inappropriate, thus immodest. In conservative Middle Eastern societies, modesty may involve women completely covering their bodies with a burqa and not talking to men who are not immediate family members. In Christian Anabaptist and similar sects, it may involve women wearing only ankle-length skirts, blouses up to the collar, and often a small head covering or shawl. Among both and others, a one-piece swimsuit may be considered modest while wearing a bikini is not. In most countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty, as well as public nudity, is considered indecent exposure and is usually punished by law.

Nudity may be acceptable in public single-sex changing rooms at swimming baths, for example, or for mass medical examinations of military personnel. A person who would never disrobe in the presence of the opposite sex in a social context might unquestioningly do so for a medical examination, while others might allow such examination but only by a person of the same sex.

Overall, standards of modesty vary widely around the world because of sociocultural and contextual differences and particular situations.

==Body==
Standards of modesty discourage or forbid exposure of parts of the body, varying between societies, which may include areas of skin, the hair, undergarments, and intimate parts. The standards may also require obscuring the shape of the body or parts of it by wearing non-form-fitting clothing. There are also customs regarding the changing of clothes (such as on a beach with no enclosed facilities), and the closing or locking of the door when changing or taking a shower.

Standards of modesty vary by culture or generation and vary depending on who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the context, and other variables. The categories of persons who could see another&#x27;s body could include:

* a spouse or romantic partner of some sort,
* a friend or family member of the same sex,
* strangers of the same sex.

The context would include matters such as whether it is in one&#x27;s own home, at another family member&#x27;s home, at a friend&#x27;s home, at a semi-public place, at a beach, swimming pool (including whether such venues are considered clothes-optional), changing rooms or other public places. For instance, wearing a bathing suit at the beach would not be considered immodest, while it likely would be in a street or an office. The context may change during specific events or rituals such as Mardi Gras in New Orleans or during neopagan Skyclad work.

Excessive modesty is called prudishness. As a medical condition, it is also called gymnophobia. Excessive &quot;immodesty&quot; is called exhibitionism.

==In medical settings==
At times of public or private emergency, expectations of modest dress may be suspended if necessary. This may apply to decontamination after a chemical or biological attack, where removal of contaminated clothing is important, or escaping from a night-time fire without time to dress. For example, during suspected anthrax attacks in 1998 and 2001 in the United States, groups of people had to strip to their underwear in tents set up in parking lots and other public places for hosing down by fire departments. On the other hand, even in an emergency situation, some people are unable to abandon their need to hide their bodies, even at the risk of their life.

==In dress==

Most discussion of modesty involves clothing. The criteria for acceptable modesty and decency have relaxed continuously in much of the world since the nineteenth century, with shorter, form-fitting, and more revealing clothing and swimsuits, more for women than men. Most people wear clothes that they consider not to be unacceptably immodest for their religion, culture, generation, occasion, and the people present. Some wear clothes which they consider immodest, due to exhibitionism, the desire to create an erotic impact, or for publicity.

===Generally accepted Western norms===
Appropriate modesty depends on context and place. For example, in single-sex public changing rooms, nudity is often acceptable.

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose cleavage depends on social, cultural and regional context. Women&#x27;s swimsuits and bikinis commonly may reveal the tops and sides of the breasts, or they may be topless as is common on the beaches of the French Riviera. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be considered inappropriate in settings such as workplaces, churches and schools. Showing the nipples or areolae is almost always considered toplessness or partial nudity. However, in 2014 newly elected Pope Francis drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry.

In private homes, the standards of modesty apply selectively. For instance, nudity among close family members in the home can take place, especially in the bedroom and bathroom, and wearing of only undergarments in the home is common.

In many cultures it is not acceptable to bare the buttocks in public; deliberately doing so is sometimes intended as an insult. In public, Western standards of decency expect people to cover their genitalia, and women to cover their breasts.

Since the 1980s it has become more common for young women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, &quot;short shorts&quot;, backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.

In the United States in the early twenty-first century, public breastfeeding has become increasingly acceptable, sometimes protected by law. President Barack Obama&#x27;s health care bill from 2010 provides additional support to nursing mothers, requiring employers to provide a private and shielded space for employees to use in order to nurse.

===Gender differences===

Men and women are subject to different standards of modesty in dress. While both men and women, in Western culture, are generally expected to keep their genitals covered at all times, women are also expected to keep their breasts covered. Some body parts are normally more covered by men than women—e.g., the midriff and the upper part of the back.

In 1992 New York State&#x27;s highest court accepted Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution arguments and struck down the provision in New York&#x27;s &quot;Exposure of the Person&quot; statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.

==Religious traditions==

Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people&#x27;s sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed moral codes covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics, etc. Besides other aspects of sexuality, these moral codes seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people&#x27;s behaviour and practices which could arouse such interest, or which overstate a person&#x27;s sexuality. These religious codes have always had a strong influence on people&#x27;s attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behaviour, speech, etc.

===Buddhism===
Modesty (appicchatà or hiri) is the quality of being unpretentious about one&#x27;s virtues or achievements. Genuinely modest people are able to see themselves as they really are and rejoice in their good qualities without becoming vain or self-promoting, and acknowledge their faults without shame or self-loathing. 
Modesty in dress is important in Buddhism. The Sekhiya rules of Buddhist Monastic code, for example, provide guidelines on proper clothing as well as recommended ways of dressing for monks.

The &#x27;robes hitched up&#x27; phrase above refers to lifting one&#x27;s 1 or 2 piece cloth robe, thereby exposing either side or both sides of one&#x27;s body to other human beings in an inhabited area. Such exhibitionism is not recommended to monks. Beyond monks, the Buddhist belief is that modesty has a purifying quality for everyone.

===Christianity===


There are verses in the Christian Bible that discuss the issue of modesty. Before the fall of man, &quot;Nakedness was &#x27;very good&#x27; from the beginning, but its innocence was corrupted by the fall&quot;, a concept taught in and . , and discuss that after the fall of man, &quot;publicly exposed nakedness is a symbol of the shame of sin.&quot; In , Adam and Eve tried to cover their nakedness, though their attempt was inadequate for God and so God properly clothed humans in . and explicate that God instructed humans to cover their torso and thighs. instructs Christians to dress in &quot;modest apparel&quot; rather than to adorn themselves; in the same vein, Saint Peter wrote to Christians that &quot;Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes, but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God&quot; ().

Historically, female communicants of traditional Christian denominations (including Anglican, Baptist, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, Oriental Orthodox, Reformed, and Roman Catholic) wore a headcovering while praying at home and worshipping in the church, or all the time as with Anabaptists such as the Mennonites and the Bruderhof, in keeping with their interpretation of , which has been practiced since the time of the early Church. Apostolic Tradition commands: &quot;let all the women have their heads covered with an opaque cloth, not with a veil of thin linen, for this is not a true covering.&quot; John Chrysostom (407) delineated Saint Paul&#x27;s teaching on the wearing of headcoverings by Christian women, continually: 

These ancient Christian practices regarding modesty continue to be normative among Christians in regions such as in Eastern Europe and in South Asia, though they have waned in the Western world starting in the 1960s. Many Trinitarian Christians consider modesty extremely important, though considerable differences of opinion exist about its requirements and purposes. The early Church stressed the importance of modesty in the practice of Christianity, with early Church Father Clement of Alexandria teaching:

The early Christian manual Paedagogus (198 AD) teaches that clothing worn by faithful Christians should extend beyond the knees and warns against the wearing of expensive clothing, in addition to forbidding the excesses of jewelry:

Early ecclesiastical writer Tertullian echoed the same teachings regarding modesty in his &quot;On the Apparel of Women&quot;, also including a prohibition on Christian men and women dyeing their hair. Rather than to ostentatiously display the hair, Tertullian said that Christian women are to wear a headcovering in public. He taught that Christians should be able to be easily distinguished from non-Christians by their wearing of modest clothing.

====Anabaptists====

Many Christians belonging to the Conservative Anabaptist and Old Order Anabaptist traditions (including the Amish, Conservative Mennonites, Old Order Mennonites, Hutterites, Apostolic Christians, Charity Christians, Bruderhof, River Brethren and Schwarzenau Brethren) have plain dress prescriptions designed to achieve modesty and create a sense of church identity, as Petrovich writes: &quot;Their dress standard is not only intended to specify a pattern which all members agree to be a modest covering for the human form but must also correspond to their vision of Jesus as meek and humble, dressed as a simple peasant from a common village. Since an established dress standard promotes uniformity, it also provides a sense of shared purpose.&quot; These requirements are either written in denominational or congregational statements or are understood and reinforced through informal pressure and ministerial reminders.

Requirements vary across churches and denominations; however, all conservative Anabaptist women wear Christian headcoverings and a skirt or dress, and all men wear long trousers. From there, considerable variation exists in men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s styles. Anabaptist adherents read a church group&#x27;s relative strictness, distance from popular culture, and even religious ideas by their appearance and the speed of dress changes. Accordingly, the extent to which popular fashion elements show up in an Anabaptist person&#x27;s dress often depends on the social distance of that church from popular culture. For example, women&#x27;s headcoverings have numerous subtle design elements that distinguish church association, age, and attitude toward modest dress. Women in more fashion-conscious groups, especially among some Conservative Mennonites as well as young adults among some Old Order Amish, may wear a lacy doily that fits a stylized appearance, whereas groups and individuals holding to a distinctive form of modesty wear a fixed-style kapp with a back part that covers the hair bun and is pleated to a front part that vertically encircles the head.

Churches vary in how much members may experiment with modesty and fashion in dress. Some groups, for example, may be less inclined to censure tight dresses so long as the church&#x27;s distinctive style is maintained or to censure popular swimwear worn while swimming in groups or in public; others carefully observe and embrace their church&#x27;s pattern for modest, distinct dress on all non-private occasions.

====Catholicism====

Saint Thomas Aquinas defined modesty as &quot;humility, studiousness, temperance in outward movements and in apparel.&quot;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church points out that &quot;Modesty is decency. It inspires one&#x27;s choice of clothing&quot; (CCC, 2522).&quot;

The wearing of a veil (headcovering) for women while praying at home and while worshipping at Mass has been practiced by Christian women since the time of the early Church. The wearing of headcoverings during the celebration of the liturgy was mandated as a universal rule for the Latin Church by the Code of Canon Law of 1917, abrogated by the Code of Canon Law of 1983.

The standards issued by Pope Pius XI declared that &quot;women who wear immodest dress shall be denied Holy Communion, and shall not be admitted as a godmother at Baptism or as a sponsor at Confirmation&quot;. They further stated &quot;Nuns, in accordance with the Letter of 23 August 1928, of the Sacred Congregation of Religious, shall not admit to their colleges, schools, oratories, or amusement centers, nor allow to remain there any girls who do not observe Christian modesty in dress; and in the education of their charges they shall take special care to sow deeply in their hearts a love of chastity and Christian modesty.

Pope Pius XI also issued the standard of decent dress, declaring that &quot;A dress cannot be called decent which is cut deeper than two fingers breadth under the pit of the throat; which does not cover the arms at least to the elbows; and scarcely reaches a bit beyond the knees. Furthermore, dresses of transparent materials are improper.&quot;

Between 1933 and 1980, the Catholic Legion of Decency was active in monitoring morally objectionable content in films. It condemned a number of films, including several on account of the clothing worn. For example, the Legion has condemned the display of cleavage in &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1941) and in &quot;The French Line&quot; (1954).

In 1944 on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, the so-called &quot;Marylike Crusade&quot; (formally known as the &quot;Purity Crusade of Mary Immaculate&quot;) was initiated by Rev. Bernard Kunkel to codify Pope Pius&#x27; XII directives on the Catholic standards of dress, known as &quot;Marylike modesty&quot;. It seeks for Christians to emulate the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title &quot;Mother Most Chaste&quot; as the model for modesty. Mary-like Modesty includes for women, wearing sleeves &quot;extending at least to the elbows&quot; and &quot;skirts reaching below the knees&quot;, as well as having a neckline no more than two inches with the rest of the bodice fully covered. The Marylike Crusade promotes a vow for Catholics to take: &quot;While I am determined always to dress with Marylike modesty, both at home and in public, I intend to be specially careful to do so when visiting any place dedicated to God.&quot; The Marylike Crusade received an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Pius XII on 14 July 1954 and on 11 May 1955, Pope Pius XII extended this &quot;to the members, to their Directors and Moderators, to their families and loved ones, and to all who further their laudable movement for modesty in dress and behaviour.&quot; The standards of Mary-like Modesty established by the Purity Crusade of Mary Immaculate continue to be promoted by Traditionalist Catholics as normative.

In 2004 Cardinal Anthony Okogie sent letters to the priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos and asked them to prohibit &quot;fashions promoting lust and immorality&quot; within churches. Under this rubric, people wearing &quot;clothes which reveal sensitive parts of the body such as the bust, chest, belly, or upper arms, transparent clothing or dresses with slits above the knees&quot; are forbidden to attend Mass inside the church. The faithful Catholics in the Archdiocese have been wholly supportive of the dictum concerning modesty, with many women practicing Christian headcovering with the Virgin Mary as their model.

Some Catholics have attempted to form cohesive theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective, while at other times it takes a more systematic, Thomistic approach, combined with the writings of the Church Fathers. Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the saints, can also be found. In various localities, from time to time the church hierarchy have given opinions on various matters regarding dressing and modesty of the faithful. While Nicholas the Great wrote to the first Christian ruler of Bulgaria, Boris I, in the 9th century, that it was acceptable for the Bulgarian women to continue to wear trousers, Giuseppe Cardinal Siri stated in 1960 that trousers were unacceptable dress for women. Many traditional Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard. Around 1913, it became fashionable for dresses to be worn with a modest round or V-shaped neckline. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.

====Methodists====
Methodists belonging to the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, have guidelines on modest apparel in accordance with the Wesleyan-Arminian doctrine of outward holiness. The Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches, which continues to observe the ordinance of women&#x27;s headcovering, stipulates &quot;renouncing all vain pomp and glory&quot; and &quot;adorning oneself with modest attire.&quot; Their interpretation of and is seen as forbidding the exposure of the body from torso to thighs, while is interpreted as God mandating gender-distinct clothing. The 2015 &quot;Discipline of the Evangelical Wesleyan Church&quot;, for example, states: &quot;We require our women to appear in public with dresses of modest length, sleeves of modest length, modest necklines and modest hose; the wearing of split skirts, slacks, jeans, artificial flowers or feathers is forbidden.&quot; It goes on:

====Pentecostals====

Holiness Pentecostalism, the original trunk of Pentecostal Christianity, historically affirms the doctrine of outward holiness, which is reflected in the wearing of modest clothing. Holiness Pentecostals have historically taught a distinction between the male sex and female sex with respect to gender distinct clothing; they do not wear adornment, such as jewelry and makeup. The Apostolic Faith Church and the Free Gospel Church, for example, subscribe to these Holiness Pentecostal standards; in addition to these, the Ukrainian Pentecostal Church adheres to the ordinance of women&#x27;s headcovering (cf. ).

Oneness Pentecostalism, another branch of Pentecostal Christianity, teaches the wearing of modest clothing. Oneness Pentecostal denominations, such as the United Pentecostal Church International, maintain the teaching of gender distinctions, including a belief that men should have short hair and women should not cut their hair (cf. ). While at the beach, women wear swimming dresses rather than what adherents would consider revealing bathing suits. Oneness Pentecostals do not adorn themselves with cosmetics or jewelry. Additionally, certain Oneness Pentecostal denominations, such as the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, observe the wearing of headcoverings by Christian women (cf. ).

====Quakers====
Conservative Friends and Holiness-Orthodox Friends, two associations of Quaker Christians, wear plain dress as part of their testimony of simplicity.

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has issued official statements on modest dress for its members. Clothing such as &quot;short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back&quot; are discouraged. Men and women are also encouraged to avoid extremes in clothing or hairstyles. Rules on modesty also include women being asked to wear no more than one pair of earrings. Women are generally expected to wear skirts or dresses for church services. Most LDS members do not wear sleeveless shirts or shorts that do not reach the knee.

The church-funded university, Brigham Young University (BYU), requires students and tenants of BYU housing to sign an agreement to live according to these standards of modesty.

===Hinduism===

The premise and concepts of modesty have evolved under Hinduism. During Vedic times, both women and men wore at least two pieces of draped dress that was largely undifferentiated, voluntary and flexible. Stitched clothes such as skirts and bodices were also common in the Vedic period. However, modesty was not determined by the precepts of religion, but by local traditions, social codes, profession, circumstances and occasion. The multiple pieces of draped dress for women evolved into a single length of draped cloth among Indian Hindus, now called a sari; but it remained two or more pieces for Southeast Asian Hindus. For men, the draped dress reduced to one piece, now called by various names such as dhoti, &quot;lungi&quot;, &quot;pancha&quot;, &quot;laacha&quot; and other names among Indian Hindus, and &quot;kamben&quot; among Balinese Hindu.

The Hindu belief, suggests Christopher Bayly, is that modesty through appropriate dress has the energy to transmit spirit and substance in a social discourse. Dress serves as a means of expression or celebration, with some dressing elements such as saffron threads or white dress worn by men as moral, transformative and a means to identify and communicate one&#x27;s social role in a gathering, or one&#x27;s state of life such as mourning in days or weeks after the passing away of a loved one.

The canons of modesty for Hindus in South Asia underwent significant changes with the arrival of Islam in the 12th century. The Islamic rulers imposed a dress code in public places for Hindu dhimmis, per their Islamic mores of modesty. The &quot;sari&quot; worn by Hindu women extended to provide a veil, as well as a complete cover of her navel and legs. In the early 18th century, Tryambakayajvan—a court official in south central India—issued an edict called &quot;Stridharmapaddhati&quot;. The ruling outlined a required dress code for orthodox Hindus in that region. &quot;Stridharmapaddhati&quot; laced social trends with Hindu religion to place new rules on modesty for women, but gave much freedom to men.

The concept of modesty evolved again during colonial times when the British administration required Indians to wear dresses to help identify and segregate the local native populations. Bernard Cohn and others remark that dress during the colonial era became part of a wider issue in India about respect, honor and modesty, with the dress code intentionally aimed by the administration to reflect the relationship between the British ruler and the Indian ruled. The British colonial empire encouraged and sometimes required Indians to dress in an &#x27;oriental manner&#x27;, to help define and enforce a sense of modesty and to identify roles and a person&#x27;s relative social status. Among Indonesian Hindus, the accepted practice of toplessness among teenage Hindu girls changed during the Dutch colonial rule, with women now wearing a blouse or colorful cloth.

====Temples====

Inside most Hindu temples, there is an expectation of modesty rather than sexual allurement. Men and women typically wear traditional dress during religious ceremonies and rituals in a temple, with women wearing &quot;saris&quot; or regional Indian dress. In Indonesia and Cambodia, Hindu temple visitors are often requested to wrap their waist with a traditional single piece cloth called &quot;kamben&quot;, &quot;wastra&quot; or &quot;sarung&quot;, with or without &quot;saput&quot;.

====Current trends====
Hindus have diverse views on modesty, with significant regional and local variations. Among orthodox Hindu populations, sexually revealing dress or any sexual behaviour in public or before strangers is considered immodest, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the dress of deities and other symbolism in Hindu temples, the discussion of dress and eroticism in ancient Hindu literature, and art works of Hinduism can be explicit, celebrating eroticism and human sexuality.

In general, a disregard of modesty can be confusing or distressing, in particular to traditional Hindu women. Even in a health care context, some Hindu women may express reluctance to undress for examination. If undressing is necessary, the patient may prefer to be treated by a doctor or nurse of the same sex.

===Islam===

Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. In many authentic hadiths, it has been quoted that &quot;modesty(Haya) is a part of faith&quot;. Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. Dress code is part of that overall teaching.

====Women====
&quot;And tell the believing women to cast down their glances and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands&#x27; fathers, their sons, their husbands&#x27; sons, their brothers, their brothers&#x27; sons, their sisters&#x27; sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.&quot; -Quran 24:31.

&quot;O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.&quot; -Quran 33:59. Jalabib is an Arabic word meaning &quot;loose outer garment&quot;.

In some Muslim societies, women wear the niqab, a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full burqa, a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Wearing these garments is common in some, but not all, countries with a predominately Muslim population.
Though by some scholars these expressions of modesty are interpreted as mandatory, most countries do not enforce modesty by law. However, a few countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran, enforce specified standards of dress for women.

====Men====
&quot;Tell the believing men to cast down their glances and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is [well] acquainted with what they do.&quot; -Quran 24:30

Most scholars agree that men are required to cover everything from the navel to the knees; some men choose also to wear the traditional Islamic cap (taqiyah), similar to the Jewish yarmulke or kippah. The taqiyah may vary in shape, size, and color, with differences according to tradition, region, and personal taste.

===Judaism===

Modesty in Judaism, called Tzniut (), is important beyond aspects of clothing. It extends to behaviour in public and in private, and depends on the context.

====Women====
Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jewish women usually wear skirts that cover their knees, with blouses or shirts covering the collarbone and sleeves covering the elbows. See-through materials may not be used, and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting or &quot;provocative&quot;. Less strict Conservative Judaism recommends modest dress, but this is not broadly observed. Less restrictive branches of Judaism tend to adopt the fashions of the society in which they live.

It is the custom for a married Orthodox Jewish woman to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf (tichel), snood, hat, or a wig called a Sheitel.

====Men====
Standards of modesty also apply to men. While some Orthodox men will wear short-sleeve shirts in public, ultra-Orthodox men will not. More modern Orthodox Jewish men will be more lax in their dress when surrounded by other men (if it is not in a religious environment). Modesty for men most often translates to covering the torso and legs with loose clothing. Different groups of Orthodox Jews have different dress norms. But all have men dress in a head covering (kippah).

==In the arts==

Expectation of modesty also applies in the arts, though standards of modesty have varied at different times and in different places. Nudity and various types of behaviour were sometimes depicted, sometime not. In many cases where society did not allow nudity or immodest dress, nudity was accepted in art. Where nudity in art was not acceptable, full nudity was not displayed; otherwise nude subjects had their intimate parts hidden by apparently accidental draped fabric, flowers, other people, a fig leaf, etc. In films, very brief nudity was accepted. Some nude artworks had fig leaves added when standards became less permissive.

In a given society, the criteria varied according to the circumstances; for example artworks on public display were more restrained than those for private display to adults.

Nudity in art was sometimes suggested without actual depiction by:

* something seemingly by chance covering the parts of the body which should modestly be covered
* in film:
** showing a supposedly nude person from the waist or shoulders up
** maneuvering (turning, having objects in front) and editing in such a way that no genitals are seen
** showing nudity from a distance, or from the back only, although other characters are nearby and/or would also see frontal nudity
** showing nudity very briefly

In cartoons, even in cases where the genital area is not covered with clothing, genitals are often simply not drawn, as is the case in Family Guy and other animated sitcoms. In the film &quot;Barnyard&quot;, showing anthropomorphized cattle of both sexes walking on two legs, instead of either showing genitals of male cattle or not showing them, the concept of a &quot;male cow&quot; was used, with an udder. In &quot;Underdog&quot; a partly animated anthropomorphized dog is shown with a penis when a real dog is filmed, and without one in the animated parts.

Paintings are sometimes changed because of changed modesty standards, and later sometimes changed back. During the Counter-Reformation there was a &quot;fig-leaf campaign&quot; aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures that started with Michelangelo&#x27;s works. Works covered in this way include the marble statue of &quot;Cristo della Minerva&quot; (church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome) which was covered by added drapery, as it remains today, and the statue of the naked child Jesus in &quot;Madonna of Bruges&quot; (The Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium) remained covered for several decades. Also, the plaster copy of the David in the Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum) in London has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue. It was there to be placed over the statue&#x27;s genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty. The statue of Achilles at Hyde Park Corner now has an incongruous figleaf permanently attached, after it was stolen several times.

<text>Fort Augustus is a settlement in the parish of Boleskine and Abertarff, at the south-west end of Loch Ness, Scottish Highlands. The village has a population of around 646 (2001). Its economy is heavily reliant on tourism.

==History==
Some historians like G. Mcdonalds -after the finding of a roman coins hoard in 1767 near the city&#x27;s ancient benedictine abbey- wrote about the possibility that Fort Augustus was built on a roman small fortification built under Diocletian rule

The Gaelic name for the modern village is &#x27; () and until the early 18th century the settlement was called Kiliwhimin. It was renamed &quot;Fort Augustus&quot; after the Jacobite rising of 1715. The accepted etymology is that the settlement was originally named after Saint Cummein of Iona who built a church there. Other suggestions are that it was originally called &#x27; after one of two abbots of Iona of the Comyn clan, whose badge &#x27; refers to the cumin plant, or that it was called &#x27; (&quot;Comyn&#x27;s Burialplace&quot;) after the last Comyn in Lochaber.

In the aftermath of the Jacobite rising in 1715, General Wade built a fort (taking from 1729 until 1742) which was named after Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. Wade had planned to build a town around the new barracks and call it Wadesburgh. The settlement grew, and eventually took the name of this fort. The fort was captured by the Jacobites in March 1746, just before the Battle of Culloden.

A hoard of Roman coins was unearthed in 1767 near the ancient Benedictine abbey that are thought to be from Roman to Late Iron Age - 79 AD to 560 AD.

In 1867, the fort was sold to the Lovat family, and in 1876 they passed the site and land to the Benedictine order. The monks established Fort Augustus Abbey and later a school. The school operated until 1993 when it closed owing to changing educational patterns in Scotland causing a decline in enrollment. The monks employed Tony Harmsworth to devise a rescue package which saw the site converted into the largest private heritage centre in Scotland which operated between 1994 and 1998; however, the heritage centre failed to generate sufficient profit to maintain the buildings. In 1998 the monks abandoned the site, and it reverted to the Lovat family which in turn sold it to Terry Nutkins. He also owned The Lovat Hotel that stands on the site of the old Kilwhimen Barracks, one of four built in 1718. This site houses the west curtain wall of the old Fort, intact with gun embrasures. The Lovat was originally built as the local Station Hotel.

==Infrastructure==
The village is served by the A82 road and lies approximately midway between Inverness (56 km) and Fort William (51 km).

The village was served by a rail line from Spean Bridge to a terminus on the banks of Loch Ness from 1903 until 1933, built by the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway in the hope of eventually completing a line to Inverness and latterly operated by the North British Railway and its successor, the London and North Eastern Railway, but initially operated by the Highland Railway. The Caledonian Canal connecting Fort William to Inverness passes through Fort Augustus in a dramatic series of locks stepping down to Loch Ness.

The village is served by the Cill Chuimein Medical Centre.

The village has both a primary school and a secondary school – Kilchuimen Primary School and Kilchuimen Academy – which share a campus.

==Climate==
As with most of the British Isles and Scotland, Fort Augustus has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool summers and mild winters. Like a lot of the surrounding area, sunshine levels are low at around 1,000 hours per annum and temperatures are unpredictable – Fort Augustus holds the UK&#x27;s joint lowest May temperature record of . This is the latest point in the run-up to summer that such a low temperature has been recorded, suggesting it can become a frost trap on calm clear nights due to its valley location. That same low-lying topography can also give rise to some high temperatures on occasion – Fort Augustus held the UK daily high temperature record for 16 December for almost 80 years.

==Notable people==
* Guy Prendergast (1905–1986), explorer and soldier. Buried in Strathoich cemetery.
