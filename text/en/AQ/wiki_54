<text>Schofield Barracks is a United States Army installation and census-designated place (CDP) located in Honolulu and in the Wahiawa District of the Hawaiian island of Oahu, Hawaii. Schofield Barracks lies adjacent to the town of Wahiawā, separated from most of it by Lake Wilson (also known as Wahiawā Reservoir). Schofield Barracks is named after Lieutenant General John McAllister Schofield, who was the Commanding General of the United States Army from August 1888 to September 1895. He had been sent to Hawaii in 1872 and had recommended the establishment of a naval base at Pearl Harbor.

Schofield Barracks has an area of on Central Oahu. The post was established in 1908 to provide mobile defense of Pearl Harbor and the entire island. It has been the home of the 25th Infantry Division, nicknamed the &quot;Tropic Lightning&quot; division, since 1941, as well as the headquarters for United States Army Hawaii (USARHAW).

Schofield is home to the Pacific field office of the Army CID.

The population was 14,904 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Schofield Barracks is located at (21.497650, −158.063248). The Main Gate used to be off Wilikina Drive; however, now only the Foote and Lyman gates located along Kunia Road are used for controlled access. Proceeding north on Wilikina Road (State Rte. 99) leads to intersections with Kaukonahua Road (State Rte. 801) to Waialua and Kamehameha Highway (State Rte. 99) to Haleiwa. East on Wilikina leads to Interstate H-2 and Kamehameha Highway (State Rte.s 80 and 99) to Wahiawā and Mililani Town. Proceeding south on Kunia Road (State Route 750) past Schofield leads to the Kunia Gate on Wheeler, Kunia, and eventually Waipahu.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of , all of it land.

==Post areas==
===Main Post===
The Main Post area consists of numerous quadrangle-style barracks and unit command structures, most of which have a letter designation. B and C Quads are the oldest, having been constructed in the 1910s, with D, E, and F quads being built later. Additionally on Main Post are the PX (post exchange), the Commissary, the &quot;Aloha Building&quot;, the Library, Bowling Alley, and Uniform Clothing Store. Several sets of barracks have recently been constructed (the first set completed in 1998) adhering to a more stylish apartment-type setup. The Nehelani Club, Old Nehelani Club and Conroy Bowl are in the Main Post area as well.

===Housing areas===
Much of the housing on-post has been renovated or rebuilt now that the housing has been privatized. The enlisted housing area lies to the west of Main Post, while the officers&#x27; housing lies to the north along Wilikina Drive. Island Palms is the on-post housing company, which is part of Lend Lease, that is responsible for maintaining the units. The average wait time for housing is 2–6 months and up to one year for larger homes.

===Area X===
Area X and its environs constitute the bulk of the training areas on Schofield Barracks. Large open areas allow for air assault operations to take off and land. Covered concrete pads can provide shelter for units training in the area who do not wish to deal with sleeping in the field. The range control office as well as numerous semi-automated and other firing ranges are contained within this area as well.

===East Range Training Area===
The Air Assault School, Land Navigation Course, and designated training areas are laid out in this area to the east of the Main Post and the Enlisted Housing area. Typically, the bulk of the EIB train up and testing are done in this area.

===Kolekole Pass===
Kolekole Road, which passes through the Enlisted Housing Area and West Post Training Area, leads up to a saddle named Kolekole Pass which allows vehicle traffic to flow between Schofield Barracks and Lualualei Naval Magazine as well as being an intermediate destination for physical training runs by soldiers stationed on Schofield Barracks.

A 37-foot, 35-ton steel cross located at Kolekole Pass was dismantled by the Army in 1997 after Hawaii Citizens for the Separation of State and Church filed a federal lawsuit charging the cross, built with public tax dollars in 1962, was a &quot;blatant and obvious violation&quot; of the First Amendment.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates two schools in Schofield Barracks CDP: Samuel K. Solomon Elementary School, and Daniel K. Inouye Elementary School. Solomon Elementary&#x27;s namesake was a member of the Wolfhounds. The dedication of the original campus was on November 11, 1969, while the dedication of the current facility occurred on November 9, 2019. In the 2016–2017 school year it had 933 students. The Department of Defense&#x27;s Office of Economic Adjustment funded the construction of the current campus with a $70,248,901. The State of Hawaii added an additional $20,000,000 to the funding. The current campus has four buildings, with each up to two stories tall, and a capacity of above 800. These buildings have 63 classrooms total. Inouye Elementary opened in 1959 as Hale Kula Elementary School, and it was given its current name on April 19, 2016. Some students are, as of 2016, zoned to Wheeler Elementary School.

As of 2016 the zoned secondary schools are Wheeler Middle School and Leilehua High School.

Sergeant Rodney J. T. Yano Library (Building 560), operated by the United States Army&#x27;s Family and MWR Programs, is in the area. Hawaii State Public Library System operates nearby civilian public libraries.

==25th Infantry Division Memorial==
The 25th Infantry Division Memorial consists of four statues, representing the division&#x27;s soldiers who served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the War on Terrorism (Afghanistan and Iraq). The first statue was unveiled in June 2005, created by Artist Lynn Weiler Liverton.

==In popular culture==
* Schofield Barracks was the principal setting for the novel &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1951) by James Jones and the ensuing film of 1953, television mini-series (1979), and musical story (2003) versions.
* Schofield Barracks and its surrounding area were also used for CBS&#x27;s &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; TV series.

==Climate==
Schofield Barracks has a tropical savanna climate. Owing to a higher elevation, Schofield is slightly cooler year round than Honolulu, but is still well within the realms of a tropical climate. Precipitation patterns closely resemble those of mediterranean climates being found in mainland California, but its warm winters prevents the climate from being classified as such.

<doc id="110533" wikidata="Q2016119" url="?curid=110533" title="Wahiawa, Hawaii">
<text>Wahiawa (, ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States, on the island of Oahu. It is in the Wahiawā District, on the plateau or &quot;central valley&quot; between the two volcanic mountains that bookend the island. In Hawaiian, &quot;wahi a wā&quot; means &quot;place of the wa people&quot;. The population was 18,658 at the 2020 census.

Lakes and reservoirs are rare in Hawaii, and Wahiawā is unique in being surrounded on three sides by Lake Wilson (also known as Wahiawā Reservoir or Kaukonahua). The town must be reached by either of two bridges on Kamehameha Highway (State Rte. 80) across the reservoir&#x27;s narrow north and south arms. Outside of the reservoir, the town used to be surrounded by military bases and agricultural fields, but development is making its way up from the increasingly urbanized southern portion of the central plain. Still, there are significant U.S. Army facilities in the area, including Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Army Airfield, and East Range, an Army training area extending into the hills south and east of town. Schofield Barracks alone is larger than Wahiawā CDP. Wahiawā is also home to the United States Navy&#x27;s Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific and the housing community HMR.

The U.S. postal codes for Wahiawā are 96786 and 96857.

== Geography ==
Wahiawā is located at (21.502574, -158.022938).

Vehicular routes to the North Shore from Wahiawā are Kamehameha Highway (State Rte. 80) to Haleʻiwa and Kaukonahua Road (State Rte. 801) to Waialua. Wheeler and Schofield are reached along Wilikina Drive (Wahiawā Bypass) (State Rte. 99), which bypasses Wahiawā from the south bridge, a road that eventually connects to both Kamehameha Highway and Kaukonahua Road northwest of town. Kamehameha Highway continues south (as State Rte. 99) past Wheeler to Mililani Town. Interstate H-2 terminates at Wilikina Drive near the Kamehameha Highway intersection, and is a less congested route southward to Mililani and beyond to Pearl City and Honolulu via Interstate H-1. Kunia Road (State Rte. 750) runs from Wilikina Drive, between Schofield and Wheeler (on the bypass), then southward along the mostly still agricultural western side of the plain to Kunia and Waipahu beyond.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which is land and , or 11.34%, is water.

Kaʻala, the highest peak on Oahu (), is west of Wahiawā, overlooking Schofield Barracks.

Wahiawā Reservoir or Lake Wilson is Hawaii&#x27;s second-largest reservoir (). It irrigates agricultural fields, including the Dole Pineapple Plantation fields at the northern part of Wahiawā, all the way to Oahu&#x27;s North Shore, where it empties.

==History==
Many of the current families living in Waialua are the results of agricultural industry which began in the early 20th century. There was an increased demand for workers as the industry grew, resulting in workers being brought in from China, Portugal, Japan, Korea, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Spain and other areas. Upon arriving in Hawaii, many of these workers were assigned to work in the sugarcane plantations in Waialua. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the sugar production decreased as increasing labor and production costs caused producers to move overseas. Many of the families brought to Waialua during the sugar rush remained here and many of their descendants reside there today.

During World War II the twin guns from USS Saratoga were installed off Kamehameha Highway near Waialua for use as gun batteries attached to Hawaiian Pineapple Company Camp Brodie 4.

<text>Waipahu () is a former sugarcane plantation town and now census-designated place (CDP) located in the Ewa District on the island of Oahu in the City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP population was 43,485. The U.S. postal code for Waipahu is 96797.

==History==
Waipahu is the name of an artesian spring. In Hawaiian, Waipahu is derived from &quot;wai&quot;, meaning water, and &quot;pahū&quot;, meaning &quot;burst or explode&quot;; combined, &quot;Waipahu&quot; means &quot;water forced up (as out of a spring)&quot;. The early Native Hawaiians took pleasure in the cool and clear water gushing from the ground and named this spring Waipahu. Before the Western civilization set foot in Hawaii, the Hawaiians considered Waipahu to be the capital of Oahu. Royalty in the Kingdom of Hawaii would often gather and enjoy the fresh water from the spring Waipahu.

In 1897, Oahu Sugar Company was incorporated, and its board of directors located the sugar mill in Waipahu. It had 943 field workers. There were 44 Hawaiians, including 10 minors; 57 Portuguese; 443 Japanese, 408 of them contract laborers; and 399 Chinese, 374 of whom were contract laborers. The company&#x27;s managers from 1897 to 1940 were August Ahrens (1897–1904), E.K. Bull (1904–1919), J.B. Thomson (1919–1923), E.W. Greene (1923–1937), and Hans L&#x27;Orange (1937–1956).

In the early days of the plantation, each worker was assigned a number inscribed on a metal disc about the size of a silver dollar. The numbers 1 through 899 identified Japanese alien; 900 through 1400 were Japanese who were American citizens or Hawaii-born. The 2000 and 2100 series were Portuguese laborers, 2200 Spanish, 2300 Hawaiian, 2400 Puerto Rican, 3000 Chinese or Korean, 4000 and 5000 Filipino. The company imported laborers from many different countries including the Philippines, Japan, China, Portugal, and Norway. Very few laborers working for the Oahu Sugar Co. were Hawaiian. The majority of the company&#x27;s first laborers were either Japanese or Chinese. Plantation workers lived by what was called The Plantation System. Field workers received an average monthly salary of $12.50. However, Filipino immigrants were paid less than the other laborers because they were the cheapest to import. The Filipinos, on average, made less than $10.00 a month. The Chinese generally were paid the most, with a monthly average of $15.00.

In 1932, the Oahu Sugar Co. opened a continuation school, and allowed a half-day off from work once a week for workers to attend. Those who weren&#x27;t available during the day could also attend evening courses. This was to give them a chance to better their knowledge for a better job.

During the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) planes fired at the sugar mill in Waipahu, killing a civilian and injuring seven others.

Amfac acquired the company in 1961. Oahu Sugar Company shut down plantation operations after the 1995 harvest.

In 1923, the Oahu Sugar Company field also served as the community center which featured band concerts, sporting events, and carnivals. Later, the athletic field was renamed Hans L&#x27;Orange Field. Today, the park is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of Hawaii Pacific University&#x27;s men&#x27;s baseball team, the Sea Warriors. It was the home field of the Hawaii Winter Baseball teams the North Shore Honu and West Oahu CaneFires until 2008.

In 1973, the City and County of Honolulu and the State of Hawai&#x27;i purchased opposite the Waipahu sugar mill to establish the Waipahu Cultural and Garden Park. The park is known today as the Hawai&#x27;i Plantation Village. Hawai&#x27;i Plantation Village is a living history museum located in Waipahu.

In 1997, the Governor of Hawaii, Benjamin J. Cayetano, proclaimed the months of June 1997 through November 1997 to be Waipahu Centennial Celebration Months. Many activities and events were held to celebrate the Waipahu Centennial.

Waipahu is the home to the 2008 Little League World Series champions from Waipi&#x27;o Little League. They defeated Matamoros, Mexico 12–3 in the final game on August 24, 2008. On August 28, 2010, that same team won the U.S. championship of the Little League World Series, defeating the team from Pearland, Texas, but lost to Edogawa Minami LL of Tokyo on August 29, 2010, in the international championship.

==Geography==

Waipahu is located along the northern shore of both Middle Loch and West Loch of Pearl Harbor. Both Interstate H-1 and Farrington Highway (Hawaii Route 90) run east–west through the length of Waipahu. The town of Waipahu spans across three ahupuaʻa (historic Native Hawaiian land division): Waipiʻo, Waikele, and Hōʻaeʻae. It is common for neighborhoods to be named after the ahupuaʻa in which it&#x27;s located. The neighboring areas of Waipio, Village Park, Royal Kunia and Waikele use Waipahu as their postal city, and are often considered to be part of Waipahu.

There are several streams that run through Waipahu, including Waikele Stream and Kapakahi Stream. Waikele Stream runs along the Hawaii Plantation Village and down into Pouhala Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary, which is habitat for several endangered bird species that are endemic to Hawaii. There is roughly 140 feet of elevation change between the north side of Waipahu along H-1 and sea level.

Waikele is located across the H1 freeway north of Waipahu. Waikele consists of newer subdivisions and an upscale outlet shopping center and world-famous golf course. To the west via either roadway can be reached Makakilo and Kapolei, with the Leeward coast beyond. To the east lie Pearl City and the H-2 interchange to Waipio. At the western end of Waipahu is Kunia Road (State Rte. 750) which leads to the Waipahu newer growth areas of Royal Kunia and Village Park north of H-1, and eventually on up across the central plain to Kunia and Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Army Airfield, and Wahiawā. Kunia Road becomes Fort Weaver Road (State Rte. 76) south of Farrington Highway, and goes south through Honouliuli and Ewa Villages to Ewa Beach.

==Government and infrastructure==

The Hawaii Department of Public Safety operates the Waiawa Correctional Facility, a minimum security prison near Waipio.

In 2017, the state approved NRG Energy, Inc., to build a 45.9 megawatt Waipio solar farm project north of Costco near Waiawa and H-2 in Waipio. Hawaiian Electric Companies (HECO) will buy electricity from this solar farm at 10.4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for 22 years. On September 10, 2019, the 45.9 megawatt Waipio Solar developed by Clearway Energy Group began its operation. Originally started by the developer SunEdison, Hawaiian Electric broke its ties to the firm in February 2016 before SunEdison&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings. San Francisco-based Clearway&#x27;s predecessor the NRG Energy&#x27;s Community Solar division, took over the project at the end of November 2016. On January 22, 2019, the Clearway Energy Group obtained NRG Community Solar&#x27;s assets.

In March 2019, the Public Utilities Commission approved Clearway Energy Group to build a 36 megawatt with 144 megawatt-hour storage solar farm plus battery storage project near Waipio called Waiawa Solar. HECO will buy electricity from this solar-plus-storage project at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The Waiawa Solar project is expected to be completed by Clearway and go online at the end of 2021.

==Education==
Hawaii Department of Education operates public schools. Kanoelani Elementary School is in the Waipio CDP.

==Recreation==

===Little League World Series===
In 2008, the team from Waipio LL, representing Hawaii and the United States, captured the Little League World Series crown, beating Matamoros LL, Mexico 12–3 in 6 innings. Iolana Akau started with a solo blast earlier in the game and Tanner Tokunaga added two homers later in the game. Waipio is the second team from the Ewa District to win the world championship; &#x27;Ewa Beach representing West O&#x27;ahu won the title in 2005.

In 2010, the Waipio LL team won the U.S. championship of the Little League World Series, defeating Pearland White LL from Pearland, Texas on August 28, 2010, by a score of 10-0 after 5 innings, which invoked the Little League &quot;mercy rule&quot; where a team is leading by 10 runs or more after 4 innings. They lost in a close 4–1 game to Edogawa Minami LL of Tokyo, Japan on August 29, 2010, in the Series final.

<text>Wheeler Army Airfield , also known as Wheeler Field and formerly as Wheeler Air Force Base, is a United States Army post located in the City &amp; County of Honolulu and in the Wahiawa District of the Island of O&#x27;ahu, Hawaii. It is a National Historic Landmark for its role in the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Overview==
Wheeler AAF comprises approximately of land adjacent to Schofield Barracks and is home to a variety of Department of Defense activities including the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the 169th Aircraft Control &amp; Warning Squadron (169 ACWS) of the Hawaii Air National Guard, the 193rd Aviation Regiment (Medium Lift), Detachment 55 Operational Support Airlift (Det 55 OSA) of the Hawaii Army National Guard, the Regular Army&#x27;s 25th Infantry Division&#x27;s 25th Combat Aviation Brigade composed of the 25th Aviation Regiment, the 2nd Squadron-6th Cavalry Regiment, and the 209th Aviation Support Battalion, also located on Wheeler is the Trial Defense Service-Hawaii.

==History==
On 6 February 1922, a detachment of 20 enlisted men from Luke Field, proceeded to Schofield Barracks, under Lieutenant William T. Agee, to clear the flying field on the grounds of the former 17th Cavalry Regiment drill grounds and construct housing for the divisional air service. Two canvas hangars were erected and the field cleared of weeds, guava and algaroba trees. Thus Wheeler Field got its modest start. It was named Wheeler Field on 11 November 1922 in honor of Major Sheldon H. Wheeler, former commander of Luke Field on Ford Island, killed in the crash of DH-4B, &quot;AAS Ser. No. 63525&quot; on 13 July 1921.

In June 1923, 13 months after the designation of the new flying field, shop hangars, airplane hangars, and oil storage tanks were erected. In 1927, one of the wooden shop hangars was remodeled to provide space for a barracks and a mess hall incident to the formation of a pursuit group. It was not until 1930 that any permanent construction was started. Many different units were originally stationed at Wheeler Field. The first units of the Schofield Barracks divisional airdrome were the 4th Observation Squadron, Photo Section No. 11 and Branch Intelligence Office No. 11.

In October 1922, the photo section and intelligence units were returned to Luke Field. The following May, the 17th Composite Group was organized at Wheeler. It consisted of a Headquarters Squadron, the 19th Pursuit Squadron and the 4th Observation Squadron. These units operated from the field until January 1924, when the 17th Group was rendered inactive. Three years later, the foundation for the present 18th Pursuit Group was laid and the 6th and 19th Pursuit Squadrons were transferred from Luke Field. More squadrons were eventually added to the 18th Pursuit Group and Bellows Field was opened as an aerial gunnery camp for the use of tactical organizations. The 15th Pursuit Group was formed next and was made a permanent part of the airdrome. Hand in hand with this move came the formation of the 14th Pursuit Wing.

Wheeler Field was the site of several major historic aviation events prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, including the first transpacific flight from California in 1927; the great Dole Air Race from California to Hawaii; the first transpacific flight from the U.S. to Australia in 1928, and the first Hawaii-to-Mainland solo flight in 1935 by Amelia Earhart. Ms. Earhart visited Wheeler Field in 1935 in her Lockheed Vega and in 1937 in her Lockheed Model 10 Electra. Kingsford Smith, in his plane, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, also used the airfield on his historic flights across the Pacific.

By 1940, Wheeler Field had evolved into a primary base for Army Air Corps pursuit (i.e., &quot;fighter&quot;) aircraft such as the P-40 Warhawk, responsible for air defense of the Hawaiian Islands Territory.

===World War II===

Wheeler Army Airfield was a primary target and site of the first attack on 7 December 1941, leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese attacked the airfield to prevent the numerous planes there from getting airborne and engaging them. Most of the planes were destroyed, but 12 pilots assigned to the 15th Pursuit Group at Wheeler (predecessor of the present day 15th Wing) succeeded in getting their P-36 Hawk and P-40 Warhawk aircraft off the ground, engaged the Japanese in furious dogfights, and scored some of the first American victories of World War II.

2nd Lieutenant Phil Rasmussen found an old, unscathed Curtiss P-36 Hawk and taxied it to a revetment where he had it loaded with ammunition. During a lull in the bombing, he took off with three other pilots. Lieutenant Rasmussen managed to shoot down a Mitsubishi A6M Zero and the American pilots subsequently engaged 11 Japanese aircraft.

The installation has a National Historic Landmark District in association with the attack on 7 December 1941. The 1941 Flightline, hangars and barracks survive today.

Casualties at Wheeler totaled 33 killed and 75 wounded. Of the 233 aircraft assigned to the Hawaiian Air Force, 146 were in commission before the attack; afterward, only 83 were in commission (including 27 P-40s) and 76 had been totally destroyed. During World War II as part of the US Army Air Forces and until 1949 as part of the newly established United States Air Force, Wheeler was assigned to the Seventh Air Force (former Hawaiian Air Force) and successor commands.

===Cold War===
With the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947, Wheeler Army Air Base was re-designated Wheeler Air Force Base under the operational control of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). The following year, the installation was placed on minimum caretaker status; however, with expansion of the Air Force during the Korean War, Wheeler AFB was restored to fully operational status in 1952.

On 24 February 1952, the 1508th Support Squadron was organized to provide administrative and logistical support to activities at Wheeler AFB. The unit was redesignated the 6487th Support Squadron on 1 April 1955, then inactivated on 1 November 1971, concurrent with activation of the 15th Air Base Squadron.

A subordinate unit of the 15th Air Base Wing, the 15 ABS served as the host organization at Wheeler AFB, which consisted of approximately 1,389 acres of land and facilities valued at over $37 million. Responsibilities of the 15 ABS included providing munitions service and support to all Air Force activities within the Hawaiian area, in addition to operating a small arms firing range where personnel of the Air Force, U.S. Customs and local law enforcement agencies were certified. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the installation hosted a number of Army and Air Force activities, including Army rotary-wing and fixed-wing aviation units and USAF fixed-wing air support / forward air control units flying the O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco.

In August 1987, the Secretary of the Interior designated Wheeler AFB as a National Historic Landmark, recognizing it as a site of national significance in the history of the United States and, in particular, World War II in the Pacific.

The 15th Air Base Squadron inactivated at Wheeler on 31 October 1991, one day before the U.S. Army assumed operational control of the installation in accordance with a memorandum of understanding signed by the Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces, and the Commander, US Army Western Command.

===Return to Army control===
On 1 November 1991, the Army held a simple ceremony to signify their takeover of the base, then changed the sign at the main gate to Wheeler Army Airfield. The installation, however, remained on the real property records of the 15th Air Base Wing until 15 March 1993 when an Action Memorandum signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and Occupational Health) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations and Housing) authorized the exchange of Wheeler AFB for Fort Kamehameha Military Reservation.

==Design==
Wheeler Army Airfield was constructed in the pattern of the Garden City. These type of neighborhoods are the inspiration of Sir Ebenezer Howard of England, who designed these type neighborhoods in re-action to the industrial company towns that had blighted his nation. The neighborhoods are designed in loops with ample green spaces that were to be shared in common among the residents. The homes within the loops are of the Spanish Colonial Revival style that was flourishing in the 1920s and 1930s.

Today, Wheeler Army Airfield comprises approximately of land returned to the Department of the Army on 1 November 1991. As of the 2000 Census, the base had a total population of 2,829 military personnel and families.

==Geography==
Wheeler AAF is located at 21°28&#x27;56&quot; North, 158°2&#x27;24&quot; West (21.482216, −158.039959). The Wheeler Main Gate is located on Kamehameha Highway (State Rte 99) running north to Wahiawā (becoming State Rte. 80) and connecting westward to Wilikina Road (State Rte. 99) and Schofield Barracks. Proceeding south on Kamehameha Hwy. provides access to Interstate H-2 and Milillani Town. The Wheeler Kunia Gate is off Kunia Road directly across from the Schofield Lyman Gate. Kunia Road (State Rte. 750) continues south to Kunia, and eventually Waipahu.

Wheeler is directly adjacent to Schofield Barracks across Kunia Road and to Wahiawā on the central plateau of the Island of O&#x27;ahu. The U.S. postal code for Wheeler Army Airfield is 96786.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the base has a total area of none of which is covered by water.

The opening scene of this first installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise is supposed to take place in the Peruvian jungle where the main character, Indiana Jones, discovers an ancient booby-trapped temple.

Kalalea and the Anahola mountains also serve as a backdrop for a Polynesian resort - supposedly located on Makatea island - in the 1998 feature film &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot;. Coincidently, this movie also stars Harrison Ford.

<doc id="110547" wikidata="Q2638406" url="?curid=110547" title="Hanalei, Hawaii">
<text>Hanalei is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States. The population was estimated at 299 as of 2019. &quot;Hanalei&quot; means &quot;lei making&quot; in Hawaiian. Alternatively, the name &quot;Hanalei&quot; also means &quot;crescent bay&quot; and may be indicative of the shape of Hanalei Bay. Hanalei can also be translated as lei valley, referring to the rainbows that color the valley and encircle Hanalei like a wreath.

== Geography ==
Hanalei is located at (22.206653, -159.500713), near the mouth of the Hanalei River on Kauai&#x27;s north shore. It is bordered to the east by Princeville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of , of which are land and are water. The total area is 8.17% water.

== History ==
Hanalei was densely populated in ancient times, boasting a thriving indigenous community that produced an abundance of food from both terrestrial and marine sources. The earliest inhabitants of Hanalei cultivated substantial quantities of taro, bananas, breadfruit, sweet potatoes, yams, and coconuts. With the arrival of foreigners in Hawaii, new agricultural endeavors were introduced. During the first half of the 19th century, Hanalei became a significant supplier of various crops, including mulberry leaves, coffee, tobacco, cotton, rice, sugarcane, citrus fruits, peaches, pineapples, bananas, dates, tamarinds, guava, potatoes, plantains, cabbage, lettuce, and other agricultural products. 

=== Hawaiian Royalty ===

Hanalei, located on the island of Kauai, was a frequent destination for members of the Royal Hawaiian family during the 19th century. Notably, King Kamehameha II embarked on a 42-day voyage to Kauai in 1821. Later, King Kamehameha III visited Hanalei in 1852. Subsequent visits were made by King Kamehameha IV, who traveled to Hanalei in 1856 accompanied by Queen Emma and again with their young son, Prince Albert. These royal visits inspired Robert Crichton Wyllie, the owner of a local plantation, to name his estate Princeville in honor of the young prince

In 1867, Princess Ruth Ke’elikolani visited Hanalei, where she picnicked on the Hanalei River accompanied by her two poodles. Seven years later, in 1874, King Kalakaua also visited Hanalei Bay, receiving a ceremonial welcome that included a 21-gun salute. This salute was uniquely executed using cannons improvised from Ohia Lehua trees 

=== Imperial Russia ===
In the early 19th century Russians were present here. In 1815 the German physician and agent of the Russian-American Company Georg Anton Schäffer came to the Hawaiian Islands to retrieve goods seized by Kaumualiʻi, chief of Kauai island. On arrival he became involved with internal Hawaiian politics, and Kaumualiʻi planned and manipulated to reclaim Kauai from Kamehameha I with the Russian Empire&#x27;s help. Kaumualiʻi signed a &quot;treaty&quot; granting Tsar Alexander I protectorate over Kauai. In 1817, Fort Elizabeth, near the Waimea River, and two other Russian forts near Hanalei were briefly part of tsarist Russian America.

=== 1900s ===
During the early 20th century, the coastal plain of Hanalei was predominantly utilized for rice cultivation, with nearly all available land being dedicated to rice fields. The initial rice farmers were predominantly Chinese, later followed by Japanese, Filipino, Portuguese, and other ethnic groups. Many of these individuals were former sugarcane plantation workers who had completed their contractual obligations. The rice farming community in Hanalei established a comprehensive infrastructure, including homes, educational institutions, retail stores, rice mills, and places of worship such as churches and temples. Today, many descendants of these farmers and plantation workers continue to reside in Hanalei

In 1983 parts of the movie Uncommon Valor were filmed two miles from Hanalei.

A speculative interpretation of the Peter Paul &amp; Mary song &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot; as a marijuana metaphor claims that Puff&#x27;s homeland &quot;Hanah Lee&quot; is actually the town of Hanalei, which, according to the interpretation, is renowned for its marijuana. The cliffs on the side of the beach are said to look like a dragon. This interpretation was rejected by the song&#x27;s authors.

The beach at Hanalei Bay was selected No. 1 on &quot;Dr. Beach&quot; Stephen Leatherman&#x27;s 2009 list of top 10 beaches.

Hanalei was mentioned in the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as a place of residence for the town psychiatrist and his wife.

Parts of the movie &quot;The Descendants&quot; were filmed in and around Hanalei, on the beach at Hanalei Bay and in Princeville.

A song titled &quot;Hanalei&quot; was a part of the &quot;I&#x27;m with You Sessions&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2013.

All of the Queensland scenes in 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; were filmed in Kauai, with several of the scenes being shot in Hanapepe.

Hanapepe was the filming location for the Filipino city of Olongapo in &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;.

<text>Lihue (, ) is an unincorporated community, census-designated place (CDP) and the county seat of Kauai County, Hawaii, United States. Lihue is the second-largest town on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, following Kapaa. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 6,455, up from 5,694 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
In ancient times, Lihue was a small village. &quot;Līhue&quot; means &quot;cold chill&quot; in the Hawaiian language. Lihue is in the ancient district of Puna, the southeastern coast of the island, and the land division (&quot;ahupuaa&quot;) of Kalapaki. Royal Governor Kaikioewa officially made it his governing seat in 1837, moving it from Waimea; he named the town after land he owned on Oahu by the same name.

With the emergence of the sugar industry in the 1800s, Lihue became the central city of the island with the construction of a large sugar mill. Early investors were Henry A. Peirce, Charles Reed Bishop and William Little Lee. The plantation struggled until William Harrison Rice built the first irrigation system in 1856.

Subsequent plantation owner Paul Isenberg helped German people emigrate to Lihue starting in 1881, with the first Lutheran church in Hawaii founded in 1883. Services were held in German well into the 1960s. By the 1930s, George Norton Wilcox became one of the largest sugarcane plantation owners, buying Grove Farm from Hermann A. Widemann. The Wilcox family home, Kilohana, has been converted into a restaurant and gift shop. The surrounding plantation now grows crops and livestock. A narrow-gauge tourist railroad with vintage diesel locomotives from Whitworth and General Electric offers tours of the plantation; horse-drawn carriage tours are offered as well. The grounds are also the site of luaus, many of which are offshore excursions booked through NCL America. Lihue also houses the Kauai Museum, which details the history of Kauai.

==History==

This region was part of the Crown Lands following the Great Māhele. There was no private property prior to the Māhele, but in 1842 the land had been leased by the governor of Kauai to Godfrey Rhodes and John Bernard for a coffee plantation and this lease of Crown Lands was sold to Robert Crichton Wyllie in 1853. The area was named in honor of an 1860 visit by Prince Albert Kamehameha, son of King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. It was then a plantation leased by Robert Crichton Wyllie. He named another part of the plantation &quot;Emmaville&quot;, but that name never stuck.

Originally the land was planted with coffee, which was not suited to the wet lowlands. It was then planted with sugarcane. Wyllie&#x27;s nephew Robert Crichton Cochran inherited the land on the condition he would adopt the Wyllie surname, but he died by suicide on February 7, 1866. In 1867 it was purchased by Elisha Hunt Allen and later became a cattle ranch. It was sold for development in 1968 and became a golf course and resort called &quot;Princeville at Hanalei&quot;.

<text>Waimea (literally, &quot;red water&quot; in Hawaiian) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States. Situated on the southwest coast of the island of Kauai, the population was 2,057 at the 2020 census. The first Europeans to reach Hawaii landed in Waimea in 1778 (giving rise to Kauai&#x27;s cheeky slogan: &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s &quot;Original&quot; Visitor Destination&quot;).

==History==

=== Original settlers ===
Between 200 and 600 AD, the first settlers arrived in Kaua‘i from the Marquesas Islands. It is not clear why the voyagers sought a new homeland. They brought taro, sweet potato, pigs and fowl, as well as seeds. They were experienced farmers and fishermen, with advanced irrigation techniques that allowed them to thrive on the land.

Around 1000 AD, Tahitian explorers arrived in Hawai‘i and conquered the Marquesans. According to Hawaiian legend, the small-in-stature Marquesans were chased into the hills by the Tahitians, and became the &quot;Menehune&quot;, thought to be responsible for bad luck. The Tahitians brought with them a social and political hierarchy with distinct rules and taboos, also called &quot;kapu&quot;. It was forbidden for women and men to eat together, for women to eat pork or bananas, or for anyone to step on the shadow of a royal member. This kapu system, with kings (ali‘i), thrived and ruled for hundreds of years before Western explorers first made contact in the Islands.

=== First Western contact ===

On January 20, 1778, the British explorer, Captain James Cook, and his ships, HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;, arrived at the mouth of the Waimea River on the western side of Kaua‘i. Originally, Cook sent three small craft to Waimea so that his men could determine if it was a good place for the ships to dock. They reported back that there was a freshwater lagoon alongside a native village, so Cook and his men anchored their ships and went ashore on smaller craft.

Cook&#x27;s mission is thought to be one of scientific and social exploration. His men documented the flora and fauna of the Waimea area, and tried to translate the language of the natives. While Cook&#x27;s first contact with the islands was originally friendly and is responsible for a vast resource of information about the flora, fauna and culture of Hawai‘i, it also marks the beginning of the period of colonization of Hawai‘i and its people. The arrival of Europeans also introduced venereal disease and tuberculosis, which were responsible for decimating the native Hawaiian population.

== Economy ==

In the late 1700s and early 1800s Waimea was an important trading post for the maritime fur trade, whaling and sandalwood industries, later replaced by the sugar industry in the 1800s. In 1815 the fur trading vessel &quot;Atahualpa&quot;, purchased by the Russian–American Company and renamed &quot;Bering&quot;, wrecked at Waimea. Currently, the main industries in Waimea are construction and tourism. There are only two hotels in the town: Waimea Plantation Cottages, and The West Inn motel. There are several shops, small restaurants and food trucks that cater to both the local and tourist population. Waimea is home to the original location of Jo-Jo&#x27;s Shave Ice, the headquarters for the condiment manufacturer, Aunty Lilikoi.

==History ==
Amfac, Inc. started to develop Kaanapali Beach Resort in the 1960s, on mile-long Kaanapali Beach on the western shore of Maui, a couple miles north of the old whaling town of Lahaina. Since that time, many more hotels and condos have been built both on Kaanapali Beach and for several miles up and down the coast, and Lahaina has turned into a tourist shopping area.

Major resort hotels now on Kaanapali Beach (in order from the south end closest to Lahaina to the north end) are the Hyatt Regency Maui (opened in 1980), Maui Marriott (opened 1982, now turned into timeshares), Westin Maui Resort &amp; Spa (originally opened as the Maui Surf in 1971, then rebuilt as the Westin 1987), Outrigger Kaanapali Beach Hotel (1964), Sheraton Maui Resort &amp; Spa (1963 but completely rebuilt in 1996), Royal Lahaina (1962), and Aston Maui Kaanapali Villas (originally a Hilton when it opened in 1963 and sometime referred to as Hale Kaanapali).

There are also condominium complexes on Kaanapali Beach. Toward Lahaina between the Marriott and the Westin is the Alii. Moving further north on Kaanapali beach between Whalers Village (shopping center) and the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, is the Whaler. On the north side of Kaanapali Beach (north of Black Rock) there are two new complexes. The Westin Ka&#x27;anapali Ocean Resort Villas is a vacation ownership resort, with South Phase opened in September 2003 and North Phase opened in July 2007. The Honua Kai condominium complex is just south of the Aston Mahana condominiums (formerly ResortQuest Hawaii) and Ka&#x27;anapali Beach Club.

==Airports==
The Kapalua-West Maui Airport is a small regional airport that serves West Maui, including Kaanapali, Lahaina, Kapalua and Napili-Honokowai. The airport has been in service since 1987.

From 1965 to 1986, Kaanapali had its own airport located in the Kaanapali North Beach area, which was developed as The Westin Ka&#x27;anapali Ocean Resort Villas and Honua Kai condo complex.

Oneloa Bay at and Honokahua Bay are also backed by the resort. Mokuleia Bay and Honolua Bay are to the north in Honolua and Nāpili is to the south. Kapalua Bay was named &quot;Best Beach in the World&quot; by the readers of &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; magazine, &quot;America&#x27;s Best Beach&quot; on the first annual list of Stephen Leatherman&#x27;s Top 10 Beaches in America, and the &quot;Best Beach in America&quot; by the Travel Channel, among other honors.

<text>Lahaina, Lāhainā (, , , old var. Lāhainā) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Maui County, Hawaii, United States. On the northwest coast of the island of Maui, it encompasses Lahaina town and the Kaanapali and Kapalua beach resorts. At the 2020 census (before the 2023 wildfire), Lahaina had a resident population of 12,702. The CDP spans the coast along Hawaii Route 30 from a tunnel at the south end, through Olowalu, and to the CDPs of Kaanapali and Napili-Honokowai to the north.

A series of wildfires destroyed approximately 80% of Lahaina in 2023, resulting in the deaths of 102 people.

== History ==

=== Name ===
==== Modern name, etymology and pronunciations ====
Protestant missionaries sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) began organizing a way to write the Hawaiian language with English letters between 1820–1826 after they reached Hawaii.

According to &quot;Thrums Hawaiian Annual&quot; of 1921 the proper pronunciation of Lahaina is La-hai-ná.

Lahaina has different pronunciations depending on how diacritical marks are applied.

Lahaina is a combination of two Hawaiian words, “lā” which means sun, and “hainā” which means cruel. The varied spellings Lāhainā and Lahaina are commonly interchanged when written in modern english, although the traditional spelling “Lāhainā” is still considered proper.

==== Ancient names ====
Lahaina was originally called &quot;Lele&quot; in Hawaiian and was known for its breadfruit trees. &quot;Lele&quot; means jump or fly. Albert Pierce Taylor explains its relationship to the area as the &quot;flying piece of &quot;kuleana&quot;, that which sticks out from the sea&quot;.

In 1915, James N.K. Keola, in an article in &quot;Mid-Pacific Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;Old Lahaina&quot;, wrote: &quot;Lahaina is said to have received its name from &quot;Lā&quot;, the sun, and &quot;hainā&quot;, merciless. A bald-headed chief who lived at Kauaula Valley, while going to and fro without a hat, felt annoyed at the effects of the scorching rays of the burning sun. He looked up and gazed into the heavens and cursed at the sun thus: &quot;He keu hoi keia o ka la haina!&quot;&quot; (&quot;What a merciless sun!&quot;). On July 13, 1920, the &quot;Star Bulletin&quot; published several theories on the name&#x27;s origins that included the bald-headed chief legend, as well as theories that included the belief that the name goes back to 11th century as &quot;Laha aina&quot; (Proclaiming land).

Other interpretations of the name include &quot;day (of) sacrifice&quot; and &quot;day (of) explanation&quot;. Inez MacPhee Ashdown (1899–1992), historian and founder of Maui Historical Society, believed the name was &quot;Lahaʻaina&quot;, meaning &quot;land (of) prophecy&quot;, because of the number of &quot;kahuna nui&quot; (high priest) prophecies made there.

=== Early rulers ===
The first &quot;mōʻī&quot; or &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (supreme ruler) of western Maui was Haho, the son of Paumakua a huanuikalalailai. This line produced the subsequent rulers.

The name &quot;Lele&quot; was adopted during the reign of Kakaʻalaneo. He held court there during joint rule with his brother Kakae, while living on a hill called &quot;Kekaʻa&quot;. They were the sons and heirs of Kaulahea I. Kakaʻalaneo first planted breadfruit trees while his son Kaululaʻau is credited with expelling ghosts from Lānaʻi and putting the island under the rule of his father and uncle. Kakae&#x27;s son Kahekili I succeeded his father and uncle as ruler. Kahekili I&#x27;s successor was his son Kawaokaohele, who was succeeded by his own son Piʻilani

Piʻilani was the first ruler of the entire island of Maui when he extended his sovereignty over East Maui. The aliʻi of Hāna district accepted him as supreme ruler. Piʻilani also controlled the neighboring islands of Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, and parts of Molokaʻi.

In 1738, Lahaina and most of West Maui were the sites of a series of battles between the forces of Kamehamehanui Aiʻluau with his uncle and ally Alapaʻi, the &quot;ali‘i nui&quot; of Hawaii Island, against his half-brother Kauhiʻaimokuakama with his ally Peleʻioholani, the &quot;ali‘i nui&quot; of Oʻahu. The war ended in a truce between Alapaʻi and Peleʻioholani and the capture and execution of Kauhiʻaimokuakama by drowning. The remains of the fallen soldiers from both sides are said to be buried in the sands of Kāʻanapali district.

=== Western contact ===

On November 26, 1778 Captain James Cook&#x27;s ships appeared near Maui while the island&#x27;s monarch Kahekili II battled the forces of Kalaniʻōpuʻu, the &quot;ali‘i nui&quot; of Hawaii Island. He did not land on the island but was greeted by the warriors of Kalaniʻōpuʻu including a young Kamehameha I in their war canoes. The base of the Kamehameha statue in Honolulu depicts the warrior meeting Cook off the coast of Lahaina.

==== Kahekili II ====
British explorer George Vancouver visited in 1793 and unsuccessfully attempted to mediate a peace between Kahekili and Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s successor Kamehameha I. During his visit, he gave a description of the constant warfare on Lahaina:
The village of Raheina ... seemed to be pleasantly situated on a space of low or rather gently elevated land, in the midst of a grove of bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, and other trees...In the village the houses seemed to be numerous and to be well inhabited. A few of the natives visited the ships; these brought but little with them, and most of them were in very small miserable canoes. These circumstances strongly indicated their poverty, and proved what had been frequently asserted at Owhyhee, that Mowee and its neighbouring islands were reduced to great indigence by the wars in which for many years they had been engaged.

==== Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II ====
From 1802 to 1803, Kamehameha I stationed his large fleet of &quot;peleleu&quot; war-canoes in Lahaina. While there, he wrote to the last independent ruler of Kauaʻi, Kaumualiʻi, asking him to acknowledge his overlordship. Although an invasion failed in 1804, Kaumualiʻi surrendered in 1810, uniting the Hawaiian Islands for the first time. Kamehameha II resided in Lahaina from December 1819 until February 1820, when he returned to Honolulu.

==== Christian missionaries ====
American Protestant missionaries from the ABCFM arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1820, setting up stations on Hawaiʻi, Oʻahu and Kauaʻi. However, the first mission station on Maui was not established until 1823 by Reverend Charles Stewart and William Richards. The two men and their family accompanied Queen Keōpūolani, the wife of Kamehameha I, and her daughter Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena from Oʻahu to Lahaina. They were tasked with instructing the queen about Christianity, to which Keōpūolani converted on her deathbed. The missionaries erected a temporary church made of wooden poles and a thatched roof. In 1824, at the chiefs&#x27; request, Betsey Stockton started the first mission school open to common people. Maui Governor Hoapili ordered the construction of a stone church. The cornerstone of the Waiola Church (originally named Ebenezera or Waineʻe Church) was laid on September 14, 1828. In 1831, missionaries founded Lahainaluna Seminary (present-day Lahainaluna High School) where Hawaiian boys and young men (among them historian David Malo) were educated in the religion and in crafts such as carpentry, printing, engraving, and agriculture. The school published the first Hawaiian language newspaper in 1834. Teachers and students were instrumental in the translation of the Bible into Hawaiian.

==== Whaling ====
Lahaina was an important destination for 19th-century whalers who came to reprovision their ships with fresh water, fruit, potatoes and other vegetables. The town provided ample rest and recreation for their crew whose presence frequently led to conflicts with the local missionaries. On more than one occasion the conflict became so severe that sailors rioted. The British whaling ship in 1827 shelled Lahaina. In response, Governor Hoapili built the Old Lahaina Fort in 1831 to protect the town from disorderly conduct of sailors.

==== Kamehameha III ====

Kamehameha III resided in a traditional royal compound on the sacred island of Mokuʻula located on Mokuhinia lake in the middle of Lahaina from 1837 to 1845. He built a two-story, Western-style palace in 1838 named Hale Piula, although it was not completed before the court moved. During his residence, Kamehameha III signed and proclaimed the first Hawaiian constitution on October 8, 1840, at Luaʻehu, in Lahaina. The legislature&#x27;s first meeting was held on April 1, 1841, also at Luaʻehu. With the growing commercial importance of Oʻahu, Kamehameha III moved the capital to Honolulu in 1845. Hale Piula was then transformed into a courthouse until it was heavily damaged in an 1858 storm. The following year, the Old Lahaina Courthouse was built as a replacement courthouse and customhouse at a site near the old fort.

A banyan tree (&quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot;) was planted near the site of Kamehameha I&#x27;s first palace by William Owen Smith on April 24, 1873, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Christian missionaries. It survived as the oldest banyan tree in the state.

==== 20th century ====
On January 1, 1919, a major fire destroyed more than thirty buildings in Lahaina before it was extinguished by residents. The 1919 fire led to the creation of the island-wide Maui Fire Department and adoption of fire safety standards.

===21st century===
Over August 8–9, 2023, much of Lahaina was destroyed by a wildfire amid dry and windy conditions exacerbated by Hurricane Dora, with 102 fatalities occurring in the town.

In 2024, Maui County released plans for rebuilding the commercial district, infrastructure and affordable housing with a completion estimate of six years.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 16%, is water.

=== Climate ===
Lahaina town is one of the driest places in Hawaii, because it is in the rain shadow of Mauna Kahālāwai (West Maui Mountains). Many different climate zones define Lahaina&#x27;s districts. Kaanapali is north of a wind line and has double the annual rainfall and frequent breezes. Kapalua and Napili have almost four times more annual rainfall than the town.

Lahaina has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BShs&quot;) with warm temperatures year-round, fairly wet winters, and dry summers.

==Demographics==
The population of Lahaina was 12,702 as of the 2020 Census.

34.8% were Asian, 27.9% were White, 0.1% were Black or African American, 0.1% were Native American or Alaska Native, 10.5% were Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 24.7% were from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 11.5% of the population.

The population of Lahaina was 6,654 in the 1980 Census and 9,189 in the 1990 Census.

== Arts and culture ==
Before the fire, Front Street stores and restaurants attracted many visitors and was the focal point of the Lahaina Historic District. The Bailey Museum, the Lahaina Courthouse, and the Prison lined the street. The historic district included 60 historic sites managed by the Lahaina Restoration. Front Street was ranked one of the &quot;Top Ten Greatest Streets&quot; by the American Planning Association. The Banyan Court Park featured was the largest banyan tree in the United States, reaching 60 ft (18m) in height with 46 ancillary trunks covering an area of 1.94 acres (0.78 hectares).

The 1831 fort retained reconstructed remains of its walls and original cannons. Near the harbor were the historic Pioneer Inn and the Baldwin House, a historical landmark built in the 1800s.

Whale-watching excursions were a popular pastime. The humpback whale is dominant, although sightings of fin, minke, Bryde&#x27;s, blue, and North Pacific right whales have been reported.

&quot;Carthaginian II&quot; was a museum ship moored in the harbor of this former whaling port-of-call. Built in 1920 and brought to Maui in 1973, it served as a whaling museum until 2005. It was sunk in of water about offshore to create an artificial reef. It replaced an earlier replica of a whaler, &quot;Carthaginian&quot;, which was converted to film scenes for the 1966 movie &quot;Hawaii&quot;.

Hale Pai, located at Lahainaluna High School, is the site of Hawaii&#x27;s first printing press, where Hawaii&#x27;s first paper currency was printed in 1843. The &quot;L&quot; in the West Maui mountains stands for Lahainaluna High School which was built in 1904. West Maui mountain valleys are visible from town. The valleys are the backdrop for &quot;the 5 o&#x27;clock rainbow&quot; that appears almost every day.

Halloween is a major celebration celebrated in Lahaina, with crowds averaging between twenty and thirty thousand. Front Street is often closed to vehicles, followed by the &quot;Keiki Parade&quot; of costumed children. Adults in costumes join in. Halloween night in Lahaina has been termed the &quot;Mardi Gras of the Pacific&quot;. From 2008-2011 the celebration was curtailed following the objections of cultural advisers who claimed that it was an affront to Hawaiian culture, after which the County permitted the event to resume, citing economic reasons. 

==Sports==
Each November, the Lahaina Civic Center hosts the Maui Invitational, a top early-season college basketball tournament. The 2023 tournament was moved to Honolulu because of the wildfires.

The Lahaina Aquatic Center hosts swim meets and water polo. Tennis events also take place.

Lahaina hosts the finish of the Victoria to Maui Yacht Race, which starts in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. This race started in the 1960s and is held biannually.

The Plantation Course at Kapalua hosts the PGA Tour&#x27;s Sentry Tournament of Champions every January.

<text>Lāna‘i City is a census-designated place (CDP) on the island of Lāna‘i, in Maui County, Hawai‘i, United States. The population was 3,332 at the 2020 census. Lāna‘i City is the island&#x27;s commercial center. Many of the island&#x27;s restaurants and shops are in the town square that surrounds Dole Park, and the only hospital on the island, Lāna‘i Community Hospital, is located near the park.

Lāna‘i City is served by Lāna‘i Airport (LNY).

==Geography and climate==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Lāna‘i City experiences a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: As, Trewartha: Asab) with a mostly dry summer season. The average temperature in January is almost cool enough to qualify this climate as a warm-winter form of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot; or even &quot;Csb&quot;). An average monthly temperature of is the lower limit for tropical climate classification.



==History==
Lāna‘i was once the home of the pineapple plantation of entrepreneur James Drummond Dole, which spanned over and employed thousands of workers. Dole owned the entire island for a time, and in the 1920s built Lāna‘i City to house and serve the community of workers. It was the first model city in Hawai‘i. In 1923 several stores, a bank, a hospital, a theater, a church and business headquarters were built around an open park space. In 1930 model homes for couples featuring two bedrooms, a large living room, a kitchen, with running water, electricity and spacious yards were erected. The single men&#x27;s houses had three furnished rooms and also running water and electricity.

In 2009, the corporation Castle &amp; Cooke, which had been spun off from the Dole Food Company, announced its intent to demolish much of what remained of the historic district, including homes, a laundromat, and a jailhouse—all dating back to the 1920s—in order to build new commercial structures. The development would have included a supermarket described by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as &quot;oversized&quot; and &quot;out-of-scale&quot;. The intact plantation town is something not found on any of the other Hawaiian Islands.

However, in June 2012, Castle &amp; Cooke sold its island possessions (totaling 98% of the island) to billionaire Larry Ellison for $300 million.

==Demographics==

<text>Mā&#x27;alaea () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Maui County, Hawaii, United States. The population was 310 at the 2020 census. Mā‘alaea sits on the southern coast of the isthmus separating West Maui from the island’s Central Valley. Like other &quot;ahupua‘a&quot; (Hawaiian land divisions), it widens as it descends from mountain slopes into the sea, occupying 5.4 square miles of land and 2.3 miles of ocean. For more than a millennium, Mā‘alaea has been a crossroads, a landing place for Hawaiian kings and armies, and in time, whalers and sailing ships. Highways follow the ancient trails that once branched north to Wailuku (today Maui County’s governmental seat), west to Lahaina, and south to what are now the towns of Kīhei and Wailea. The name Mā‘alaea comes from the Hawaiian word &quot;‘alae,&quot; the iron oxide from volcanic eruptions that gives the region its iron-rich red earth.

==Geography==
Mā‘alaea is located at (20.809336, -156.490729).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 29.99%, is water.

== Māʻalaea History ==
Source:

The site of a 15th century fishing village, Mā‘alaea was home to a massive &quot;heiau&quot; (ceremonial site)&quot;,&quot; petroglyphs, &quot;kauhale&quot; (dwellings) and &quot;ko‘a&quot; (fishing shrines), some of which remain on the hillsides above. For the region’s earliest inhabitants, Kapoli Spring, near the present-day harbor, was the main source of fresh water in this sometimes arid land.

On January 20, 1778, Captain James Cook and the crew of &quot;H.M.S. Endeavor&quot; became the first westerners to set foot in Hawai‘i. The decades that followed saw an ever-increasing population of missionaries, seafarers, adventurers, merchants and tradesmen from around the globe. By the late 1800s, Mā‘alaea had become a major destination for travelers to Maui. A detailed 1883 map of Mā‘alaea Bay shows a wharf, a hotel and cafe, a boathouse and more.

After the 1893 overthrow of Hawai‘i’s last queen, Liliuokalani, westerners turned former kingdom lands into vast sugar and pineapple plantations. Many of the Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and other immigrants they recruited to work in the fields remained in the islands after finishing their contracts, contributing to Hawai‘i’s multicultural society.

A small fishing village sprang up in Mā‘alaea; the 1910 census showed it populated mostly by Japanese (32 individuals) and 7 Hawaiians. That same year, the Maui Dry Goods Company opened a general store in Mā‘alaea, and by 1918, a local Japanese named Yosabaru Tsuboi had acquired the business, expanding it to include a popular fish market that featured the wares of the local fishing fleet. The majority of crews on Hawai‘i’s fishing boats were of Japanese ancestry; in Mā‘alaea, they carved the likeness of the Shinto god Ebisu-Sama, the protective deity of fishermen. The  statue and shrine remain in the village to this day. So does the Mā‘alaea General Store, a Maui landmark that is still open today—and listed on the National Historic Register.

In 1929, a World War I Navy pilot named Stanley C. Kennedy constructed Maui’s first airport: a 1,500-foot-long landing field in Mā‘alaea for his newly formed Inter-Island Airways. That year, two Sikorsky amphibian planes, holding eight passengers each, flew from Honolulu to Maui in 59 minutes. With flights between Maui and O‘ahu, Lāna‘i and Moloka‘i, Mā‘alaea was once again a crossroads for travelers.

The years leading up to World War II brought surfers to Mā‘alaea Bay, enticed by its irresistible waves. Among them is the “Mā‘alaea Freight Train.” It’s considered one of the world’s fastest rideable waves, but only occurs under the right conditions.

A dozen years later, as World War II raged in Europe, the U.S. Navy sailed 130 ships into Hawaiian waters, and in the months following the Imperial Japanese Navy’s attack on Pearl Harbor, sent thousands of Marines to Maui. The Fourth Marine Division set up training areas along the island’s leeward coast and put Mā‘alaea’s mudflats to use for live-fire exercises and a demolition training camp for underwater teams, preparing them for the conditions they would find on Iwo Jima, Saipan and Tinian. The Marines who had trained at Mā‘alaea went on to defeat the Japanese Army’s 43rd Infantry Division on Saipan. Relics from the Marines’ training exercises still lie submerged off Mā‘alaea Bay.

During the war, thousands of Japanese living in America, many of them citizens, were sent to internment camps on the U.S. mainland. In the predominantly Japanese village of Mā‘alaea, Keizo Ban, manager of Kīhei General Store, was the first to be arrested. Another was Reverend Masao Arine, who held services at Mā‘alaea’s Ebisoku Jinsha shrine.

In the 1950s, Hawai‘i’s economy began a decades-long shift from sugar and pineapple to tourism. The Hale Kini O Maalaea Polynesian Motel opened in 1956, five years after the Territory’s Department of Public Works completed the Lahaina Pali (cliff) Tunnel above Mā‘alaea Village, linking Maui’s Central Valley with Lahaina. As the island’s fledgling visitor industry emerged, so did Mā‘alaea small-boat harbor as a launching place for recreational vessels and commercial fishing boats. In 1968, the Coast Guard started stationing its cutter &quot;Cape Newagen&quot; there. A year later, Hollywood’s Mirisch Productions came to Mā‘alaea to film &quot;The Hawaiians.&quot; Based on the James Michener book, the movie starred Charlton Heston and Geraldine Chaplin.

By the 1980s, big ideas were in the air for the village and its environs: a national marine sanctuary for humpback whales, a much-debated harbor expansion, and commercial centers. These and many more proposed projects led to the creation of the Ma‘alaea Community Association in 1988. In its twenty-eight years, the MCA’s long list of initiatives and projects left a lasting legacy in the community.

More changes came to Mā‘alaea in the 1990s. The establishment of the Maui Ocean Center, the Pacific Whale Foundation’s headquarters and Mā‘alaea Village Shops would transform the quaint village into a must-see visitor attraction. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Oceans Act that established the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. A second refuge opened at Mā‘alaea’s Keālia Pond, protecting the endangered Hawaiian stilt, Hawaiian coot, Hawaiian monk seal, and two species of Hawaiian sea turtles.

In 1994, the state’s new trails program, Nā Ala Hele, began restoring the serpentine Lahaina Pali Trail, connecting Lahaina and Mā‘alaea along slopes containing 18 historic sites, including ancient rock walls and petroglyphs. The MCA ceased activities in 2016, and was replaced the next year by the newly incorporated Mā‘alaea Village Association, whose purpose, in part, is to protect the region’s environment, from its upland watershed to its coastal waters.

<doc id="110588" wikidata="Q2087831" url="?curid=110588" title="Wailuku, Hawaii">
<text>Wailuku is a census-designated place (CDP) in and county seat of Maui Island, Maui County, Hawaii, United States. The population was 17,697 at the 2020 census.

Wailuku is located just west of Kahului, at the mouth of the Iao Valley. In the early 20th century Wailuku was the main tourist destination on Maui, though it has since been eclipsed with the rise of the resort towns such as Kaanapali.

Historic sites in the town include Kaʻahumanu Church (named after Queen Kaʻahumanu, wife of Kamehameha I) which dates to 1876, the Wailuku Civic Center Historic District, the site of the Chee Kung Tong Society Building, and the Bailey House, a 19th-century former seminary and home that houses a history museum and the Maui Historical Society.

There are two ancient temples near Wailuku, called — the Halekiʻi Heiau and the Pihanakalani Heiau. Both date back hundreds of years and were used for religious purposes by the native Hawaiians.

Wailuku is served by Kahului Airport.

== Geography ==
Wailuku is located at (20.891923, -156.502177) between the CDPs of Waihee-Waiehu to the north, Kahului to the east, and Waikapu to the south.

The town is situated at above sea level, at the base of West Maui Volcano, known historically as Mauna Kahalawai and Hale Mahina, on the northern edge of the isthmus of East Maui (Haleakalā) and West Maui.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.16%, is water.

The three moku or districts of west Maui are Lāhaina, Kāʻanapali, and Wailuku. Wailuku is also known as Pūʻalikomohana, or Nā Wai ʻEhā which means the four waters. The four waters are the ahupuaʻa (smaller land division than district), which are Waikapū, Wailuku, Waiʻehu, and Waiheʻe.

== History ==
Home to Maui&#x27;s most famous Hawaiian rulers, site of Kamehameha&#x27;s decisive 1790 victory at the Battle of Kepaniwai in the Iao Valley, location of the 19th century Mission Station and birthplace of the mighty sugar industry, Wailuku illustrates the powerful influences which shaped the town, the island and the state.

The area was a center of power and population in pre-historic Hawaii. In the mid-1800s it was irrevocably changed when New England missionaries brought their religious beliefs, western skills and implements and new agricultural methods. By the 1860s the Wailuku Sugar Company (owned by C. Brewer &amp; Co.) and other plantations were busy growing and milling sugarcane. Miles of ditches were dug, bringing irrigation water from deep in the mountains to the vast fields of central Maui, and the sugar industry flourished, to the detriment of the native people.

Thousands of skilled and unskilled workers immigrated to Maui from all parts of the world to toil in the fields and factories. They came from China, Japan, Okinawa, Korea, the Philippines, Europe, America – bringing ethnic, cultural and religious diversity to their new home. Many settled in Wailuku, where houses, schools, churches, temples, shops, banks and community buildings were built to meet the needs of the thriving company town.

In 1905, Wailuku was designated Maui&#x27;s County Seat, and it soon became a hub of government, business and entertainment, boasting vaudeville and movie theatres, bowling alley, hotels, poi factory, ice and soda works, and many markets and offices. Thus began the era of growth which continued until the late 1960s when the sugar industry, losing its economic prosperity, reduced operations and the development of alternative commercial centers drew business away from Wailuku&#x27;s downtown streets.

Many private and public buildings have architectural and historical significance. Beyond this stylish neighborhood are the narrow lanes where modest bungalow, amidst colorful gardens, preserve the flavor of old Wailuku. On upper Main Street (the road to Iao Valley), are remnants of the missionary era. A tiny graveyard contains tombstones of Hawaiian Ali’i (royalty) and missionary families. Further uphill are the Alexander House and Bailey House, now an excellent museum displaying ancient Hawaiian artifacts and missionary period rooms, and office of the Maui Historical society. A turn on Ilina Street to the top of Vineyard Street brings you to an interesting cemetery with lovely views of the Iao Valley and West Maui Mountains.

Follow Vineyard downhill through a charming neighborhood clustered around the Iao Congregational Church. The mature trees, varied architecture and serene vistas recreate the atmosphere of bygone days. As you approach the center of town, new buildings mingle with old, and former residences or commercial buildings have been rehabilitated for modern uses, keeping the colorful appearance of the past. In the business district, where false fronts and art deco facades stand shoulder to shoulder, sidewalks are shaded by canopies, inviting you to stroll and explore the charms of Old Wailuku Town.

In the Hawaiian tongue Wailuku means literally &quot;destroying water.&quot; The Hawaiian god Kāne is considered to be the procreator and the provider of life. He is associated with wai (fresh water) as well as clouds, rain, streams and springs. Kanaloa, the Hawaiian god of the underworld, is represented by the phallic stone of the ʻĪao Needle.

Kapawa, the king of Hawaiʻi prior to Pili, was buried here. Maui&#x27;s ruler Kakaʻe, in the late 15th century, designated ʻĪao Valley as an aliʻi burial ground. The remains were buried in secret places. In 1790, the Battle of Kepaniwai took place there, in which Kamehameha the Great defeated Kalanikūpule and the Maui army during his campaign to unify the islands. The battle was said to be so bloody that dead bodies blocked ʻĪao Stream, and the battle site was named Kepaniwai (&quot;the damming of the waters&quot;).

<doc id="110593" wikidata="Q1085274" url="?curid=110593" title="Meridian, Idaho">
<text>Meridian is a city located in Ada County, Idaho, United States. The population was 117,635 at the 2020 census, making it the 2nd most populous city in the county and Idaho after Boise, the state capital. Meridian is considered the state&#x27;s fastest-growing city and among the fastest-growing cities in the United States.

==History==
The town was established in 1891 on the Onweiler farm north of the present site and was called Hunter. Two years later an I.O.O.F. lodge was organized and called itself Meridian because it was located on the Boise Meridian and the town was renamed. The Settlers&#x27; Irrigation Ditch, 1892, changed the arid region into a productive farming community which was incorporated in 1902.

Meridian was incorporated in 1903. The information in the following sections (Irrigation, Village, Rail Transportation, and Creamery) is found on the displays in the Meridian City Hall Plaza.

===Irrigation (1890– )===
Early settlers arriving in the area came with no knowledge of gravity flow irrigation. Their previous homes were in areas where rain provided the needed moisture to raise crops. Irrigation soon became a necessity, since having a water source was a requirement for receiving the patent for the land from the U.S. Land Office. Irrigation districts, such as the Nampa-Meridian and Settlers irrigation districts, continue to serve the immediate Meridian area.

===Village (1903–41)===
The original Meridian town site was filed in 1893 on homestead grant land belonging to Eliza Ann Zenger. Her husband, Christian, filed the plat with county officials and called it Meridian. The early settlers, many of whom were relatives, left their homes in Missouri to go west, either by wagon, train, or immigrant railroad car, bringing their lodge and church preferences with them. They established local institutions soon after arriving and filed for homestead lands.

Around the start of the 20th century, settlers established fruit orchards and built fruit packing businesses and prune dryers along the railroad tracks. Local orchards produced many varieties of apples and Italian prunes. Production continued through the mid-1940s when it was no longer profitable and the businesses closed. In 1941, Meridian&#x27;s status changed from a village to a city.

===Rail transportation (1908–28)===
Following the raising of $4,000 to lay the Interurban rail line from Onweiler (Meridian and Ustick Roads), the tracks were completed into the village center. Turning east on Broadway and ending at East Second, the last car would spend the night in Meridian before returning to Boise early the next morning with passengers and freight. The interurban Station and Generator building (west one-third of the old library at Meridian and Idaho Streets) was built in 1912, and the line continued on to Nampa via Meridian. The tracks down Broadway were not used after 1912. The Interurban Company entered into receivership and closed in 1928 after 20 years of providing continuous transportation to neighboring towns. It was Meridian&#x27;s main connection to the area outside the local community.

The Union Pacific Railroad spur opened in 1900 and is currently operated by the Boise Valley Railroad. Many industrial customers continue to ship forest, agricultural, and chemical products along this corridor.

===Creamery (1929–70)===
The lowest days of the Great Depression brightened for area dairymen when the Ada County Dairymen&#x27;s cooperative creamery began operation in 1929. It provided milk checks to those who were members of the cooperative, enabling them to pay their taxes and provide food for their families. Other community members hauled milk to the creamery and were employed by the creamery, whose product was Challenge Butter.

The creamery ran 7 days a week for 40 years. Additions and improvements were made while the plant was in full operation. Later years saw the Wyeth Laboratories affiliate with the creamery to manufacture SMA baby formula.

After the creamery ceased local operations in 1970, the dairymen shipped their milk to the Caldwell creamery for processing.

<text>New Meadows is a rural city in Adams County, Idaho, United States, at the southern and upper end of the Meadows Valley, on the Little Salmon River. Located in the west central part of the state, just south of the 45th parallel, the population was 496 at the 2010 census, down from 533 in 2000. New Meadows is located at the junction of the primary north–south highway in the state, U.S. Route 95, and State Highway 55, which connects it with McCall and Boise.

==History==

Prior to the establishment of Adams County in 1911, Meadows was in Washington County; &quot;The Meadows Eagle&quot; newspaper served the community, and C. A. Hackney was the publisher.

The Pacific and Idaho Northern (PIN) Railroad ran from Weiser to an area about from Meadows, the site of modern-day New Meadows founded in 1911. The city of New Meadows hosts the last surviving remnants of the PIN; without the railroad, New Meadows would arguably not have existed.

The depot was built in 1910 and served as the northern end of the PIN Railroad. It is a significant cultural and historical resource in the Payette River Scenic Byway corridor in the city of New Meadows, at the junction of US-95 and state highway 55. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The depot is an asset for the community of New Meadows and currently functions as a community center for the local area. It hosted the Barn Again! Smithsonian Institution traveling exhibition in 2005, and represents early twentieth century efforts to create a north–south railroad for Idaho. Though the efforts ultimately failed, the PIN Railroad served an important function as a &quot;farm-to-market&quot; railroad until 1940, and then as a timber railroad for local timber outfits.

The Union Pacific acquired the line in 1936 and in 1979 abandoned the northern end of the line, from the Tamarack sawmill site north of Council to New Meadows, along US-95. The depot was a functioning facility until 1972. In 1978, ACHS acquired the title to the PIN Depot to preserve it as a repository for the history of Adams County. Since 2000, the building has been preserved from immediate deterioration; the foundation has been restored and the building has a new roof.

==Education==
The only school in New Meadows is the Meadows Valley School, which houses all thirteen grades, K-12. The school mascot is the mountaineer, and the school colors are orange and black.

==Recreation==
Two established alpine ski areas, Brundage Mountain and the Little Ski Hill are less than to the east, both on the west side of the Valley/Adams county line. The MeadowCreek golf resort (originally &quot;Kimberland Meadows&quot;) is a few miles northwest of town. Payette Lake and the surrounding areas in McCall offer numerous recreational opportunities, and further north along US-95 is Riggins, the gateway to the Salmon River and the Seven Devils Mountains. north of New Meadows is Zim&#x27;s Hot Springs.

==Highways==
* - U.S. Route 95
* - State Highway 55 - &quot;Payette River Scenic Byway&quot;

New Meadows is approximately north of Boise, accessed via State Highway 55, the &quot;Payette River Scenic Byway,&quot; a designated national scenic byway. It heads north from Eagle in Ada County to Horseshoe Bend in Boise County, and climbs the whitewater of the Payette River to Cascade and McCall in Valley County. The route turns west at Payette Lake in McCall and ends at New Meadows at the junction with U.S. Route 95.

<text>Pocatello () is the county seat and largest city of Bannock County, with a small portion on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in neighboring Power County, containing the city&#x27;s airport. It is the principal city of the Pocatello metropolitan area, which encompasses all of Bannock County in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Idaho.

As of the 2020 census, the population of Pocatello was 56,320. Pocatello is the 6th most populous city in the state, just behind Caldwell.

The city is at an elevation of above sea level and it sits on the Portneuf River in the Snake River Plain ecoregion. Pocatello covers a land area of .

Pocatello is the home of Idaho State University and the manufacturing facilities of Amy&#x27;s Kitchen and ON Semiconductor Corporation; it is served by the Pocatello Regional Airport.

==History==


===Indigenous tribes===
Shoshone and Bannock Indigenous tribes inhabited southeastern Idaho for hundreds of years before the Lewis and Clark Expedition across Idaho in 1805. The expedition&#x27;s reports of the many riches of the region attracted fur trappers and traders to southeastern Idaho. The city is named after Chief Pocatello, a 19th-century Northern Shoshone leader.

===Permanent settlements===

Nathaniel Wyeth of Massachusetts established one of the first permanent settlements at Fort Hall in 1834, which is only a few miles northeast of Pocatello. When over-trapping and a shift in fashion to silk hats put an end to the fur trade, Fort Hall became a supply point for immigrants traveling the Oregon Trail.

Although thousands of immigrants passed through Idaho, it was not until the discovery of gold in 1860 that Idaho attracted settlers in large numbers. The gold rush brought a need for goods and services to many towns, and the Portneuf Valley, home of Pocatello, was the corridor initially used by stage and freight lines. The coming of the railroad provided further development of Idaho&#x27;s mineral resources and &quot;Pocatello junction&quot; became an important transportation crossroads as the Union Pacific Railroad expanded its service.

===Gate City===
After its founding in 1889, Pocatello became known as the &quot;Gate City&quot; for being a gateway to Idaho and the Pacific Northwest. As pioneers, gold miners and settlers traveled the Oregon Trail, they passed through the Portneuf Gap south of town. Stage and freight lines and the railroad soon followed, turning the community into a trade center and transportation junction.
===Gold rush and agriculture===
After the gold rush played out, the settlers who remained turned to agriculture. With the help of irrigation from the nearby Snake River, the region became a large supplier of potatoes, grain and other crops. Residential and commercial development gradually appeared by 1882.

===Alameda consolidation===
The adjacent city of Alameda was consolidated into Pocatello in 1962, Chubbuck, further north, opposed a similar merger and remained a separate municipality. In the 1960 census, Alameda had a population of 10,660 and Pocatello was at 28,534; the consolidation made Pocatello the state&#x27;s largest city based on those numbers, passing Boise and Idaho Falls.

===Flag===
The Pocatello flag used from 2001 to 2017 was considered by the North American Vexillological Association to be the worst city flag in North America. In April 2016, the city&#x27;s newly created flag design committee met for the first time. Attending the meeting was Roman Mars whose 2015 TED Talk had made Pocatello&#x27;s flag infamous. On July 20, 2017, after a year and a half of work by the flag committee, the Pocatello City Council approved the adoption of a new flag with the informal name of &quot;Mountains Left&quot; out of a total of 709 designs.

==Geography==

A main water feature of Pocatello is the Portneuf River, which runs southeast to northwest on the western side of the city. Since 1992, the city and the Portneuf Greenway Foundation have worked to create a system of trails that follow the river and connect to other trails in the greater Portneuf Valley. Currently, 15+ miles of trails have been constructed with 27 planned total miles.

<text>Montpelier is a city in Bear Lake County, Idaho, United States. The population was 2,643 at the 2020 census. The city is the largest community in the Bear Lake Valley, a farming region north of Bear Lake in southeastern Idaho along the Utah border. It was settled in 1863 by Mormon pioneers on the route of the Oregon Trail. Nearby to the east is the border with Wyoming.

==History==
As happened for many western towns, the name has been changed numerous times. First it was known as Clover Creek by Oregon Trail travelers, later it became Belmont and finally was given the name Montpelier by Brigham Young, one of the early leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), after the capital of his birth state of Vermont. The city was first settled in 1864.

The Oregon Short Line Railway started in Granger, Wyoming from the existing Union Pacific station, and reached Montpelier on August 5, 1882 (the rail line reached Huntington, Oregon in 1884). The terminal was located here until 1972. The railroad brought a population that made Montpelier the county&#x27;s &quot;Gentile Town&quot; as opposed to nearby Mormon-run Paris that was the county seat. Both cities would have tabernacles built in their city limits.

U.S. Routes 89 and 30 intersect in Montpelier.

On August 13, 1896, the Bank of Montpelier was the site of a heist by Butch Cassidy and members of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch, Elzy Lay and Henry &quot;Bub&quot; Meeks, who were supposedly trying to get enough money to bail out fellow gang member Matt Warner. They escaped with roughly $7,000. This historical footnote has become a notable component of the town&#x27;s identity and is commemorated by a plaque on Washington Street (Highway 89). 

On 3 April 2022, LDS Prophet Russell M. Nelson announced that an LDS Temple would be built in Montpelier.

==Arts and culture==
The National Oregon/California Trail Center in Montpelier is an interactive interpretive center dedicated to the history of the trails that ran through the town.

<text>St. Charles or Saint Charles is a city in southern Bear Lake County, Idaho, United States, that is located near the northwestern shore of Bear Lake. Its population was 131 at the 2010 census, down from 156 in 2000.

==Description==
Ranching and recreation are the major influences on the community. Its small population live in houses scattered through a number of blocks of rustic streets interspersed with fields and agricultural buildings. A number of summer homes for visitors to the lake have added to the community. St. Charles sits at the mouth of St. Charles Canyon, a scenic inlet into the neighboring mountains, where hiking and camping opportunities are available.

==History==
St. Charles was settled in May 1864 by Mormon pioneers. As did most Mormon communities along the Idaho–Utah border, early settlers believed they were in the Territory of Utah. In 1864, the Utah territorial legislature created Richland County (shortened to Rich in 1868) for the Bear Lake Valley settlements, designating St. Charles as its county seat. The 1870 Decennial Census of the United States listed St. Charles and 10 other Idaho Bear Lake Valley settlements under Rich County, Utah.

But when the official survey of the Idaho–Utah line was completed on February 15, 1872, it placed St. Charles and the rest of the northern Bear Lake Valley settlements in Oneida County, Idaho Territory.

The area developed as an agricultural community, and the population was never substantial. In the 20th century it began to attract tourists and persons seeking a recreation area. Some second homes and retirement homes have been built here, but the population has declined.

==Notable residents==
Sculptor Gutzon Borglum (1867–1941) was born in St. Charles to Danish immigrant parents. He is best known for his sculptured portraits of American presidents carved in the stone of Mount Rushmore.

<text>Blackfoot is a city and county seat of Bingham County, Idaho, United States. The population was 12,346 at the 2020 census. Blackfoot is the principal city of the Blackfoot, Idaho, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Bingham County.

==History==

The city of Blackfoot is located near the center of Bingham County, on the south side of the Snake River. It was designated the county seat by the Thirteenth Territorial Legislature on January 13, 1885. Originally, the county seat was to be Eagle Rock (the original name for Idaho Falls). However, supposedly, on the night before the legislation was to be signed, men from Blackfoot bribed a clerk to erase Eagle Rock and write in Blackfoot. The measure went through without opposition and was signed by the governor. The origin of this accusation, written many years after the event, was a Blackfoot newspaper editor named Byrd Trego. The battle for county seat between Eagle Rock and Blackfoot was a political tug-of-war involving sectional and anti-Mormon factions in the Idaho Legislature. The leader of the southeastern Idaho anti-Mormons was a Yale graduate named Fred Dubois, who settled in Blackfoot in 1880. The legislative maneuvering to overturn Eagle Rock as the county seat naturally left &quot;disparaging rumors intimating some skullduggery on Blackfoot’s part.&quot;

Frederick S. Stevens and Joe Warren were the first permanent white settlers of record in Bingham County. In 1866, Stevens and Warren filed claims in the Snake River Valley near the present-day location of Blackfoot, where they started farming and ranching. The area was a flat, expansive plain of sagebrush frequented by Indians. To create a place of safety for the scattered settlers when they feared Indian trouble, Mr. Warren outfitted his cabin with holes between the logs where men could stand guard, day or night, until the natives left the neighborhood. When the Utah and Northern Railway signed contracts to expand north into Idaho in the 1870s, some of the settlers laid out a town on the Shilling and Lewis homesteads. The planned town, named Blackfoot, which was what the area had been called by fur traders, was near the Corbett stage station, about a mile from the Snake River, and two miles from the Blackfoot River.

Civil War veteran William Edward Wheeler, from Vermont, was an early settler. On July 1, 1880, Wheeler began publishing a newspaper called the &quot;Blackfoot Register.&quot; The first issue described the businesses in operation in Blackfoot on the publication date: &quot;four general merchandise stores, one jewelry store, a livery stable, four saloons, a hotel, one meat market, two blacksmith shops, one barber shop and one lumber yard.&quot; Henry W. Curtis opened the first hardware store in 1885.

The first issue of the &quot;Blackfoot Register&quot; also described &quot;a ditch being dug from the Blackfoot River that would irrigate several thousand acres.&quot; It was their plan to bring the water into town so residents could grow gardens and plant trees. The goal was finally realized in 1886 when Alfred Moyes planted the first shade trees in the Upper Snake River Plain around the Blackfoot Courthouse. Others in town followed suit and within a few years Blackfoot&#x27;s tree-lined streets had a reputation that earned the nickname &quot;Grove City.&quot; Sightseeing excursions from the surrounding area were reportedly organized so they could &quot;feast their eyes on this verdure,&quot; which stood in pleasant, stark contrast with the endless acres of dry, gray sagebrush.

==Geography==

<text>Shelley is a city in Bingham County, Idaho, United States. The population was 4,409 at the 2010 census.

Since 1927 Shelley has been home to the &quot;Idaho Annual Spud Day&quot;, which is celebrated on the 3rd Saturday of September. It typically features a parade, live bands, a Spud Tug, a spud-picking Contest, and free baked potatoes.

==History==
Shelley was established in 1904. It was named for John F. Shelley, who moved to the area in 1892. He&#x27;d moved to the area intending to open a small store, and needed lumber and other supplies to build it. Since the site was some distance from the nearest existing community, he asked the railroad company to make a special stop to offload the supplies he&#x27;d ordered. They consented, provided he could offload the supplies in under 20 minutes. His daughter, Lottie, wrote the following in her personal history: 
On September 4, 1902 a large fire destroyed seven buildings on State Street. Only two buildings, a general merchandise store and Nalder&#x27;s furniture store, were saved. Soren Yorgesen, a local Justice of the Peace and proprietor of the first hotel in Shelley recounts the experience as follows:

This fully paved trail, a collaborative project between Shelley and Bingham County, follows the Snake River for 2 miles before terminating at North Bingham County Park. The trail includes picnic tables, benches, and activities for families throughout.

==Idaho Annual Spud Day==

In September, 1927, Shelley hosted its first Spud Day (Now called The Idaho Spud Day), now a yearly tradition usually taking place on the third Saturday each September. During this first Spud day, 10,000 people were served hot baked potatoes with butter. This tradition continues each year, along with several other events. These events have included a parade that features the various clubs and bands of the schools in the area, as well as local businesses and groups. Other events include the spud tug - where teams play a game of tug of war over a pit of mashed potatoes blended together in a cement truck, spud run - a set of 1-mile and 5k races, concerts, fairground booths and games, and a demolition derby hosted at nearby North Bingham County Park.

<doc id="110620" wikidata="Q1516909" url="?curid=110620" title="Bellevue, Idaho">
<text>Bellevue is a city in Blaine County in the central part of the U.S. state of Idaho. The population was 2,287 at the 2010 census, up from 1,876 in 2000.

It is located in the Wood River Valley, about south of the resort area of Ketchum and Sun Valley. The city of Hailey and the Friedman Memorial Airport are a few miles north of Bellevue. The Big Wood River flows near downtown.

The Bellevue Historic District and the Henry Miller House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The Bellevue area was explored by fur trader Alexander Ross in 1824.

Bellevue was settled and chartered in 1882. The city is located on a mile-wide plateau noted for its rich soil suitable for fruit growing. The nearby lands are also rich with resources, and Bellevue grew as a mining town. Between 1881 and the 1893 crash of the silver market, the mines near Bellevue produced more than $60 million worth of silver, lead and gold. Some of Bellevue&#x27;s mines included Keystone, Palmas, Antelope, Big Camus, Phoenix, Paymaster, Silver Tide, and Monday Mine.

The community soon had two newspapers, &quot;The Bellevue Daily Sun&quot; and &quot;The Bellevue Chronicle&quot;. In 1880, the Bellevue M.E. Church was established, as was Bellevue IOOF Lodge No. 9. The International Hotel was built at Main and Oak, and could accommodate 75 guests. A mining smelter was also constructed.

From 1889 to 1895, it was the county seat of the short-lived Logan County.

A devastating fire engulfed the city&#x27;s business district in 1905, started when the Seymour Saloon&#x27;s bartender lit a match to investigate a gasoline leak. In 1957, windows in Bellevue were shattered and the city was rocked when 8 tons of dynamite and 56 rounds of artillery shells accidentally detonated at a mine west of the city.

The Wood River Rock Festival took place in 1971 in nearby Slaughterhouse Gulch. The festival was plagued by faulty sound equipment, cold weather, inadequate facilities, poor attendance, and grasshoppers. Eight people were arrested for drug possession, and three for drunk driving.

In 2003, Bellevue was the location of the murders of Diane and Alan Scott Johnson. In 2012, Jon Anderson, a former mayor of Bellevue, committed a murder-suicide, killing his ex-wife and then himself.

In 2009, Bellevue&#x27;s city clerk, Lacey Ann Loughmiller, was sentenced to 180 days in jail after being convicted of embezzling almost $14,000 from the city.

<doc id="110623" wikidata="Q1519069" url="?curid=110623" title="Ketchum, Idaho">
<text>Ketchum is a city in Blaine County, Idaho, United States. Located in the central part of the state, the population was 3,555 at the 2020 census, up from 2,689 in 2010. Located in the Wood River Valley, Ketchum is adjacent to Sun Valley and the communities share many resources: both sit in the same valley beneath Bald Mountain, with its skiing. The city also draws tourists to its fishing, hiking, trail riding, tennis, shopping, art galleries, and more. The airport for Ketchum, Friedman Memorial Airport, is approximately south in Hailey.

==History==

Originally the smelting center of the Warm Springs mining district, the town was first named Leadville in 1880. The postal department decided that was too common and renamed it for David Ketchum, a local trapper and guide who had staked a claim in the basin a year earlier. Smelters were built in the 1880s, with the Philadelphia Smelter, located on Warm Springs Road, processing large amounts of lead and silver for about a decade.

After the mining boom subsided in the 1890s, sheepmen from the south drove their flocks north through Ketchum in the summer, to graze in the upper elevation areas of the Pioneer, Boulder, and Sawtooth mountains. By 1920, Ketchum had become the largest sheep-shipping center in the West. In the fall, massive flocks of sheep flowed south into the town&#x27;s livestock corrals at the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s railhead, which connected to the main line at Shoshone.

After the development of Sun Valley by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1936, Ketchum became popular with celebrities, including Gary Cooper and Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway loved the surrounding area; he fished, hunted, and in the late 1950s bought a home overlooking the Big Wood River near the city. It was there he committed suicide; he and his wife Mary, his granddaughter, model and actress Margaux Hemingway, are buried in the Ketchum Cemetery. The local elementary school is named in his honor.

Every Labor Day weekend, Ketchum hosts the Wagon Days festival, a themed carnival featuring Old West wagon trains, narrow ore wagons, and a parade.

The Clint Eastwood film &quot;Pale Rider&quot; (1985) was partially filmed in the Boulder Mountains near Ketchum.

Ketchum is referenced in the song &quot;Ketchum, ID&quot; by indie rock band boygenius.

<text>Sun Valley is a resort city in the western United States, in Blaine County, Idaho, adjacent to the city of Ketchum in the Wood River valley. The population was 1,783 at the 2020 census. The elevation of Sun Valley (at the Lodge) is above sea level.

Among skiers, the term &quot;Sun Valley&quot; refers to the alpine ski area, which consists of Bald Mountain, the main ski mountain adjacent to Ketchum. Dollar Mountain, which is adjacent to Sun Valley, is suited for novice and lower intermediate skiers. Bald Mountain, or &quot;Baldy&quot;, best suited for intermediate to advanced and expert skiers, has a summit of and a vertical drop of . The treeless &quot;Dollar&quot; at has a moderate vertical drop of .

The term &quot;Sun Valley&quot; is used more generally to speak of the region surrounding the city, including the neighboring city of Ketchum and the Wood River Valley area winding south to Hailey and Bellevue. The region has been a seasonal home to the rich and famous since first being brought to public attention by Ernest Hemingway in the late 1930s.

Scheduled passenger airline service is available at Friedman Memorial Airport (SUN) in Hailey, approximately south. Visitors are relatively close to the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, accessed over Galena Summit on State Highway 75, the &quot;Sawtooth Scenic Byway&quot;.

==History==
===Union Pacific Railroad (1936–64)===
The first destination winter resort in the U.S. was developed by W. Averell Harriman, the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, primarily to increase ridership on U.P. passenger trains in the Western United States. The UP&#x27;s &quot;City of Portland&quot; (from Chicago and Omaha) and &quot;Portland Rose&quot; (from Kansas City) went to Shoshone in southern Idaho, where buses (then called &quot;motor coaches&quot;) took travelers to Sun Valley. Sleeping car passengers from Los Angeles were able to take direct carriages on the UP&#x27;s &quot;Pony Express&quot; from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City, and the &quot;Sun Valley Special&quot; from Salt Lake City to Sun Valley.

The success of the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, spurred an increase in participation in winter sports (and alpine skiing in particular). A lifelong skier, Harriman determined that America would embrace a destination mountain resort, similar to those enjoyed in the Swiss Alps, such as St. Moritz and Davos.

During the winter of 1935–36, Harriman enlisted the services of an Austrian Sportsman, Count Felix von Schaffgotsch, to travel across the Western U.S. to locate an ideal site for a winter resort. The Count toured Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Yosemite, the San Bernardino Mountains, Zion, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Wasatch Range, Pocatello, Jackson Hole, and Grand Targhee areas. 

Late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development, he backtracked toward the Ketchum area in central Idaho. A U.P. employee in Boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to Ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the Count went to explore.

Schaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of Bald Mountain and its surrounding mountains, adequate snowfall, abundant sunshine, moderate elevation, and absence of wind, and selected it as the site. Harriman visited several weeks later and agreed. The Brass Ranch was purchased for about $4 per acre and construction commenced that spring; it was built in seven months for $1.5 million. Publicist Steve Hannagan named the resort &quot;Sun Valley&quot; and developed the tag line: &quot;Winter sports under a summer sun&quot;. (Count Schaffgotsch returned to Austria and was killed on the Eastern Front during World War II.) The centerpiece of the new resort was the Sun Valley Lodge, which opened on December 21, 1936.

The 220-room, X-shaped lodge&#x27;s exterior was constructed of concrete, poured inside rough-sawn forms. The wood grain was impressed on the concrete finish, which was acid-stained brown to imitate wood. The Swiss-style Sun Valley Inn (originally the &quot;Challenger Inn&quot;) and village were also part of the initial resort, opening in 1937. Hannagan wanted swimming pools at the resort, &quot;so people won&#x27;t think skiing is too cold.&quot;

Both the Lodge and the Inn have heated outdoor swimming pools, circular in shape. Hannagan had the pools designed this way, unique at the time, in the hope they would be widely photographed, providing free publicity, and it worked.
====Chairlifts====

The world&#x27;s first chairlifts were installed on the resort&#x27;s Proctor and Dollar mountains in the fall of 1936. (Proctor Mountain is northeast of Dollar Mountain). They have since been removed, but parts of the base of the Proctor Mountain chairlift can still be seen near the Proctor Mountain trail, along with a plaque identifying the area as the location of the world&#x27;s first chairlift. Additionally, the original lift operator&#x27;s station (now repainted) for the chairlift on Dollar Mountain is still standing. One of the early single chairlifts was transported to Cordova, Alaska in the 1970s where it now serves Mount Eyak Ski Area as the oldest operating charlift in the world. The U.P. chairlift design was adapted by an engineer recalling banana loading conveyor equipment used for tropical fruit ships&#x27; cargo. Single-seat chairlifts were developed at the U.P. headquarters in Omaha in the summer of 1936. The chairlift went on to replace primitive rope tow and other adaptations seen at ski areas at the time. The original Proctor Mountain Ski Lift is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Celebrities====
Author Ernest Hemingway completed &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; while staying in suite 206 of the Lodge in the fall of 1939. Averell Harriman had invited Hemingway and other celebrities, primarily from Hollywood, to the resort to help promote it.

Gary Cooper was a frequent visitor and hunting/fishing partner, as were Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Lucille Ball, Marilyn Monroe, and several members of the Kennedy family. Hemingway was a part-time resident over the next twenty years, eventually relocating to Ketchum (&quot;Papa&quot; and his fourth wife are buried in the Ketchum Cemetery). The Hemingway Memorial, dedicated in 1966, is just off Trail Creek Road, about a mile northeast of the Sun Valley Lodge. You can still visit a number of locations that have Hemingway ties, including the Ketchum Cemetery.

Sun Valley was featured (and promoted) in the 1941 movie &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;, starring Sonja Henie, John Payne, Milton Berle, and bandleader Glenn Miller. Scenes were shot at the resort in March 1941. Sun Valley transfer local and future gold medalist Gretchen Fraser was the skiing stand-in for Henie.

In February 1958, the cast of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; filmed an episode of their follow-up series of hour-long specials, known in syndication as &quot;The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, at Bald Mountain.

In 1971, &quot;Apollo 15&quot; astronaut and avid skier Jim Irwin, when stepping upon the surface of the Moon&#x27;s Hadley–Apennine, exclaimed that it was like Sun Valley.

Adam West who played Batman on television had a ranch in the area. Other notable residents have included Scott Glenn, Richard Dreyfuss, Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke and Janet Leigh.

Sun Valley&#x27;s oldest resident was former actress and silent movie star Barbara Kent. Another resident was actress Ann Sothern.

Hollywood actor, politician, and businessman, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a frequent visitor of Sun Valley and owns a residence in Ketchum, ID. He has a ski run named after him.

====World War II====
During World War II, the resort was closed in 1942 and converted to a convalescent hospital for the U.S. Navy (Pacific Theater), which was operational in July 1943. It re-opened to the public in December 1946.

After the war, the resort&#x27;s clinic operated on the third floor of the northern wing of the Sun Valley Lodge (wing closest to the Trail Creek Rd.) until the Sun Valley Community Hospital was built in 1961. That facility was named after Dr. John Moritz when he retired in 1973; the Nebraska-born surgeon had served as the resort&#x27;s year-round physician for 33 years. The Moritz Hospital was closed shortly after the new St. Luke&#x27;s branch hospital opened (south of Ketchum) in November 2000 and the Moritz building now serves as employee housing.

===Bill Janss (1964–77)===
After World War II, Harriman focused on his career in government service and the Union Pacific gradually lost interest in the resort. Rail service to Ketchum was discontinued in 1964 and that November the resort was sold to the Janss Investment Company, a major southern California real estate developer, headed by a former Olympic ski team member, Bill Janss (1918–96), founder of Snowmass. (Janss was an alternate on the 1940 team, but the games were cancelled due to the war). The railroad&#x27;s management had called in the Janss Corporation as consultants and it was determined that it would take a lot of work and no less than $6 million for a face-lifting. The Union Pacific decided to sell and brothers Ed and Bill Janss bid just under $3 million.

During this Janss era of ownership, the north-facing Warm Springs area was developed, as well as Seattle Ridge, and condominium and home construction increased significantly. Seven chairlifts were added, and the number of trails increased from 33 to 62. The first two double chairs on Warm Springs were installed in series in 1965; the upper &quot;Limelight&quot; had a vertical rise, the greatest in the U.S. at the time for a chairlift.

Bill Janss bought out his brother&#x27;s share of the resort and gained full control of Sun Valley in 1968. Snowmaking was introduced on a limited basis in the fall of 1975, covering up to an elevation of 

The original Seattle Ridge double chairlift was installed in 1976, but due to a very poor snow year in 1976–77 it was not operated until December 20, 1977, christened by local legend Gretchen Fraser. Janss also has a ski run named after him, called &quot;Janss Pass&quot;, to the skier&#x27;s left of the Frenchman&#x27;s chairlift. Janss&#x27; wife Ann, age 54, died in early 1973 while helicopter skiing near Sun Valley.

Later that year, Janss married Mrs. Glenn Cooper, a widow, family friend, and mother of five, including World Cup racer Christin Cooper, silver medalist in the women&#x27;s giant slalom at the 1984 Winter Olympics.

Under Janss&#x27; ownership, the Elkhorn area southeast of Dollar Mountain was developed by the Sun Valley Company and Johns-Manville, beginning in 1972.

During excavation, ancient tools dating back nearly 7,000 years were discovered. Elkhorn&#x27;s golf course was opened in the summer of 1975.

===Earl Holding (1977–2013)===
Janss was running low on funds in 1977 and had entered into negotiations to sell the resort to the Walt Disney Company. While the negotiations were strung out by Disney, Earl Holding, a Utah businessman, learned of the situation through a small article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and contacted Janss and arranged for a meeting. For about $12 million, Holding purchased Sun Valley through his company, Sinclair Oil, which operates the Grand America Hotels &amp; Resorts. Holding was initially distrusted by many locals: &quot;Earl is a Four Letter Word&quot; was a popular bumper sticker in the late 1970s in Blaine County. But time proved that Holding did not buy the resort for property speculation; like his other assets he meant to operate and improve for the long-term. One of his first changes was the removal the archaic single-seat chairlift on Exhibition, replacing it with a triple. A daily lift ticket for Baldy during Holding&#x27;s first season (1977–78) was priced at $13.

Under Holding&#x27;s ownership there have been substantial improvements on the mountain: extensive snowmaking and grooming, high-capacity chairlifts, and the construction of four impressive day lodges, a gondola, and the renovation of the classic Roundhouse restaurant. The resort&#x27;s golf course was redesigned in the late 1970s by Robert Trent Jones Jr.

In 1977, the Warm Springs side boasted of snowmaking up to an elevation of , thought to be the highest anywhere at the time. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, snowmaking was significantly expanded on Bald Mountain. Three high-speed quad chairlifts were installed during the summer of 1988 (Christmas, Challenger, &amp; Greyhawk).

An impressive day lodge, constructed of logs, river rock, and glass, opened at the base of Warm Springs in the fall of 1992, replacing the 1960s &quot;Northface Hut&quot; cafeteria. Similar day lodges were later opened at the Seattle Ridge summit (1993), and the River Run base (1995). A fire of undetermined origin damaged the Warm Springs lodge in 2018; it occurred shortly after the end of the ski season, while unoccupied at night in 

An older cafeteria, the modest one-floor &quot;Lookout Restaurant&quot;, is below the summit at , at the top of three chairlifts. Built in 1973, it is the ground floor of a multi-story building that was never completed, resulting in its &quot;basement-like&quot; atmosphere. Nevertheless, the mountain views from this near-summit lodge are quite impressive. However, the resort&#x27;s recently approved master plan has the facility slated for eventual replacement.
Four additional high-speed quads were installed in the 1990s. Two of these replaced older chairlifts on River Run (1992) and Seattle Ridge (1993), and two cut brand new paths: Lookout Express (1993) and Frenchman&#x27;s (1994). The chairlift from River Run was purchased by Eldora Mountain Resort in Colorado. Baldy&#x27;s 13 chairlifts have a capacity of over 23,000 skiers per hour. With an average of 3,500 skiers per day (&amp; less than 6,000 skiers per day during peak periods), Sun Valley has kept the lift lines to a minimum, a rarity among major resorts.

The Dollar Mountain Lodge opened in November 2004. This day lodge replaces the Dollar Cabin, and also serves as the headquarters for the Sun Valley Ski School. It is similar in construction to the newer day lodges at the big mountain.

The interior of the original Sun Valley Lodge has been remodeled twice during Holding&#x27;s ownership, in 1985 for the golden anniversary and again in 2004. The Sun Valley Inn was also remodeled in 2018.

The Sun Valley Golf Course saw significant improvement in the summer of 2008, with the opening of the new &quot;White Cloud Nine&quot; course on the site of the old Gun Club (relocated further down along Trail Creek road), as well as the opening of the &quot;Sun Valley Club&quot;, a full service golf course club house built in the style of the resort&#x27;s mountain day lodges, replacing a much smaller and older facility.

The year also saw the opening of the &quot;Sun Valley Pavilion&quot;, built in partnership with the Sun Valley Summer Symphony as a permanent home for the orchestra&#x27;s annual three-and-a-half-week series of free concerts. The Pavilion is a performing arts facility that has hosted several well-known musical artists and more slated to perform in the near future.

In 2009, the resort installed the &quot;Roundhouse Express Gondola&quot; on Bald mountain, which runs from the mountain&#x27;s River Run Base to the Roundhouse Restaurant (located midway up the mountain, at ). The Exhibition triple chairlift (originally a single-chair in 1939) was removed with the addition of the new enclosed 8-passenger lift. The new gondola carries skiers (and non-skiers) to the restaurant for lunch and eventually dinner year-round; the mid-mountain lodge was built in 1939 and remodeled in 2010 to accommodate its new year-round role.

Sun Valley opened a new expansion in 2021, which included the new Broadway chairlift, a high-speed quad, and the removal of the nearby Cold Springs chairlift (fixed-grip double).

Earl Holding died in April 2013. His wife and business partner of 64 years, Carol, passed away December 2024. Their children Stephen, Anne &amp; Kathleen will continue to run the resort along with vice president Pete Sontag.

In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated that Sun Valley was worth in the range of $300 million.

===Ski racing===
In the years before the World Cup circuit, the Harriman Cup at Sun Valley was one of the major ski races held in North America, along with the &quot;Snow Cup&quot; at Alta, the &quot;Roch Cup&quot; at Aspen Mountain, and the &quot;Silver Belt&quot; races at Sugar Bowl, north of Lake Tahoe. Originally known as the &quot;Sun Valley International Open&quot;, the Harriman Cup races were the first major international ski competitions held in North America, beginning in 1937. The first three competitions of 1937–39 were held in the Boulder Mountains north of Sun Valley. Beginning in 1940, the Harriman Cup was held on the Warm Springs side of Bald Mountain, decades before chairlifts were installed on that north face of the mountain. American Dick Durrance won three of the first four Harriman Cups, stunning the overconfident Europeans.

In the final season before the launch of the World Cup, Sun Valley hosted the world&#x27;s top racers in 1966 at the &quot;American International&quot; in late March, with a full slate of races for both men and women. With the 1966 World Championships not run until August, it was one of the biggest alpine racing events since the 1964 Olympics. The Austrians swept the men&#x27;s downhill (Heini Messner, Karl Schranz, and Egon Zimmermann), while Jean-Claude Killy of France won the slalom, with Schranz as runner-up. The two switched places in the one-run giant slalom. Erika Schinegger of Austria, Nancy Greene of Canada, and Marielle Goitschel of France were the top three in the women&#x27;s downhill, while Goitschel and teammate Annie Famose finished 1–2 in the slalom. Goitschel, Greene, and Famose were the top finishers in the giant slalom and France took the overall team title.

In March 1975 and 1977, Sun Valley hosted World Cup ski races, with slalom and giant slalom events for both men and women, run on the Warm Springs side of the mountain.

The 1975 slalom was won by Gustavo Thoeni, the dominant World Cup skier of the early 1970s (which turned out to be his last win in the slalom discipline). A young Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, perhaps the greatest technical ski racer ever, took the giant slalom title both years. Thoeni and Stenmark left Idaho tied in the overall standings in 1975, which Thoeni won in the finals of a parallel slalom the next week in Italy. Phil Mahre of White Pass, Washington, age 19, won the 1977 slalom race over Stenmark, with twin brother Steve placing third. It was Phil&#x27;s second win (he had won a GS in France in December), but his first victory in the slalom and first in the U.S., and being from the Northwest, very close to home.

The present ownership has declined to host any World Cup races since, as it involves closing off runs for a significant time. But during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake (about to the southeast), Sun Valley was used as a training site for many nations&#x27; alpine and Nordic ski teams. The alpine speed events for the Olympics were held at a sister resort, Snowbasin, outside of Ogden, Utah.
Sun Valley is scheduled to host the U.S. Alpine Championships in 2016 and 2018, held after the World Cup season in March. It last hosted the event in 1951.

Olympic medalists from Sun Valley include Gretchen Fraser, Christin Cooper, Picabo Street, snowboarder Kaitlyn Farrington, and disabled skier Muffy Davis, a founding and honorary board member of Sun Valley Adaptive Sports. All five have runs named after them on Bald Mountain: three are on Seattle Ridge (Gretchen&#x27;s Gold, Christin&#x27;s Silver (ex-Silver Fox) and Muffy&#x27;s Medals (ex-Southern Comfort)), Picabo&#x27;s Street (ex-Plaza) on Warm Springs, and Kaitlyn&#x27;s Bowl (ex-Farout Bowl) on the Bowls. US TV&#x27;s legendary sports commentator Tim Ryan (CBS/NBC) also lives in Sun Valley as well as Ski Racing Magazine&#x27;s proud owner, Gary Black Jr.

Still to this day, Sun Valley, Idaho holds numerous ski race events on its world renowned terrain. Common participants such as Axel Hattrup are constantly looking forward to their next event.

The World Cup finals (8 events) are scheduled for Sun Valley in March 2025.

==Culture==

The non-profit Sun Valley Museum of Arts (SVMoA) was initiated in 1969 by Mrs. Glenn Cooper and Bill Janss, who later married. It attained non-profit status and was officially founded in 1971; the original campus was located off Dollar Road in Sun Valley. Studios and workshops were open to the public and focused on ceramics, founded by James Romberg; photography, founded by Sheri Heiser and Peter deLory; and fine arts, founded by David W. Wharton. The SVC offered year-round workshops, lectures, and exhibitions by nationally recognized artists and craft persons to both residents and tourists to Blaine County. Later, the Sun Valley Center for the Arts acquired its main building in nearby Ketchum as well as a historic house and classroom in Hailey.

Sun Valley also hosts the Sun Valley Film Festival.

The annual Sun Valley Writers&#x27; Conference (SVWC) was founded by journalist Reva B. Tooley, with the inaugural event run in 1995. Robin Eidsmo is executive director (since 2014), and novelist John Burnham Schwartz, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming, and Pulitzer Prize-winner Liaquat Ahamed help to mount the event each year.

In 2018, The Argyros Performing Arts Center opened in downtown Ketchum. Since opening, the 450-seat theater has hosted nationally and internationally recognized artists such as Robert Cray, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Isabella Boylston, Peter Cetera, Kristen Chenoweth, Rita Wilson, and others.

The Sun Valley region boasts a wide variety of year-round adaptive sports programs for the disabled including the local DSUSA Chapter – Higher Ground Sun Valley; Wood River Ability Program; Sage Brush Equine Training Center for the Handicapped and Camp Rainbow Gold, a youth cancer program.

==Two sections==
A small mountain saddle splits the city of Sun Valley into two sections. The northern section is centered around the famous Sun Valley Lodge, Inn, and the &quot;village&quot; complex of shops, condominiums, and original 18-hole golf course (27 holes by 2008), which winds its way up the Trail Creek valley to the northeast. This area is referred to as simply &quot;Sun Valley&quot;.

The southern area of Elkhorn, adjacent to Dollar Mountain, has its own condo complex and 18-hole golf course. Quite distinct and separate, including a drier &quot;sagebrush&quot; appearance, it was initially developed in 1972. The Sun Valley Company took over day-to-day operations of the Elkhorn Golf Club in July 2011 and named Rick Hickman director of golf operations for the company.

Adjacent to Sun Valley is the older city of Ketchum, which is just a mile downstream of the Sun Valley Lodge (along Trail Creek). Ketchum comprises primarily the 19th-century town center (with its limited grid system) and lands adjacent to Bald Mountain along the Big Wood River and Warm Springs Creek.

The Sun Valley/Ketchum CVB offers area wide information on events, vacation planning information and area resources.

On September 11, 2005, the Dalai Lama visited Wood River High School in Hailey to give a speech on understanding and friendship in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 Attacks and offered condolences to the many thousands affected by the recent Hurricane Katrina.

<doc id="110626" wikidata="Q517389" url="?curid=110626" title="Horseshoe Bend, Idaho">
<text>Horseshoe Bend is the largest city in rural Boise County, in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Idaho. Its population of 707 at the 2010 census was the largest in the county, though down from 770 in 2000.

It is part of the Boise City–Nampa, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is named for its location at the horseshoe-shaped U-turn of the Payette River, whose flow direction changes from south to north before heading west to the Black Canyon Reservoir.

==History==
The area was originally settled as a gold miners&#x27; staging area, as prospectors waited along the river for snows to thaw at the higher elevations. Gold had been discovered in 1862 in the Boise Basin mountains to the east, near Idaho City.

The settlement became known as Warrinersville, after a local sawmill operator. The name was changed to Horseshoe Bend in 1867, and after the gold rush quieted, the city became a prosperous ranching and logging community. The railroad, from Emmett up to Long Valley following the Payette River (its North Fork above Banks), was completed in 1913.

In 1998 the city&#x27;s primary employer, Boise Cascade, closed its sawmill on September 30. Horseshoe Bend has attempted to become the county seat of Boise County, replacing historic Idaho City.

==Highways==
* - SH-52 - to Emmett and Payette (west)
* - SH-55 to Boise (south) and McCall (north)

Horseshoe Bend sits along State Highway 55, the primary north–south route out of Boise, to the south and accessed over the Spring Valley summit, a.k.a. &quot;Horseshoe Bend Hill.&quot; Highway 55 was designated the &quot;Payette River Scenic Byway&quot; in 1977. The new multi-lane grade was completed in fall 1991; the old curvier road is to the west, long plagued by landslides and closures.

==Recreation==
Within an hour&#x27;s drive north of Horseshoe Bend are the outdoor recreational areas of the Payette River basin, including Cascade, Tamarack Resort, and McCall.

Horseshoe Bend&#x27;s current culture is a blend of ranching and a growing bedroom community for Boise. Its annual events include a banjo festival in late May, the national senior pro rodeo in June, and a fall festival in October. A scenic railroad, the Thunder Mountain Line, was based in the city, but it closed operation in 2016.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Horseshoe Bend has either a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) or a dry-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;) depending on isotherm used.

<text>Idaho City is a town in, and the county seat of, Boise County, Idaho, United States, located about northeast of Boise. The population was 466 at the 2020 census.

Idaho City is part of the Boise City−Nampa, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Idaho City was founded in December 1862 as “Bannock” (sometimes given as “West Bannock”), amidst the Boise Basin gold rush during the Civil War, the largest since the California gold rush a dozen years earlier. Near the confluence of Elk and Mores Creeks, its plentiful water supply allowed it to outgrow the other nearby camps in the basin, such as Placerville, Pioneerville, and Centerville. As its population swelled, the new Idaho Territorial legislature changed the town&#x27;s name to “Idaho City,” to avoid confusion with Bannack, in present-day Beaverhead County, the southwestern corner of Montana.

At its peak during the mid-1860s, there were more than 200 businesses in town, including three dozen saloons and two dozen law offices. Its 1864 population of 7,000 made it the largest city in the Northwest, bigger than Portland. Wood was the prime source of both shelter and heat, which caused Idaho City to burn four times: 1865, 1867, 1868, and 1871. Five businesses on Main Street burned again in the early hours of June 5, 2015.

In 1863, St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church was established; it was the first Catholic parish in the new Idaho Territory and the church was completed the following year.

Idaho City is an important location in local Masonic history. The Grand Lodge of Idaho was founded in Idaho City in 1867. Idaho Lodge No. 1 was originally located in Idaho City, but is now in Boise.

During the boom, the greater Boise Basin population numbered in the tens of thousands, but most departed the mountains once mining declined. Idaho City&#x27;s population fell below 900 by 1870 and was down to 104 by 1920. The modern economy relies mainly on hunting and fishing tourism, and visits to the many historic sites, including the Boot Hill Cemetery. Outside of town, the mining tailings of the era are ubiquitous.

Senator Frank Church announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president from the porch of the county courthouse in Idaho City in March 1976. His grandfather had settled there in 1871 and his father was born there in 1889. Chase Clark, Church&#x27;s father-in-law, had announced his candidacy for governor in Idaho City in 1940.

=== Chinese ===
Four thousand Chinese people lived in the Idaho Territory from 1869 to 1875. Like many Chinese immigrants, they came to “Gold Mountain” to work as miners, or found work as laundrymen and cooks. The store of Pon Yam, a prominent Chinese businessman Pon Yam House from 1867 is one of the only remaining buildings from Idaho City&#x27;s Chinese. Although today Chinese are rarely seen except as tourists, the 1870 census reported at 1,751 Chinese who were nearly half of city residents. Annie Lee was one legendary Idaho city woman who like Polly Bemis, escaped from sexual slavery. She escaped from a member of the Yeong Wo Company in the 1870s to Boise to marry her lover, another Chinese man. Charged by her owner with grand larceny, she told a judge that she wanted to stay in Boise City. The judge subsequently granted her freedom.

===Historic district===

<text>Placerville is a populated place in Boise County, Idaho, United States. The population was 53 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Boise City–Nampa, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Placerville received its name because of placer mining in the vicinity. The ghost town is located 17 miles east of Horseshoe Bend. The townsite was selected December 1, 1862; and by December 16 there were six cabins in the camp. By the early summer of 1863, the town had 300 buildings and a population of 5,000. At the meeting of the first legislature held in Lewiston in 1863, the citizens obtained a charter for their city. Father Mesplie, a Catholic priest, held the first church service January 4, 1864, and in that same year a stage line was established between the Basin and Wallua to carry Wells Fargo express. It ran every other day from Placerville and went through in four days. By July 1864, 4500 claims had been recorded in the district.

Unlike the earlier northern Idaho mining areas of Florence (northeast of Riggins) and Pierce, the Boise Basin mines provided good returns over a period of many years, the peak years being 1863–66, during and immediately after the Civil War. For that reason the Boise Basin rush was significant an early Idaho settlement, bringing a substantial number of people who stayed to establish towns and providing a population base for retailing and agricultural settlement in the Boise Valley. Boise Basin had a higher percentage of families than did most mining areas, and the major towns, like Placerville and Idaho City, acquired substantial buildings, lodges, churches, schools, and post offices. Placerville was unusual in that it even had a street grid and a town square, known locally as the &quot;plaza.&quot; Additionally it had an Episcopal church-which is still in use currently, thirteen saloons, seven restaurants, five butcher shops, five blacksmith shops, as well as hotels, druggists, express agents, bakeries, livery barns, carpenters, sawmills, and –attesting to the presence of women—dressmakers and a millinery shop.

Mining in Placerville began with placer workings for gold, but miners soon turned to quartz mining as well. By 1864, a stamp mill was working in the area. Hydraulic giants were also used. By 1870, however, much of the excess population of the region had been drained off to other mining rushes and returns on claims had fallen somewhat. The population in Placerville shrank from 2500 in 1864 to 318 in 1870. By that time a good percentage of the population was Chinese, as the Chinese were allowed to work the less rewarding claims that the white miners would not touch. The Chinese also established services like laundries and restaurants.

Only few early buildings remain in Placerville: as was the case in most mining towns, Placerville suffered more than once from fires that burned a large part of the town. The fire that is most remembered is the 1899 fire, which practically destroyed the town. The streetscape remaining today dates mostly from the rebuilding immediately after that fire and another fire that burned several buildings ten months later.

During the war years Placerville just maintained like the rest of the nation. Wartime restrictions included a suspension of the mining industry. There was no growth — only a feeling of &quot;things have to get better.&quot;

In the early 1970s the upper lots were auctioned off creating what was and are now known as the &quot;upper subdivision.&quot; There were both permanent and vacation homes built on these lots. Then as now there was only one business in Placerville, the city store.

Placerville continues to survive with the few full-time residents and some part-time residents. The Village Market store has closed but Donna&#x27;s Place II is open. The tourism industry which includes among others, history seekers, hunters and ATV and snowmobile recreationalists also continue to add life to the small city. The incorporated city is governed by a mayor and city council which meets regularly at City Hall. The city is served by the Placerville Fire Department which has its fire station located adjacent to the city plaza and the East Boise County ambulance service. There are two city museums which are maintained by public donation and volunteers and are open weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day and by special request.

In 1984, the settled areas of the city were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, the &quot;Placerville Historic District.&quot;

==History==
The Kutenai Indians have lived in the area around Lake Pend Oreille for centuries, well before the first Europeans explored the North American wilderness.

The town of Clark Fork was named in honor of William Clark, who along with Meriwether Lewis, headed the expedition through the western American wilderness in 1804. It is believed the Lewis and Clark party encountered the Clark Fork River near present-day Missoula, Montana, in October 1805. After the Lewis and Clark Expedition, fur traders would pass through the area. The origins of an actual town date back to when the Northern Pacific Railway constructed a line adjacent to the Clark Fork River, near the eastern shore of Lake Pend Oreille in the early 1880s. By the 1890s a ferry boat service was used to cross the river or to travel as far as Heron, Montana, about 12 miles (20 km) upriver.

Clark Fork is a small town that focuses on agriculture, forestry, small businesses and tourism (camping, hunting and fishing).

<text>Sandpoint is the largest city in, and the county seat of, Bonner County, Idaho, United States. Its population was 9,777 as of the 2022 census.

Sandpoint&#x27;s major economic contributors include forest products, light manufacturing, tourism, recreation and government services. As the largest service center in the two northern Idaho counties (Bonner and Boundary), as well as northwestern Montana, it has an active retail sector.

Sandpoint lies on the shores of Idaho&#x27;s largest lake, Lake Pend Oreille, and is surrounded by three major mountain ranges, the Selkirk, Cabinet and Bitterroot ranges. It is home to Schweitzer Mountain Resort, Idaho&#x27;s largest ski resort, and is on the International Selkirk Loop and two National Scenic Byways (Wild Horse Trail and Pend Oreille Scenic Byway). Among other distinctions awarded by national media in the past decade, in 2011 Sandpoint was named the nation&#x27;s &quot;Most Beautiful Small Town&quot; by Rand McNally and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

==History==

Salish Tribes, specifically the Kalispel, and the Kootenai, built encampments on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille every summer, fished, made baskets of cedar, and collected huckleberries before returning to either Montana or Washington in the fall. The encampments ended before 1930.

The region was extensively explored by David Thompson of the North West Company starting in 1807. Disputed joint British/American occupation of the Columbia District led to the Oregon boundary dispute. This controversy ended in 1846 with the signing of the Oregon Treaty, whereby Britain ceded all rights to land south of the 49th parallel.

In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railroad brought European and Chinese settlement to the area.

In August 1888, 29-year-old author and civil servant Theodore Roosevelt visited Sandpoint on a caribou-hunting trip in the Selkirk Mountains. Roosevelt documented what a rough-and-tumble environment &quot;Sand Point&quot; was at that time (and for many decades following).

Sandpoint was officially incorporated in 1898.

Timber harvesting and railroads drove the economy for nearly a century as loggers moved in from the over-harvested Great Lakes region. Several lumber companies operated in the region from as early as 1896 to present, the most notable being the Humbird Lumber Company which operated from 1900 to around 1944. The lumber companies bought land from the Northern Pacific Railroad and built a major mill at Sandpoint and adjacent Kootenai. Lumber company-owned railroads extended into many of the local drainages including Grouse Creek, Gold Creek and Rapid Lightning Creek. Although the trees were never exhausted in the area, Humbird Lumber succumbed to the low timber prices of the Great Depression.

&quot;Stump ranches&quot; were sold by Humbird to many families who slowly cleared much of the valley land of tree stumps. Farming and ranching became the third largest business in the area, behind lumber and railroads, prior to the &quot;discovery&quot; of Lake Pend Oreille as a sports fishery in the 1950s. The economy was given a boost during World War II from Farragut Naval Station, a training center for the US Navy located at the southwestern end of Lake Pend Oreille.

The opening of Schweitzer Mountain Resort in 1963 turned the area into a year-round tourism destination. The beauty of the surrounding Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains and Lake Pend Oreille has kept Sandpoint a tourist favorite for water sports, hunting, hiking, horseback riding, fishing and skiing.

In the 1980s and 1990s, 30 miles south of Sandpoint, the areas of Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Hayden Lake attracted nationwide publicity when white supremacist Neo-Nazi groups (most notably the Aryan Nations) set up headquarters in the area. Many Sandpoint residents reacted negatively to such groups; some formed the Bonner County Human Rights Task Force in opposition. In 2001, the Aryan Nations lost a lawsuit filed against them. The lawsuit bankrupted the organization and forced them to give up their Hayden Lake property and disband. In December 2011, Sandpoint became the first city in Idaho to pass an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Community organizations stage a number of regionally known annual events, including Sandpoint Winter Carnival in February; the Lost in the 50s vintage car show in May; and the Festival at Sandpoint summer music festival in August. Sandpoint&#x27;s historic vaudeville-era Panida Theater hosts frequent performing art events and an ongoing independent film series. The Music Conservatory of Sandpoint provides classical music classes and inaugurated its &quot;Little Carnegie&quot; concert hall in 2022. A robust visual arts community supported by the Pend Oreille Arts Council also contributes to Sandpoint&#x27;s reputation as a center for arts and culture in northern Idaho and the Inland Northwest.

There have been occasional reports of unusual lights over Lake Pend Oreille at night. Described as glowing orbs, these lights have been attributed to various causes, including possible military activity from the nearby Farragut Naval Training Station, though no definitive explanations have been provided.

==Geography and climate==


According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Sandpoint has a fairly typical inland Northwestern humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;), with cold, snowy winters and dry summers with large diurnal temperature swings from hot in the day to very cool at night.

<doc id="110638" wikidata="Q937598" url="?curid=110638" title="Ammon, Idaho">
<text>Ammon is a suburb city in Bonneville County, Idaho, United States. As of the 2010 US Census, the population of Ammon was 13,816. By the 2020 census, Ammon&#x27;s population had grown to 17,694. It lies directly to the east of Idaho Falls and to the west of the Ammon foothills, and is the second most populous city in the Idaho Falls metropolitan area.

As of 2020, Ammon is the 15th most populous city in Idaho. It was one of the state&#x27;s fastest growing cities from 2000 to 2010, experiencing a 123.3% growth rate based on the 2010 US Census.

==History==
Ammon was founded by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1888. It was originally called South Iona because it was the dependent branch in the south end of the Iona, Idaho ward. The area was made a ward in the church in 1889 with Arthur M. Rawson as bishop, who renamed the town in honor of Ammon, a figure in the LDS book of scripture, the Book of Mormon. Since it was now independent of the Iona Ward, a new name seemed appropriate. On February 9, 1893, the name of the town was changed from South Iona Ward to Ammon.

By 1930 the village of Ammon had 270 inhabitants, but the total district of Ammon, which is how the name is usually used and is closer to the modern borders, had a population of about 1100.

Ammon was an early agricultural center and later was home to several general stores, a grain elevator and a brickyard. The city was officially incorporated on October 10, 1905. It became a Second Class City under Idaho law in 1963. In the early 1900s a spur line was built by the Union Pacific Railroad to the Ammon Elevator. Beginning in the 1940s housing divisions have aided the city&#x27;s growth and it has become a suburb for the adjacent city of Idaho Falls. Building boomed in the 1990s in both the business and housing sectors, and the city was one of the fastest growing in Idaho from 2000 to 2010.

<text>Idaho Falls is the fourth most populous city in Idaho and the county seat of Bonneville County. It is the state&#x27;s most populous city outside the Boise metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of Idaho Falls was 64,818. In the 2010 census, the population of Idaho Falls was 56,813 (2019 estimate: 62,888), with a metro population of 133,265. 
Idaho Falls serves as the commercial, cultural, and healthcare hub for Eastern Idaho, as well as parts of western Wyoming and southern Montana. It is served by the Idaho Falls Regional Airport and is home to the College of Eastern Idaho, Museum of Idaho, Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, and the Idaho Falls Chukars minor league baseball team. It is the principal city of the Idaho Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Idaho Falls–Blackfoot-Rexburg, Idaho Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
===Montana Trail origins===
The area around Idaho Falls was first sparsely settled by cattle and sheep ranchers. No significant development took place until 1864, when a man named Harry Rickets built and operated a ferry on the Snake River at . The ferry served a new tide of westward migration and travel on the Montana Trail following the Bear River Massacre of Shoshone Indians in 1863.
The present-day site of Idaho Falls became a permanent settlement when freighter Matt Taylor built a timber-frame toll bridge across a narrow black basaltic gorge of the river downstream from the ferry. The bridge improved travel for settlers moving north and west, and for miners, freighters, and others seeking riches in the gold fields of Idaho and Montana especially the boom towns of Bannack and Virginia City.

===Eagle Rock===

By the end of 1865, a private bank, small hotel, livery stable, eating house, post office, and stage station had sprung up near the bridge. The settlement was initially known as Taylor&#x27;s Crossing, but postmarks indicate that by 1866, the emerging town had become known as Eagle Rock. The name was derived from an isolated basalt island in the river near the ferry, where approximately twenty eagles nested.

In 1874, water rights were established on nearby Willow Creek and the first grain was harvested. Settlement was sparse, and consisted of only a couple of families and small irrigation ditches. The first child of European descent was born at Eagle Rock in 1874.
Soon, the Utah and Northern Railway (U&amp;NR) was built, stretching north from Utah through Eagle Rock and crossing the Snake River at the same narrow gorge as Taylor&#x27;s bridge. The railway would eventually connect to the large new copper mines at Butte, Montana. The U&amp;NR had the backing of robber baron Jay Gould, as Union Pacific Railroad had purchased it a few years prior. Grading crews reached Eagle Rock in late 1878, and by early 1879, a wild camp-town with dozens of tents and shanties had moved to Eagle Rock with a collection of saloons, dance halls, and gambling halls. The railroad company had 16 locomotives and 300 train cars working between Logan, Utah and the once-quiet stage stop. A new iron railroad bridge was fabricated in Athens, Pennsylvania at a cost of $30,000 and shipped by rail to the site, where it was erected in April and May 1879. The bridge was long and had two spans, with an island in the center. The camp-town moved on, but Eagle Rock now had regular train service and several U&amp;NR buildings, shops, and facilities which expanded and transformed the town.

As soon as the railroad came through, settlers began homesteading the upper Snake River Valley in earnest. The first new settlers carved out homesteads to the north at Egin (near present-day Parker) and at Pooles Island (near present-day Menan). The Utah &amp; Northern Railway provided easy access, especially to homesteaders from Utah, who soon populated much of the area surrounding Eagle Rock. Some of these men had initially worked building the railroad, then later returned with their families to stake out new farms. These Utah families brought irrigation know-how developed in Utah&#x27;s Great Basin settlements. Through their and others&#x27; canal systems, water from the Snake River made the Upper Snake River Valley into one of the most successful irrigation projects in the Mountain West. Large-scale settlement ensued and within a decade, there appeared roads, bridges, and dams, which brought most of the Upper Snake River Valley under cultivation.

Then, in 1887, following the construction of the Oregon Short Line and a railroad workers&#x27; strike in Eagle Rock, most of the railroad facilities were moved to Pocatello, where the new line branched off the U&amp;NR. This caused a sharp and immediate drop in population, which nearly killed the town. In 1891, marketers convinced town leaders to change the name to Idaho Falls in reference to the rapids below the bridge. Some years later, the construction of a retaining wall for a hydroelectric power plant transformed the rapids into waterfalls. On June 22, 1895, the world&#x27;s then-largest irrigation canal, the Great Feeder (located 5 miles northeast of Ririe), began diverting water from the Snake River, helping to convert tens of thousands of more acres of desert into green farmland. The area grew sugar beets, potatoes, peas, grains, and alfalfa, and became one of the most productive agricultural regions of the United States. The city once again began to flourish, growing continuously into the 20th century.

===Nuclear reactors===

In 1949, the Atomic Energy Commission opened the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) in the desert west of Idaho Falls. On December 20, 1951, a nuclear reactor there produced useful electricity for the first time in history. There have been more than 50 unique reactors built at the facility for testing—only three remain active.

On January 3, 1961, NRTS became the scene of the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in U.S. history. The event occurred at an experimental U.S. Army plant known as the Argonne Low-Power Reactor, which the Army called the Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One (SL-1). Due to poor design and maintenance procedures, a single control rod was manually pulled out too far from the reactor, causing the reactor to become prompt critical, leading to a destructive power excursion. Three trained military men had been working inside the reactor room when a mistake was made while reattaching a control rod to its motor assembly. With the central control rod nearly fully extended, the nuclear reactor rated at 3 MW rapidly increased power to 20 GW. This rapidly boiled the water inside the core. As the steam expanded, a pressure wave of water forcefully struck the top of the reactor vessel, upon which two of the men stood. The explosion was so severe that the reactor vessel was propelled nine feet into the air, striking the ceiling before settling back into its original position. One man was impaled by a shield plug and lodged into the ceiling, where he died instantly. The other men died from their injuries within hours. The three men were buried in lead coffins, and that entire section of the site was buried. The core meltdown caused no damage to the area, although some radioactive nuclear fission products were released into the atmosphere.

The site has since developed into the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), a national laboratory operated by the United States Department of Energy. INL and its contractors are a major economic engine for the Idaho Falls area, employing more than 8,000 people between the desert site and its research and education campus in Idaho Falls. Among other projects, INL operates and manages the world-famous Advanced Test Reactor (ATR).

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , 98% is land and 0.45 square miles (1.17 km2, 2%) is water.

Natural disasters are rare in the area, although an F2 tornado hit the Idaho Falls area on April 7, 1978, causing up to $5 million in damage.

===River Walk===
Idaho Falls has an extensive river walk trail featuring running and bike trails, art installations, and points of interest along several miles of the Snake River. It is maintained by the city and periodically receives donations and grants that allow for expansion.

===Neighborhoods===
Notable Idaho Falls neighborhoods include:
* Downtown - Historic downtown Idaho Falls sits on several blocks of the original townsite along the east side of the river. It features restaurants, plazas, shops, and cultural amenities including the Museum of Idaho, Colonial Theatre, Art Museum of Eastern Idaho, Idaho Falls Public Library, and Japanese Friendship Garden. It is home to the Idaho Falls Farmers&#x27; Market and many other community events.
* The Numbered Streets - The numbered streets area was the first planned neighborhood in Idaho Falls. The streets run west and east between South Boulevard and Holmes Avenue. Traffic on the odd-numbered streets travels east, and west on the even-numbered streets. Kate Curley Park is located in the neighborhood, as is the Wesley W. Deist Aquatic Center and the Eleventh Street Historic District.
* West Side - The West Side houses Idaho Falls Regional Airport and I-15. It has retained more of a small-town feel than the east side, which has grown and developed much more rapidly since the 1980s.
* Snake River Landing - SRL is a large, mixed-use development on the west side of the river near I-15, which includes residential, restaurant, park, and community event space, including a planned mid-sized indoor arena. It now hosts the Melaleuca Freedom Celebration, a large Independence Day event.

===Climate===
Idaho Falls experiences a humid continental climate, however bordering on a semi-arid climate, with warm summers and cold winters (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). Precipitation is relatively sparse.

==Economy==
Idaho Falls serves as a regional hub for health care, travel, and business in eastern Idaho.

The community&#x27;s economy was mostly agriculturally focused until the opening of the National Reactor Testing Station in the desert west of Idaho Falls in 1949. The city subsequently became largely dependent on high-income jobs from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), known locally simply as &quot;The Site.&quot; Since the 1990s, the city has added a significant retail, entertainment, and restaurant sector, as well as a regional medical center.

Idaho Falls hosts the headquarters of the United Potato Growers of Idaho and District 7 of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. It is the home to several small-to-medium-sized national corporations such as North Wind, Inc. and Melaleuca, Inc.

The median home price in Idaho Falls was $224,800 in January 2007.

Public transport in Idaho Falls is run by the Greater Idaho Falls Transit, which runs the GIFT On Demand demand-responsive transport system.

==Arts and culture==

The Willard Arts Center, The Colonial Theatre, and Frontier Center for the Performing Arts host musical concerts, plays, and events.

The Mountain America Center, a multi-purpose arena and convention center, opened to the public in November 2022.

The Museum of Idaho showcases local artifacts and history. It also brings in major traveling exhibits such as fossilized dinosaurs, Gutenberg Bibles, Titanic remnants, and &quot;Bodies: the Exhibition.&quot;

Downtown Idaho Falls once struggled as the city expanded eastward, but it has been revitalized in recent years due to the efforts of local business owners, the City of Idaho Falls, and other organizations such as the Downtown Development Corporation and the Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce. Today, it is home to a handful of locally owned shops, stores, restaurants, galleries, theaters, and future revitalization efforts.

The city attracts many tourists visiting nearby Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, Jackson Hole, and fishing on the Snake River.

<text>Ririe is a city in Bonneville and Jefferson counties in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Idaho. It is part of the Idaho Falls metropolitan area. The population was 656 at the time of the 2010 census.

== History ==
The city of Ririe was named for one of its first homesteaders, David Ririe. A Utah resident, Ririe settled in the area in 1888 and began cultivating a small claim of land. In 1891, Joseph Hyrum Lovell and his family settled on an adjoining area and began farming. That winter, however, Joseph died of illness, leaving his family alone and isolated. David Ririe helped the widowed family to establish their farm, and eventually married one of the Lovell daughters, Leah Ann. The families flourished in the area, and David eventually built a large stone house, which stands today, to house his large family. As more residents settled in the area, the common need for schools and churches help foster a community. However, the city of Ririe was formally established in 1914. That year, the railroad was routed through the city and Ririe was given its name by railroad officials. The small community of Shelton was absorbed by Ririe, but several buildings and sites continue to bear the Shelton name, such as the Ririe-Shelton Cemetery.

A large fire in the summer of 1919 destroyed much of the southern half of the town, but since then, the elementary school/high school complex, an athletic field, and an LDS Stake Center have been built in the area. Since 2007, nearly a thousand acres (4 km) have been annexed into the town, ostensibly in anticipation of future development.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

== Culture ==
Ririe and its surrounding area are largely dependent on a farming economy. The major crops grown in the area are wheat, barley, alfalfa, and potatoes. Many community residents either farm their own land or work in some aspect of farm support, including supplying farm equipment, coordinating crop buyers, etc. In addition to those who farm, many residents work at the Idaho National Laboratory (a.k.a. &quot;the Site&quot;), a regional division of the Department of Energy that focuses on nuclear energy and security technology. Others work in various occupations in the surrounding communities.

Ririe is one of only three cities in Idaho situated astride county lines. Ririe is nearby to three larger cities--Idaho Falls, Rexburg, and Rigby, Idaho Falls and Rexburg both being about a half-hour away, and Rigby about 15 minutes away. These communities provide Ririe residents with easy access to shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and other city amenities.

Because of its unique location and small size, Ririe has become, in effect, a &quot;bedroom&quot; community with little retail commerce of its own. There have been several startup business attempts in the city, most failing within the first year or two. In addition to the several local grain elevators, the few small-town businesses that have succeeded are loyally supported. These include three gas stations, three restaurants, two convenience stores, a bank, an auto parts store, an auto repair shop, a metal design and fabrication shop, and one bar. The city also includes a post office, a senior citizen community center, a community library, a city park, and a community cemetery.

The community has a small independent public school system, consisting of the Ririe Elementary School complex located in the heart of the city, and the Ririe High School complex located just to the south of the city. Ririe also has its own community fire station, which provides volunteer EMS and fire-fighting to the area.

The predominant religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is widespread in city culture. The majority of city residents identify themselves as members, and two large church buildings serve as centers for many community activities. There is also a small non-denominational church in the community supported by a handful of loyal members.

Based in the heart of the Rocky Mountains and near the south fork of the Snake River, a large number of outdoor activities are available, including snowmobiling, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, hunting, boating, camping, and fishing. Heise Hot Springs, a local recreation area, provides facilities for golfing, camping and year-round swimming. The Kelly Canyon Ski Area, a small ski resort with 4 chairlifts, offers day and night skiing in the winter.
