==History==
In February 1878, James R. Fulton, William D. Fulton and W.D.&#x27;s son, L.W. Fulton, arrived at the present site of Garden City.

The original townsite was laid out on the south half of section 18 by engineer Charles Van Trump. The land was a loose, sandy loam and covered with sagebrush and soap weeds, but there were no trees. Main Street ran directly north and south, dividing William D. and James R. Fulton&#x27;s claims. As soon as they could get building material, they erected two frame houses. William D. Fulton building on his land, on the east side of Main Street, a house one story and a half high, with two rooms on the ground and two rooms above. This was called the Occidental Hotel. William D. Fulton was proprietor. No other houses were built in Garden City until November 1878, when James R. Fulton and L.T. Walker each put up a building. The Fultons tried to get others to settle here, but only a few came, and at the end of the first year there were only four buildings.

Following a sustained drought, irrigation arrived in Finney County in 1879, with completion of the &quot;Garden City Ditch&quot;. The ditch helped to launch an agricultural boom in southwestern Kansas.

===19th century===
Charles Jesse Jones, later known as &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones, arrived in Garden City for an antelope hunt in January 1879. Before Jones returned home, the Fulton brothers procured his services to promote Garden City, and especially in trying to influence the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad to put in a switch station. The railroad agreed to place its station at Garden City. In the spring of 1879, more people began arriving to homestead in the area. During the years of 1885–1887, a rush was made for Western Kansas, and a settler arrived for every quarter section. The United States Land Office also located at Garden City, and people went there to make filings on their land. Lawyers also arrived in Garden City. I.R. Holmes, the agent for the sale of lands of the ATSF, and Holmes&#x27; partner, A.C. McKeever, in 1885 sold thousands of acres of railroad and private land. The Knights of Reciprocity were organized in Garden City in 1890.

The streets of Garden City were crowded with horses, wagons, buggies and teams of oxen. Long lines of people stood out in the weather awaiting mail at the post office, and there was always a crowd in front of the land office. During the height of the boom the town had nine lumber yards. Lumber was hauled in all directions to build up inland towns and to improve the nearby homesteads. Thirteen drug stores were in operation, and the town had two daily newspapers. Nearly everyone used kerosene lamps, and a few were placed on posts on Main Street. There was no city water works, so all depended on shallow wells, which were strongly alkaline. Passenger trains of two and three sections arrived daily, loaded with people, most of whom got off at Garden City.

The first issue of &quot;The Garden City Newspaper&quot; appeared April 3, 1879. Three months after the paper was established, the editor stated, &quot;There are now forty buildings in town.&quot; When the first telephone line was built, trees were growing on both sides of Main Street. These interfered with the wires, but local residents knew the value of trees in Western Kansas would not allow them to be cut, and the telephone poles were set down the center of the street. The first long-distance telephone service from Garden City was a line nine miles (14 km) long, built in 1919.

===20th century===
In the 1970s, Garden City&#x27;s city council allowed the building of a meatpacking plant. This invigorated the economy. New residents arrived, but even with population growth the unemployment rate was only about 3% in 2017. Many of the new arrivals were immigrants from outside the United States (Myanmar, Somalia, Vietnam, and other places, particularly Mexico and Latin America), such that over 48% of the 2010 population was Hispanic, and less than 40% of the population was non-Hispanic white.

=== 21st century ===
In October 2016, Gavin Wright, Curtis Allen, and Patrick Stein were arrested by the FBI for plotting a bombing attack on a mosque and the housing complex where some of the town&#x27;s Somali community live. The three men were charged in federal court with threatening to use weapons of mass destruction, namely explosives. All three defendants were found guilty in April 2018 and were sentenced to 25–30 years in prison.

The 2020 census found that 53.1 percent of the city&#x27;s population was Hispanic.

Hispanics and Latinos, including immigrants, came to Garden City beginning in the 1980s due to the establishment of meatpacking plants and partially due to plant management deliberately recruiting them. Many educational institutions for adults were teaching Hispanic immigrants after they had asked for amnesty for having illegally immigrated.

After the Fall of Saigon in 1975 immigrants from Southeast Asia began coming to Garden City. Garden City Catholics sponsored an initial group of Vietnamese immigrants that year. More Vietnamese came in the 1980s during a wave of immigration, and Lao people also came with them. Dr. Janet E. Benson of Kansas State University stated that perhaps about half originated from Wichita as they had lost work during industry layoffs there. The second group of Vietnamese were less educated than the first, and they were more likely to be Buddhist as opposed to being Christian. In their home country they had originally done agricultural and/or fishing work. By the late 1980s many Mexican immigrants replaced Vietnamese immigrants who had moved away from Garden City as they accumulated enough capital to seek employment elsewhere.

<text>Holcomb is a city in Finney County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,245. It is located south of Highway 50.

==History==
Holcomb took its name from a local hog farmer. The city was a station and shipping point on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The first post office in Holcomb was established in December 1909.

===1959 murders===

The town of Holcomb was thrust into national and, eventually, international notoriety after November 15, 1959, when four members of the prominent Clutter family (father Herbert, 48; his wife Bonnie, 45; their youngest daughter, Nancy, 16; and son Kenyon, 15) were found bound and shot to death in various rooms of their home, on the family&#x27;s River Valley Farm on the outskirts of Holcomb.

Two ex-convicts, Richard (&quot;Dick&quot;) Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested, tried, and convicted of the killings. It started when both Hickock and Smith were released from prison and, acting on jailhouse information by a cellmate of Hickock&#x27;s named Floyd Wells (who had worked for Mr. Clutter in 1948), made plans to rob the Clutter household under the mistaken belief that Mr. Clutter, according to Wells, kept thousands of dollars in cash in a safe at the residence. There was no Clutter safe, nor was there any substantial amount of cash in the home. Upon this discovery, and after killing the captive family to eliminate any witnesses, the pair fled with around $42 (), a portable radio, and one pair of binoculars. They were arrested on December 30, 1959, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after possibly, although not likely, having murdered another family in Florida. Following their convictions and several appeals, Hickock and Smith were hanged for first-degree murder on April 14, 1965.

The murders, arrests and convictions of Hickock and Smith were the basis for author Truman Capote&#x27;s acclaimed book &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 1965 and first published in book form in 1966. Capote actually began work on the book several days after he read a news article in a New York paper in 1959 about the murders.

The best-selling book, in turn, spawned several filmed versions of the story: director Richard Brooks&#x27; theatrical feature film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; in 1967 starring Robert Blake, Scott Wilson and John Forsythe, and a two-part 1996 TV miniseries adaptation starring Eric Roberts, Anthony Edwards and Sam Neill that aired on network TV in 1996. Portions of the 1967 theatrical film were shot on location in and around Holcomb and nearby Garden City, including the actual house where the crimes took place.

The 2005 movie &quot;Capote&quot;, directed by Bennett Miller, is also about the author Capote, and the crimes in Holcomb. The 2006 film &quot;Infamous&quot;, starring Toby Jones as Capote, covers much of the same material.

<text>Dodge City is a city in and the county seat of Ford County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 27,788. It was named after nearby Fort Dodge, which was named in honor of Grenville Dodge. The city is known in American culture for its history as a wild frontier town of the Old West.

== History ==

The first European immigrant settlement in the area that became Dodge City was Fort Mann, built by civilians in 1847. The fort was built to provide protection for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail. Fort Mann collapsed in 1848 after an attack by Natives. In 1850, the U.S. Army arrived to provide protection in the region and constructed Fort Atkinson on the old Fort Mann site. The army abandoned Fort Atkinson in 1853. Military forces on the Santa Fe Trail were re-established farther north and east at Fort Larned in 1859, but the area remained vacant around what would become Dodge City until the end of the Civil War. In April 1865, the American Frontier Wars in the West began heating up, and the army constructed Fort Dodge to assist Fort Larned in providing protection on the Santa Fe Trail. Fort Dodge remained in operation until 1882.

The town of Dodge City can trace its origins to 1871, when rancher Henry L. Sitler built a sod house west of Fort Dodge to oversee his cattle operations in the region, conveniently located near the Santa Fe Trail and Arkansas River, and Sitler&#x27;s house quickly became a stopping point for travelers. Others saw the commercial potential of the region with the Santa Fe Railroad rapidly approaching from the east. In 1872, Dodge City was staked out on the 100th meridian and the legal western boundary of the Fort Dodge reservation. The town site was platted and George M. Hoover established the first bar in a tent to serve thirsty soldiers from Fort Dodge. The railroad arrived in September to find a town ready and waiting for business. The early settlers in Dodge City traded in buffalo bones and hides and provided a civilian community for Fort Dodge. With the arrival of the railroad, Dodge City soon became involved in the cattle trade.

The idea of driving Texas Longhorn cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas originated in the late 1850s, but was cut short by the Civil War. In 1866, the first Texas cattle started arriving in Baxter Springs in southeastern Kansas by way of the Shawnee Trail. Texas Longhorn cattle carried a tick that spread Texas cattle fever, among other breeds of cattle. Alarmed Kansas farmers persuaded the Kansas State Legislature to establish a quarantine line in central Kansas. The quarantine prohibited Texas Longhorns from the heavily settled, eastern portion of the state.

Like many Kansas cattle towns, Dodge City enforced segregation of business and residential districts, along race lines as well as morality (containing &quot;vice industries&quot;) and economic status. There was a number of black cowboys, who commanded some respect, but attitudes towards people of colour varied and were ambivalent.

With the cattle trade forced west, Texas Longhorns began moving north along the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, the main cowtown was Abilene, Kansas. Profits were high, and other towns quickly joined in the cattle boom: Newton in 1871, Ellsworth in 1872, and Wichita in 1872. In 1876, however, the Kansas State Legislature responded to pressure from farmers settling in central Kansas and once again shifted the quarantine line westward, which essentially eliminated Abilene and the other cowtowns from the cattle trade. With no place else to go, Dodge City suddenly became the &quot;queen of the cow towns.&quot;

A new route known as the Great Western Cattle Trail or Western Trail branched off from the Chisholm Trail to lead cattle into Dodge City. Dodge City became a boomtown, with thousands of cattle passing annually through its stockyards. The peak years of the cattle trade in Dodge City were from 1883 to 1884, and during that time the town grew tremendously. In 1880, Dodge City got a new competitor for the cattle trade from the border town of Caldwell. For a few years, the competition between the towns was fierce, but enough cattle were available for both towns to prosper.

Dodge City became known as a true frontier settlement of the Old West. Dodge City had more gunfighters working at one time or another than any other town in the West, many of whom participated in the Dodge City War of 1883. It had saloons, gambling halls, and brothels, including the Long Branch Saloon and China Doll brothel. For a time in 1884, Dodge City had a bullfighting ring where Mexican bullfighters would put on a show with specially chosen Longhorn bulls. As more agricultural settlers moved into western Kansas, pressure increased on the Kansas State Legislature to do something about splenic fever, known today as anthrax. Consequently, in 1885, the quarantine line was extended across the state and the Western Trail was all but shut down.

By the mid-1880s, Dodge City began working to change its image away from that of a violent western town and towards that of a more peaceful and civilized location. In 1878, for example, the bodies in the notorious &quot;Boot Hill&quot; cemetery were moved to the newly established Prairie Grove Cemetery, and a new schoolhouse was built on Boot Hill. In 1907 Andrew Carnegie donated money for the construction of a new public library in Dodge City.

Dodge City was also a significant hub for racing for many years, and it held the first World Championship 300 Mile Motorcycle Race on July 4, 1914. Notable attendees included William Harley and Walter Davidson, who adopted the &quot;hog&quot; as a mascot after one of their riders, Ray Weishaar, brought a piglet from his farm with him to the race.

===In popular culture===

Starting in the 1870s, the violent episodes of early Dodge City history, particularly the exploits of Wyatt Earp, attracted national media attention. National news coverage of the 1883 Dodge City War civil strife fueled public perceptions of frontier turmoil and established Dodge City as the &quot;Sodom of the West&quot; in the public consciousness. Gunfighters and lawmen such as Earp and his brothers and partners became celebrities, and sensationalized versions of their activities entered period popular culture as the subject of dime novels. Over time, the level and scale of the violence in early Dodge City were significantly embellished, becoming the stuff of legend. This trend continued into the 20th century, particularly after the 1931 publication of Stuart N. Lake&#x27;s book &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. Regarded in American folklore as the quintessential rough and rowdy Old West frontier town, Dodge City served as the setting for numerous works of Western-themed media, including later popular films and television series.

Dodge City was the setting of the long-running radio and television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. The series followed the adventures of fictional U.S. Marshal Matt Dillon portrayed on radio by William Conrad and then on television by James Arness, as he dealt with gunfighters, cattle rustlers, gamblers and other criminals while enforcing the law in the frontier town. The radio lasted from 1952 to 1961 while the television series ran from 1955 to 1975, on the CBS television network, and was one of the longest-running prime-time TV dramas in American history. The show proved to be culturally influential and promoted the legend of Dodge City&#x27;s Old West era. It also served as the source of the idiom &quot;get [the hell] out of Dodge&quot;, which means to leave a dangerous area quickly. In honor of the series, the city government changed the name of Walnut Street, one of its downtown streets, to Gunsmoke Street, in 1959.

The city has also been a setting for a number of films and television series dramatizing the career of Wyatt Earp. These include several seasons of the series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; starring Hugh O&#x27;Brian on the ABC television network from 1955 to 1961, and the films &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950), with James Stewart &quot;Masterson of Kansas&quot; (1954), with George Montgomery, &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964), featuring Richard Widmark, James Stewart and Edward G. Robinson and directed by John Ford and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994) with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. In the 1939 film &quot;Dodge City&quot; the fictional lawman Wade Hatton, played by Errol Flynn, was modeled on Earp.

The area officially called West Brewarrina, part of Brewarrina, New South Wales, Australia, was dubbed &quot;Dodge City&quot; by its Aboriginal residents, after they had been moved there in 1965 from the Aboriginal reserve known as Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission. The name reflects the racial segregation practised in the town.

In the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, Metropolis is said to be southwest of Dodge City with Smallville, &quot;Superman&quot; / Clark Kent&#x27;s childhood and adolescent residence, located west of Wichita.

More recently, Dodge City served as a setting for the 2005 multi-platform video game &quot;Gun&quot;.

The Bruce Springsteen song “If I Was The Priest,” on his 2020 album &quot;Letter to You, &quot; refers to the main character being “needed tonight up in Dodge City.”

Dodge City is prominently featured in Ken Burns PBS documentary &quot;The American Buffalo&quot; that premiered on October 16, 2023.

==Notable people==

Numerous figures of the American Old West lived in Dodge City during its period as a frontier cowtown.

<doc id="114562" wikidata="Q202973" url="?curid=114562" title="Kingston, Ontario">
<text>Kingston is a city in Ontario, Canada, on the northeastern end of Lake Ontario. It is at the beginning of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River, the south end of the Rideau Canal. Kingston is near the Thousand Islands, a tourist region to the east, and the Prince Edward County tourist region to the west. Kingston is nicknamed the &quot;Limestone City&quot; because it has many heritage buildings constructed using local limestone.

Growing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade led to the founding of a French trading post and military fort at a site known as &quot;Cataraqui&quot; (generally pronounced ) in 1673. The outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later Fort Frontenac, became a focus for settlement. After the Conquest of New France (1759–1763), the site of Kingston was relinquished to the British. Cataraqui was renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and Loyalists began settling the region in the 1780s.

Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10, 1841. While its time as a capital city was short and ended in 1844, the community has remained an important military installation. The city is a regional centre of education and health care, being home to a major university, a large vocational college, and three major hospitals.

Kingston was the county seat of Frontenac County until 1998. Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac. Kingston is the largest municipality in southeastern Ontario and Ontario&#x27;s 10th largest metropolitan area. John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada lived in Kingston.

==History==

===Naming history and etymology===

Cataraqui, Kingston&#x27;s original name, is a derivation of an Indigenous name for the Kingston area. The word may mean &quot;Great Meeting Place&quot;, &quot;the place where one hides&quot;, &quot;impregnable&quot;, &quot;muddy river&quot;, &quot;place of retreat&quot;, &quot;clay bank rising out of the water&quot;, &quot;where the rivers and lake meet&quot;, &quot;rocks standing in water&quot;, or &quot;place where the limestone (or clay) is&quot;.

Cataraqui was referred to as &quot;the King&#x27;s Town&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Town&quot; by 1787, in honour of King George III. The name was abbreviated to &quot;Kingston&quot; in 1788. Cataraqui today is an area around the intersection of Princess Street and Sydenham Road, where the village of Cataraqui (formerly known as Waterloo) was located. Cataraqui is also the name of a municipal electoral district.

===Early Indigenous habitation===

Archaeological evidence suggests people lived in the Kingston region as early as the Archaic Period (about 9,000–3,000 years ago). Evidence of Late Woodland Period (about 500–1000 AD) early Iroquois occupation also exists. The first more permanent encampments by Indigenous people in the Kingston area began about 900 AD. The group that first occupied the area before the arrival of the French was probably the Wyandot people (Hurons), who were later displaced by Iroquoian groups.

At the time the French arrived in the Kingston area, Five Nations Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) had settled along the north shore of Lake Ontario. Although the area around the south end of the Cataraqui River was often visited by Iroquois and other groups, Iroquois settlement at this location only began after the French established their outpost. By 1700, the north shore Iroquois had moved south, and the area once occupied by the Iroquois (which includes Kingston) became occupied by the Mississaugas, a subtribe of the Anishinaabe, who had moved south from the Lake Huron and Lake Simcoe regions.

===French settlement and Fort Frontenac===
European commercial and military influence and activities centred on the fur trade developed and increased in North America in the 17th century. Fur trappers and traders were spreading out from their centres of operation in New France. French explorer Samuel de Champlain visited the Kingston area in 1615.

To establish a presence on Lake Ontario for the purpose of controlling the fur trade with local indigenous people, Louis de Buade de Frontenac, Governor of New France established Fort Cataraqui, later to be called Fort Frontenac, at a location known as Cataraqui in 1673. The fort served as a trading post and military base, and gradually attracted indigenous and European settlement. In 1674, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle was appointed commandant of the fort. From this base, de La Salle explored west and south as far as the Gulf of Mexico. The fort was rebuilt several times and experienced periods of abandonment. The Iroquois siege of 1688 led to many deaths, after which the French destroyed the fort, but would rebuild it. The British destroyed the fort during the Battle of Fort Frontenac (Seven Years&#x27; War) in 1758 and its ruins remained abandoned until the British took possession and partially reconstructed it in 1783. The fort was renamed Tête-de-Pont Barracks in 1787. It was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870–71 and is still being used by the military. It was renamed Fort Frontenac in 1939. Partially reconstructed parts of the original fort can be seen today at the western end of the La Salle Causeway.

===Loyalist settlement===

In 1783, Frederick Haldimand, governor of the Province of Quebec directed Major Samuel Holland, Surveyor-General of Quebec, to lay out a settlement for displaced British colonists, or Loyalists, who were fleeing north because of the American Revolutionary War and &quot;minutely examine the situation and site of the Post formerly occupied by the French, and the land and country adjacent&quot;. Haldimand had originally considered the site as a possible location to settle loyal Mohawks. The survey would also determine whether Cataraqui was suitable as a navy base since nearby Carleton Island on which a British navy base was located had been ceded to the Americans after the war. Holland&#x27;s report about the old French post mentioned &quot;every part surpassed the favorable idea I had formed of it&quot;, that it had &quot;advantageous Situations&quot; and that &quot;the harbour is in every respect Good and most conveniently situated to command Lake Ontario&quot;. Major John Ross, commanding officer of the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York at Oswego partly rebuilt Fort Frontenac in 1783. As commander, he played a significant role in establishing the Cataraqui settlement.

To facilitate settlement, the British Crown entered into an agreement with the Mississaugas in October 1783 to purchase land east of the Bay of Quinte. Known as the Crawford Purchase, this agreement enabled settlement for much of the eastern section of the north shore of Lake Ontario. With the completion of the Mississauga agreement, settlement could proceed, although the planning of the layout of the townsite had not waited for the completion of the negotiations. The area was surveyed, and the survey report mentioned the area was deemed to have productive lands, abundant resources, a good harbour and an existing townsite. These requirements were considered ideal to settle the Loyalists. Three kinds of refugee Loyalists would settle at Cataraqui: &#x27;associated&#x27; or &#x27;incorporated&#x27; Loyalists who were organized into companies under militia officers, provincial colonial regiments and their dependents, and unincorporated Loyalists who came to Canada independently.

Many Loyalist refugees had at first settled on Carleton Island, and operated businesses there. When the Island was ceded to the United States after the Revolutionary War, these Loyalists, along with their businesses, relocated to Cataraqui.

Notable Loyalists who settled in the Cataraqui area include Molly Brant (the sister of Six Nations leader Joseph Brant); businessman and political figure Richard Cartwright; John Stuart, a clergyman, missionary and educator who arrived in 1785; and militia captain Johan Jost Herkimer. A group of Loyalists from New York State, led by Captain Michael Grass who arrived in 1784 after sailing from New York and up the St. Lawrence River, established a camp south of Fort Frontenac at Mississauga Point. The first name given to the settlement by the Loyalists was King&#x27;s Town, which would eventually develop into the current appellation.

The first high school (grammar school) in what later became the province of Ontario was established in Kingston in 1792 by Loyalist priest John Stuart, which evolved into Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute.

===War of 1812, and development===

During the War of 1812, Kingston (with a population of 2,250) was a major military centre. It was the base for the Lake Ontario division of the Great Lakes British naval fleet, which engaged in a vigorous arms race with the American fleet based at Sackets Harbor, New York for control of Lake Ontario. The Provincial Marine quickly placed ships into service and troops were brought in. A Royal Naval detachment built warships in order to control Lake Ontario. Fortifications and other defensive structures were built. The first Fort Henry was built during this time to protect the dockyards in Navy Bay. This fort was replaced by a more extensive fort on Point Henry in 1813. The present limestone citadel, constructed between 1832 and 1836, was intended to defend the recently completed Rideau Canal (opened in 1832) at the Lake Ontario end as well as the harbour and the naval dockyard. In 1843, the advanced battery overlooking the lake to the south was completed when the casemated commissariat stores and magazines were built. Fort Henry was garrisoned by British until 1871. It was restored starting in 1936 and is a popular tourist attraction, now part of a World Heritage Site.

Kingston&#x27;s location at the Rideau Canal entrance to Lake Ontario made it the primary military and economic centre of Upper Canada after canal construction was completed in 1832. It was incorporated as a town in 1838; the first mayor of Kingston was Thomas Kirkpatrick. Kingston had the largest population of any centre in Upper Canada until the 1840s. Kingston was incorporated as a city in 1846.

Kingston became an important port as businesses relating to transshipment, or forwarding, grew. Since Kingston was at the junction of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, commodities shipped along the lake from the west such as wheat, flour, meat, and potash were unloaded and stored at Kingston to await transfer to vessels that could navigate the risky St. Lawrence. With the completion of the Rideau Canal, cargoes could be transported in a safer fashion since the St. Lawrence River route could be bypassed. The canal was a popular route for transporting lumber.

Regiopolis College (for training priests) was incorporated in March 1837, and in 1866 the college was given full degree-granting powers, although these were rarely used and the college closed in 1869. The building became the Hotel Dieu Hospital in 1892. The college reopened at another location in 1896. Queen&#x27;s University, originally Queen&#x27;s College, one of the first liberal arts universities, first held classes in March 1842; established by the Presbyterian Church, it later became a national institution. The Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) was founded in 1876.

Kingston Penitentiary, Canada&#x27;s first large federal penitentiary, was established in 1835 and operated until 2013. Several more prisons would be established in later years in the greater Kingston area, including the federal Prison for Women (1930, closed in the 1990s), Millhaven Penitentiary, Collins Bay, Frontenac (which amalgamated with Collins Bay in 2013), and Joyceville Institutions.

During the Upper Canada Rebellion, 1837–38, much of the local militia was posted in Kingston, under Lt. Col. Richard Henry Bonnycastle who completed construction of the new Fort Henry.

===As Canada&#x27;s first capital===
Governor General Lord Sydenham chose Kingston as the first capital of the united Canadas, and it served in that role from 1841 to 1844. The first meeting of the Parliament of the Province of Canada on June 13, 1841, was held on the site of what is now Kingston General Hospital. The city was considered too small and lacking in amenities, however, and its location near the border made it vulnerable to American attack. Consequently, the capital was moved to Montreal in 1844, and it alternated between Quebec City and Toronto from 1849 until Ottawa, then a small lumber village known as Bytown, was selected as the permanent capital by Queen Victoria. Subsequently, Kingston&#x27;s growth slowed considerably and its national importance declined.

In 1846, with a population of 6,123, Kingston was incorporated as a city, with John Counter as the first mayor. By that time, there were stone buildings, both residential and commercial. The market house was particularly noteworthy as &quot;the finest and most substantial building in Canada&quot; which contained many offices, government offices, space for church services, the post office, the City Hall (completed in 1844) and more. Five weekly newspapers were being published. Fort Henry and the marine barracks took up a great deal of space. Kingston Penitentiary had about 400 inmates. (The prison opened in 1835, with a structure intended to reform the inmates, not merely to hold or punish them.) Industry included a steam grist mill, three foundries, two shipbuilders, ship repairers and five wagon makers; tradesmen of many types also worked here. All freight was shipped by boat or barges and ten steamboats per day were running to and from the town. Five schools for ladies and two for boys were operating, and the town had four bank agency offices. There were ten churches or chapels and the recently opened Hotel Dieu hospital was operated by sisters with the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph as a charity.

Both Hotel Dieu and Kingston General Hospital (KGH) cared for victims of the typhus epidemic of 1847. The KGH site held the remains of 1,400 Irish immigrants who had died in Kingston in fever sheds along the waterfront, during the typhus epidemic of 1847, while fleeing the Great Famine. They were buried in a common grave. The remains were re-interred at the city&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in 1966. In 1995, KGH was designated a National Historic Site of Canada, because it is &quot;the oldest public hospital in Canada still in operation with most of its buildings intact and thus effectively illustrates the evolution of health care in Canada in the 19th and 20th centuries&quot;.

In 1848, the Kingston Gas Light Company began operation. (Gas lamps would be used until 1947.) By that time, the town was connected to the outside world by telegraph cables.

The Grand Trunk Railway arrived in Kingston in 1856, providing service to Toronto in the west, and to Montreal in the east. Its Kingston station was north of downtown. Kingston became an important rail centre, for both passengers and cargo, due to difficulty travelling by ship through the rapids-and-shoal-filled river.

By 1869, the population had increased to 15,000, and there were four banks. There were two ship building yards.

Kingston was the home of Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald. He won his first election to Kingston City Council in 1843, and would later represent the city for nearly 50 years at the national level, both before and after Confederation in 1867. One of his residences in Kingston, Bellevue House, is now a popular National Historic Site of Canada open to the public, and depicting the house as it would have been in the 1840s when he lived there.

In the early hours of April 18, 1840, a dock fire, fanned by high winds, spread to a warehouse containing between 70 and 100 kegs of gunpowder. The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city&#x27;s downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick. This rebuilding phase was referred to as &quot;the Limestone Revolution&quot; and earned the city the nickname &quot;The Limestone City&quot;.

===20th century===

The Canadian Locomotive Company was in the early 20th century the largest locomotive works in the British Empire and the Davis Tannery was at one time the largest tannery in the British Empire. The tannery operated for a century and was closed in 1973. Other manufacturing companies included the Marine Railway Company, which built steamboats; the Victoria Iron Works, which produced iron in bars from scrap; several breweries; a distillery; and two soap and candle manufacturers. (By the start of the 21st century, most heavy industry would leave the city and their former sites would be gradually rehabilitated and redeveloped.)
A telephone system began operation in Kingston in 1881; at that time the population was 14,091. Electricity was not available in Kingston until 1888.

Kingston grew moderately through the 20th century through a series of annexations of lands in adjacent Kingston Township, including a 1952 annexation of some which encompassed areas west to the Little Cataraqui Creek (including the village of Portsmouth), where a number of large residential subdivisions were built in the late 1950s and early &#x27;60s.

Kingston&#x27;s economy gradually evolved from an industrial to an institutional base after World War II. Queen&#x27;s University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of St. Lawrence College was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen&#x27;s. The city&#x27;s economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.

Municipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding townships, which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the city was amalgamated with Kingston Township and Pittsburgh Township to form the new City of Kingston. The city&#x27;s boundaries now encompass large rural areas north of Highway 401 and east of the Cataraqui River.

===21st century===
The La Salle Causeway bridge that spans the Cataraqui River between downtown and Fort Henry was demolished by the Government of Canada after an engineering error during refit work in 2024 led to its collapse.

==Military history==
Kingston, being strategically located at the head of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River near the border with the United States, has been a site of military importance since Fort Frontenac was built in 1673. The French and, later, the British established military garrisons. The War of 1812 led to the bolstering of military troops, the servicing of ships, and the building of new fortifications to defend the town and the Naval Dockyard. Forts were constructed on Point Henry and at Point Frederick. A picket wall, or stockade, incorporating five blockhouses was built to the west of the town, and batteries were constructed. In November 1812 American naval forces attacked the British sloop Royal George in Kingston harbour but the ship took refuge in the harbour and the American forces withdrew.

Several defensive fortifications were constructed in the late 1840s because of tensions with the United States. These include Fort Henry, four Martello towers (Cathcart Tower, Shoal Tower, Murney Tower, and Fort Frederick), and the Market Battery. Military ships were built at the Naval Dockyard at Point Frederick from 1788 to 1853. The peninsula near the entrance of the later Royal Military College of Canada was the headquarters of the Royal Navy in between 1813 and 1853. (Fort Frederick, built in 1812–13, was also on this peninsula.)

After the British army withdrew from most locations in Canada in 1870–71, two batteries of garrison artillery were formed by the Dominion Government; the &quot;A&quot; Battery was in Kingston at Fort Henry and Tête du Pont Barracks (Fort Frontenac). (The other battery was in Quebec City) The batteries were also schools of gunnery. Designated as the &quot;Regiment of Canadian Artillery&quot;, the regular component evolved into the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery. Most of its battery remained housed at Tête du Pont Barracks until 1939.

Following the withdrawal of British forces from Canada in 1870–71, the federal government recognized the need for an officer training college in Canada. In 1874, during the administration of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, enabling legislation was passed. Located on Point Frederick, the site of the former Royal Naval Dockyard,

Before a formal college was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, students underwent a military course in 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Kingston. The school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company&#x27;s Officer. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867.

The withdrawal of imperial troops required a Canadian location for the training of military officers. Because of Kingston&#x27;s military tradition and the fact several military buildings already existed at the old naval dockyard, Point Frederick was chosen as the location for Canada&#x27;s first military college, the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC). The facility, called simply The Military College until 1878, opened on Point Frederick with 18 students in 1876 under Lt.-Col. Edward O. Hewett, R.E. providing cadets with academic and military training. In 1959, it became the first military college in the Commonwealth with the right to confer University degrees.

Located east of Kingston&#x27;s downtown, the army&#x27;s Camp Barriefield, now McNaughton Barracks, was constructed at the beginning of the World War I and expanded during the World War II. Camp Barriefield was named in honour of Rear-Admiral Robert Barrie (May 5, 1774 – June 7, 1841), a British naval officer noted for his service in the War of 1812. It was later named McNaughton Barracks after Andrew George Latta McNaughton, a former minister of national defence. Nearby Vimy Barracks was established in 1937 for the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (later the Royal Canadian School of Signals). Vimy and McNaughton Barracks house the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics (CFSCE), the Canadian Forces&#x27; military communications training centre and several other units. McNaughton Barracks and Vimy Barracks make up most of Canadian Forces Base Kingston (CFB Kingston). Major military facilities supported by CFB Kingston include Fort Frontenac, on the site of the original fort, and the Royal Military College of Canada.

The Princess of Wales&#x27; Own Regiment has been a fixture in the City of Kingston since 1863. The PWOR operates as a Primary Reserve Regiment, its members drawn from the Kingston and area community.

During World War I, the 21st Battalion was formed and saw action in France in 1915 resulting in 18 battle honours including their role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery also fought in Europe with the 2nd Canadian Division, taking part in 13 major battles. Fort Henry became an internment camp for enemy aliens from August 1914 to November 1917.

During World War II the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders (SD&amp;G), mobilized in June 1940. During fighting, troops that had formed in Kingston received recognition from the government for their achievements. Fort Henry was again an internment camp (Camp 31) from September 1939 to December 1943. A military aerodrome, RCAF Station Kingston, was constructed to the west of Kingston to support flying training.

==Heritage sites==
Kingston is known for its historic properties, as reflected in the city&#x27;s motto of &quot;where history and innovation thrive&quot;. Including World Heritage Sites, National Historic Sites, Provincially Significant sites, municipally designated heritage properties, and listed or non-designated heritage properties, the city has 1,211 properties listed in the heritage register it maintains pursuant to the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;.

In 2007, the Rideau Canal, along with the fortifications at Kingston, was designated a World Heritage Site, one of only 15 such sites in Canada.

There are 21 National Historic Sites of Canada in Kingston.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada, Kingston had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Kingston CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
In 2021, 82.4% of Kingston residents were white/European, 13.4% were visible minorities and 4.2% were Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (3.4%), Chinese (2.4%), Black (2.0%), Arab (1.2%), and Latin American (1.0%).
*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

===Religion===

In 2021, 65,490 Kingston residents, or about half of the population, were members of Christian groups; the largest were Roman Catholics, who numbered 30,385 (23.5%), the United Church of Canada (8,575 or 6.6%), and the Anglican Church of Canada (8,600 or 6.7%).

The Presbyterian Church was particularly influential in the 19th-century development of Kingston post-secondary education. The church was a founder and financial supporter of Queen&#x27;s University until 1912 when it was agreed the university should become a secular institution. John A. Macdonald was also a member of St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Kingston.

The religious history of the city can still be seen in the monumental stone churches throughout the downtown core, some of which now serve as community and co-working spaces. Newer churches in the city, like Reunion Kingston, tend to seek rental options rather than build new physical spaces.

Groups other than Christians and the non-religious include Muslims (3,375 or 2.6%), Hindus (1,670 or 1.3%), and Jews (875 or 0.7%).

55,355 people, or 42.9% of the population, identified as non-religious.

==Government==
=== Municipal ===
For its municipal government, the city is divided into 12 wards; each elects one councillor. All voters in the city cast ballots for the mayor, currently Bryan Paterson, an economics professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. Paterson was re-elected in the 2022 Ontario municipal elections for the 2022–2026 term.

The councillors elected for the same term were:

* Gary Oosterhof – Countryside District (acclaimed)
* Paul Chaves – Loyalist-Cataraqui District
* Lisa Osanic – Collins-Bayridge District
* Wendy Stephen – Lakeside District
* Don Amos – Portsmouth District
* Jamshed (Jimmy) Hassan – Trillium District
* Brandon Tozzo – Kingscourt-Rideau District
* Jeff McLaren – Meadowbrook-Strathcona District
* Vincent Cinanni – Williamsville District
* Conny Glenn – Sydenham District
* Gregory Ridge – King&#x27;s Town District
* Ryan Boehme – Pittsburgh District

On November 20, 2018, Kingston City Council received Report 18-384 which presented the results of the 2018 ranked choice ballots referendum question and outlined potential next steps. The Municipal Elections Act requires that at least 50 percent of the total number of eligible electors in the municipality must vote on the referendum question in order for the results to be &quot;binding&quot;. Based on the official 2018 election results the number of eligible electors was 83,608. The total number of electors that voted on the referendum question was 32,803 or 39.2 percent of eligible electors. Since 50 percent of eligible electors did not vote on the referendum question, the results are not &quot;binding&quot; on Council. Of the electors that voted on the referendum question, 62.9 percent were in favour of using ranked choice voting to elect the mayor and district councillors. Although the result of the referendum question is not &quot;binding&quot;, Council has directed staff to initiate the process to implement ranked choice voting for the 2022 municipal election.

A by-law to establish ranked choice elections has not been passed to elect City of Kingston Mayor and District Councillors. The required ranked choice Voting Bylaw would have to be passed by May 1, 2021. The Ontario provincial government introduced in October 2020 Bill 218, &quot;Supporting Ontario&#x27;s Recovery and Municipal Elections Act, 2020,&quot; which revoked the regulation that would allow municipalities to conduct elections using ranked ballots. The Bill received Royal Assent on November 20, 2020.

=== Provincial ===


In provincial elections, the city consists of one riding, Kingston and the Islands formed after the 1999 redistribution, incorporating half of the former Frontenac-Addington and most of the former Kingston and the Islands riding.
=== Federal ===
Kingston is part of two federal ridings. Most of the city is in Kingston and the Islands, created in 1966 from Kingston and parts of Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington and Prince Edward—Lennox. A small portion north of Highway 401 is in Lanark—Frontenac—Kingston, which was created by the 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution and was legally defined in the 2013 representation order. It came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election on October 19, 2015.
==Economy==
Kingston&#x27;s economy relies heavily on public sector institutions and establishments. The most important sectors are related to health care, higher education (Queen&#x27;s University, the Royal Military College of Canada, and St. Lawrence College), government (including the military and correctional services), tourism and culture. Manufacturing, and research and development play a smaller role than in the past. The private sector accounts for half of Kingston&#x27;s employment. One of Kingston&#x27;s major industrial employers of the 20th century, the Canadian Locomotive Company, closed in 1969, and the former Alcan and DuPont operations employ far fewer people than in the past. But due to the city&#x27;s central location between Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Syracuse, NY a trucking and logistics warehousing industry has developed.

According to the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, the major employers in Kingston as of October 2023 were:

* Queen&#x27;s University 9,352
* Canadian Forces Base Kingston 8,500
* Kingston Health Sciences Centre 5,953
* Limestone District School Board 3,400
* Correctional Service of Canada 2,500

===Tourism===
According to Statistics Canada, the tourism industry in Kingston represents a vital part of the city&#x27;s economy. In 2004, over 3,500 jobs were contributed to Kingston&#x27;s economy due to the tourism industry. The tourism industry has been at a healthy growth rate and has become one of the most performing sectors of Kingston. Unique opportunities are presented for this industry in this time of shifting travel trends and the baby boomer generation. The success of Kingston&#x27;s tourism industry is heavily dependent on information about travellers; however, data availability still remains a challenge.

Kingston has launched several tourism campaigns including Downtown Kingston! and Yellow Door. The city launched a campaign to attract more traffic to downtown Kingston. The campaigns mission statement promises, &quot;to promote downtown Kingston as the vibrant and healthy commercial, retail, residential, and entertainment centre of our region, attracting more people to live, shop, work and gather&quot;. The downtown area of Kingston is known as the central business district, and is the gathering place for various events including the Kingston Buskers Rendezvous, FebFest, the 1000 Islands Poker Run and The Limestone City Blues Festival.

Alternatively, Yellow Door promotes tourism to the entire city. The goal of the campaign is to increase the consumer&#x27;s exposure to Kingston tourism, while remaining financially reasonable. A yellow door was used as a metaphor for Kingston – and the good times people have – and used street workers to gather potential tourists from nearby Toronto and Ottawa. &quot;Yellow Door&quot; promotes interest by offering potential tourists a trip to Kingston. In 2013, Yellow Door received the Tourism Advertising Award of Excellence for the marketing and promotion of an Ontario tourism product.

===Attractions===
TripAdvisor users rate the following among the best attractions in and near the city: Canada&#x27;s Penitentiary Museum, Fort Henry (Fort Henry National Historic Site), Wolfe Island (via ferry), Bellevue House National Historic Site, City Hall and the downtown waterfront nearby.

==Culture==

Kingston hosts several festivals during the year, including the Kingston WritersFest, Limestone City Blues Festival, the Kingston Canadian Film Festival, Artfest, the Kingston Buskers Rendezvous, Kingston Jazz Festival, the Reelout Queer Film Festival, Feb Fest, the Wolfe Island Music Festival, the Skeleton Park Arts Festival, Kingston Pride, Día de los Muertos Kingston Festival, and The Kick &amp; Push Festival.

Kingston is home to many artists who work in visual arts, media arts, literature, and a growing number who work in other time-based disciplines such as performance art. The contemporary arts scene in particular has two long standing professional non-profit venues in the downtown area, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre (founded 1957), and Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre (founded 1977). Local artists often participate in the exhibition programming of each organization, while each also presents the work of artists from across Canada and around the world – in keeping with their educational mandates.

Comedian and actor Dan Aykroyd has a residence just north of Kingston and is a frequent face in town. He was briefly a minor partner in a restaurant called Aykroyd&#x27;s Ghetto House Café on upper Princess Street during the 1990s which prominently featured a Blues Brothers&#x27; car projecting out from the second story wall.

==Education==

Kingston is the site of two universities, Queen&#x27;s University and the Royal Military College of Canada, and a community college, St. Lawrence College. According to Statistics Canada, Kingston has the most PhD holders per capita of any city in Canada.

===Queen&#x27;s University===

Queen&#x27;s University is one of Ontario&#x27;s oldest universities and offers a variety of degree programs. The university was founded in 1841 under a royal charter from Queen Victoria. It has an enrolment of over 31,000 students. Queen&#x27;s Main Campus is rather self-contained, but is within close walking distance of downtown Kingston, making it a pedestrian-friendly university for students and faculty alike.

===Royal Military College of Canada===

The Royal Military College of Canada, established in 1876, is Canada&#x27;s only military university (&quot;Collège Militaire Royal&quot; in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, is a military college), providing academic and leadership training to officer cadets, other members of Canada&#x27;s armed forces and civilians. There are 1,100 undergraduate students and 500 full- and part-time graduate students.

===St. Lawrence College===

St. Lawrence College offers baccalaureate degree programs at its Kingston campus in behavioural psychology, industrial trades, microelectronics, nursing, and business administration (the latter via a partnership with Laurentian University), in addition to certificate, diploma, and advanced diploma programs.

===Primary and secondary education===
The Limestone District School Board serves students in the City of Kingston and the counties of Frontenac and Lennox and Addington. Along with the Limestone School of Community Education, which provides adult education and training programs, approximately 21,000 students attend 70 elementary and secondary schools along with supporting education centres. The Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board serves students of the Roman Catholic faith. Approximately 12,800 students attend 36 elementary schools and five secondary schools in this district. The Catholic high schools in the immediate Kingston area include Regiopolis Notre-Dame and Holy Cross Catholic High School. The francophone community is served by two school boards, the Conseil des écoles publiques de l&#x27;Est de l&#x27;Ontario and the Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est, each providing one secondary school in the area.

Secondary schools in Kingston:

* Bayridge Secondary School
* École secondaire catholique Marie-Rivier
* École secondaire publique Mille-Îles
* Frontenac Secondary School
* Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School
* Kingston Secondary School
* La Salle Secondary School
* Leahurst College High School
* Loyalist Collegiate and Vocational Institute
* Regiopolis-Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School
==Correctional institutions and facilities==
Kingston has the largest concentration of federal correctional facilities in Canada. The facilities are operated by the Correctional Service of Canada. Of the nine institutions in the Kingston area, seven are within the city&#x27;s municipal boundaries.
* Kingston Penitentiary (maximum security) (Officially closed September 30, 2013).

* Regional Treatment Centre (multi-level security), co-located within Kingston Penitentiary
* Joyceville Institution (medium security)
* Pittsburgh Institution (minimum security), co-located with Joyceville
* Collins Bay Institution (medium security)
* Frontenac Institution (minimum security), co-located with Collins Bay

Until 2000, Canada&#x27;s only federal correctional facility for women, the Prison for Women (nicknamed &quot;P4W&quot;) was also in Kingston. As a result of the report of the &quot;Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston&quot;, the facility was closed in 2000. Queen&#x27;s University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen&#x27;s Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; Queen&#x27;s found the required upgrades difficult to finance. In 2018, Queen&#x27;s University sold the property to Siderius Developments, which in 2024 divided it into blocks to begin residential development.

In September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a National Historic Site of Canada in February 1990 due to its history and reputation. In its early years, the prison had a vital role in constructing the city. The prison brought prosperity to Kingston, and along with eight other prisons being built in the area, helped create an impressive local economy.

==Geography and climate==

Kingston is within the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone, and is dominated in the Kingston area by a mixture of deciduous and coniferous tree species and abundant water resources. The region is underlain mostly by Ordovician limestone of the Black River Group.

Being within hardiness zone 5, Kingston has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). It has cooler summers and colder winters than most of Southern Ontario. Although proximity to Lake Ontario has a moderating effect on the climate, it also tempers the heat and can on occasion increase precipitation, especially during heavy snowfall events. Mild to strong breezes blowing off Lake Ontario make Kingston one of the most consistently windy cities in Canada, especially near the water. As a result of the moderation the all-time high is a relatively modest recorded on July 9, 1936. However, due to the humidity, the humidex values on such hot days is normally very high. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Kingston was on February 17, 1896.

The central part of the city is between the Cataraqui River to the east and the Little Cataraqui Creek to the west, with outlying areas extending in both directions. The eastern part of the city is accessible by the La Salle Causeway on Highway 2.

Major features of Kingston&#x27;s waterfront include Flora MacDonald Confederation Basin, Portsmouth Olympic Harbour, Collins Bay, Wolfe Island, Garden Island, the Cataraqui River (including the Inner Harbour and, within that, Anglin Bay).

==Sports==

===Hockey===
Kingston lays claim to being the birthplace of ice hockey, though this is contested. Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote &quot;Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.&quot; Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen&#x27;s University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for Lorne Carr-Harris, under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.

The Memorial Cup, which serves as the annual championship event for the Canadian Hockey League, began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian James T. Sutherland. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1923.

Kingston is represented in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) by the Kingston Frontenacs. Kingston had a team in the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL), the Kingston Voyageurs but ceased after the 2018–19 season.

The International Hockey Hall of Fame, was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the Kingston Memorial Centre (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston&#x27;s west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada. The museum&#x27;s collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston&#x27;s role in the history of hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey&#x27;s oldest sweater worn by a Queen&#x27;s student in 1894, and Canada&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.

Slush Puppie Place, in the downtown core, opened in February 2008, and serves as home ice for the Frontenacs. The Voyageurs played at the Invista Centre in the city&#x27;s west end.

===Sailing===
The city is known for its fresh-water sailing, and hosted the sailing events for the 1976 Summer Olympics. CORK – Canadian Olympic-training Regatta, Kingston – now hosted by CORK/Sail Kingston Inc. is still held every August. Since 1972, Kingston has hosted more than 40 World and Olympic sailing championships. Kingston is listed by a panel of experts among the best yacht racing venues in the US, even though Kingston is in Canada.

Kingston sits amid excellent cruising and boating territory, with easy access to Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence River, and the Thousand Islands, including the St. Lawrence Islands National Park.

Kingston is also home to the youth sail training ship called the &quot;St. Lawrence II&quot;.

During the summers, the RMC campus in Kingston plays host to a Royal Canadian Sea Cadets camp called HMCS &quot;Ontario&quot;, which provides sail training along with much other training to youth from across Canada. The Kingston Yacht Club in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.

===Diving===
Kingston is known for fresh-water wreck diving. Kingston&#x27;s shipwrecks are well preserved by its cool, fresh water, and the recent zebra mussel invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.

===Lawn bowling===
The Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport&#x27;s beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914. While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond. Most notable of these was Dick Edney, who was inducted into the Kingston and District Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

===Golf===
The Kingston area has eight golf courses, two of which are entirely public. The Kingston Golf Club, established in 1884, was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Golf Association in 1895; however, this club ceased operating in the mid-1920s. The first winner of the Canadian Amateur Championship that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at Cataraqui Golf and Country Club (founded in 1917 and redesigned by Stanley Thompson in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). Matt McQuillan, a professional player on the PGA Tour for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the Garrison Golf and Curling Club. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus Edmonton Open on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour.

===Curling===
Three curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf &amp; Country Club, Garrison Golf &amp; Curling Club, and the Royal Kingston Curling Club. The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993. In 2006, the RKCC moved to a new facility at 130 Days Road, to make way for the construction of a new complex at Queen&#x27;s University, the Queen&#x27;s Centre.

Kingston has a history of hosting major curling competitions. In 2020, Kingston hosted the Tim Hortons Brier, the national men&#x27;s curling championship. Kingston previously hosted the Brier in 1957. In 2013, Kingston hosted the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the national women&#x27;s curling championship.

===Rugby===
The Kingston Panthers Rugby Football Club (KPRFC) was founded in 1959, and from that moment onward has established a reputation as a strong community player. KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the Ontario Rugby Union (ORU), and Rugby Canada (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at Twin Elm Rugby Park in Ottawa, Ontario.

===Football===
The earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the Kingston Granites which played in the predecessor league to the Canadian Football League, the Ontario Rugby Football Union, (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the Ottawa Rough Riders 8–0. Kingston also hosted the 10th Grey Cup on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams&#x27; main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.
Many notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:

===Volleyball===

The Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015. It is a non-profit organization, a member of the Ontario Volleyball Association (OVA), Volleyball Canada (VC). The club relies on fundraising in order to operate.

===Soccer===
Kingston formerly had a soccer team called the Kingston Clippers who played in League1 Ontario with both a men’s and women’s side.

<text>Lane is a city in Franklin County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 241.

== History ==
The first temporary settlement near what would become Lane occurred in 1838 when Rev. Robert Simerwell established a Baptist Mission Station &quot;on the south side of Pottawatomie Creek&quot; following the Potawatomie Trail of Death. When the Federal Government moved the Potawatomie (and the Baptist Mission) to the Kansas River valley in the mid-1840s, brothers William, Peter, and &quot;Dutch&quot; Henry Sherman were left as the first permanent settlers. The community was known as Dutch Henry&#x27;s Crossing because a wagon road forded the creek near the Sherman cabin.

The area of Lane west of Kansas Avenue was originally laid out under the name Shermanville in 1855. It was renamed Lane in 1863 for James H. Lane, a leader of the Jayhawkers abolitionist movement, who served as one of the first Senators from Kansas.

When the Missouri Pacific Railroad arrived in 1879, a competing community, called either Emerson or Avondale, was laid out east of Kansas Avenue. Within two years the competition between the two towns ceased, and both townsites had merged into the single community of Lane. Lane was incorporated as a city in 1908.

Lane is near the site where in 1856, the abolitionist John Brown and four other of his followers hacked five pro-slavery men, one of whom was William Sherman, to death with broadswords near Mosquito Creek and Pottawatomie Creek. The event is commonly referred to as the Pottawatomie massacre.

<text>Ottawa (pronounced ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Franklin County, Kansas, United States. It is located on both banks of the Marais des Cygnes River near the center of Franklin County. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 12,625. It is the home of Ottawa University.

==History==
===19th century===
The name derives from the Ottawa tribe of Native Americans, on whose reservation the city was laid out. In the spring of 1864, title to the land was obtained from the tribe through treaty connected to the founding of Ottawa University, the Ottawa having donated 20,000 acres of land to establish and fund a school for the education of Indians and non-Indians alike. The word Ottawa itself means &quot;to trade&quot;. In 1867, the Ottawa tribe sold their remaining land in Kansas and moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
On the last day of March 1864, J.C. Richmond built the first non-Indian settlement in the new town, at the corner of Walnut and First streets.

===Flooding===
Ottawa has a history of flooding because of its location straddling the Marais Des Cygnes river. The area&#x27;s first recorded flood was the Great Flood of 1844. In 1928, a flood crested at 38.65 feet and killed six people. Other flood years include 1904, when water crested at 36 feet and ran to a man&#x27;s shoulders in the Santa Fe depot; 1909, cresting at ; 1915, cresting at , and 1944, cresting at .

However, it is the Great Flood of 1951 which is the most famous. It was about five inches higher than the 1928 flood. The flood of 1951 affected much of Missouri and Kansas and 41 people died. One-third of Ottawa was covered because of this flood.

It is unlikely Ottawa will suffer major damage due to a flood again thanks to a series of levees and pumping stations built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s, which is part of a larger system of flood systems to regulate the Marais Des Cygnes River to the Missouri River. The levees built along the river are inspected on an annual basis to insure their quality.

===20th century===
In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were brought to Kansas and other Midwest states to help solve the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war. Large internment camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Ottawa.

==Geography==
Ottawa straddles the Marais des Cygnes River and is located southwest of Kansas City at the junction of U.S. Route 59 and K-68. U.S. Route 50 and Interstate 35 bypass Ottawa to the south and east, while business US-50 passes through the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===

<text>Junction City is a city in and the county seat of Geary County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 22,932. Fort Riley, a major U.S. Army post, is nearby.

==History==

Junction City is so named from its position at the confluence of the Smoky Hill and Republican rivers, which forms the Kansas River.

In 1854, Andrew J. Mead of New York of the Cincinnati-Manhattan Company, Free Staters connected to the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company planned a community there called Manhattan (there was also a discussion to call it New Cincinnati). When the steamship &quot;Hartford&quot; delivering the immigrants could not reach the community because of low water on the Kansas River, the Free Staters settled 20 miles east in what today is Manhattan, Kansas. The community was renamed Millard City for Captain Millard of the Hartford on October 3, 1855. It was renamed briefly Humboldt in 1857 by local farmers and renamed again later that year to Junction City. It was formally incorporated in 1859.

In 1923, John R. Brinkley established radio station KFKB (which adopted the slogan &quot;Kansas First, Kansas Best&quot;) in nearby Milford, Kansas, using a 1 kW transmitter. It was one of the first radio stations in Kansas. Brinkley used the station to espouse his belief that goat testicles could be implanted in men to enhance their virility.

Among Junction City&#x27;s residents is film director Kevin Wilmott, whose movies, including Ninth Street, are set in Junction City. Ninth Street specifically refers to a bawdy area of the community that was frequented by Fort Riley soldiers in the 1960s. In the 1980s a major initiative was undertaken to clean up the Ninth St. area.

<text>Ulysses (pronounced ) is a city in and the county seat of Grant County, Kansas, United States. It is named after Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,788.

==History==
===Early History===
In 1831, south of the future site of Ulysses, Kansas, then a part of Northern Mexico Territory, mountain man and explorer Jedediah Smith was killed by Comanche warriors, on May 27, 1831. The first Ulysses, town, founded in June 1885, was located approximately two miles east of present-day Ulysses. Approximately six weeks later Ulysses&#x27; first newspaper, the &quot;Grant County Register&quot;, began publication.

From February 1892 through August 1893, Ulysses had two weekly newspapers, the &quot;Ulysses Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Grant County Republican&quot;; both papers were political in nature. The &quot;Grant County Republican&quot; represented the Republican Party, and the &quot;Ulysses Tribune&quot; represented the Alliance Party. The &quot;Grant County Republican&quot; constitutes the predecessor of the current-day &quot;Ulysses News&quot;, which claims to be Grant County&#x27;s oldest surviving business, although it has operated under numerous names, editor/publishers, and management.

In the &quot;Grant County Register&quot;, Volume 1, #1, dated July 21, 1885, the following story was published:

&quot;Ulysses, everything is newness and bustle, when a month ago on the 7th of June six thousand head of cattle were rounded up on a gentle western slope near a beautiful lake. Now there is a bustling, prosperous young city, and all the country is dotted with settlements. The town company offers fine inducements to all wanting to embark in business, no better location can be found. We have several buildings already up, and a good hotel with 16 rooms.&quot;

Another publication, the Ulysses Tribune, published in March 1887:

&quot;Ulysses is the booming town of old Grant County, Kansas. The old county lines will be established by the present legislature beyond doubt, and Ulysses is bound to be the county seat. Ulysses has more natural advantages than any other town in western Kansas. She is on the direct line of the new east and west railroad, and a railroad is to be built from Lakin south to Ulysses, thus insuring her of two railroads. In other towns water is to be found at a depth of one to three hundred feet, but in Ulysses pure water is found at 30 feet.&quot;

In its prime, &quot;Old&quot; Ulysses boasted four hotels (the most notable, Hotel Edwards, pictured herein, which was moved to &quot;New Ulysses&quot; in 1909, and has been preserved/restored, currently resting on the grounds of The Historic Adobe Museum for Grant County, Kansas today), twelve restaurants, twelve saloons, a bank, six gambling houses, a large schoolhouse, a church, a newspaper office, and an opera house to serve the approximately 1500 residents. When Old Ulysses moved to New Ulysses in 1909, the opera house was set in what is today the front lawn of the current day court house, where it was converted into being the Grant County courthouse, with county offices on the first floor, and high school classes being held on the second floor, until the first dedicated building for a high school was put in service in 1923. During the 1930s WPA era, the current Grant County courthouse was constructed behind it, and this building was destroyed.

According to the &quot;Grant County Register&quot;, in February 1888, the Supreme Court of Kansas declared Ulysses the temporary county seat of Grant County. The county seat status was contested by another early Grant County settlement, Cincinnati, throwing the determination into state courts. During this same general time frame of 1887–1888, Grant County itself was in a state of formation, de-formation, ultimate re-formation and re-organization, with that controversy being resolved and the first officers of Grant County being sworn on June 18, 1888.

The years 1885 through 1888 and the first half of 1889, were boom times and growing years for early day Ulysses; the second half of 1889 brought drought, and the boom began to fade.

===Early 1900s===
By the early 1900s, Ulysses was the last surviving town in Grant County, and by 1906, Ulysses was faced with increasingly hard times and desperation. According to the Grant County History book, the population of Ulysses had dwindled from that of a flourishing town to a hamlet of about 40 people.

24 years later, after the initial founding, in February 1909, the early day residents of &quot;Old&quot; Ulysses began moving the remains of the town to its present location.

The early town of Ulysses had been bonded heavily for improvements that were never made. The bonds were issued and sold and the money pocketed by early grafters. &quot;Old&quot; Ulysses dwindled from a flourishing town of approximately 1,500 residents in the late 1880s to a hamlet of 100 in 1908. Facing a staggering debt of $84,000 (US$ in 2025), for which there was absolutely nothing to show, the situation was desperate.

Some of the bond holders brought suit and took judgments for several thousand dollars against the city for delinquent interest. The citizens of Ulysses were forced to pay a high levy to meet payment on the judgment. This levy included a 600% increase in the realty taxes, and a 362% increase on personal property taxes.

After paying a year of exorbitant taxes, came the decision which few towns make, the citizens decided to take their belongings and move off the old town site, and out of the school district. The unity the citizens displayed in reaching this decision deserves credit, and the determination they displayed in putting this gigantic plan in operation has become a significant portion of Ulysses and Grant County history.

The city fathers moved approximately two miles west, and purchased a quarter of land that was deeded to the New Ulysses Town Company. After the land was surveyed into a new town site, the town began the move. The move began the first of February 1909, and continued for approximately three months. Skids were used to move the larger buildings, and the smaller ones were loaded onto wagons. Horse power was used to move the loads. It was necessary to move these structures downhill, through a large draw, and uphill to the new locations.

It took several days to move some of the buildings. The larger buildings were cut into sections and moved a section at a time. It took 60 horses to move just one section of the old hotel. The courthouse and the post office remained on the old town site until June 1909, when New Ulysses was officially declared the county seat.

The move that began in February was completed in June 1909, when every resident with their homes, business houses and belongings moved from the old town site. The inhabitants moved to the new location, two and one half miles west, crossing the Lakin draw at the bottom of an intervening valley, and built a new town called New Ulysses. Later in 1909, with the move complete, the former citizens left the old town site just as they had found it, a rolling tract of prairie.

In the wee hours of June 10, 1893, Bill Doolin and four members of his gang robbed a train one-half mile east of Cimarron.

In 2016, the Amtrak Southwest Chief was involved in a collision near Cimarron. The train, en route to Chicago from Los Angeles, derailed on a section of track that was damaged by a runaway truck. 28 people were injured in the derailment, which caused over $1.4 million in damage. The tracks were knocked out of alignment the morning before the derailment when a fully loaded truck from Cimarron Crossing Feeders, an adjacent business, ran out of control down a hill leading to the tracks. The truck was removed, but the incident was not reported to local authorities or BNSF, the owner of the tracks.

<text>Horace is a city in Greeley County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 102.

==History==
Horace was established in 1886 when the Missouri Pacific Railroad passed through the area. The city is named after Horace Greeley of Chappaqua, New York, editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Greeley encouraged western settlement with the motto &quot;Go West, young man&quot;.

In 1887, Horace was officially incorporated. When it came time to select the county seat, Horace was a strong candidate, but despite being larger than nearby Tribune, it lost to its eastern neighbor just two miles away. Still, Horace thrived, and by 1888, it had 300 residents, a local newspaper, and a bank.

By the early 1900s, the town featured a brick schoolhouse, a railroad roundhouse, a YMCA building, a hotel, a grocery store, and a Baptist church. None of these buildings remain today.

In 1910, Horace was home to several mercantile businesses, telegraph and express offices, a money order office, and 189 residents. It also continued to serve as a stop on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

A post office was opened in Horace in 1886. The post office closed on December 30, 1965, and, eventually, the train depot shut down as well.

On November 6, 2007, voters in rural Greeley County and in Tribune approved a consolidation of the county and the city. Horace, however, decided against consolidation.

Most of Attica is in Section 3 of Township 32 South of Range 9 West (S3-T32S-R9W) of the 6th Principal Meridian. The land for Attica was purchased from the Osage Land Trust, which also held the surrounding farmland. According to documents from Attica, the Osage Land Trust was held by the US government for the Osage tribe. Settlers could buy tracts of 160 acres (quarter-sections) for $1.25 / acre, and the money would go to the tribe. For reference, some of that land sold in 1909 for $12/acre.

On May 12, 2004, the town was damaged by an F2 tornado that was received widespread coverage on local and national television.

<text>Hesston is a city in Harvey County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,505. Large manufacturing facilities for AGCO (farm equipment) and Stanley Black &amp; Decker (lawn mowers) are located in Hesston. It is home of Hesston College.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and in 1861, Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1872, Harvey County was established within the Kansas Territory which included the land for modern day Hesston.

A post office was established as Elivon on February 10, 1873. It then moved near the current city site on April 24, 1878.

In 1886, Hesston was founded and named after the Hess brothers who owned the land where a depot on the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built. The post office was renamed to Hesston on December 16, 1887. Due to the railroad, Hesston became an important regional shipping point.

===20th century===
In 1909, the Mennonite Church founded the Hesston College, because many of the early settlers were Mennonite farmers.

In 1947, Lyle Yost and Adin Holdemann founded the farm equipment company Hesston Manufacturing Company. In 1991, AGCO Corporation purchased the company. In 1960, John Regier founded the lawn mower company Excel Industries.

In 1981, the Dyck Arboretum of the Plains was founded at the Hesston College.

On March 13, 1990, a large portion of Hesston was damaged by an F5 tornado during a tornado outbreak. A total of 226 homes and 21 businesses were destroyed, and several were swept completely from their foundations. 20 farms were torn apart in rural areas outside of Hesston. Light debris from Hesston was found away in Nebraska. One person died and 59 people were injured. After passing through Hesston, the tornado increased to an &quot;extreme F5&quot; near the city of Goessel. The severity of the damage left behind by this tornado led some meteorologists to believe that the Goessel tornado was among the strongest ever documented at that time.

===21st century===
On February 25, 2016, Hesston became the scene of a mass shooting in which three people were killed and twelve others injured at an Excel Industries building. Prior to that shooting, other shooting incidents occurred at the nearby city of Newton and also Old U.S. Route 81, in which two people were wounded. The shooter was identified as Excel employee Cedric Larry Ford, who was killed by responding police officers.

In 2021, Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired Excel Industries.

==Economy==

The two largest companies in Hesston are AGCO (Hesston Corp) and Excel Industries (Hustler).

In 1947, Lyle Yost founded the farm equipment company Hesston Manufacturing Company. In 1955, it introduced the first commercially available self-propelled windrower, then in 1967 it introduced the first hydrostatic drive windrower. In 1978, it introduced the first large square baler, then in 1988 it introduced the first totally automatically large round baler. In 1974, the Hesston Company commissioned its first belt buckles, which became popular on the rodeo circuit and with collectors. The company&#x27;s controlling stake was sold to Italian corporation Fiat Trattori in 1977. The remainder of the company was purchased in 1987 by the same firm. In 1991, the American-based equipment manufacturer AGCO Corporation purchased Hesston Corporation and later expanded the manufacturing facilities.

In 1960, John Regier founded the lawn mower company Excel Industries. The company manufactures outdoor equipment, primarily Hustler and Big Dog mowers. The original Hustler was the world&#x27;s first twin-lever, zero-turn mower. In 2021, Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired Excel.

==History==
===19th century===

For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1872, Harvey County was founded.

<text>Walton is a city in Harvey County, Kansas, United States. It is named in honor of one of the 19th century stockholders of Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 219.

==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861, Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1872, Harvey County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Walton.

In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia through Walton to Newton, reaching Walton and Newton in July. In 1996, it merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

Walton was laid out as a town site in December 1871 by William Mathews. He built a home, and this was followed by a general store and railroad section house. Because of difficulty in perfecting title to the lots, the town-site remained dormant until it was sold to J.F. Watson and he filed a plat of the town in 1876. In 1871, a Kansas one room school, measuring 18 x 20 feet, was built and the first school was held by Mrs. M. J. Sharron. A post office was established in Walton on December 28, 1871, Mrs. E. Peck as Postmistress.

===20th century===
The New Santa Fe Trail road was routed through Walton in the late 1910s. Initially, the road entered the north side of the city on Walton Ave. The trail became U.S. Route 50 in the late 1930s, when the new highway was routed northeast to southwest parallel to the railroad.

<text>Denison is a city in Jackson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 146.

==History==

===19th century===
Denison was founded as a result of the &quot;Kansas City, Wyandotte and Northwestern Railway&quot; laying tracks that would connect the communities of Valley Falls and Holton. The railroad was slated to come through one mile south of an existing village, Tippinville, and in September 1887, A.D. Walker and Hollis Tucker, land speculators, laid out lots for a new town, which was named after Tucker&#x27;s hometown of Denison, Ohio. Most of the houses and two churches in Tippinville were physically moved to the new townsite, which is primarily in Garfield Township, with a small portion in Cedar Township (it was all Cedar Township at first). By August 1890, Tippinvile had been officially vacated and by 1894 Denison had a population of 150.

A number of Civil War veterans are buried in the Denison Cemetery (and nearby cemeteries, North and South Cedar Cemeteries), and there is one veteran of the Mexican–American War, G. W. White, buried at Denison. Eliza Cody Myers (Mrs. George Myers), sister of William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody is also buried there. It was a truly exciting event for school children when Buffalo Bill came to Denison to visit his niece, Nellie Myers Copas, and her family.

A post office, named North Cedar, was established in 1867. The first school, built of logs, was established in 1858 south of present-day Denison, on the site of the North Cedar Cemetery. The first church in the area, of the Christian denomination was founded in 1856 by the Rev. J.T. Gardiner. The Reformed Presbyterian Church was established in 1871, with the Rev. J.S.T. Milligan the founding pastor; the United Presbyterian Church, in 1880; and the Denison Methodist Episcopal Church, in 1889. The Christian, United Presbyterian and Methodist churches united to become the Denison Union Church in 1958, and later became the Denison Bible Church. The Denison Christian Church building, erected in 1878, now houses the Denison Historical Museum, and is one of three Jackson Co. buildings included in the State Register of Historic Places.

===20th century===
The Denison State Bank was founded in 1901, and after its second robbery, in 1938, was moved to Holton, the county seat, where it thrives today under the same name. The Denison Rural High School was established in 1916, and a brick building was erected. It burned in 1938 and a new school building was completed in 1941. Due to school district unification, the last class to graduate from Denison High School was in 1969. However the school continued to serve lower grades until it closed its doors in 1990. Area students now attend schools in Holton.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Holton is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,401.

==History==
The party that chose the site of Holton started at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in May 1856. A train of six covered wagons, each drawn by two yoke of oxen, started the long trek to take Free State settlers to Kansas. They were financed by the Kansas Society of Milwaukee which was headed by Edward Dwight Holton, the Milwaukee abolitionist. They met General James H. Lane with two hundred men at Nebraska City, Nebraska, a rendezvous for Free State men. They followed the &quot;Jim Lane Road&quot; into Kansas approximately thirty miles. They came to Elk Creek, miles west of Holton, where they cut timbers to make a bridge, crossed it and made camp where Central School now stands. They liked the two streams (later named Banner Creek and Elk Creek) and the pleasant grassy hills, so they decided to stay. A company was organized and a civil engineer who was with them commenced the survey. They named the new town in honor of Holton.

A log house was erected; it was so planned that is could be used for a fort and was known as Jim Lane&#x27;s Fort. In the spring of 1857, J. B. Ingerson surveyed the townsite lots.

The county that contains Holton was previously named Calhoun County for the pro-slavery South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In 1859 the name was changed to Jackson County. Holton was chosen as the county seat in 1858. A frame building served as the first courthouse on the east side of the square, near the middle of the block. The first courthouse was built in the center of the square in 1872. The present courthouse was completed in 1921.

In 1859, the abolitionist John Brown took a group of escaped slaves through Holton, leading to an incident known as the Battle of the Spurs.

In 1859, Holton had seven dwellings, one store, a blacksmith shop and a steam saw mill. The census taken in April, 1857, gave Holton 291 people; in 1860 the population was 1,936. In 1859 the city was incorporated.

In 1879, the residents of Jackson County, Kansas decided to form a university in Holton. It was funded by mining magnate, A. C. Campbell, a former resident who had moved to Utah, and thus named Campbell University. In 1902 it merged with Lane University and became Campbell College. In 1913, it merged with Kansas City University, then later closed in 1933. The former site of the college later became the location of Holton High School.
