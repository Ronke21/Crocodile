<text>Jonesboro () is a city located on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge in the northeastern corner of the U.S. State of Arkansas. Jonesboro is one of two county seats of Craighead County. In 2023, the city had an estimated population of 80,560, making it the fifth-most populous city in Arkansas. In 2020, the Jonesboro metropolitan area had a population of 134,196, and the Jonesboro-Paragould Combined Statistical Area had a population of 179,932.

Jonesboro is the home of Arkansas State University and is the cultural and economic center of Northeast Arkansas.

==History==
The Jonesboro area was first inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. At the time of the European encounter, historic tribes included the Osage, the Caddo, and the Quapaw. The name for the state of Arkansas comes from the Quapaw language. The French and Spanish traders and trappers had relations with those groups.

After the United States acquired this territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, American settlers eventually made their way to an area near Jonesboro. They began exploring, hunting, trapping, and trading with local Indian tribes. The permanent settlement of Jonesboro was established shortly after 1859, when Craighead County was established.

In 1859, land was taken from nearby Greene, Mississippi, and Poinsett counties and was used to form Craighead County. Jonesboro was designated as the original county seat. As the population increased to the west of the county, Lake City was named as the second seat. Jonesboro had 150 residents in 1859. It was named after State Senator William A. Jones in recognition of his support for the formation of Craighead County. Originally spelled &quot;Jonesborough&quot;, the city name was later shortened to its present-day spelling.

In 1881, a young woman was brutally murdered in an apparent robbery. Her father had left their farm for a short while and returned to find her in a pool of her own blood. Four black men were arrested in conjunction with the crime, and after their trial, The Jonesboro Lynching of 1881 took place at midnight on March 12. The &quot;Decatur Daily Republican&quot; reported that the four men, called Green Harris (sometimes referred to as Hawes), Giles Peck, John Woods (sometimes referred to as Jud Woods), and Burt Hoskins (sometimes referred to as Haskins)—had been arrested and tried before magistrates Jackson and Akers at New Haven Church, eight miles north of Jonesboro. The hearing, which found that the men were guilty, was attended by several hundred people. According to this and several other reports, the accused made a complete confession. The magistrates bound them over to the grand jury, and they were ordered taken to the jail in Jonesboro. The hour being late, however, it was decided to hold them overnight in the church under a strong guard. The large crowd gradually dispersed, &quot;muttering threats of vengeance.&quot; Around midnight, between 200 and 300 masked men surrounded the church, overpowered the guards, and broke in the doors and windows. They seized the accused, dragged them to a tree about 200 yards away, and hanged them. Once again, the crowd dispersed, &quot;leaving the bodies of their victims dangling in the air and presenting a horrible spectacle in the moonlight.&quot; According to the &quot;Republican&quot;, &quot;The crime and punishment form one of the blackest pages in the annals of the state.&quot;
During the late 19th century, the city tried to develop its court system and downtown infrastructure. Shortly after the city was named county seat, the highest point in Jonesboro was identified and a courthouse was planned for construction. This was delayed for several years, for the locals did not want to ruin their deer hunting. The first courthouse was finally completed but was destroyed by a fire in 1869. A store across from this site was rented and used as a courthouse. It was destroyed in an 1876 fire. Another building was constructed on the same site, but it fell to a fire in 1878, a major one that destroyed most of downtown Jonesboro. Soon afterward, another courthouse was constructed; it was replaced by the present courthouse in 1934.

The St. Louis Southwestern Railway, known as the Cotton Belt Railroad was constructed through Jonesboro, with its tracks passing just north of the center of the city. During the first train&#x27;s journey, it became stuck and supplies had to be carried into town. It connected St. Louis to points in Arkansas and Texas. Other major railways began to construct tracks to and from Jonesboro, including the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway and Missouri Pacific Railroad. Some of the rail companies still own and use the tracks that run through Jonesboro.

The city set up the Jonesboro School District in 1899. In 1900, St. Bernard&#x27;s Regional Medical Center was established by the Olivetan Benedictine Sisters. The Grand Leader Department Store, the first department store in the city, was opened in 1900. Woodland College and two schools within the Jonesboro School District were opened in 1904. Arkansas State College (now Arkansas State University) was established in 1909, a year in which the first horseless carriages were driven in the city. There is a recording on a Sanborn Fire Insurance Map dating back to March 1897 of a Presbyterian Church existing at the corner of Church St. and Monroe, and a Christian church located at the corner of Union and Huntington Ave. Other early churches of the city were started in the 1910s. First Baptist Church was founded in 1911, and First Methodist Church in 1916.

Wade Thomas was lynched on December 26, 1920, in downtown Jonesboro. A large white mob seized Thomas after he allegedly shot local Patrolman Elmer Ragland during a Christmas Day raid on a local dice game. He was paraded through the town and then hanged and his body riddled with bullets.

On September 10, 1931, Governor Harvey Parnell authorized the Arkansas National Guard to be deployed in Jonesboro to quell the Church War, a clash between the followers of Joe Jeffers and Dow H. Heard, the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Jonesboro. Jeffers&#x27; supporters also attacked the mayor and police chief, resulting in front-page coverage of the incident in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On May 15, 1968 an F4 tornado struck Jonesboro, destroying 164 homes. At least 34 people died and more than 350 people were injured as a result of the tornado which struck the town without warning at 10:00pm that night.

On May 27, 1973, shortly after midnight, an F4 tornado struck Jonesboro, killing 3 and injuring 289. Damage was estimated at 60 million in 1973 dollars.

The 1998 Westside Middle School shooting occurred on March 24. Two young boys (aged 11 and 13 years) fired upon students at Westside Middle School while hidden in woodlands near the school. They killed four students and one teacher, and injured 10 persons.

In the 2007–2008 school year the Jonesboro Public School District elementary schools were reclassified as magnet schools.

==History==
The city of Monette was initially settled in 1898, when the Jonesboro, Lake City and Eastern Railroad bypassed the town of Stottsville (about a mile away from the town&#x27;s present location, founded by Adam Stots in the 1870&#x27;s) in 1898. Settlers and businessmen in Stottsville decided to relocate to the new railroad. The first train arrived in Monette on August 19, 1898, and the town was incorporated two years later on July 3, 1900.
On December 10, 2021, a large and violent EF4 tornado part of a large tornado outbreak struck Monette. One person was killed at a nursing home on the north side of town.

==Geography==

The St. Francis Lowlands are a flat region mostly covered with row crop agriculture today, though also containing sand blows and sunken lands remaining from the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. Waterways have mostly been channelized, causing loss of aquatic and riparian wildlife habitat. The St. Francis Sunken Lands Wildlife Management Area, which preserves some of the bottomland hardwood forest typical of this ecoregion prior to development for row agriculture lies just west of Monette along the St. Francis River.

<text>Alma is a city in Crawford County, in far western Arkansas, United States. It is located within the Arkansas River Valley at the edge of the Ozark Mountains; the city is the sixth largest in the Fort Smith metropolitan area. The population was 5,419 at the 2010 Census. Interstates 40 and 49 were constructed to intersect near the existing city.

==History==
Alma was incorporated in 1874. Its economy was largely agricultural until the introduction of the canning industry. Today, the city claims the title of &quot;Spinach Capital of the World&quot;.

In his book &quot;Washington Goes to War&quot; (1996), David Brinkley described Alma&#x27;s participation in the World War II effort:

In the town of Alma, Arkansas (population 776), one-fourth of the girls in the 1944 high school graduating class signed up to leave for Washington, and several of their teachers cast aside their low-paying jobs and went with them, all of them climbing aboard a Pullman car for their first train ride, looking for more money and excitement than they had any reasonable expectation of finding in Alma.
 Many people migrated from small towns to the capital seeking jobs as the government and associated businesses expanded to run the war effort.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.06%, is water.

Alma is located in south-central Crawford County and has no airport. The train station, which fell into a state of dilapidation, was torn down in the early 1970s.

Much of its commerce derives from interstate highway traffic, as Interstates 40 and 49 (previously 540), as well as U.S. Routes 64 and 71, pass through the city.

The city gets its water supply from Lake Alma, which is located above the city on the northeast. The lake was formed by a tall earthen dam that blocks Little Frog Bayou. Lake Alma is the reservoir that supplies the city&#x27;s tap water.

Alma developed along the border between the Boston Mountains and the Arkansas River Valley. While most of the city lies on flat land, immediately to the north is scenic hill country. Alma is surrounded by several rural towns, including Rudy to the north, Dyer and Mulberry to the east, and Kibler to the southwest.

<text>Earle is a city in Crittenden County, Arkansas, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,831.

==Geography==

Earle has a total area of , all land.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The city of Earle originally started as two neighboring communities started in the 1860s, Earle and Norvell. Norvell was originally settled in July 1872 by local doctor James Throgmorton. Earle was a train stop established in the late 1880s on land owned by Josiah Francis Earle, a former Confederate soldier and Klansman. The train stop was established after his death in 1884.

=== Reconstruction period ===
In 1888, a branch of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, &amp; Southern Railway was built south of Earle. The line still exists as a part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The town had two lumber company-owned railroads connect to it in the early 1900s, the Crittenden Railroad and the Tyronza Lumber Company Railroad.

=== Early 20th century ===
Originally, the Earle post office was located within Norvell. The move caused some controversy in the two communities, and in 1904 an altercation took place between the former and then current men who owned the land the post office sat on. John Watt, who formally controlled the post office, shot the current owner, W.M. Brown. Watt was later acquitted of the Brown&#x27;s murder.

From its formal incorporation in 1905 to the 1940s, Earle was one of the largest towns in Crittenden County. Referred to by locals as the &quot;Pearl of the St. Francis,&quot; for many years the town was a center of industry and an important transportation hub for the Arkansas Delta.

One of the more notable residents of Earle was George Berry Washington. Born into slavery in 1864, Washington established a thriving business as a landlord, and through this enterprise provided a means of income for hundreds of Black Arkansans. In 1928, the widow and family of local figure George Berry Washington had a monument, known as &quot;the Angel in the Field&quot;, built to honor Washington&#x27;s life.

In 1918, an African-American man named Elton Mitchell was eviscerated with a knife and hanged from a tree after he refused to work for a white landowner for free.

=== Modern era ===
A merger of Norvell and Earle was proposed as early as 1913. In 1978, the two towns were formally merged.

==== 2008 tornado ====
On May 2, 2008, WMC-TV reported that a tornado which was reported to be large and very dangerous affected the Earle area causing major damage in parts of the town and some injuries. There were reports of people missing or unaccounted for. Homes were reportedly destroyed, while businesses and the high school were damaged. The tornado was later confirmed on the same day as an EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with winds near 150 to 160 mph.

The 2022 Earle mayoral election resulted in a historic victory for Jaylen Smith, who at 18 years old became the youngest Black person to be elected mayor in any U.S. city.

<text>Marion is a city in and the county seat of Crittenden County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 12,345 at the 2010 census, a 38.7% increase since 2000. The city is part of the Memphis metropolitan area. It is the second largest city in Crittenden County, behind West Memphis.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Although Marion was incorporated in 1896, the community predates that significantly. The site of Marion was part of Louisiana (New Spain) from 1764 to 1803, when it became Louisiana (New France). Some of the oldest land titles in the area are from Spanish land grants from a time prior to the Louisiana Purchase. After the Louisiana Purchase the area was part of the Arkansas Territory. During the 1830s the Trail of Tears (the forced removal of Native Americans from Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi) passed through the area.

In 1837, two commissioners had been appointed by Crittenden county court to select a site for a new county seat. County residents Marion Tolbert and his wife Temperance gave a deed to the commissioners &quot;for the county of Crittenden for county purposes&quot; on June 25, 1837. A town was laid out and named Marion in honor of the man who gave the land for the site. The town of Marion was officially made the county seat of Crittenden County, Arkansas.

Soon after the county seat was moved from its first location of Greenock on the Mississippi River to Marion, a wooden frame building was constructed in the town for holding court. At an unknown point, the building was destroyed by a tornado. In the late 1850s, the first railroad in the state of Arkansas, the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad, laid tracks 5.5 miles south of the town.

=== American Civil War and after ===
During the American Civil War the steamboat &quot;Sultana&quot; was destroyed in an explosion on April 27, 1865, as it was transporting released Union POWs near Mound City, just east of Marion. It is estimated that 1,500 soldiers and crew were killed, the largest loss of life in a maritime accident in US history. This tragedy is commemorated by a historic marker placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

By 1873, construction started on a two-story brick county courthouse in Marion. This building burned in 1908 and was later replaced with the current brick courthouse. The initial contract for the courthouse and jail was $60k, and due to unknown circumstances construction took many years to finish. In the 1880s, the town received its first proper railway connection when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway built a line through the town to make a connection between St. Louis, Missouri and Memphis.

In 1954, a local Black man, Isadore Banks, was murdered by a mob in the town. He was chained to a tree, covered with gasoline and burned. Nobody was ever charged in the killing.

=== Incorporation ===
The city of Marion was officially incorporated on March 5, 1896.

==Geography==

Marion is located in eastern Crittenden County. According to the United States Census Bureau, Marion has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.37%, is water. It is bordered by the city of West Memphis to the south and by Sunset and Clarkedale to the north.

Ecologically, Marion is located on the border between the Northern Backswamps (west Marion) and Northern Holocene Meander Belts (east Marion) ecoregions within the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The Northern Backswamps are a network of low-lying overflow areas and floodplains historically dominated by bald cypress, water tupelo, overcup oak, water hickory, and Nuttall oak forest subject to year-round or seasonal inundation. The Northern Holocene Meander Belts are the flat floodplains and former alignments of the Mississippi River, including levees, oxbow lakes, and point bars. Much of the wetlands and riverine habitat have been drained and developed for agricultural or urban land uses. The Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge, which preserves some of the year-round flooded bald cypress forest typical of this ecoregion prior to development for row agriculture lies north of Marion.

Marion is west of Memphis, Tennessee, which has a humid subtropical climate.

<text>West Memphis is the largest city in Crittenden County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 24,520 at the 2020 census, ranking it as the state&#x27;s 20th largest city. It is part of the Memphis metropolitan area, and is located directly across the Mississippi River from Memphis, Tennessee.

==History==
===Pre-European habitation===
Native Americans lived in the Mississippi River Valley for at least 10,000 years, although much of the evidence of their presence has been buried or destroyed. The people of the Mississippian Period were the last indigenous inhabitants of the West Memphis area. Mound City Road, located within the eastern portion of the West Memphis city limits, has a marker indicating that the villages of Aquixo (Aquijo) or Pacaha were in the area. Several mounds are still visible.

===European exploration and settlement===
Explorers from both Spain and France visited the area near West Memphis. Among those explorers were Hernando de Soto and his men from Spain and Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet from France. By the time French hunters and explorers entered the region, the Mississippian towns and other settlements had been abandoned. The original site of West Memphis came from Spanish land grants issued during the 1790s. Grants were given to Benjamin Fooy, John Henry Fooy, and Isaac Fooy in the Hopefield (Crittenden County) area and to William McKenney in the Bridgeport-West Memphis area.

===Early history===
In the summer of 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto crossed the Mississippi River into what is now Crittenden County with an army of over 300 conquistadors and almost as many captured Native American slaves. The Spanish found the land to be the most densely populated that they had seen since starting their journey on the Florida coast, two years earlier. The Spanish expedition departed Arkansas two years later, leaving behind numerous Old World diseases. It was 130 years before Europeans visited this region again. The French expedition of Joliet and Marquette in 1673 found none of the towns or people that the Spanish had documented; all that remained were the many mounds that still dot the landscape along the rivers and creeks. The original inhabitants, like the later settlers, were drawn to this region because of its fertile river bottom soil, abundant game, and thick forest.

====First European settlement====
The earliest recorded immigrant to the area was Benjamin Fooy, a native of Holland, who was sent in 1795 by the Spanish governor of the large area claimed by Spain to establish a settlement on the Mississippi River. He chose a location across the river from present-day Memphis. In 1797, the Spanish established Campo de la Esperanza, which was a small fort along the Mississippi River. The Spanish abandoned the fort in 1802 and the area took its English translation &quot;Field of Hope&quot;, which eventually became known as Hopefield shortly after the United States took possession of the Louisiana Territory.

===Crittenden County===
Crittenden County is bounded on the east by the Mississippi River and was established in 1825, eleven years before Arkansas became a state. Named after Robert Crittenden, the first secretary of the Arkansas Territory, the county had a population of 1,272 in 1830. Hopefield became the eastern terminal for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad in 1857. However, the Civil War forced a halt to track construction just east of the St. Francis River in 1861.

===Civil War and the end of Hopefield===
During the summer of 1862, Memphis fell into the hands of the Union forces. Most Confederate soldiers were ferried across the river to Hopefield, Arkansas, and surrounding farms. Many of these soldiers were moved on to other battle fronts, but some remained to harass the Union forces and disrupt river traffic. This became such a problem that on February 19, 1863, four companies of Federal forces burned down the entire town. The town of Hopefield was rebuilt after the war but never regained the prominence it once held in Crittenden County. After the St. Francis Levee District began the levee system in the Arkansas Delta during the 1890s, what little remained of Hopefield became part of the Mississippi River flood plain and was washed away.

===First settlement named West Memphis===
An early settlement that was established for ferry operations between Memphis and Arkansas in the early 1880s was given the name West Memphis. This small settlement, located directly south of the present day Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge, never incorporated and died out shortly after ferry traffic ceased due to the completion of the Frisco Bridge across the Mississippi River in 1892. In addition to its lost ferry operations, this area, in the same fashion as its northern neighbor Hopefield, became part of the Mississippi River flood plain in the 1890s.

The entire area usually flooded in the spring until the St. Francis Levee District was established in 1893. However, private landowners along the Mississippi River built levees that were only three or four feet high. In 1912 and 1913, the St. Francis main levee broke, flooding the area from the Mississippi River to Forrest City in St. Francis County. The flood of 1913 was the last time the levee broke in Crittenden County.

===Founding of West Memphis===
After the levee system was built and strengthened, Zack T. Bragg, a lumberman who had been logging in St. Francis County since 1905, purchased 300 acres of virgin timber and established a sawmill in 1914. The mill was located along a railroad spur and a dirt path that would eventually become Missouri Street in West Memphis. Bragg also acquired the timbering rights to thousands of acres of adjacent land clearing the area that eventually gave way to fertile farmland and to the future West Memphis. The area around Bragg&#x27;s Mill was known for the first few years as Bragg, Arkansas. The small community consisted of the mill, a commissary and boarding house, and a few dozen dwellings for workers.
In 1914, another operation began two miles south of Bragg&#x27;s Mill when William H. Hundhausen began plans for the Bolz Slack Barrell Cooperage plant located at the southern end of present-day 8th Street in West Memphis. The Bolz Cooperage, which was a stave mill, purchased a great quantity of acreage for its lumber operation. Within a short time of the mill&#x27;s beginning, a small community developed. In 1917, highways 70 and 61 were established and clearing began through the future West Memphis. With the threat of river flooding diminished by a strengthened levee, the establishment of two lumber operations and the building of two major U.S. highways, the small lumber communities grew rapidly. In 1920 the population was approximately 132 and by 1928, the population had grown to 350. The community incorporated as a city in 1927 with the name West Memphis. Zack T. Bragg, one of the city&#x27;s founders, was elected as the first mayor and served for three consecutive one year terms. William H. Hundhausen, another founder of West Memphis, was elected as its third mayor and served from 1932 to 1944.

===Early 20th century===

The construction of the railroads, the establishment of lumber operations and the construction of two new U.S. highways fueled the growth of West Memphis. In 1930, the population reached 895. By 1940, the population grew to 2,225 and by the 1950 census, the population had more than quadrupled in size to 9,112, making West Memphis the fastest growing city in Arkansas. Due to the rapid growth of the city that grew from thick forests and swamps earlier in the 20th century, West Memphis was nicknamed the &quot;Wonder City&quot; in the mid-1930s.

===20th century growth===
The first automobiles began crossing the Mississippi River at Memphis in 1917 by special roadways constructed on the Harahan Bridge, which was built for rail traffic and opened in 1916. This heralded the growth of the future West Memphis as its main street, U.S. Highway 70, known as Broadway Avenue, brought an influx of automobile traffic through the area. U.S. Highway 61, named Missouri Street in West Memphis, was constructed at the same time and its juncture with Highway 70 would become the epicenter of downtown West Memphis.
West Memphis was officially incorporated in 1927 and continued to grow to become the largest city in Crittenden County. The availability of river and rail transportation transformed West Memphis into the manufacturing and distribution hub of the county. In the 1930s West Memphis, along with the rest of the Mississippi Delta, suffered due to the economic depression. However, the city grew and developed at a record pace. The most notable export of West Memphis from that era was its original blues music. At one time Sonny Boy Williamson, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and B.B. King lived in West Memphis.

The growth and development of the city&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfare, Broadway Avenue, was instigated by the increased traffic and by demand for the industrial products produced and shipped through West Memphis by rail and river. Tourist courts, restaurants, hotels and other amenities geared toward the traveler were constructed along the traffic corridor through West Memphis. During the World War II years, transportation of soldiers and goods by road, river, and rail in the Memphis/West Memphis area created the need for lodging and other services. Construction in 1949 of a second automobile bridge across the Mississippi, connecting Memphis and West Memphis, created another influx of automobile traffic.

The buildings in the 700, 800 and 900 blocks of East Broadway reflect the growth of the city of West Memphis in the years 1930 to 1958. Until the national interstate highway system was opened in the late 1950s, diverting traffic away from former routes through the middle of America&#x27;s towns, West Memphis&#x27; Broadway Avenue was the city&#x27;s center of commerce, with retail stores, tourist courts and hotels and office buildings. Decline of Broadway Avenue was rapid after the traffic through the town diminished with the opening of the interstate highways. Although the three blocks of East Broadway contained in the West Memphis Commercial Historic District remain much as they appeared in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, the remainder of the city&#x27;s major traffic corridor, Broadway Avenue, has changed significantly.

===World War II to the modern era===
In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, 8th Street was often called &quot;Beale Street West&quot;, reflecting a music and nightlife scene to equal that in Memphis. Some places in West Memphis have been associated with entertainers such as B.B. King (who began his public entertaining at the Square Deal Café on South 16th Street) and Elvis Presley (who ate his first breakfast after being inducted into the U.S. Army at the Coffee Cup on East Broadway on March 24, 1958). Other night spots along Broadway Street included Willowdale Inn, the Cotton Club, and the Plantation Inn.

Legal greyhound racing began in the county in 1935. In the years that followed, the track closed several times—once for flooding, another due to World War II, and another time due to fire. However, the business currently known as Southland Park Gaming &amp; Racing on North Ingram Boulevard has been in the same location since 1956 and is now open every day of the week, including 24 hours on weekends.
West Memphis began its role as a trucking hub with the opening of parts of Interstate 55 in the 1950s. With both I-55 and I-40 traveling toward the Mississippi River, West Memphis became known as the &quot;crossroads of America&quot; in the trucking industry. In 1973, a six-lane highway bridge, known as the Hernando de Soto Bridge and located north of the Harahan, opened as part of I-40.

In 1980, Leo Chitman was elected as the city&#x27;s first African American mayor. Current mayor Marco McClendon, who became the youngest West Memphis Mayor to be sworn into office in 2019, is African American as well.

On December 14, 1987, a tornado killed six people and caused approximately $35 million in damage. The town had not recovered from the tornado damage when it flooded from of rain on December 25, 1987. Additionally, of snow fell on January 6, 1988. When the snow began to melt, this added to the already existing flood problems and the destruction caused by the tornado.

Some of the major employers in the city are Schneider National Carriers, Southland Park Gaming &amp; Racing, Family Dollar Distribution, FedEx National LTL, and Robert Bosch Power Tools. Family Dollar Distribution and FedEx National LTL are located in the Mid-America Industrial Park west of the city.

The 1993 murders of three young boys and the subsequent convictions of Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, Jr. brought much unwanted attention to West Memphis. The three young men convicted were known as the West Memphis Three and the case brought about a great amount of public intrigue. Four documentaries have been made about the incident, the first being &quot;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&quot;. Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley were released from jail in 2011 after signing an Alford plea, which allowed them to plead guilty while maintaining their innocence. They were released with time served and placed on probation until 2021.

==Geography==

West Memphis is located in eastern Crittenden County. It is bordered to the north by the city of Marion. A small piece of West Memphis extends south as far as the Mississippi River, but in most places the river is from south or east of the city limits. Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, is east of downtown West Memphis. According to the United States Census Bureau, West Memphis has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.34%, is water.

Ecologically, West Memphis is located on the border between the Northern Backswamps (western part of West Memphis) and Northern Holocene Meander Belts (eastern section of West Memphis) ecoregions within the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The Northern Backswamps are a network of low-lying overflow areas and floodplains historically dominated by bald cypress, water tupelo, overcup oak, water hickory, and Nuttall oak forest subject to year-round or seasonal inundation. The Northern Holocene Meander Belts are the flat floodplains and former alignments of the Mississippi River, including levees, oxbow lakes, and point bars. Much of the wetlands and riverine habitat have been drained and developed for agricultural or urban land uses. The Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge, which preserves some of the year-round flooded bald cypress forest typical of this ecoregion prior to development for row agriculture lies north of West Memphis.

While the crime within West Memphis is typically high, it is relatively average when compared with its far larger neighbor Memphis, the same applies to other cities throughout the same region of the South.

==Economy==
Primarily because of its central location and transportation infrastructure, West Memphis has become a hub for distribution and assembly operations. Healthcare is a noteworthy component of the city&#x27;s economy, including Baptist Memorial Hospital – Crittenden, various clinics, medical suppliers, and nursing homes located in town.

The city lies at the point where two of the nation&#x27;s most heavily traveled interstate highways, Interstate 40 and Interstate 55, intersect with the Mississippi River (a major cargo waterway) and large rail-lines operated by BNSF and Union Pacific. In particular, the Port of West Memphis, owned by the city and slightly south of city center along the Mississippi River, is a deepwater port and facilitates transloading among trucks, barges and trains. It is served by the West Memphis Base Railroad, a three-mile branch line that allows Union Pacific to reach customers at the Port.

Cable television, internet and digital phone service is offered through Comcast. AT&amp;T provides telephone and internet service.

===Distribution centers===
Major operations include distribution centers for retailers such as Family Dollar, Carvana, Bosch Tools and manufacturers such as Stateside Steel &amp; Wire.

===Broadway Boulevard===

Broadway Boulevard is the downtown district for the city of West Memphis. This downtown area has more than 84 stores and restaurants lining the street. Broadway also hosts blues singers and events in the city&#x27;s &quot;Blues on Broadway&quot;.

===Gambling===
West Memphis is one of only two cities in Arkansas (along with Hot Springs) with a venue for parimutuel gambling, antedating the casino developments in nearby Tunica County, Mississippi, by many years.

In the 1990s, Southland Greyhound Park, one of West Memphis&#x27; largest employers, saw its attendance and revenues decline drastically, with a corresponding economic impact on both the town and state. This was largely attributed to the rise of casino gambling in nearby Tunica, Mississippi. By 2002, Southland struggled to survive.

Following an estimated $40 million investment by the park&#x27;s owner and the addition since 2006 of electronic games of skill and video poker machines, Southland has added more than 300 new employees, making it the third largest employer in West Memphis with 660 employees.

<text>Hickory Ridge is a city in Cross County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 272 at the 2010 census. Always a small farming community with an economy based on agriculture, a post office was first established in 1875, but the community did not incorporate until 1949.

==History==
A post office in Brushy Lake Township was named Hickory Ridge on October 5, 1875. The post office was closed shortly thereafter, and the area remained very sparsely populated because the soils were too wet to grow cotton. Following the Cotton Belt railway extension through the settlement around 1882, the community saw prosperity from timber and agriculture; reestablishing the Hickory Ridge post office in 1892.

The city was racially segregated along the railroad tracks (similar to the Delmar Divide), and around 1910, white residents dynamited the black section of town, expelling all black residents. The city became completely white and evolved into sundown town through unwritten rules.

==Geography==
Hickory Ridge is located in northwestern Cross County. U.S. Route 49 passes through the community, leading north to Jonesboro and south to Interstate 40 at Brinkley.

Hickory Ridge is within the Mississippi embayment of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, a flat fertile floodplain of the Mississippi River. In Arkansas, an economic and cultural region roughly following this geography is known as the Arkansas Delta (or &quot;the Delta&quot;). Roughly the western third of Cross County is within the Western Lowlands Pleistocene Valley Train subregion of the Delta. This region is characterized as flat windblown deposits of silty, sandy soils, and loess with a high groundwater table. Post oak and loblolly pine are native in the higher elevations, with overcup oak, water hickory, willow oak, and pin oak and pondberry native in wetlands. Today, row agriculture is extensive (mostly soybeans and cotton), with commercial aquaculture (crawfish, baitfish, and catfish farms) also common.

==Speed Trap==
Parkin has become known as a notorious speed trap for vehicles traveling along Route 64. This has been a problem for many years, with reports stemming back to 2007. A common practice for the police officer is to issue &quot;Inattentive Driving Citations&quot;, breaking Parkin&#x27;s City Ordinance 269. This results in a fine over $275 instead of a normal speeding ticket, and this money goes straight to the city, as they use the city ordinance. This results in over 30% of the city&#x27;s income each year (handing out over 2500 Ordinance 269 violations).

==Education==

The Wynne School District serves Parkin; it operates Wynne High School.

The former Parkin School District merged into the Wynne district on September 7, 2005.

<text>Wynne is the county seat and largest city of Cross County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 8,314 at the 2020 Census. Nestled between the Arkansas Delta and Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, Wynne is the closest city to the second-largest state park in Arkansas, Village Creek State Park.

==Early history==

Wynne was named for Captain Jesse Watkins Wynne, a Texan who achieved the rank of captain in the Civil War at the age of just 21. He was famed for leading a group of his captors up to the Confederate lines, where he then marched them to headquarters as his own prisoners.

In 1867, Captain Wynne moved to St. Francis County, Arkansas, and joined the finance company of Dennis &amp; Beck. At that time, the Dennis &amp; Beck company held savings for other companies and for individuals, but eventually, it became the Bank of Eastern Arkansas, and Wynne became its first president.

From 1880 to 1885, as the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, and Southern Railroad was under construction, active steamboat riverports like Wittsburg, at that time the county seat of Cross County, were deserted for the railroads.

The location of the settlement of Wynne was first chosen in 1882, when a train derailed, leaving one boxcar without wheels and off the tracks. That boxcar was then turned upright as a building, and as a compliment to Captain Wynne, it was designated the &quot;Wynne Station&quot;. On September 27, 1882, the Wynne Station Post Office was opened.

When the east–west railroad line was completed, it crossed the north–south line near the boxcar, and the name &quot;Wynne Junction&quot; became well known in the area. On May 28, 1888, the &quot;Junction&quot; part of the name was dropped, and the town of Wynne was formed.

By the 1890s, the railroad traffic and the resulting activity in Wynne made it a more vibrant town than the town of Vanndale, which had been the county seat since 1886. In 1903, the county seat of Cross County was moved to Wynne.

With the advent of the U.S. Highway System in the 1920s and 30s, U.S. Route 64 was built west from Memphis, through Wynne, and to points west. Also, the north–south Arkansas Highway 1 was built through Wynne, making it an important highway crossroads for several decades, in addition to being a railroad town. Since the advent of the Interstate Highway System, Interstate 40 has largely diverted long-distance travel away from Wynne.

On Friday, March 31, 2023, shortly after 4:30 P.M., an intense EF3 tornado with winds reaching 150 miles per hour struck the community. Four people died and 26 people were injured. Numerous homes and businesses, including Wynne High School, were damaged or destroyed. The tornado was on the ground for 73 miles, dissipating in Tipton County, Tennessee.

==Geography==
Wynne lies in south-central Cross County along the boundary between two distinct geographical areas of Arkansas: the fertile farmland of the Arkansas Delta (which is a part of the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain), and Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, a distinct rise marking the New Madrid Fault Line.

U.S. Route 64 passes through the northern side of the city, leading east to Marion and west to Searcy. Arkansas Highway 1 leads north to Harrisburg and south to Interstate 40 at Forrest City.

<doc id="106955" wikidata="Q80098" url="?curid=106955" title="Fordyce, Arkansas">
<text>Fordyce is a city in southeast Dallas County, Arkansas, United States. Its population has been decreasing since the 1980s when the town reached an all time high of 5,175. The population in 2020 was 3,396 down from 4,300 at the 2010 census, and from 4,799 in 2000.

The city is the county seat, home to the 1911 Dallas County Courthouse.

Within Fordyce there are 19 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Fordyce Home Accident Insurance Company. The town was named for Samuel W. Fordyce.

==History==
Before European settlement the area was inhabited by the Caddo people, whose artifacts are occasionally found. The land that became Fordyce was partially cleared prior to 1850 by W. W. Killabrew, an early settler. In the 1870s the land was owned by an African American named Henry Atkinson who sold it to Dr. Algernon Sidney Holderness for $118, who built the first sawmill in town.
The town of Fordyce was named for Samuel Wesley Fordyce. Little construction took place until 1881 when four railroad lines were constructed in Dallas County, one of which was surveyed by Samuel Fordyce. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company was completed in 1883 under Fordyce&#x27;s management, which he operated for 16 years. The rail line called the &quot;Cotton Belt Line&quot; passed through the town of Fordyce until 1940 when the rail lines were abandoned, and trucks on the roads replaced the trains.

By 1890, Fordyce was the largest town in the county and on April 8, 1908, it became incorporated and the seat of Dallas County.

The Fordyce Lumber Co. was formed in February 1892 by Charles Warner Gates, John Wenzel Watzek and Edward Savage Crossett. Within four years of starting the Fordyce Lumber Co., the partners began the Crossett Lumber Co. in 1899. The city of Crossett is named after Edward Savage Crossett. On March 10, 1907, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&amp;PR) connected the town of Crossett to Fordyce. The (CRI&amp;PR) allowed timber and lumber to move between the sawmills in Crossett to Fordyce that were owned by Charles Warner Gates, John Wenzel Watzek and Edward Savage Crossett.

The first high school football team in the state of Arkansas was started in Fordyce in 1904.

On July 5, 1975, The Rolling Stones band members Keith Richards and Ron Wood were arrested in Fordyce for reckless driving, carrying an illegal weapon- a hunting knife, and less than two grams of cocaine said to belong to a passenger in the car. They drank soda pop at the City Hall and called the British Embassy while a crowd gathered outside, but were released some hours later after paying $162.50 in bail and then they forfeited bond- not appearing on their court date. 31 years later in 2006 Richards was pardoned for the incident by the governor at the time Mike Huckabee.

On June 21, 2024, a mass shooting at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce left four people dead and nine others injured, including two police officers. The shooter was shot by responding police and arrested.

==History==
Arkansas City, since 1879 the county seat of Desha County, was incorporated by the Chicot County Court on September 12, 1873, being then, and for some years later, in Chicot County. From 1879, it grew into a thriving riverport for the next forty years. It had a natural harbor for steamboats and two railways, as well as fourteen saloons and three sawmills. An opera house was moved to Arkansas City in 1891. The building was also used as an unofficial &quot;town hall&quot;; at other times it became a ballroom, and citizens danced to music of groups from Memphis, Tennessee.

Until the flood of 1927, Arkansas City was an important commercial and cultural center and one of the most important ports on the Mississippi River. The flood devastated the settlement. More than 2,000 people had to be rescued. As a result, the riverport closed and made the railroads unnecessary.

<text>Dumas ( ) is a city in Desha County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 4,706 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1870, a planter, merchant and surveyor of French descent, William B. Dumas, bought acres of farmland from the Abercrombie Holmes family. The area was named Watson District and the town continued to develop. Then, the District was renamed Dumas and was incorporated in 1904.

Dumas proudly proclaims itself as &quot;Home of the Ding Dong Daddy&quot;, a reference to the vaudeville song &quot;I&#x27;m a Ding Dong Daddy from Dumas&quot; by Phil Baxter. However, this is up for debate, as the city of Dumas, Texas, also lays claim, with some documentation, to the song being about them.

On February 24, 2007, Dumas was struck by a long-tracked EF3 tornado. Twenty-eight people were injured, and many homes and business were damaged or destroyed. Police said on CNN that &quot;the feed mill was the local employer and now it is gone&quot;. Following the storm, U.S. Senator Mark Pryor criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s response to the recovery and cleanup efforts.

On March 19, 2022, two gunmen killed one person and injured at least 26 others, including six children, at the Hood-Nic Festival, an annual car show held in the city. One suspect was later arrested and admitted to firing a gun at another man present at the festival. The shooter was sentenced to 60 years.

<text>McGehee is a city in Desha County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 4,219 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The history of the city of McGehee and the history of the railroad through McGehee are intricately interwoven. The history of the railroad dates back to 1870 when a railroad was constructed from Pine Bluff southeast through Varner, to Chicot County.

Important in the history of the town of McGehee is the McGehee family which came to the area from Alabama in 1857. Benjamin McGehee, his wife, Sarah, a son, Abner, and daughters Laura and Mary settled on land that is now a part of McGehee. Abner McGehee, son of Benjamin and Sarah McGehee, purchased of land on July 1, 1876, on which the town of McGehee was later to be located.

When the railroad came into McGehee in 1878 and continued south and southwest, people began to move into the area. Abner McGehee constructed a large commissary building and entered the mercantile business to accommodate the new arrivals.

One of the first buildings in the area was a sawmill. The lumber cut in this mill was used to build shotgun-type rent houses.

A post office was established in the McGehee commissary, and in 1879 Abner McGehee became the first postmaster. The post office was named McGehee and served between 400 and 500 people.

An order of incorporation was signed March 5, 1906. The first meeting of the town council was held July 21, 1906.

During World War II, the outskirts of McGehee was the site of an American detention camp used to house Japanese and Japanese-American civilians who had previously lived on the U.S. West Coast.

Today the economy of the area is largely dependent upon agriculture. The railroad has been largely replaced by the trucking industry which hauls farm products from the gins and grain bins of the area to their destination. From a population of 400 in 1879, McGehee has grown into a community of about 5,000 citizens. Port facilities on the Mississippi River are being developed, and the present highway system is rebuilt to accommodate increased traffic.

But the city maintains its connections with the railroads, with both the North Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad and the Arkansas Midland Railroad directly serving McGehee, and the Union Pacific indirectly serving it through interchange with the Arkansas Midland.

==Geography==
U.S. Route 278 passes through the center of town, leading west to Monticello and intersecting U.S. Routes 65 and 165 on the southeast side of town. US 65/165 leads north to Dumas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, McGehee has a total area of , all land.

<text>Monticello ( ) is a college town in, and the county seat of, Drew County, Arkansas. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 9,467. Founded in 1849 in the Arkansas Timberlands near the Arkansas Delta region, the city has long been a commercial, cultural and educational hub for southeast Arkansas.

==History==
===19th century===
When Drew County was founded on December 18, 1849, when the county seat was moved from Rough and Ready. The first courthouse was built in 1851, and a second courthouse was erected in 1857. Two trials were held in that courthouse in March and September 1859 to consider whether the slave Abby Guy ought to be freed. She said that a former master had manumitted her but that years later, she was illegally kidnapped and re-enslaved by his brother. The first trial in her freedom suit resulted in a hung jury, but the second jury of twelve local white men found in her favor. Top lawyers worked on her case, and she married another white man who assisted her. The case was appealed to the state supreme court, which ruled in Guy&#x27;s favor. She was set free as were her children because they were born to a free woman. During the American Civil War, several small skirmishes were fought around Monticello. The Rodger&#x27;s Female Academy was used as a military hospital for Confederate soldiers.

===20th century===

<text>Conway is a city in the U.S. state of Arkansas and the county seat of Faulkner County, located in the state&#x27;s most populous Metropolitan Statistical Area, Central Arkansas. The city also serves as a regional shopping, educational, work, healthcare, sports, and cultural hub for Faulkner County and surrounding areas. Conway&#x27;s growth can be attributed to its jobs in technology and higher education. Conway is home to three post-secondary educational institutions, earning it the nickname &quot;The City of Colleges&quot;.

As of the 2020 Census, the city proper had a total population of 64,134, making Conway the eighth-most populous city in Arkansas. Central Arkansas, the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical Area, is ranked the 76th most populous in the United States with 734,622 people in 2016. Conway is part of the larger Little Rock–North Little Rock, AR Combined Statistical Area, which in 2016 had a population of 905,847, and ranked the country&#x27;s 60th largest CSA.

==History==
The city of Conway was founded by Asa P. Robinson, who came to the area shortly after the Civil War. Robinson was the chief engineer for the Little Rock-Fort Smith Railroad (now the Union Pacific). Part of his compensation was the deed to a tract of land, one square mile, located near the old settlement of Cadron. When the railroad came through, Robinson had deeded a small tract of his land back to the railroad for a depot site. He laid off a town site around the depot and named it &quot;Conway Station&quot; in honor of a famous Arkansas family. Conway Station contained two small stores, two saloons, a depot, some temporary housing, and a post office. Despite being founded as a railroad town, there is currently no passenger service; this is attributed to the increasing emphasis placed on cars.

In 1878, Father Joseph Strub, a priest in the Roman Catholic Holy Ghost Fathers, arrived in Arkansas. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Strub was expelled from Prussia during the Kulturkampf in 1872. He moved to the United States, settling in Pittsburgh, where he founded Duquesne University in October 1878. Difficulties with Bishop John Tuigg led Strub to leave Pittsburgh in late October 1878 to travel to Conway. In 1879, Strub convinced the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad to deed along the northern side of the Arkansas River to the Holy Ghost Fathers in order to found the St. Joseph Colony. This included land on which Father Strub founded and built St. Joseph Catholic Church of Conway. As part of the land deal, the railroad offered land at 20 cents per acre to every German immigrant. In order to attract Roman Catholic Germans to Conway and the surrounding areas, Father Strub wrote &quot;The Guiding Star for the St. Joseph Colony&quot;. In addition to extolling the qualities of Conway and the surrounding area, Father Strub provided information on how best to travel from Europe to Conway. By 1889, over 100 German families had settled in Conway, giving the town many of its distinctively German street and business names.

On April 10, 1965, an F4 tornado struck Conway, causing six deaths and 200 injuries.

<text>Damascus is a town in Faulkner and Van Buren counties of central Arkansas, United States. The population of Damascus was 382 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Damascus is a town located in the Ozark foothills on a plateau surrounded by clear streams along U.S. Highway 65 on the county line between Faulkner and Van Buren counties. It is most known for its proximity to the Titan II missile base that operated from 1963 until 1980, when a missile explosion killed one person and injured twenty-one. Damascus is home to three Baptist churches, a Church of Christ that was built in 1917, and a Methodist church that was built in 1947.

Damascus is also near the Gus Blass Scout Reservation, a Boy Scout Camp of 3,000 acres maintained by the Quapaw Area Council.

===Broken Arrow Incident===

Construction began on a Titan II missile base north of Damascus in 1961; the site became active on December 18, 1963. During routine maintenance in a Titan II silo, an Air Force repairman dropped a heavy wrench socket, which rolled off a work platform and fell toward the bottom of the silo. The socket bounced and struck the missile, causing a leak from a pressurized fuel tank. The missile complex and the surrounding area were evacuated and a team of specialists was called in from Little Rock Air Force Base, the missile&#x27;s main support base. About hours after the initial puncture, fuel vapors within the silo ignited and exploded. The explosion fatally injured one member of the team. Twenty-one other USAR personnel were injured. The missile&#x27;s re-entry vehicle, which contained a nuclear warhead, was recovered intact. There was no radioactive contamination.

Damascus was the site of a nuclear &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; incident on September 18–19, 1980 when a Titan II ICBM exploded NNE of the town, although no radiation was spread as a result of the explosion. An extensive description of the Damascus accident can be found in Eric Schlosser&#x27;s 2013 book: Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety.

<doc id="106971" wikidata="Q79658" url="?curid=106971" title="Greenbrier, Arkansas">
<text>Greenbrier is a city in Faulkner County, Arkansas, United States. It is part of the Central Arkansas region. The population was 5,707 at the 2020 census, up from 4,706 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

Prior to European settlement, Native American tribes, including the Quapaw and later the Cherokee, lived in the area. Several historical figures of the Wild West such as Jim Bowie and Jesse James passed through the Greenbrier region toward Oklahoma and Texas. The Wiley brothers settled near East Fork Cadron around 1818, about east of today&#x27;s Greenbrier. In 1837, Jonathan Hardin settled near the Wiley settlement. Also in the early 19th century, the Casharagos settled north of Greenbrier in the present community of Republican.

Greenbrier is a town that developed from a minor brothel on the Butterfield Stagecoach route into a bustling city. The town was named for the greenbriar vines which grew along the creek through the town. Greenbrier is located north of Conway on Highway 65. Recent years have seen continued growth as Greenbrier becomes a bedroom community for Conway. As early as 1818 settlers were in the vicinity of what is now Greenbrier. Mooresville was given as the name for this fast growing community. It was later changed to Greenbrier when the first post office was established on September 15, 1857. Henderson Moore was the first postmaster.

Greenbrier was incorporated as a town on April 5, 1880, with an estimated population of 300 people. Hardin Township at this time had 886 people and Cadron Township had 2,916 people. 
In 1905 Greenbrier could boast of eight general stores, three grist mills, four cotton gins, a steam sawmill and a shingle mill, three churches, a six-room school building, and 350 people.

There was a period of uncertainty from 1920 to 1940. Floods, droughts, and the Great Depression of 1930-1935 plagued Greenbrier and the social and cultural atmosphere displayed the feelings of uncertainty and dismay. As adjustments were made to the natural physical setbacks, there emerged a conservative type of culture. Some businesses closed permanently, others changed hands several times. Only a few stayed in business the entire period from 1920 to 1940. After 1935 the New Deal ushered in activities that provided employment which gave a new spurt of life.

The next two decades saw a reprieve from the earlier stagnation and people were again motivated to make Greenbrier into a thriving village. The relocation of U.S. Highway 65 through Greenbrier in 1942 gave a real boost to the town. Following the drought of 1950, a rapid movement from cotton to dairy and livestock farming was observed. The income from the average farm tripled.

On September 9, 1949, the townspeople elected Hugh Henry as mayor; P.B. Matthews, recorder; Joe Castleberry, treasurer; and these five aldermen: Div Williams, W.A. Dillaha, Marvin Cantrell, S.C. Case and C.R. Denton. J.A. Dickens was elected marshal. Mayors since 1949 have been: Royce Williams, Howard Lawrence, Percy Matthews (acting due to the resignation of Howard Lawrence), Cecil Garrett, Eddie Garrett (no relation), and D.P. (Press) Kelso.

The population in the incorporated area in 1980 was 1,423.

<doc id="106974" wikidata="Q80159" url="?curid=106974" title="Mayflower, Arkansas">
<text>Mayflower is a city in Faulkner County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 2,234 at the 2010 census, up from 1,631 at the 2000 census. It is located in the Central Arkansas region.

==History==
Mayflower is a small town located along Interstate 40 southeast of Conway (Faulkner County) and northwest of Little Rock (Pulaski County). Located on the southwestern edge of Lake Conway, Mayflower is particularly known for its fishing. Like many of the smaller towns of Faulkner County, such as Vilonia and Greenbrier, Mayflower offers a rural lifestyle within a short drive of Conway and Little Rock, where many of its residents commute to work. It was incorporated as a town in Arkansas on March 6, 1928.

The area’s earliest European settlers were Loyalists, known then as Tories, who moved westward in order to flee the Revolutionary War. Families such as the Flannagins and Massengills arrived around 1778 and settled near the mouth of Palarm Creek. However, local tribes of Native Americans had inhabited this region for centuries, principally the Quapaw. Yet, other indigenous groups were in this area now known as part of the Great Plains Cultural Area.

Like most of Arkansas, the land was heavily wooded and was therefore logged extensively until the turn of the twentieth century. Cotton plantations existed during the American Civil War owing to the river bottom’s fertile soil. This would later give way to sharecroppers and modern farming. This presents the largest source of the local economy today, although some small businesses exist in the town.

The 2013 Mayflower oil spill occurred on March 29, 2013, when an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying heavy crude oil ruptured near Mayflower, spilling thousands of barrels of oil. This caused the evacuation of 22 homes as well as extensive damage to other local properties and the local ecosystem.

===2014 tornado===

Mayflower was hit by a violent EF4 tornado before 8:00 p.m. on April 27, 2014.

==History==
Vilonia was first settled in 1861 as Vilsonia. By 1870, a cottin gin, a gristmill, general stores and a drug store were in Vilsonia. In 1873, an error caused the town name to be changed to Vilonia.

In 1874, the first schoolhouse was built on what is now U.S. Highway 64. In 1879, the first post office was established. In 1887, a blacksmith shop was opened.

===2014 tornado===

On April 27, 2014, in the late evening hours, a violent EF4 tornado passed through Mayflower and continued into Vilonia shortly before 7:50 p.m. (0050 UTC). 16 people were killed, several homes in one subdivision were swept clean off their foundations, a 15-ton fertilizer tank was thrown ¾ of a mile and several businesses were damaged or destroyed, including the new Vilonia Intermediate School, which had been set to open in the fall. The NWS office in Little Rock said that if it had occurred before the Enhanced Fujita scale was implemented in 2007, it would more than likely have been rated F5. There was consideration for upgrading the tornado to EF5 status, but due to the low quality of construction, the EF4 rating stands.

On May 7, 2014, President Barack Obama visited the city to view the damage and reconstruction efforts. With him were Governor Mike Beebe (D), Senator Mark Pryor (D) and Representative Tim Griffin (R).

<text>Charleston is a city in Franklin County, Arkansas, United States, and along with Ozark is one of the two county seats of Franklin County. It is part of the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,494 at the 2010 census, down from 2,965 in 2000.

==History==
Charleston was platted in 1870.

In 1954, Charleston was the first school district in the former Confederate States to implement school integration in response to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. On July 27, 1954, the school board, including President Howard Madison Orsburn, George Hairston, Archibald Schaffer, Herbert Shumate, and Homer Keith, unanimously voted to &quot;disband the Colored School and admit the Colored children into the grade and high school when classes open for the fall semester.&quot; Accordingly, when the schools opened on August 23, 11 black children were in attendance alongside 480 whites. School Superintendent Woodie Haynes made an agreement with the local press not to cover the event, and stonewalled any outside reporters that asked questions. The decision to integrate had financial benefits, as the district had been paying a considerable sum to transport black high school students to Fort Smith, and were able to close the old Rosenwald school. During the Civil Rights era, the city was among a few Southern cities which surprisingly showed little resistance to integration. Charleston suffered some discrimination from other schools and the state; many schools refused to play football against them and the band was denied the opportunity to play in some band competitions. In 1961, the first two black students to graduate from Charleston were Barbara (Williams) Dotson and Joe Ferguson.

<text>Ozark is a city in Franklin County, Arkansas, United States and one of the county&#x27;s two seats of government. The community is located along the Arkansas River in the Arkansas River Valley on the southern edge of the Ozark Mountains. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 3,684.

Incorporated in 1850, Ozark is adjacent to much of Arkansas wine country, and contains a bridge to cross the Arkansas River for travelers heading to points south. The city is also located on Arkansas Highway 23, nicknamed the Pig Trail Scenic Byway, known for its steep drops, sharp curves and scenic mountain views.

The name &quot;Aux Arcs&quot;, later simplified to &quot;Ozark&quot;, was given to this bend of the river by the French explorers when they were mapping out this land.

==History==
Native Americans roamed the area freely before Arkansas was a territory. The Cherokee and Osage lived in this area that would later become attractive to settlers. The Ozark area was frequented by French fur trappers and served as a landmark during European exploration of the area. It was these adventurous souls who gave the area and the rolling mountains that rise there their name, Aux Arcs.

Included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the vicinity became a stopping and crossing point along the Arkansas River. The modern settlement of Ozark was established here in the 1830s, and an important road grew connecting Ozark to Fayetteville, Arkansas, following the route of today&#x27;s Pig Trail Scenic Byway to connect Northwest Arkansas with the river.

Ozark played a role on the Trail of Tears. Steamboats would often stop here in times of low water and Native Americans camped in Ozark before moving to Oklahoma on foot. The waterfront is a designated stop on the Trail of Tears route.

Ozark&#x27;s population grew to about 100 people during the Civil War and served as a Confederate base after the battles of Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove in 1862. In April 1863, Brigadier General William L. Cabell led 900 men from Ozark on an expedition that ended at the Battle of Fayetteville. Ozark became the scene of fighting later that year and again in 1864, where many skirmishes were fought in the vicinity. A monument on the grounds of the Franklin County Courthouse pays tribute to an officer killed just north of town.

Although Ozark prospered over the years, it remained a small city on the river.

The name &quot;Ozark&quot; comes from &quot;Aux Arcs&quot;, the name given to the area and the mountains that rise there by early French settlers. Ozark, Arkansas, was the first community to be incorporated with that name.

In 1991, the campus was renamed Arkansas Valley Technical Institute (AVTI). On July 1, 2003, AVTI merged with Arkansas Tech University to become Arkansas Tech University–Ozark Campus.

== Tourism ==

Downtown Ozark features a number of historic sites. Among these is the old Missouri Pacific Depot, which now serves as a museum and houses many artifacts related to the city&#x27;s history. Murals can be found throughout the city. The quintessential square is filled with window store fronts full of antique and gift shops, crape myrtle shrubs in bloom summer through fall, and a park across from the courthouse.

The old Franklin County Jail features a distinctive stone facade, resembling a medieval castle.

The city serves as the southern access point for the Pig Trail Scenic Byway. This scenic drive begins north of Ozark where Highway 23 enters the Ozark National Forest. The Pig Trail leads drivers through rolling mountain country and past waterfalls, rock formations and the Mulberry River, popular for kayaking and canoeing. Ozark is a popular place for food and rest while exploring the Pig Trail Scenic Byway.

Ozark Lake on the Arkansas River provides plenty of fishing opportunities. Tree-shaded Aux Arc Park stretches along the river from the Ozark Lock and Dam and has a playground, campsites, boat launching ramps and other facilities. Within miles of Ozark are the Mulberry River and White Rock Mountain Recreation Area in the Ozark National Forest.

Ozark is in the heart of Arkansas Wine Country along with the cities of Altus, Wiederkehr Village, and Paris.

== Depictions in cinema ==

In the first season of the reality TV series &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie worked at the Sonic Drive-In in Ozark.
On April 17, 2007, &quot;Late Late Show&quot; host Craig Ferguson mentioned Ozark during his guest appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. While telling Dave a story about travelling the country, Craig said he had stopped in &quot;Ozark, which is a town in Arkansas,&quot; and discovered catfish. It was the first time Ferguson had eaten catfish. He described it as being &quot;a tasty fish&quot;. On June 14, 2007, Ferguson displayed a letter from Mayor Vernon McDaniels, making Ferguson an honorary citizen of Ozark. After becoming an honorary citizen, Ferguson set out to become an honorary citizen of as many U.S. cities as possible and later became an official U.S. citizen, all thanks to Ozark starting the trend. On June 25, 2009, Ferguson again mentioned Ozark during his opening monologue. He told his audience that Ozark was the place to stop for good catfish and described it as a &quot;lovely town&quot;. Ferguson later financed a bond to build a $415,000 turf field for their high school football team in 2010.

==History==
John Cooper, Sr. purchased 400 acres along the South Fork River in 1948 to create a summer retreat for his family.  He soon realized others would also love having a place for their families to retreat, so he began purchasing additional land totaling 2,400 acres. He then began carving out lots for building homes and construction of lakes.  In 1954 he founded Cherokee Village Development Company as the first planned recreation community in the state and one of the first of its kind in the nation.

Cherokee Village was dedicated in June 1955 with one lake and an airstrip.

In 1976 a Suburban Improvement District was formed under the Arkansas State Improvement District Act of 1941; Cherokee Village Suburban Improvement District  (CVSID) provided services such as fire protection, street and public maintenance, police security, parks and recreation. 

In 1997 Cherokee Village (CV) began with the incorporation of Cherokee Village West in the Fulton County portion of the area.  In 1998, the Sharp County portion was annexed and the entire area became a city.  As a result, we are the largest city in the tri-county area of Fulton, Izard and Sharp County.  When CV became a city, CVSID and the city split the duties.  The city is responsible for Police, Fire, Streets, District Court, Planning &amp; Zoning.  CVSID continued to care for the parks and recreation, which includes the golf courses, parks and lakes. 

The city now covers over 13,000 acres with over 300 miles of hard surface roads. 2020 Census has the Cherokee Village population at 4,780 residents.  Cherokee Village has 7 lakes, 2 Golf courses, outdoor pool, marinas, 3 fire stations, many churches, clubs and organizations.  Cherokee Village is a first class municipality governed by a mayor-council form of government.

<text>Mammoth Spring is a city in Fulton County, Arkansas. The population was 929 at the time of the 2020 census and is home to Mammoth Spring, one of the largest natural springs in the world. The location is renowned for its trout fishing.

==History==
The original village site was established in Missouri, near what was called the Harry Turnstall spring, now known as “Old Town.” Despite homesteading efforts by early settlers in the region, the spring was divided into multiple plots. It wasn’t until the arrival of the Frisco Railroad in 1883, which extended its track from Springfield, Missouri, to Memphis, Tennessee, and established a station and depot between the spring and the Spring River, that the town shifted to the Arkansas side of the river.

In 1890, Mammoth Spring was promoted to Memphis investors as an excellent site for construction of major manufacturing operations. At that time the town was home to an upscale resort hotel, &quot;The Nettleton&quot;, said to rival other hotels in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. &quot;The Nettleton&quot; was built by Memphis millionaire Napoleon Hill and operated from 1899 to 1932, when it was destroyed by fire. In 1927, Mammoth Spring became the first town in the region to have electricity, powered by the dams constructed by the Mammoth Spring Improvement Company.

In 1968, the Frisco Railroad discontinued passenger service altogether and the train depot was converted into a museum, an extension of Mammoth Spring State Park. The depot was restored in 1971 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

Hay was sent on a reporting assignment to Mammoth Spring in 1919 when he was invited to a hoedown in a local cabin. There, a fiddle player, a guitar player, and a banjo player performed until dawn. Hay was impressed, and that planted the seed for his later efforts.

<text>Hot Springs is a resort city in the state of Arkansas and the county seat of Garland County. The city is located in the Ouachita Mountains among the U.S. Interior Highlands, and is set among several natural hot springs for which the city is named. As of the 2020 United States Census, the city had a population of 37,930, making it the eleventh-most populous city in Arkansas.

The center of Hot Springs is the oldest federal reserve in the United States, today preserved as Hot Springs National Park. The hot spring water has been popularly believed for centuries to possess healing properties, and was a subject of legend among several Native American tribes. Following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. Incorporated January 10, 1851, the city has been home to Major League Baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as Al Capone, horse racing at Oaklawn Park, the Army and Navy Hospital, and 42nd President Bill Clinton. One of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States, the Assemblies of God, traces its beginnings to Hot Springs.

Much of Hot Springs&#x27; history is preserved by various government entities. Hot Springs National Park is maintained by the National Park Service, including Bathhouse Row, which preserves the eight historic bathhouse buildings and gardens along Central Avenue. Downtown Hot Springs is preserved as the Central Avenue Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city also contains dozens of historic hotels and motor courts, built during the Great Depression in the Art Deco style. Due to the popularity of the thermal waters, Hot Springs benefited from rapid growth during a period when many cities saw a sharp decline in building—much like Miami&#x27;s art deco districts. As a result, Hot Springs&#x27;s architecture is a key part of the city&#x27;s blend of cultures, including a reputation as a tourist town and a Southern city. Also a destination for the arts, Hot Springs features the Hot Springs Music Festival, Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, and the Valley of the Vapors Independent Music Festival annually.

==History==
===Settlement===
Members of many Native American tribes had been gathering in the valley for untold numbers of years to enjoy the healing properties of the thermal springs.

In 1673, Father Marquette and Jolliet explored the area and claimed it for France. The 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded the land to Spain; however, in 1800 control was returned to France until the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

In December 1804, George Hunter and William Dunbar made an expedition to the springs, finding a lone log cabin and a few rudimentary shelters used by people visiting the springs for their healing properties. In 1807, a man named Prudhomme became the first settler of modern Hot Springs, and he was soon joined by John Perciful and Isaac Cates.

On August 24, 1818, the Quapaw Native Americans ceded the land around the hot springs to the United States in a treaty. After Arkansas became its own territory in 1819, the Arkansas Territorial Legislature requested in 1820 that the springs and adjoining mountains be set aside as a federal reservation. Twelve years later, in 1832, the Hot Springs Reservation was created by the United States Congress, granting federal protection of the thermal waters. The reservation was renamed Hot Springs National Park in 1921.

===Civil War===
The outbreak of the American Civil War left Hot Springs with a declining bathing population. After the Confederate forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, the Union troops advanced toward the Confederate city of Little Rock. Confederate Governor Henry M. Rector moved his staff and state records to Hot Springs. Union forces did not attack Little Rock, and the government returned to the capital city on July 14, 1862.

Many residents of Hot Springs fled to Texas or Louisiana and remained there until the end of the war. In September 1863, Union forces occupied Little Rock. During this period, Hot Springs became the prey of guerrilla bands loosely associated with either Union or Confederate forces. They pillaged and burned the near-deserted town, leaving only a few buildings standing at the end of the Civil War.

===Rebuilding===
After the Civil War, extensive rebuilding of bathhouses and hotels took place at Hot Springs. The year-round population soared to 1,200 inhabitants by 1870. By 1873 six bathhouses and 24 hotels and boardinghouses stood near the springs. 
In 1873, Hot Springs became the county seat of the newly formed Garland County. Prior to 1873, the city had been a part of Hot Spring County.
In 1874, Joseph Reynolds announced his decision to construct a narrow-gauge railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs; completion in 1875 resulted in the growth of visitation to the springs. Samuel W. Fordyce and two other entrepreneurs financed the construction of the first luxury hotel in the area, the first Arlington Hotel, which opened in 1875.

During the Reconstruction Era, several conflicting land claims reached the U.S. Congress and resulted on April 24, 1876, Supreme Court ruling that the land title of Hot Springs belonged to the federal government. Protests ensued. To deal with the situation, Congress formed the Hot Springs Commission to lay out streets in the town of Hot Springs, deal with land claims, define property lines, condemn buildings illegally on the permanent reservation (now the national park), and define a process for claimants to purchase land. The commission surveyed and set aside encompassing the hot springs and Hot Springs Mountain to be a permanent government reservation. Another became the Hot Springs townsite, with awarded to claimants. The townsite consisted of 196 blocks and of streets and alleys. The remaining portion of the original four sections of government land consisted of hills and mountains which were mostly unoccupied, and Congress acted on the commission&#x27;s recommendation in June 1880 by adding those lands to the permanent reservation.

===Baseball in Hot Springs===
Hot Springs has a rich baseball history. During the early 20th century, Hot Springs was known for baseball training camps. Often called the &quot;birthplace&quot; of Spring training baseball, Hot Springs first welcomed Major League Baseball in 1886, when the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), brought their coaches and players to the city in preparation for the upcoming season. Chicago White Stockings&#x27; President Albert Spalding, the founder of A.G Spalding, and player/manager Cap Anson introduced the concept of players having training and fitness before the start of the regular season, This move gave credit to Hot Springs being called the &quot;birthplace of spring training baseball&quot;. Both Spalding and Anson liked the city and the natural springs for their players. They first played in an area behind what is now the Garland County Courthouse on Ouachita Avenue at was called the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. Many other teams followed Chicago and began training and playing games in Hot Springs.

The Cleveland Spiders, Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red Sox were among the major league teams that made Hot Springs their home for Spring training. Needing additional venues for teams to play, Whittington Park was built in 1894, followed by Majestic Park in 1908 and Fogel Field in 1912. 134 members of the Baseball Hall of Fame are documented to have trained or played in Hot Springs.

Negro league baseball teams also utilized Hot Springs for spring training. The Pittsburgh Crawfords utilized Fogel Field for spring training from 1932 to 1935. Their roster contained Baseball Hall of Fame Inductees Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Oscar Charleston and Judy Johnson. The Homestead Grays, held spring training at Fogel Field in 1930 and 1931. On their roster were numerous Hall of Fame players: Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Oscar Charleston, Jud Wilson, Bill Foster, Judy Johnson, Smokey Joe Williams, Willie Wells and Cum Posey.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1918, is nicknamed the &quot;Day that changed Baseball Forever.&quot; Boston Red Sox&#x27; pitcher Babe Ruth hit a long Home Run into the Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo that altered the course of baseball history. In the opening exhibition game against Brooklyn at Whittington Park, Ruth (coming off a 24–13 season) was a last-minute replacement at first base, his first time at a position other than pitcher. Ruth hit two long home runs that day while playing the field for the first time. His first home run was a long blast that landed in a wood pile. However, his second Home run is legendary in its record setting length and eventual effect on Ruth. It was a shot that traveled an astonishing estimated 573 feet.

After that day Ruth became a hitter, switching from being just a pitcher. In Hot Springs, Ruth could be seen walking the streets, visiting the bath spas, and gambling at the nearby horse track. There is a Ruth plaque both inside and outside the Alligator Farm, as well as a home plate marker at the former Whittington Park across the street.

The Pittsburgh Pirates trained for over a decade at Whittington Park. Hall of Fame shortstop Honus Wagner became a fixture in the city. As evidence of this, Wagner purchased and donated basketball uniforms and equipment to Hot Springs High School in 1912. The uniforms were in the Pittsburgh Pirates colors of black and gold and subsequently the high school switched permanently to those colors. Wagner also refereed a basketball game for the school that season, something he would later repeat.

In 1952, an 18-year old Hank Aaron played in the Negro American League championship for the Indianapolis Clowns against the Birmingham Black Barons at Majestic Park.

On October 22, 1953, Jackie Robinson played in an exhibition game at Majestic Park. Having broken Major League Baseball&#x27;s color barrier in 1947, Robinson&#x27;s squad played the Negro American League All-Stars that day, losing 14–9.

&quot;The First Boys of Spring&quot; is a 2015 documentary covering the history of Hot Springs Baseball spring training. The film features many Hot Springs historical items and references. Produced by Arkansas filmmaker Larry Foley, it is narrated by Hot Springs area native, actor Billy Bob Thornton. The Foley documentary is aired nationally on the MLB Network, first airing in February 2016.

Today, as part of the Hot Springs Baseball Historic Trail, there are 26 green plaques/markers posted throughout Hot Springs that identify the key people and locations, with an app available to provide live information.

===1913 fire===

On September 5, 1913, a fire broke out on Church Street a few blocks southeast of Bathhouse Row, near the Army and Navy Hospital. The fire burned southeast, away from the hospital, until the wind reversed an hour later. Racing toward the business section, it destroyed the Ozark Sanitarium and Hot Springs High School on its way across Malvern Avenue. Along the way it consumed the Public Utilities plant, which destroyed the firefighters&#x27; water supply. A wide front then was blown toward Ouachita Avenue which destroyed the Garland County Court House. The Hot Springs Fire Department fought alongside the Little Rock Fire Department, which had rushed over on a special train. Despite their efforts, numerous homes, at least a hundred businesses, four hotels, the Iron Mountain Railroad facilities, and the Crystal Theater were destroyed. A rainstorm finally quenched the blaze at Hazel Street. Although Central Avenue was ultimately protected (primarily by desperate use of dynamite), much of the southern part of the city was destroyed. Damage was estimated at $10,000,000 across 60 blocks.

===Formation of the Assemblies of God===
From April 2–12, 1914, several Pentecostal Christian leaders gathered in Hot Springs to form what became known as the Assemblies of God. It has since grown to become one of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States, with 3,146,741 adherents, 12,849 churches, and 36,884 ministers ().

===Gangsters and illegal gambling===
Illegal gambling became firmly established in Hot Springs during the decades following the Civil War, with two factions, the Flynns and the Dorans, fighting one another throughout the 1880s for control of the town. Frank Flynn, leader of the Flynn Faction, had effectively begun paying local law enforcement officers employed by both the Hot Springs Police Department and the Garland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to collect unpaid debts, as well as to intimidate gambling rivals. This contributed to the March 16, 1899, Hot Springs Gunfight. Of the seven Hot Springs police officers who have been killed while in service of the department, three died during that gunfight, killed by deputies of the Garland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. One part-time deputy sheriff was killed also, by the Hot Springs officers.

Along with Bathhouse Row, one of downtown Hot Springs&#x27; most noted landmarks is the Arlington Hotel, a favored retreat for Al Capone.

Hot Springs eventually became a national gambling mecca, led by Owney Madden and his Hotel Arkansas casino. The period 1927–1947 was its wagering pinnacle, with no fewer than ten major casinos and numerous smaller houses running wide open, the largest such operation in the United States at the time. Hotels advertised the availability of prostitutes, and off-track booking was available for virtually any horse race in North America.

Local law enforcement was controlled by a political machine run by long-serving mayor Leo McLaughlin. The McLaughlin organization purchased hundreds of poll tax receipts, many in the names of deceased or fictitious persons, which would sometimes be voted in different precincts. A former sheriff, who attempted to have the state&#x27;s anti-gambling laws enforced and to secure honest elections, was murdered in 1937. No one was ever charged with his killing. Machine domination of city and county government was abruptly ended in 1946 with the election of a &quot;Government Improvement&quot; slate of returning World War II veterans led by Marine Lt. Col. Sid McMath, who was elected prosecuting attorney. A 1947 grand jury indicted several owners and promoters, as well as McLaughlin, for public servant bribery. Although the former mayor and most of the others were acquitted, the machine&#x27;s power was broken and gambling came to a halt, as McMath led a statewide &quot;GI Revolt&quot; into the governor&#x27;s office in 1948. Illegal casino gambling resumed, however, with the election of Orval Faubus as governor in 1954. Buoyed into 12 years in office by his popular defiance of federal court desegregation orders, Faubus turned a blind eye to gambling in Hot Springs. &quot;Variety&quot; explained the status of the casinos in 1959 as follows: &quot;How do these places operate when gambling and mixed drinks are supposedly against the law? Simple. Every week the management appears in local court, pays its fine according to the amount of biz [business] done and goes back to open up.&quot;

Gambling was finally closed down in 1967 by two Republican officeholders, Governor Winthrop Rockefeller and Circuit Judge Henry M. Britt. Rockefeller sent in a company of state troopers to shutter the casinos and burn their gaming equipment. Until other forms of gambling became legal in Arkansas four decades later, Oaklawn Park, a thoroughbred horse racing track south of downtown, was the only legal gambling establishment in Hot Springs and one of only two in the state of Arkansas; the other was the Southland Greyhound Park dog track in West Memphis. Both Oaklawn and Southland remain in operation.

=== Army-Navy Hospital ===

After the Civil War, the idea of establishing an Army-Navy hospital in Hot Springs was advocated by A.S. Garnett, a former Navy surgeon with a local practice, and John A. Logan, a retired Union general turned politician who was a former patient of Garnett&#x27;s. In 1884, Logan persuaded Congress to allocate $100,000 for the purpose. Erected under the supervision of Captain J.W. Jacobs, the 100-bed hospital was built of wood and brick in the &quot;pavilion style&quot; that required patients and clinicians to traverse long distances.

After World War I, Congress granted $1.5 million to build a new facility. Built under Captain Edward George, it could hold 500 patients and contained such cutting-edge technology as an X-ray wing and temperature-controlled morgue. The operating rooms and equipment were thought to be the finest in the country.

Yet after the United States entered World War II, the hospital was once again overwhelmed. The Army and Navy arranged to send some overflow to the nearby Arlington and Majestic hotels. The hospital also trained dentists, surgeons, and pharmacists, and housed the first enlisted medical technician school for the Women&#x27;s Army Corps.The grounds contained a kitchen and living quarters for nurses and physicians. Among the famous people treated at the hospital were Helen Keller and Joe DiMaggio. The hospital was closed on April 1, 1960, likely because local demand dropped. The grounds were sold to the state of Arkansas for one dollar.

===World War II===

The military took over the enormous Eastman Hotel across the street from the Army and Navy Hospital in 1942 because the hospital was not nearly large enough to hold the sick and wounded coming in. In 1944, the Army began redeploying returning overseas soldiers; officials inspected hotels in 20 cities before selecting Hot Springs as a redistribution center for returning soldiers. In August 1944, the Army took over most of the hotels in Hot Springs. The soldiers from the west-central states received a 21-day furlough before reporting to the redistribution station. They spent 14 days updating their military records and obtaining physical and dental treatment. The soldiers had time to enjoy the baths at a reduced rate and other recreational activities. The redistribution center closed down in December 1945 after processing more than 32,000 members of the military. In 1946, after the war, the Eastman was demolished when the federal government no longer needed it.

===21st century===
In 2013, the metro was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of the top &quot;small places for business and careers&quot;, citing a low cost of doing business, high job growth and an educated workforce. The first cannabis dispensary in the state opened in May 2019 in the city.

==Geography==

Hot Springs is located in southeastern Garland County. It sits at the southeastern edge of the Ouachita Mountains and is southwest of Little Rock.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Hot Springs has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.35%, is water.
===Natural springs===
The city takes its name from the natural thermal water that flows from 47 springs on the western slope of Hot Springs Mountain in the historic downtown district of the city. About of water flow from the springs each day. The flow rate is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area. Studies by National Park Service scientists have determined through radiocarbon dating that the water that reaches the surface in Hot Springs fell as rainfall 4,400 years earlier. The water percolates very slowly down through the earth&#x27;s surface until it reaches superheated areas deep in the crust and then rushes rapidly to the surface to emerge from the 47 hot springs.

Hot Springs Creek flows from Whittington Avenue, then is underground in a tunnel beneath Bathhouse Row (Central Ave). It emerges from the tunnel south of Bathhouse Row then flows through the southern part of the city before emptying into Lake Hamilton, a reservoir on the Ouachita River.

=== Tourism ===

====Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo====

Founded on Whittington Avenue in 1902, the Arkansas Alligator Farm and Petting Zoo features approximately 200 alligators. The zoo also contains cougars, turkeys, chickens, wild boars, turtles, bobcats, and ring-tailed lemurs. A petting zoo with goats, emus, llamas, white-tailed deer, pigs, baby alligators, and other animals allows visitors to touch and feed the animals. An alligator feeding show includes educational material about the animals.

====Bathhouse Row, Hot Springs National Park====
Bathhouse Row, consisting of eight turn-of-the century historic buildings, lies within Hot Springs National Park and is managed by the National Park Service. Fordyce Bathhouse was restored in 1989 as the park&#x27;s visitor center and the beginning of restoring all properties on Bathhouse Row. The series of renovations and leasing public spaces to commercial owners became a model for similar projects across the nation.

Buckstaff Bathhouse has been in continuous operation since 1912 and is one of the best-preserved structures on Bathhouse Row. The Buckstaff Bathhouse Company has completed the majority of maintenance and renovation that has occurred without outside funding. The Quapaw was restored by the NPS in 2004, and the renovated structure was leased to Quapaw Baths, LLC, which now operates a modern spa with pools and hot tubs. The Lamar was renovated into offices for park staff and Bathhouse Row Emporium, the park&#x27;s official store. The Superior Bathhouse Brewery and Distillery has occupied Superior Bathhouse since 2012, using hot spring water in its beers and spirits. As of February 2014, the Maurice, Ozark, and Hale bathhouses are all available for rent from the NPS.

Atop Hot Springs Mountain in the park is the Hot Springs Mountain Tower, a observation tower built in 1982.

====Central Avenue====

Along Bathhouse Row is Central Avenue, Highway 7, lined with historic buildings, businesses and tourist attractions. Today preserved by NRHP as Hot Springs Central Avenue Historic District, the district includes 77 contributing properties to the district between Prospect Street and Park Avenue. Included within this district are the 1924 Arlington Hotel, the Medical Arts Building, a 1929 Art Deco high-rise, and the Wade Building, built in 1927 in the neoclassical style.

====Garvan Woodland Gardens====

Founded by the daughter of a lumber and brick magnate in 1985, the botanical garden on Arkridge Road features native Ouachita Mountains flora among rocky streams and waterfalls. Garvan also has a Japanese-themed section with several species native to Japan throughout. The garden is situated on a peninsula jutting into Lake Hamilton and began as Verna Garvan&#x27;s personal garden for decades before being donated to the University of Arkansas landscape architecture department.

====Historic hotels and districts====
Thirteen of Hot Springs&#x27;s hotels are individually listed by the NRHP within the city, with more being listed as contributing properties within other districts. Four of Hot Springs&#x27; neighborhoods are preserved as historic districts by the National Register of Historic Places, and the city also contains five historically important commercial districts in addition to the aforementioned Bathhouse Row and Central Avenue Historic District.

The city contains several historic hotels, including the Arlington Hotel, Jack Tar Hotel and Bathhouse, Mountainaire Hotel Historic District, Park Hotel, and the Riviera Hotel. During Hot Springs&#x27; heyday, several tourists visiting the city stayed at motor courts, the precursor to today&#x27;s hotels. The NRHP recognizes seven of these motels as culturally and historically significant: Bellaire Court Historic District, Cottage Courts Historic District, Cove Tourist Court, George Klein Tourist Court Historic District, Lynwood Tourist Court Historic District, Parkway Courts Historic District, Perry Plaza Court Historic District, and the Taylor Rosamond Motel Historic District.

The Fordyce-Ricks House Historic District at 1501 Park Avenue includes three buildings on formerly owned by Samuel W. Fordyce, a prominent businessman and railroad executive who moved to Hot Springs in 1876. The house and outbuildings are built as log cabins in the Adirondack style. The Pleasant Street Historic District along Malvern Avenue (colloquially &quot;Black Broadway&quot;) contains 93 contiguous buildings associated with the city&#x27;s African American community. Included within the district are the Visitors Chapel AME church and the Woodmen of Union Building, along with 69 other contributing structures. A variety of architectural styles are used, with many of the structures using brick facades. The Quapaw-Prospect Historic District contains 233 structures near downtown Hot Springs, with 139 residential houses contributing to the character of the district built between 1890 and 1950 in several architectural styles. The Whittington Park Historic District is a residential district lining Whittington Park, a long, narrow park between two one-way streets created by the National Park Service in 1897. The 1896–1960 district contains 60 single-family houses and ten other structures. Predominantly Craftsman, ranch and Queen Anne-style buildings, the district is northwest of downtown Hot Springs.

Seven districts in Hot Springs have special historical significance to the city&#x27;s past economy. In addition to the aforementioned Bathhouse Row and Central Avenue Historic District, the Army and Navy General Hospital Historic District includes 31 buildings surrounding and supporting the former Army-Navy Hospital. Built in 1933, the six-story brick building built in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with Art Deco detailing is the centerpiece of the district, and remains the most imposing figure on the Hot Springs skyline. The Forest Service Headquarters Historic District encompasses six structures on Winona and Indiana Streets built by the Civilian Conservation Corps as the headquarters of the Jessieville Ranger District of the Ouachita National Forest. The Hot Springs Railroad Warehouse Historic District preserves three brick buildings between the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks and Broadway. Almost entirely unaltered, the 1920s structures are associated with the railroad industry, which was extremely important to Hot Springs in the early 20th century. As the city grew during the early 20th century, commercial activity developed along Ouachita Avenue south of Bathhouse Row, today preserved as the Ouachita Avenue Historic District. Mostly consisting of brick commercial and multifamily buildings, the district maintains the character of an historic commercial area. The 1905 Peter Joplin Commercial Block building was the only building to survive the 1913 &quot;Black Friday&quot; fire, making it a remnant of early commercial activity on Ouachita Avenue when all contemporary structures have been destroyed.

====Lake Catherine and Lake Hamilton====

Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine are two reservoirs of the Ouachita River south of Hot Springs created for hydroelectric power generation and recreational uses. Both created by Arkansas Power &amp; Light (AP&amp;L), Lake Catherine formed following the construction of Remmel Dam in the 1920s. Following a donation of over , the state created Lake Catherine State Park in 1935. Today, the park features fishing and water recreation as well as camping to visitors. Lake Hamilton was created following the construction of Carpenter Dam in the 1930s. Built during the Great Depression, the power produced by the dam is credited with allowing AP&amp;L to survive the difficult economic times. Following construction, resorts, businesses, and homes have been built along the lake, in contrast to Lake Catherine. Due to the economic importance of the dam to Hot Springs, Carpenter Dam was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Fishing is popular on Lake Hamilton, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission operates a fish hatchery to stock the lake with bass and other species.
====Oaklawn Park====
Oaklawn Park has been operating since 1904. (A second horse racing park was once within the city limits, but was eventually closed.) Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, his half-brother Roger, and Billy Bob Thornton, all Hot Springs natives, have frequented Oaklawn Park. The meet, held from December through May each year, is sometimes called the &quot;Fifth Season&quot;. In mid-April, its final week sees the &quot;Racing Festival of the South&quot;, concluding with the Arkansas Derby, which has drawn many Triple Crown contenders. In 2015, American Pharoah won the Derby and another race at Oaklawn before going on to win the first Triple Crown in three decades. In 2018, the track commemorated the horse&#x27;s victories by installing a life-sized bronze sculpture by James Peniston.

== History ==

Prattsville, then part of Saline County, was first settled by Elder Joab Pratt, a Baptist preacher, accompanied by several other families, with the surnames of Mayfield, Pumphrey, McDaniel, and Cobb, all arrived by wagon train from Bibb County, Alabama in 1841. Mr. Pratt is the source of the town&#x27;s name. Mr. Pratt operated Pratt&#x27;s Ferry close to where modern day Highway 270 crosses the Saline River and served as the postmaster for Lost Creek Post Office in 1846. Mr. Pratt founded Philadelphia Baptist Church soon after settling in the area south of the modern day city limits.

A section of the pre-statehood wagon road, the Old Camden Trail, was a highly traveled road throughout the nineteenth century that connected Little Rock and Camden. The Old Camden Trail was one of only five main roads in Arkansas during the 1800s and served early settlers of Prattsville. It is still marked on current maps in the town and has a historical marker north of Prattsville in the pioneer Village of Belfast, unfortunately the historic road has been gated and access to the marker blocked. During the Civil War, as part of Gen. Frederick Steele&#x27;s Camden expedition, part of the larger Red River Campaign, attempted to cross the Saline River at Pratt&#x27;s Ferry with his troops to get his nearly supply-less Union Army back to Little Rock along the Old Camden Road, however the water there was too high, and Gen. Steele and his troops turned south to cross at Jenkins Ferry, where his Union Army were engaged by Confederate Troops in what is called the Battle of Jenkins Ferry. Gen. Steele&#x27;s Camden expedition cost the Union army countless men and badly needed supplies. Gen. Steele and the Union Army escaped and made a retreat back to Little Rock along the Old Camden Trail.

==Education==
The Sheridan School District operates area public schools. The Prattsville School District merged into the Sheridan district on July 1, 1994.

== Notable Prattsvillians ==
David Delano Glover (January 18, 1868 – April 5, 1952) was born and attended public school in Prattsville. He was a U.S. Representative from Arkansas. He served six terms from March 4, 1929, to January 3, 1935. He was admitted to the bar in 1910.

Robert W. Glover, David Delano Glover&#x27;s brother and a Missionary Baptist pastor, served in both houses of the Arkansas Legislature (1905–1912) from Sheridan. He lived briefly as a child in Prattsville. In 1909, he introduced the resolution calling for the establishment of four state agricultural colleges.

Jackson T. Stephens (1923–2005), born on a farm near Prattsville during the Great Depression, co-founded Stephens, Inc., the largest trading company outside of Wall Street, located in Little Rock. He donated millions of dollars to worthy causes, including the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences campus, the Delta Project, the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated with classmate Jimmy Carter, First Tee of Arkansas, the Prattsville Community Center, and others. His personal art collection, of which he donated a portion of to the Arkansas Arts Center, has been recognized as one of the most important art collections in the country. He served as chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, overseeing The Masters golf tournament. He is interred at Philadelphia Cemetery in Prattsville.

Wilton &quot;Witt&quot; R. Stephens (1907–1991) was born in Prattsville and was the older brother of Jack Stephens. He began his career selling belt buckles and Bibles door to door in the late 1920s. During the Great Depression, Witt purchased municipal bonds for ten cents on the dollar, confident that the bonds would be redeemable under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Reconstruction Finance Corporation. He sold the bonds at a profit to make a small fortune in the worst economic climate in American history. He went on to invest in natural gas, oil, and gold mining industries. After World War II, he was known as the &quot;kingmaker&quot; due to his influential power over the state&#x27;s political branches. He served two terms in his father&#x27;s State House seat starting in 1961. The Grant County Museum building is named in his honor. He is interred in Philadelphia Cemetery in Prattsville.

Ray Thornton (1928–) was a resident of Prattsville and is the nephew of Jack and Witt Stephens. Thornton is a former U.S. Representative, lawyer, Arkansas Supreme Court justice, university president, and currently is the Public Service Fellow for the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law. Thornton played &quot;a key role in fashioning the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon concerning the Watergate cover-up.&quot; Thornton was a party in the Supreme Court of the United States case, &quot;U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton&quot;, which ruled Arkansas&#x27;s and other states&#x27; attempts at placing term limits on members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate unconstitutional.

<doc id="107001" wikidata="Q80089" url="?curid=107001" title="Sheridan, Arkansas">
<text>Sheridan is a city in and the county seat of Grant County, Arkansas, United States. The community is located deep in the forests of the Arkansas Timberlands. It sits at the intersection of US Highways 167 and 270.

Early settlers were drawn to the area by the native timber, which is still a very important part of Sheridan&#x27;s economy, although the city has diversified into several other industries. Sheridan&#x27;s history also includes a college, Missionary Baptist College, until its closure in 1934, and a series of conflicts during the Civil Rights Movement.

Located at the southern end of the Central Arkansas region, Sheridan has been experiencing a population boom in recent years, as indicated by a 49% growth in population between the 1990 and 2010 censuses. The population as of the 2010 census was 4,603.

==Etymology==
Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan, for whom the community is named, served as the 8th Commanding General of the United States Army from 1883 to 1888.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
What is now Redfield was formerly part of the historical territories of the Quapaw Nation. After the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Quapaw were removed from the land and pushed further west. By 1833 most of the natives had been moved westward and the land was ceded to the United States.

===Settlement through the Gilded Age===
The first Anglo-American settler was Dr. Richard C. Rhodes, a native of North Carolina. At the beginning of the 20th century, a railroad passed through Sheridan south into Dallas County. The railroad, owned by E. S. McCarty, carried freight and passengers for hire.

A religious university, Missionary Baptist College, opened in the community in 1917 and closed in 1934 due to financial circumstances resulting from the Great Depression. A 1920 bulletin published by the college underscored its goal &quot;to teach and emphasize the very principles for which the real Baptists of Arkansas stand and for which true Baptists have stood for almost nineteen centuries.&quot; Missionary Baptist Seminary in Little Rock succeeded the college after its closure.

===Mid-twentieth century===
In 1943, Jewell Williams, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, was convicted in the Mayor&#x27;s Court for selling Bibles without a permit under Sheridan City Ord. No. 50. and fined $10. On a trial de novo, he obtained the same result. Williams joined other members of his faith and appealed similar convictions occurring across the state to the Arkansas Supreme Court in &quot;Berry v. City of Hope&quot;, challenging the city ordinance as unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The court agreed and held the ordinances unconstitutional.

The &quot;Mighty 1090&quot; KAAY radio station sponsored the Rebel Springs Rock Festival of 1973 east of Sheridan on Highway 270 that included ZZ Top as a headliner. Tickets were $4 before the show and lasted three days, July 4–6, 1973. The National Guard was sent out to maintain &quot;peace&quot;. Local property owners attempted to get a court-ordered injunction to halt the festival from talking place, on the legal theory of nuisance, but to no avail.

In 1954, Sheridan&#x27;s school board voted to comply with the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Sheridan had operated an elementary school for Black children and bused its Black high school students to schools in other counties The protests were so severe that the school board reversed itself the following night. Then, local sawmill owner Jack Williams told his Black employees that they could accept his offer to buy out their homes and give them to the employees, and all move 25 miles west to the town of Malvern. Black residents had no choice, for Williams told them that &quot;if a family refused to move, he would evict them and burn down their home.&quot; This left Sheridan as a sundown town, and instead of becoming &quot;one of the most racially progressive towns in Arkansas if its initial school board decision had stood, instead became one of its most backward.&quot; Loewen&#x27;s research describes the fact that &quot;no Sheridan resident lifted a voice to protest the forced buyout of its black community&quot; and a &quot;reputation for bigotry when their high school played interracial teams in athletic contests.&quot;

==Education==

Sheridan is provided public education from the Sheridan School District, including the Sheridan High School.

Sheridan had a segregated school for African-Americans until the &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; decision. At the time, Sheridan had around 199 African American residents out of the town&#x27;s total population of 1,898. On May 21, 1954, the local school board voted unanimously to integrate its 21 African-American students into its high school to avoid the $4,000 it would have cost the school board to send them to Jefferson County. The white parents became upset and called another vote the next night. At that vote, the board voted unanimously to keep the local school segregated. Community members in the area, still not happy, petitioned and forced four school board members to step down.

Next, Jack Williams, the largest employer of African-Americans in the area, told Black families that they could accept his offer to buyout their homes and move them, or he would burn their houses down. After the departure of the last African-American student from the city limits, the city bulldozed the African-American school; the remnants of the school were buried and the city no longer had a duty to integrate their schools. This incident is recounted by former resident James Seawood on storycorps.

In March 2014, Sheridan High School principal Rodney Williams ordered the removal of student profiles from the student yearbook, rather than publish one of an openly gay student. In response, a human rights organization held a rally on the State Capitol steps, and the principal received a petition with 30,000 signatures asking Williams to reverse the decision.

==Arts and culture==
Sheridan hosts an annual event based on the area&#x27;s deep roots in the timber industry called Timberfest, which includes a lumberjack competition and live music around the courthouse square. &quot;The White River Kid&quot;, starring Antonio Banderas and Randy Travis, was filmed during a mock Timberfest during the summer of 1998, with many of the local residents appearing as extras.

===Tourism===

The Grant County Museum, located on Shackleford Road in Sheridan, preserves and interprets the history and culture of the county for residents and visitors. The museum features exhibits detailing the Battle of Jenkins&#x27; Ferry, a segment of the Union&#x27;s failed Red River Campaign during the Civil War, as well as a large World War II vehicle collection. Other exhibits include pioneer life and settlement in Grant County, and the flora and fauna native to the county. The Heritage Square is also on the museum grounds, featuring ten relocated and restored buildings. Just 5.8 miles north of Sheridan is the B-17 Crash Memorial where a replica B-17 was constructed to honor nine airmen who died in a plane crash at this location in 1943.

==Media==
Bales and Cleveland started the first newspaper in the Grant County area, titled &quot;The Sheridan Spy&quot;. The first issue was dated September 1, 1881. In 1882, the Hon. J.S. Williams, who a year later became a state senator, bought the &quot;Sheridan Spy&quot; and renamed it &quot;The Sheridan Headlight&quot;, which is still published today. The short lived &quot;Grant County News&quot; was started in 1916 by William GoForth.

==Utilities==

Sheridan&#x27;s water system began when a private entity began installing water lines in the 1930s. This system was eventually purchased by the city, which now allows the Sheridan Water and Sewer Department to operate the system independently of city funds. Today, Sheridan is capable of treating groundwater obtained from five wells at a rate of 4.5 million gallons (17 million liters) per day (MGD/MLD). Sheridan&#x27;s wastewater treatment facility is located at the end of Gatzke Drive and discharges treated effluent to Big Creek in accordance with the permit granted by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality. The facility utilizes a three-cell pond stabilization system followed by a holding pond and is designed for a flow of 0.67 MGD (2.5 MLD).

For many years, Delaplaine was home to the Delaplaine School District, which included Delaplaine (in the rural northwest of Greene County), O&#x27;Kean (in the rural southeast of Randolph County), and the town of Peach Orchard in Clay County. In 2003, the Arkansas Legislature, supported by then-Governor Mike Huckabee, passed Act 60, an act that required every school district in the state that had a daily enrollment of less than 350 students to be consolidated with another school district. As a result, on July 1, 2004, the Delaplaine School District was consolidated with the GCT district. Delaplaine High School and Delaplaine Elementary School initially remained open under the jurisdiction of the GCT district, to serve students in the former Delaplaine district area, however, they were later closed in 2007. Delaplaine mayor Larry Myrick stated that the community lost children with families after the school stopped operations.

<doc id="107004" wikidata="Q2580725" url="?curid=107004" title="Lafe, Arkansas">
<text>Lafe is a town in Greene County, Arkansas, United States on Crowley&#x27;s Ridge. The population was 448 at the 2010 census, up from 385 in 2000.

== History ==

The first settler of Lafe was Herman Toelken, a German immigrant who had been living in New Haven, Missouri, and was seeking new opportunities in an unsettled area. Toelken began cutting railroad ties for the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern (later Missouri Pacific) railroad in order to save enough money to purchase land and send for his family.

When Toelken was settled he began advertising in a Minneapolis German newspaper seeking other German Lutherans to come to the area. Several families responded to this advertisement, and an assortment of German immigrant families followed him from Franklin County, Missouri.

On December 9, 1889, an application was made to the US Postal Service for the establishment of a post office for &quot;Newberry, Arkansas&quot;, so named due to a sawmill operator of the same name who had set up in the area. The name &quot;Newberry&quot; was denied by the Postal Service, so the postmaster combined the names of his daughters and reapplied with the name &quot;Loulyma&quot;, which was accepted. Mail arrived addressed to &quot;Loulyma&quot; and freight arrived addressed to &quot;Newberry&quot;. In 1901 a new postmaster named Lafayette Mueller took over and sought to settle the name permanently by resubmitting a new name. Townspeople elected to name the town &quot;Lafe&quot; in honor of the new postmaster, and the name was officially changed on May 21, 1902.

==Geography==
Lafe is located in the valley of Big Creek on the western side of Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, with Big Creek flowing northwest towards the Black River. Arkansas Highways 135 and 34 intersect in Lafe; Highway 135 leads north to U.S. Route 62 east of Corning and south to Paragould, the Greene County seat, while Highway 34 leads east to Marmaduke.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Lafe has a total area of , all land.

<text>Marmaduke is a city in Greene County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 1,212 in 2020.

==History==
The town of Marmaduke was named for Confederate Major General John Sappington Marmaduke, who later served as governor of Missouri. Marmaduke was said to have established a camp for his soldiers near the site of the present town. The Texas and St. Louis Railroad was built through the area in 1882.

Marmaduke was incorporated on August 2, 1909, and, by 1914, had expanded to include two drugstores, three banks, three restaurants, a Methodist and a Southern Baptist church, two barber shops, a hotel, a boarding house, and two dime stores. The primary employers at the time were a sawmill, a lumber mill, a stave mill, and large and cut timber distributors.

Current industry includes the Anchor plastics company and the American Railcar Company.

The community was severely damaged by a severe tornado on April 2, 2006. At least half of the town was reported to have been destroyed or even flattened, and nearly every structure received some degree of damage. No one was killed in Marmaduke, but at least 50 people were injured, some seriously. In 2009, a major ice storm came across the northern part of Arkansas, causing the village, together with other regions, to lose electricity for a few weeks. Since then, the town has almost fully recovered.

<text>Paragould is the county seat of Greene County, and the 19th-largest city in Arkansas, in the United States. The city is located in northeastern Arkansas on the eastern edge of Crowley&#x27;s Ridge, a geologic anomaly contained within the Arkansas Delta.

Paragould is the principal city of the Paragould, Arkansas Micropolitan Statistical Area and is also a part of the Jonesboro-Paragould Combined Statistical Area. The population of Paragould was 29,537 as of the 2020 Census, compared to 26,113 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name is a blend combining the last names of competing railroad magnates J. W. Paramore and Jay Gould. Paramore&#x27;s Texas &amp; St. Louis Railway (later the Cotton Belt) and Gould&#x27;s St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific) intersected here in 1882. A group of citizens chose the name, and it is believed to be the only city in the world with this name. For a time, Gould objected to his name&#x27;s being second and refused to list the new town on his schedules. In 1888, Paragould was the starting point for the Paragould and Buffalo Island Railway (later the Paragould Southeastern Railway), which eventually made its way to Blytheville, Arkansas.

===Sundown town===
From 1888 to 1908, Paragould experienced a series of incidents in which White residents threatened and attacked Black residents. Some Black residents were flogged, and some of their homes and churches were burned. Arkansas Governor Jeff Davis ordered the state militia not to intervene on behalf of Black citizens. On numerous occasions White residents ordered Black citizens to leave and never return. In 1908, they threatened them to leave or die, which resulted in an almost complete depopulation of African-Americans in the county, and earned Paragould the designation of a sundown town. Black children were not allowed to participate in any form of public education until 1948, and then by busing them out of the county to Booker T. Washington High School in Jonesboro. In 1957, facing mandated integration, Jonesboro terminated this practice. Prior to 1982, no hotel in Paragould would allow Black people to spend the night. In 1983, when two Black Union Pacific workers attempted to eat at a restaurant, they were locked out. When police reached the scene, they accused the workers of attempting to break into the restaurant. An informal ban on hiring African-Americans was alleged to exist in Paragould until at least 2002.

==Geography==
Paragould is located southeast of the center of Greene County. U.S. Routes 412 and 49 intersect in the city west of downtown. US 412 leads east to the Missouri state line at the St. Francis River, and a further northeast to Kennett, Missouri; to the west US 412 leads to Walnut Ridge. US 49 leads northeast to Piggott and southwest to Jonesboro. The closest major city is Memphis, Tennessee, to the southeast.

<text>Emmet is a city in Nevada and Hempstead counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas.

As of the 2010 census, the population of Emmet was 518.

== History ==
The area around Emmet had long been inhabited by the Caddo people, prior to European colonization of the Americas. It consisted of gently rolling hills and prairies, interspersed with dense timber and fertile lowlands.

By the time of the Louisiana Purchase, the natural fauna was being removed in favor of more profitable crops. Wildlife that had been an important sustenance for the Natives was also being removed, and over time the Caddo population was greatly diminished.

In the years following Arkansas statehood, settlers began flowing steadily in. Some were following the Southwest Trail to Fulton on the Red River, while others saw opportunity in the area where Emmet would be established.

In 1837, Martin Edwards secured one of the first land patents in Arkansas. His property encompassed the area that would include the community of Burkville, precursor to the city of Emmet.

== Geography ==

* Ephesus Cemetery, burial site for many of Emmet&#x27;s early settlers

=== Ark-La Village ===
In 1959, Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company opened a western-themed tourist attraction at the direction of Wilton R. Stephens, founder of Stephens Inc. and &quot;Arkla Village&quot;. &quot;Ark-La Village&quot; was a re-creation of an 1880s western settlement where patrons could participate in the &quot;daily life&quot; of early pioneers. It was located on the company&#x27;s property inside Emmet&#x27;s northern city limits.

When first constructed, the &quot;village&quot; featured a saloon and general store, a livery stable, and a museum. Other attractions included a miniature train ride, a paddlewheel boat ride, a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a &quot;jail&quot; where comical, behind-the-bars photos could be taken. Connected with the village was a factory that built horse-drawn carriages and horse saddles.

In 1961, a shooting roundup was held and Harold M. Terry was the invited marksman.

Though popular with tourists and local citizens, it was the traffic along U.S. Highway 67 between Little Rock and Dallas that provided Ark-La Village with most of its patrons. That customer base was lost when the final section of Interstate 30 was completed in 1972. As a result, the village was closed in the early 1970s, with the restaurant and bowling alley closing a few years later.

In the following years, some portions of the property have been donated to the city of Emmet. Re-development has included a new city park and a building for public meetings.

== Media ==
Emmet is served by the Hope Prescott News, a local paper owned by a partnership of Mark Keith and Wendell Hoover. The Hope Star and the Nevada County Picayune, owned by GateHouse Media, closed in 2019. Larger newspapers that serve the area include the &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Texarkana Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Shreveport Times&quot;.

Local radio stations include KHPA (104.9 MHz FM) and KTPA (1370 kHz AM). In addition, the city is served by radio and television stations from Little Rock, and Shreveport.

A variety of telephone, cable TV, and internet providers are available to subscribers in Emmet, including SWARK.Today (Southwest Arkansas), Hope-Prescott.com, a local internet-news web site.

<text>McNab is a town in Hempstead County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 68 at the 2010 census, up from 37 in 2000. It is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1860, Charles McNab, who had emigrated to the United States in 1841 from Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland, bought land in the Red River valley not far from the town of Fulton. McNab, a carpenter, had married into a plantation-owning family in Alabama which later sold their Alabama land and moved to property at Summer Grove, near Shreveport, Louisiana. Though the Arkansas property was acquired by him in 1860, the Civil War prevented McNab from cultivating his new property. After the war, in 1865, he came up and planted cotton there. Soon, he and his wife and young son, together with a number of newly freed slaves, moved from Louisiana to live on and work the new farm. When the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (Frisco) came through the area 30 years later, a small passenger and freight station was built, and a post office to serve the small community was set up across the road in the back of the general store that was operated by the McNabs. Custom of the time allowed the person who operated the post office to give it a name. Mrs. Charles F. McNab, who was the postmistress, named it &quot;McNab&quot;. Her son, Charles West McNab, who had farmed the land until 1927 and was the only grandson of the original owner, sold the last of family property there in 1956.

<text>Washington is a city in Ozan Township, Hempstead County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 180 at the 2010 census, up from 148 in 2000. It is part of the Hope Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city is home to Historic Washington State Park.

==History==
From its establishment in 1824, Washington was an important stop on the rugged Southwest Trail for pioneers traveling to Texas. That same year, it was established as the &quot;seat of justice&quot; for that area, and in 1825 the Hempstead County Court of Common Pleas was established, located in a building constructed next door to a tavern owned by early resident Elijah Stuart. Between 1832 and 1839, thousands of Choctaw American Indians passed through Washington on their way to Indian Territory. Frontiersmen and national heroes James Bowie, Sam Houston and Davy Crockett all traveled through Washington en route to the Alamo. Houston is believed to have planned parts of the revolt strategy in a tavern in Washington during 1834. James Black, a Washington blacksmith, is credited with creating a knife which became known as the iconic Bowie knife, carried by James Bowie.

During the War with Mexico, beginning in 1846, Washington became a rally point for volunteer troops on their way to serve with the US Army. Later, the town became a major service center for area planters, merchants and professionals. Following the capture of Little Rock by the Union Army in 1863, the pro-Confederate States of America state government moved the state government offices to Hot Springs for a short time, then ultimately based the state government out of Washington, making it the (rebel) state capital until 1865. Albert G. Simms (1882–1964), a United States representative from New Mexico, was born here. Following the construction of the Cairo and Fulton railroad eight miles to the south of Washington, which connected much of the state with Little Rock, the town began a slow decline. Now located on the area&#x27;s primary travel route, Hope took on Washington&#x27;s formerly important role.

==Geography==
Washington is in north-central Hempstead County, northwest of Hope, the county seat. U.S. Route 278 passes through Washington as Columbus Street, leading southeast to Hope and northwest to Nashville. Arkansas Highway 195 has its northern terminus in Washington and leads southwest to Fulton on the Red River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Washington has a total area of , all land. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Washington has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Malvern is a city in and the county seat of Hot Spring County, Arkansas, United States. Founded as a railroad stop at the eastern edge of the Ouachita Mountains, the community&#x27;s history and economy have been tied to available agricultural and mineral resources. The production of bricks from locally available clay has earned the city the nickname, &quot;The Brick Capital of the World&quot;. The city had a population of 10,318 at the time of the 2010 census, and in 2019 the estimated population was 10,931.

== History ==
Named after Malvern Hill, Virginia, Malvern was founded in 1870 by the Cairo and Fulton Railroad as a city site southeast of Hot Springs. On October 15, 1878, Malvern officially became the county seat of Hot Spring County. The original inhabitants of the county were Native Americans, trappers, hunters, and farmers.

The Hot Springs Railroad, often referred to as the Diamond Jo line, was established as a narrow-gauge railroad by Chicago businessman Joseph Reynolds in 1874. Reynolds began building the Hot Springs Railroad, which extends northwest from Malvern Junction, a station on the Cairo &amp; Fulton, to Hot Springs, after he had endured unsatisfactory stagecoach rides to the latter city. Because Malvern was the closest railroad station to Hot Springs, it became an important junction point for passengers transferring from rail to stagecoach to complete their journey to the spas in Hot Springs. This was the only railroad into Hot Springs for 15 years. The opening of the Little Rock &amp; Hot Springs Western Railroad in April 1900 provided a more direct access to Hot Springs from Little Rock and the north, and both the Choctaw, Oklahoma &amp; Gulf and the Iron Mountain took advantage of this route, effectively cutting the volume of interchange traffic into Malvern. By 1902 passenger train shuttle service through Malvern had essentially ended.

The Malvern Police Department lost Carson Smith, the deputy, and three officers in the line of duty, all shot to death during the 1930s. They were Clyde Davis, Leslie Lee Potts, and Hiram Potts. Davis and Leslie Lee Potts were both shot during a domestic dispute on April 21, 1933, a shootout in which they killed the suspect. Hiram Potts, who was related to Leslie Lee Potts, was shot and killed during his March 4, 1935, attempt to arrest two men who were boarding a train illegally.

During World War II, hundreds of Malvernites moved to the Los Angeles area to take advantage of work in the shipyards—apparently spurred by a couple of residents who found work there and wrote home boasting of 88-cent/hour jobs, which was a decent wage for the time.

<text>Rockport is a city in Hot Spring County in the U.S. state of Arkansas. As of the 2010 census, the population of Rockport was 755, down from 792 in 2000.

== History ==
Rockport is one of the oldest named places in Arkansas. Although the present city is overshadowed by Malvern, Rockport served as the county seat of Hot Spring County from 1846 to 1879 and was a landmark community of Arkansas for many years both before and after that time.

=== European exploration and settlement through early statehood ===
Large novaculite boulders in the bed of the Ouachita River made the location of Rockport ideal as both a river crossing and a resting place for weary river travelers. These boulders gave the community its name. A plaque in Rockport states that Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto visited the location in 1541, although current historians are less certain about the exact route that de Soto and his group traveled while west of the Mississippi River. French hunters and trappers definitely forded the river at this location. The Hunter-Dunbar Expedition struggled to navigate the rapids here on December 3, 1804, recording their experience in a travel diary. During the 1830s, the development of the Military Road (also called the Southwest Trail) used the boulders as a ford to cross the river. Around 1847, a bridge was completed across the Ouachita River at Rockport, which is said to be the first toll bridge built in Arkansas. Over the years, it repeatedly washed away and was rebuilt.

By that time, the settlement was already populated. Its most famous citizen was politician Lorenzo Gibson, who built a house on a bluff overlooking the river and who became, in 1837, Rockport&#x27;s first postmaster. Other early settlers were Colonel A. R. Givens, Henry Miller, and Samuel Emerson, who is credited with laying out the city and opening its first hotel. Three doctors and a lawyer also made their homes in Rockport while Arkansas was still a territory. Hot Spring County was formed in 1829, with its county seat at Hot Springs (Garland County), but the seat of county government was moved to Rockport in 1846. At that time, the city already had a gristmill, a shop where wagons were built, stores, and residences. A Methodist church was meeting in a private home as early as 1815; its first building, a log structure, was erected in 1836. Rockport Baptist Church began holding services in 1849 and also housed Rockport&#x27;s first school. New Hope Baptist Church was established in 1859.

=== American Civil War through the Gilded Age ===
A new county courthouse was dedicated in 1860, just a few months before the outbreak of the Civil War. The Hot Spring County Hornets were the first of several military units to form in Rockport. A skirmish was fought at Rockport on March 25, 1864. Federal forces under General Frederick Steele camped near the nearly abandoned city, building a pontoon bridge to cross the river on the following day.

Following the war, the Cairo and Fulton Railroad offered to build tracks through the area with a depot in Rockport, but their offer was declined by city leaders. As a result, the tracks were located farther south, and the city of Malvern was established. That same year, 1873, a major fire devastated Rockport, destroying the county courthouse among other structures. Also that year, Garland County was created, greatly reducing the size and population of Hot Spring County. As a result of all three events, county leaders decided to build a new courthouse in Malvern, and the county government was moved there in 1879. The population of Rockport began to decline. The Ouachita Falls Lumber Company was a major employer in Rockport at the time, but lumber companies and brick factories in Malvern increasingly drew jobs to the newer city.

=== Early twentieth century through the modern era ===
After several false starts due to financial difficulties, developers managed to complete a plan to build an iron bridge across the Ouachita River to replace the older wooden bridge that had been washed away. The structure itself was begun on August 10, 1900, and completed on November 6 of the same year, with a dedication ceremony and community meal on November 8. The bridge was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, only to be removed after it was damaged by storms and flooding in 1987 and 1990.

<text>Nashville is a city in Howard County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 4,627 at the 2010 census. The estimated population in 2018 was 4,425. The city is the county seat of Howard County.

Nashville is situated at the base of the Ouachita foothills and was once a major center of the peach trade in southwest Arkansas. Today the land is mostly given over to cattle and chicken farming. The world&#x27;s largest dinosaur trackway was discovered near the town in 1983.

==History==
Mine Creek Baptist Church was built along the banks of Mine Creek by the Rev. Isaac Cooper Perkins (1790–1852) in the area where Nashville now stands around 1835. Settlers later established a post stop along the settlement roads in 1840, and a post office incorporated in 1848. Michael Womack (1794–1861), a Tennessee native reputed to have killed the British general Edward Pakenham during the War of 1812, settled in the area with his family in 1849. The area was then known by locals as &quot;Mine Creek&quot;, but was also called &quot;Hell&#x27;s Valley&quot; and &quot;Pleasant Valley&quot;.

Settlement in the area progressed slowly but steadily, though industry declined during the Civil War. Following the war, the village&#x27;s prospects improved, industry and settlement picked up, and the town was officially incorporated as Nashville on October 18, 1883, with D.A. Hutchinson serving as the first mayor. Womack is attributed with first proposing the name and called the town after Nashville, Tennessee. The following year, Nashville and Hope were connected via railroad, spurring further growth, and the county seat was relocated from Center Point to Nashville. With the establishment of county government in the town, and due to the increased trade and access brought by the railroad, Nashville continued to grow. The town had a population of 928 in 1900, and boasted &quot;a cotton-compress and gin&quot; and a &quot;bottling-works&quot;; by 1920 the population had risen to 2,144.

In the years before the Great Depression, Nashville was a prosperous, if small, town. According to author Dallas T. Herndon, Nashville was &quot;a banking town, with electric lights, waterworks, an ice and cold storage plant, a canning factory, foundries, machine shops, a flour mill, two newspapers, a brick factory, fruit box and crate factory, mercantile concerns... well-kept streets, [and] modern public schools.&quot;

An EF2 tornado struck the town on May 10, 2015, and killed two people.

== Economy ==

===Peach farming===

Peach farming sustained Nashville during the Depression. The peach industry came to the Nashville area in the late nineteenth century. Peak years of production lasted from the 1920s until the 1950s. Nashville&#x27;s peak peach production was 1950, with over 400,000 bushels collected from 425 orchards. &quot;Up to 175 boxcars, each carrying 396 bushel baskets, were shipped from Nashville each day during peak production years.&quot; Late freezes and early thaws in 1952 and 1953 led to the devastation of the peach harvests. Two-thirds of the crops were destroyed, and production sank to 150,000 bushels. &quot;The Arkansas growers lost the market, and the impact was devastating. For Howard County growers, the only option was to pull up the trees and convert the land for other purposes, often pasture for cattle, or to raise chickens,&quot; which remain the dominant agricultural products in the Nashville area to this day.

The peach industry in the area continued to decline as industrial farming in the Sun Belt and shifting production patterns made southwest Arkansas less attractive to larger produce companies. However, many small peach orchards still remain and are farmed by local families.

===Dinosaur discoveries===
The largest find of dinosaur trackways in the world was discovered by SMU archaeology graduate student Brad Pittman in a quarry north of the town in 1983, the site of a prehistoric beach. A field of 5–10,000 sauropod footprints were found in a mudstone layer covering a layer of gypsum. Casts long and wide were made and put on permanent display, first at the courthouse and finally at the Nashville City Park, while many of the original tracks were disbursed to local museums such as the Mid-America Museum in Hot Springs and the Arkansas Museum of Discovery in Little Rock. The full extent of the trackway has never been excavated.

==Infrastructure==

===Railroads===
The first railroad to connect Nashville with the surrounding area was originally known as the Washington &amp; Hope Railroad Co., chartered in 1876. The first stage of the railroad was a stretch connecting Hope and Washington, Arkansas, in 1879. In 1881 the railroad was renamed the Arkansas and Louisiana Railway Co., and on October 1, 1884, a nearly extension to Nashville was opened. By the start of the 20th century the railroad was operated as an extension of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, which stretched from St. Louis, Missouri to Texarkana, Arkansas. The earliest trains coming in and out of Nashville operated under the Missouri Pacific Railroad mark.

At one time the city boasted three railroads:
* The earliest was the Iron Mountain Railway branch from Nashville to Hope.
* The second, granted a charter on June 22, 1906, was the Memphis Paris and Gulf (MP&amp;G), later the Memphis Dallas and Gulf. The track ran twenty-five miles from Nashville to Ashdown, Arkansas, and then on to Hot Springs, Arkansas. The MP&amp;G was broken up in 1922 forming the Graysonia Nashville and Ashdown (GN&amp;A) running from Nashville to Ashdown. The GN&amp;A was merged into the Kansas City Southern Railroad in 1993.
* The third railroad in Nashville was the Murfreesboro Nashville Southwestern (MNSW), which ran from Nashville to Murfreesboro, Arkansas, in 1909. The MNSW later became the Murfreesboro-Nashville railroad which folded in 1951.

==Notable people ==
* Trevor Bardette, film actor
* Effie Anderson Smith, impressionist landscape painter
* Boyd A. Tackett, Arkansas politician
* Thomas Philip Watson, Oklahoma state senator, born in Nashville

==Companies==
William T. Dillard, founder of Dillard&#x27;s, opened his first department store in Nashville. He started his successful franchise in 1938 when, with $8,000 borrowed from his father, he opened a small store in his wife&#x27;s hometown of Nashville. Aside from a short period during World War II, the Dillard Company continued operating and expanding its Nashville location. In 1948, Dillard, looking for more growth prospects, sold the Nashville store and used the money, along with some outside financing, to buy controlling interest in a store in nearby Texarkana.

Jim Yates, founder of one of the largest privately owned convenience store chains, built his first E-Z Mart store in Nashville, Arkansas.

<text>Batesville is the county seat and largest city of Independence County, Arkansas, United States, 80 miles (128 km) northeast of Little Rock, the state capital. According to the 2010 Census, the population of the city was 10,268. The city serves as a regional manufacturing and distribution hub for the Ozark Mountain region and Northeast Arkansas.
== History ==
Batesville is the second oldest municipality after the town of Georgetown — and the oldest city — in the state of Arkansas. It was named for the first territorial delegate from Arkansas to the Congress of the United States, James Woodson Bates, who settled in the town. The town has also gone by the names of Napoleon and Poke Bayou.

In early days, Batesville was an important port on the White River and served as an entry point to the interior of northern Arkansas. Batesville played a large role in the settling of the Ozark Mountains region and served as the central land office for northern Arkansas.

The first known settlement of the Batesville area was in 1810 near the mouth of Polk Bayou, and by 1819 the town had a ferry across the White River and about a dozen houses. The town was partially laid out in early 1821, and on March 3, 1822, a bill of assurance was recorded and executed and the town&#x27;s plat was laid out. Batesville became the county seat in 1821. In January 1822, Judge Richard Searcy opened the town&#x27;s first state circuit court. The town&#x27;s first post office was established in 1822, and in 1830 became the home of a county court. On September 25, 1836, shortly after Arkansas was granted its statehood, Governor Conway incorporated Batesville Academy, the state&#x27;s first academy. In the past, the area in and around the city had extensive quarries of manganese ore, phosphate rock, sandstone, limestone, and marble.

Between 1940 and 1941, Batesville had its own minor league baseball team within the Northeast Arkansas League known as the Batesville Pilots. The team later disbanded in 1941.

On July 31, 1964, singer Jim Reeves and his business partner and manager Dean Manuel left Batesville, en route to Nashville in a single-engine Beechcraft Debonair aircraft, N8972M, with Reeves at the controls. It crashed later that day near Nashville International Airport killing both on board.

Batesville currently has only one high school within the city limits, Batesville High School. Also, Batesville is the home of Lyon College, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and noted for the annual Arkansas Scottish Festival each fall. In addition, the city is home to the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville (UACCB), and NASCAR driver Mark Martin. It contains three National Register Historic Districts and many properties separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed in Norman Crampton&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;The 100 Best Small Towns in America&quot;, ranking at #75.
