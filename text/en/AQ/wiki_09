<text>St. Charles is a town in Arkansas County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 230 at the 2010 census. The small town has been at the center of various events in Arkansas&#x27; history. St. Charles is best known for the Battle of Saint Charles, which was fought on the White River, which borders the town. St. Charles is also known for being in the White River National Wildlife Refuge.

== History ==
===Early history===
The area known as St. Charles was within the territory of the Middle Mississippian culture during the Woodland Period of Native American History. In early modern times, possibly after Hernando De Soto&#x27;s initial exploration of the American Southeast, the area encompassing the whole of Arkansas County and much of Eastern Arkansas became Quapaw territory and remained so until the arrival of French explorers in the 17th century. After American settlers started to move into the Arkansas territory, A treaty signed in 1818 moved most all of the Quapaw from what is now Arkansas County to the center of the state. By 1833, the Quapaw were no longer in Arkansas. The first settler to set foot in what is Now St. Charles was French Coureur des Bois Pierre Pertuis, who moved to the area after having purchased land from the 1797 Spanish land grant. By 1839, Charles W. Belknap owned the site, known briefly as Belknap’s Bluff. He built an adobe house, one of only a few found on the Arkansas frontier. The house served as a hospital for both sides in the Civil War and was a longtime landmark. The name St. Charles first appears with Belknap’s appointment as postmaster in 1850. He platted the town and began selling lots. St. Charles flourished during the 1850s with the shipping of various products on the river. During the Arkansas&#x27; territorial period, The county seat was moved from Arkansas Post to Dewitt after many of the larger settlements, including St. Charles, wished to take power from Arkansas post after the Territorial capitol was moved to Little Rock.

=== Civil War and the Gilded Age ===
St. Charles is the site of the most deadly single shot of the American Civil War. On June 17, 1862, at the Battle of Saint Charles, eight Federal vessels including the ironclad gunboat USS &quot;Mound City&quot; attempted to pass Confederate shore guns here, on the banks of the White River. A single shot from a Confederate cannon entered the &quot;Mound City&quot; and penetrated her steam drum. The resulting explosion and release of scalding steam killed most of her crew, approximately 129 men.

St. Charles suffered like other southern communities after the Civil War. The town’s incorporation was in 1880. Until railroads came, it was an important port. Most commerce of inland communities passed through the town, until rails reached DeWitt (Arkansas County), after which St. Charles began declining. For many years, its economy depended on timber, fishing, hunting, trapping, mussels for the button industry, and crops. A school district opened in 1891, with the first commencement exercise in Arkansas County occurring in 1892.

=== St. Charles Lynching of 1904 ===
In the spring of 1904, St. Charles became the scene of what would become known as the &quot;St. Charles Lynching of 1904&quot;. Over the course of four days, a succession of white mobs terrorized black families in the area, and lynched or otherwise murdered thirteen black people. The killers or mob members were never identified. The incident began on March 21, 1904, when Jim Searcy, a white man, began arguing with a black man named Griffin over a game of chance. The two men began to fight, and a local police officer arrested Griffin for assault, telling him he would be hanged. Whether the police officer was simply saying that to cause fear, or whether that was their actual intention, has never been known for certain.

In any event, having been told he would be hanged, Griffin struck the police officer, grabbed the officer&#x27;s pistol, then fled. Griffin went into hiding, but angry white mobs were determined to locate him. By March 23, 1904, white mobs on horseback were accosting black citizens on sight, shooting those who resisted. Between sixty and seventy black men, women and children were driven from their homes and penned inside a warehouse. That night, members of the mob were intent on burning the warehouse with all inside. Some mob members began to argue to spare the lives of certain black persons who they personally knew, then other mob members began arguing for caution, believing the thing had gone too far.
Around 3:00 am on March 24, 1904, angry white men stormed the warehouse and dragged six black men outside. They were marched to the high point on the highway between St. Charles and De Witt, made to stand in a line, then all six were shot dead. On March 27, 1904, the most detailed newspaper report of the killings, posted in the &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot;, listed those who had been killed. They were Abe Bailey, Mack Baldwin, Will Baldwin, Garrett Flood, Randall Flood, Aaron Hinton, Will Madison, Charley Smith, Jim Smith, Perry Carter, Kellis Johnson, Henry Griffin, and Walker Griffin. The latter two were brothers, Walker Griffin being the man originally arrested. Their killings brought the total to thirteen. The investigation into the murders was all but nonexistent, with no one ever being arrested, tried, or interviewed. To this day it remains little known, but in fact it was one of the largest murders of this sort, given the population of the town at the time, in Arkansas history.

=== Present day ===

In 1935, the White River was designated a wildlife refuge and was named the White River National Wildlife Refuge, which protects the many types of wetland wildlife that calls the Lower White River home, though this refuge does allow for waterfowl hunting, namely ducks quail and pheasants. Charles has declined in tandem with many Delta towns since the expansion of large-scale industrial farming but has remained intact as a small town due to the influx of hunters, naturalist and birdwatchers that venture to the White River NWR.

In 2013, the refuge was given the distinction of being a National Blueway by the Fish and Wildlife service. Later in the year, they called for an expansion of more than 100,000 acres, which would be done through purchasing land from willing sellers. The purpose of this expansion would be to protect wildlife that lives on the lower river and it would also preserve the Arkansas &quot;Big Woods&quot;, which only 10% remains. In 2014, the refuge was formally renamed the &quot;Dale Bumpers White River National Wildlife Refuge&quot; to honor former Arkansas Governor Dale Bumpers.

<text>Stuttgart is a city in and the county seat of the northern district of Arkansas County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 9,326.

Known as the &quot;Rice and Duck Capital of the World&quot;, Stuttgart is an international destination for waterfowl hunting along the Mississippi Flyway. Founded in 1880, it was named for Stuttgart, Germany. Stuttgart situated on the Arkansas Grand Prairie, a region known for rice cultivation. The economy is largely based on agricultural production, waterfowl tourism, and supporting industries.

It is located on U.S. Route 165, approximately southeast of Little Rock; and on U.S. Route 79 approximately 110 miles southwest of Memphis, Tennessee. Stuttgart is also on the Union Pacific Railroad between Memphis, Tennessee, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

== History ==
Stuttgart was founded by The Reverend Adam Bürkle of Plattenhardt, Württemberg (present-day Germany). He moved to the United States in 1852 and founded a settlement at Gum Pond after living for a time in Ohio. On April 30, 1880, Bürkle opened a post office and thus had to name the village. In honor of his homeland, he named it Stuttgart. In 1882, the Texas and St. Louis railroad was opened. Stuttgart was incorporated on April 19, 1889, and in 1904, rice farming was first introduced in the Stuttgart region. It became a dual county seat in Arkansas County with DeWitt in the 1920s.

==Geography==
Stuttgart and Arkansas County are located in the Arkansas Delta (in Arkansas, usually referred to as &quot;the Delta&quot;) a subregion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is a flat area consisting of rich, fertile sediment deposits from the Mississippi River between Louisiana and Illinois.

Within the Delta, Arkansas County is almost entirely within the Grand Prairie subregion, historically a flat grassland plain underlain by an impermeable clay layer (the Stuttgart soil series). Prior to the 19th century, flatter areas with slowly to very slowly permeable soils (often containing fragipans) supported Arkansas&#x27;s largest prairie, covered in prairie grasses and forbs, with oaks covering the low hills and ridges, and pockets of floodplains with bottomland hardwood forests. This region was a sharp contrast to the bottomland forests that once dominated other parts of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Cropland has now largely replaced the native vegetation. Distinctively, rice is the main crop; soybeans, cotton, corn, and wheat are also grown. The rice fields provide habitat and forage for large numbers and many species of waterfowl; duck and goose hunting occurs at this important spot along the Mississippi Flyway. Stuttgart is the most important city within the Grand Prairie region.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Crossett is the largest city in Ashley County, Arkansas, United States, with a population of 5,507, according to 2010 Census Bureau estimates. Combined with North Crossett and West Crossett, the population is 10,752. Crossett was incorporated in 1903.

==History==

Edward Savage Crossett (1828–1910) moved to Davenport, Iowa in 1875. He became a member of the trading firm of Renwick, Shaw and Crossett. In 1882, Crossett made his first investment in a southern pine forest. In 1886 he sold his interest in the Renwick business, taking 10,000 acres of Arkansas land covered in yellow pines in payment. With fellow Iowans Charles Warner Gates and Dr. John Wenzel Watzek as investors in 1899, the Crossett Lumber Company was organized. Crossett was elected vice president of the society at its organizational meeting. Charles Gates&#x27; brother, Edgar Woodward &quot;Cap&quot; Gates, was sent to southern Arkansas to oversee construction of the mills and a new community, which his associates named in honor of Edward Savage Crossett.

The Crossett Lumber Company was established in 1899 with a small sawmill. The sawmill had a main steam engine, boiler, and heavy metal drive shafts and pulleys for sawing logs and lumber. The Mississippi River, Hamburg and Western Railroad (MRH&amp;WR) reached Crossett on May 7, 1902. The first large pine mill began operation in 1902. The company built houses, schools and churches for the workers and their families. In 1903, all of this was incorporated as the company town of Crossett. The second large pine mill opened in 1905. By 1904, the Crossett Lumber Company had built the new village of Crossett for its workforce. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&amp;PR) reached Crossett on March 10, 1907. The Arkansas, Louisiana and Gulf Railroad (AL&amp;GR) reached Crossett on October 1, 1908.

In 1937, the Crossett Lumber Company built the paper mill. By 1960, the Crossett Lumber Company had opened a kraft paper mill, a food carton factory, and a flakeboard factory that made sheets of boards used much like plywood.

The Crossett Lumber Company merged with the Georgia-Pacific Company in 1962.

<text>Cotter is a city in Baxter County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 886 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Native American Bluff Dwellers were the original inhabitants of the area now known as Cotter for centuries before settlers arrived. When Native Americans were moved westward on the Trail of Tears, approximately 1000 Cherokees crossed just a short distance upriver from the current location of Downtown Cotter.

===Exploration and settlement===
In 1819, Henry Schoolcraft was exploring the Ozarks and spent a night in the Cotter area. He said of the area,
 White River is one of the most beautiful and enchanting streams, and by far the most transparent, which discharge their waters into the Mississippi ... We here behold the assembled tributaries flowing in a smooth, broad. deep, and majestic current ... skirted at a short distance by mountains of the most imposing grandeur... [The] extreme limpidity and want of colour ... was early seized upon by the French traders on first visiting this stream, in calling it &quot;La Rivière Blanche&quot; (White River).

In 1868, Jonathan Cunningham homesteaded 300 acres on a peninsula of the White River. In 1883, he sold it to L.P. Kemp. During that time, there was a ferry landing about 100 yards downriver called Lake&#x27;s Ferry. The only power to operate the ferry was the current of the river. At the time, it was the only means of transportation across. Families would travel from Mountain Home and Yellville to visit the area, picnic, fish, and enjoy the nearby spring that was created naturally via the caves under the ground.

Future president, Herbert Hoover, spent the summer of 1892 helping Geologist John C. Branner survey the northern Ozarks. By the early 1900s, there were many mining companies active in both Baxter and Marion Counties. Cotter quickly became a central point where minerals could be shipped via steamboat to much larger cities in central Arkansas or southern Missouri.

In 1902, the city opened a post office. In 1903, L.P. Kemp sold the 300 acres to the Red Bud Realty Company for an unknown amount. Red Bud&#x27;s principles, W.V. Powell, Jerry South, and Thomas Combs all ended up having avenues named in their honor. A school opened in 1904. On July 7, 1904, 36 of the community&#x27;s leaders petitioned to incorporate the town and on November 23, 1905, the city officially opened.

===White River Line===
Seeking to capitalize on the growing trade in the area, the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (St. L., I. M. &amp; S.) commonly known as the Iron Mountain, (merged into the Missouri Pacific in 1917) announced plans to open the White River Line which would run through the area and would connect with the main line in Lake&#x27;s Landing. In 1905, the Iron Mountain
bought the area and sold over one thousand lots, mostly to railroad employees. The city was incorporated in 1905 as Cotter, Arkansas. By that time, the population was over 600. The town was named after William Cotter, an official for the Iron Mountain. The materials required to build the town and railroad had to be brought in by steamboats down the White River. Once the railroad was completed, the use of steamboats on the rivers of Arkansas decreased and eventually ceased altogether. In 1906, the first passenger train arrived, and the tourist era began. The Missouri Pacific was merged in the Union Pacific in 1982, and the White River division was spun off as the Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad MNA in 1992.

===Expulsion of African Americans===
The construction of the railroad brought many laborers, including African Americans, to the area. However, once the work was completed the sentiment among white residents turned against them. The anti-Black attitude was encouraged by a visit from Arkansas Governor Jeff Davis, who gave a racist speech in Cotter in 1904, and by the local newspaper, the &quot;Cotter Courier&quot;. In April 1906 the &quot;Courier&quot; ran an editorial titled &quot;Too Many Negroes&quot;, which said that local residents had a &quot;feeling...that the negroes should move on.&quot; In and around August 1906, all of Cotter&#x27;s African Americans were run out of town, except for one family of three, the Masons. In the 1950s advertisements for Cotter boasted that it was &quot;100 per cent white&quot;, and the 1960 census recorded no African American residents.

===Cotter Bridge===

The mercurial White River caused many motorists problems, as the nearest crossing was over to the north in Branson, Missouri. An inconvenient ferry system made the need for a bridge apparent. Locals wanted a bridge, but they strongly opposed a toll bridge. Arkansas did not have a central highway body at the time, and was instead a patchwork of &quot;road districts&quot;, which made the bridge-building efforts even more difficult. Without a toll, funding wasn&#x27;t available until Arkansas Highway 12 was redesignated U.S. Route 62 in 1930. The Cotter Bridge was constructed through the area using a unique rainbow arch design.

==Geography==

<text>Mountain Home is a city in and the county seat of Baxter County, Arkansas, United States, in the southern Ozark Mountains near the northern state border with Missouri. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 12,448. A total of 41,307 persons lived within the city and micropolitan area combined, which encompasses the majority of Baxter County.

==History==

=== Founding and early days ===
Mountain Home was originally known as Rapp&#x27;s Barren. The land was owned by Simeon &quot;Rapp&quot; Talburt, who built the first home in the area in the early 1830s. Rapp and many of his family members are buried in a small cemetery in the Indian Creek subdivision of Mountain Home. The original cabin was found in 1990 and is on display in Cooper Park in Mountain Home with other homes of historic value. The name of the town was changed to Mountain Home in 1856. A post office was established in 1857. The Mountain Home Male and Female Academy was opened in 1853 and provided much needed education in the absence of accessible public schools.

===The Courthouse===
When Baxter County was incorporated on March 24, 1873, Mountain Home was named as the county seat. Court was held in a local store and prisoners were held in the homes of respected citizens until a proper courthouse could be built. A former boardinghouse was purchased for the purpose, but was deemed unfit for county business during the renovation process, so a new wood-frame building was built on a donated lot in the middle of the town square. This building burned to the ground in the 1890s and was replaced with a stone courthouse. It was suspected that an arsonist set fire to the building due to the location of the start of the fire and the timing. In just a few days, the fireproof safe would have been completed and all county records, including indictments, would have been protected from fire. In 1912, a local town, Cotter, was booming while growth in Mountain Home had slowed, and there was talk of moving the County Seat to the riverfront town. Mountain Home added a third floor to their existing court house due to an Arkansas law that prevented county seats from being moved away from a three-story building. The current court house was completed in 1943 and is still in use today.

=== Civil War ===

Mountain Home men participated in the war on the confederate side. No major battles were fought in Mountain Home, but because of its proximity to Missouri, members of the union army would often raid the area for supplies and both sides participated in guerilla warfare. During this time, the Mountain Home Male and Female Academy was closed. In October 1862, the 14th regiment of the Missouri State Militia was ordered to advance to Yellville, Arkansas a town not far away, to attack confederate troops stationed there and to take any supplies they could along the way. When they heard that a larger force of confederate soldiers were also heading for Yellville, and facing the rising waters of the White River, they decided to content themselves with stealing approximately 50 horses and other supplies from local settlers in the Mountain Home area and then retreat. The rear guard was cut off by a battalion of confederate soldiers and a skirmish ensued where the Union Army lost no soldiers and the Confederate Army lost approximately 10.

In April 1864, Mountain Home was again involved with Civil war violence when a group of jayhawkers attacked the town. Much of the town was damaged or destroyed, including the Mountain Home Male and Female Academy.

===Post Civil War through the 1920s===

In 1893, the Mountain Home Baptist college, known as &quot;The Gem of the Ozarks&quot;, opened. It operated for 40 years, offering education in French, Greek, Shorthand and typing as well as teacher training. Most of the money required to open it was raised locally. It closed occasionally due to lack of funds. In 1901, it became part of the Ouachita Baptist University system. In 1916 it became the flagship of the schools operated in Arkansas by the Southern Baptist Convention. By 1927 there were 265 students and a 7000 volume library. In 1927, funding was withdrawn to support a more centralized school in Conway and by 1933, the school was closed. The library was donated to the local public library and public schools and the dormitories became housing for the Dam builders. In 1901, the Baxter Bulletin was established and continues to operate today.

===The Great Depression===

The Great Depression hit the area hard, causing many local farmers to lose their land and leave. A series of natural disasters also caused hardship in the area including the Flood of 1927 and the drought of 1930–31. Cotton had been one of the main crops in the area before this, but the drought ended production of cotton in Baxter county and it never truly resumed. Residents received some relief from New Deal programs such as the Federal Emergency Relief Agency (FERA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps. The Works Progress Administration transformed transportation in the area throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

===The New Deal===

The programs of the New Deal era allowed Mountain Home to modernize its courthouse. The decision to do this was hotly contested and in a vote to decide if the funds should be approved, 731 voted for the new courthouse and 592 voted against. Most of those against the new courthouse were from the Cotter area which had tried several times to move the county seat to their town. The current courthouse was completed and dedicated on August 13, 1943, the old building having been destroyed two years earlier. The WPA also built two dams in the area during this time. The Norfork Dam was built in the town of Norfork about 18 miles south east of Mountain Home. This dam was completed by 1944. An average of 815 were employed building the dam, providing a much needed economic boost to Mountain home and the surrounding area. In addition to flood control, the Norfork Dam boosted tourist interest in Baxter County and made Mountain Home a more attractive destination than Cotter for the first time, and Mountain Home began to surpass its riverfront neighbor in population and industry. A second dam had been built in the town of Bull Shoals in nearby Marion County. This meant Mountain Home was situated between two large lakes and within an easy drive to one of the most famous destinations for fishing in the country at that time. Tourism would shape the economy of Mountain Home moving forward. President Harry Truman was the keynote speaker at the dedication of the dams on July 2, 1952.

The construction of these two dams was a time of tremendous growth for the formerly isolated community of Mountain Home. Streets were paved and Electricity became common in average households. A trout fishery was built at the base of the Norfork Dam, attracting still more tourists.

<text>Bella Vista is a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. The community has taken advantage of the natural setting within the Springfield Plateau of the Ozark Mountains since first established in 1917 as a summer resort destination. The oak/hickory forests, valleys, creeks, and steep rises that characterize the city&#x27;s topography have slowly given way to a series of reservoirs, golf courses, and other amenities. A largely residential city, early settlement was predominantly summer cabins, later giving way to single-family housing of a retirement community developed by Cooper Communities with services and amenities provided by a strong property owners&#x27; association (POA).

Located within the Northwest Arkansas region, the city has been experiencing a population and building boom in recent years, as indicated by an 82% growth in population between the 2000 and 2020 censuses, largely as a bedroom community for nearby Bentonville and Rogers. Residents voted to incorporate in 2006, supplanting the POA with municipal government for most essential services.

==History==
The area now encompassed by Bella Vista was used by roving bands of Osage and Delaware who used the area for seasonal hunting grounds. A prominent rock shelter known as Hay Bluff along US 71 was used by various groups in the area and remains an important archaeological site, before later being used by early settlers to store hay. The area was established as a primitive summer resort in 1909 by a Bentonville minister who envisioned golf, tennis, and inexpensive lots for summer cabins. In 1915, Lake Bella Vista was created by damming Little Sugar Creek. By 1916, the resort was sold to the Linebarger Brothers Realty Company, who further developed the resort to include more amenities, including the Sunset Hotel and Wonderland Cave nightclub. Early cabins recognized on the National Register of Historic Places include Blackwell-Paisley Cabin, Bogan Cabin, Hagler-Cole Cabin, Lamberton Cabin, Pharr Cabin, Princedom Cabin, and Sutherlin Cabin. The resort began catering to city dwellers with automobiles, and came to include &quot;colonies&quot; of residents from Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Bella Vista became a retirement community in 1965, and, after much contention and a 2006 vote of its property owners, became an incorporated city. Following its official incorporation on January 1, 2007, the new city government took over the police department, fire department, streets, trash removal and other city functions, while the Property Owners Association (POA) retained control of the many amenities available to members (property owners) and their guests.

==Geography==
Bella Vista is located in northern Benton County. Its northern border is the Missouri state line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, consisting mainly of the several lakes within the city.

==Government==

Bella Vista&#x27;s Declarations and Protective Covenants is the &quot;rule book&quot; that governs the POA. The Property Owners Association must follow this &quot;rule book&quot; composed of various articles. There are Class A and Class B members of the POA. Class B refers to Cooper Communities, the land developer, who gets 10 votes per lot owned and Class A refers to lot private lot purchasers who receive one vote per lot owned. Cooper Communities now owns too few lots to sway the vote. Both Class A and class B members must approve a vote before it is binding.

The POA is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors who serve three-year terms. They set the direction and long-term objectives for the POA guided by Bella Vista&#x27;s declarations and protective covenants. The day-to-day activity of the POA is directed by its general manager, with division heads and site managers responsible for the various departments and facilities.

The residents voted in 2006 to incorporate as an official city effective January 1, 2007. The POA still remains intact to service the recreational amenities and provide water, but the City of Bella Vista now has responsibility for police, fire, streets, library, community development, and other services.

==Parks and recreation==

===Lakes===

Bella Vista has seven lakes. These lakes are not &quot;public&quot; in that only members of the community or their guests are permitted to use them. Lake Ann, Lake Windsor, and Lake Loch Lomond are the largest all-sports lakes in the town. Lake Avalon, Lake Norwood, and Lake Rayburn are primarily fishing lakes with &quot;no-wake&quot; restrictions. Current POA boat permits are required, as are Arkansas fishing licenses, when fishing Bella Vista lakes. No personal water crafts (AKA: Jet Skis) are allowed on any of the Bella Vista lakes, however, only 20 miles east of Bella Vista is Beaver Lake, a 31,700 acre US Army Corps of Engineers Lake, and Jet Skis are welcome there.

*Lake Ann (, el. ) is a small man-made water sport reservoir with of surface area. The lake was created by damming a small west flowing stream in Pinion Hollow that is a tributary to Little Sugar Creek. Because it is deep with no power limit, water skiing is allowed on Lake Ann.
*Lake Windsor (, el. ) is the second largest of the lakes, covering with a maximum depth of . The lake is on Tanyard Creek just upstream from its confluence with Little Sugar Creek. Lake Windsor is also an unlimited power lake, and water skiing is allowed. 
*Loch Lomond is the largest of all the lakes in the city. It is deep and covers . There is no power limit, skiing is allowed, and boat rental is offered.
*Lake Avalon is a limited-power lake that features an enclosed, heated fishing dock located off Tamworth Circle. This lake covers and is deep.
*Lake Brittany (, el. ) is deep, has a surface area and is a limited-power lake. It is located on a small north flowing tributary to Pinion Hollow and lies upstream of Lake Ann off Trafalgar Road.
*Lake Norwood, located just north of Bella Vista&#x27;s Town Center, has of surface area and is deep. The Lake Norwood launching ramp is located north of Harp&#x27;s Food Store in Town Center. This is a limited-power lake.
*Lake Rayburn is deep and has a surface area. This lake has limited-power regulations. It also features a designated swimming area and a launching ramp that is accessible from Lakeside Drive.

===Trails===

Lake Bella Vista, formerly part of Bella Vista, and the 1.8 mile walking/biking trail that goes around the lake is now part of the City of Bentonville Parks system. In the center of Bella Vista is the Tanyard Creek Nature Trail below the Lake Windsor dam. It has a footbridge and some waterfalls except during dry times. In October 2016 the City of Bella Vista, with the cooperation of the Property Owners Association, opened of hiking and mountain bike trails entitled &#x27;The Back 40&#x27; which is located on the east side of the city. The Little Sugar trail system, which was designed and built for mountain biking and opened in 2019, is located in the central part of the city and features approximately 50 mi (80 km) of trails. In July 2023, the Bella Vista Property Owners Association approved by a 7-1 vote the construction of 7 new trails. The trail Master Plan developed in 2015 shows of trails to be built by 2025.

==Education==
The following school districts serve the city. On the east side is the Bentonville School District, and on the west side is Gravette School District. A few blocks in the east are zoned to the Pea Ridge School District.

The Bentonville portion is zoned to the following schools:

The Bella Vista Fire Department is a career fire department with four fully staffed fire stations. There are three shifts with 21 career firefighters on each shift. The fire department also provides Advanced Life Support paramedic service to the city with six ambulances. In 2010, the department took control over the Bella Vista Ambulance Services.

===Transportation===

The final segment of Interstate 49 (I-49), which runs from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Kansas City, Missouri, was completed around Bella Vista on October 1, 2021. The new route bypassed Bella Vista to the south and west, removing through traffic from Highway 71, which had seen increasing traffic congestion over the decades. I-49 has four exits providing access to Bella Vista: US 71 (Bella Vista Way), two exits with Highway 72, and Benton County Road 34 (CR 34, Rocky Dell Hollow Road).

Bella Vista Way is a four-lane controlled access divided highway that bisects the city from north to south. Two Arkansas state highways cross Bella Vista: Highway 279 (Forest Hills Boulevard) runs north-south from Gravette to Missouri, and Highway 340 (Lancashire Boulevard) from east to west from Highway 279 to Missouri. Almost all of the remaining street network in Bella Vista is laid out using a street hierarchy typical of large residential subdivisions, with hundreds of cul-de-sac streets.

===Solid waste===
The City of Bella Vista contracts with Republic Services for trash collection. There also are two semi-annual pick ups of large items.

====Stump Dump Fire of 2018====
A dump site had begun an underground fire in August 2018. In December 2018, health officials declared the air within a half-mile radius around the property was at unhealthy levels on one occasion. An emergency declaration was made by Gov. Asa Hutchinson. The Bella Vista POA took over this project in early May 2019 and had the fire extinguished in less than 30 days.

===Water and wastewater===
The POA provides water service to Bella Vista residents. Village Waste Water provides sewer service to portions of Bella Vista.

<text>Bentonville is the county seat of Benton County, Arkansas, United States. The city is centrally located in the county with Rogers adjacent to the east. The city proper had a population of 54,164 at the 2020 census, making it the ninth-most populous city in Arkansas. It is one of the four main cities in the three-county Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area, with 546,725 residents in 2020.

The city is the birthplace and headquarters of Walmart, the world&#x27;s largest retailer. Bentonville is considered to be one of the fastest-growing cities in the state and consistently ranks amongst the safest cities in Arkansas.

==History==

===Early history===

The first known use by humans of the area which is now known as Bentonville, was as hunting grounds by the Osage Nation who lived in Missouri. The Osage would leave their settlements to hunt in present-day Benton County for months at a time before returning to their families. European settlers first inhabited the area around 1837 and named their settlement &quot;Osage&quot;. By this time, the Osage had ceased using the area for hunting, and the European settlers began to establish farms. Upon establishment of Benton County on September 30, 1836, Osage was deemed a suitable site for the county seat, and the town square was established as the home of county government the following year. Osage was renamed Bentonville in honor of Thomas Hart Benton, a senator from Missouri who strongly supported Arkansas statehood.

===Early statehood and Civil War===

Two years after Arkansas received statehood in 1836, thousands of Cherokee people from Georgia passed through Benton County as part of the Trail of Tears route to the Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. Although no Civil War battles were fought inside Bentonville, the city was occupied by both armies and saw almost all of its buildings burned. Bentonville was a staging point for the Confederate army prior to the Battle of Pea Ridge, fought about northeast of town, and the town saw a brief skirmish just prior to the battle. 

The city began to rebuild about a decade after incorporation on April 3, 1873, with many of these Reconstruction Era buildings today serving as the oldest structures in Bentonville.

The first railroad line into the area bypassed Bentonville, instead creating the nearby town of Rogers. So in 1883, a corporation called the Bentonville Railroad Company (a forerunner of the Arkansas and Oklahoma Railroad) proceeded to link Rogers with Bentonville, about six miles. That line has changed hands over time, but remains in use.

With good transportation available, the area established a vibrant apple industry, with Benton County becoming the leading apple producing county in the nation in 1901.

=== Twentieth century ===
In May 1922, the first Ku Klux Klan chapter was opened in Bentonville. By 1923, there was documentation of at least 162 men who were members of the Klan. Most of the town&#x27;s most prominent citizens were charter members of the Klan chapters, including mayor Lee Seamster, his successor Tom Curt, the Benton County sheriff and several deputies, and Circuit Judge William A. Dickson, as well as half of the aldermen on the city council.

In the 1920s and 1930s the county developed a reputation as a leader in poultry production that continued into the World War II years, and which the area still maintains today. The post-war economy helped Bentonville grow, with many new businesses starting.
In 1950, Sam Walton bought the Harrison Variety Store on the Bentonville town square. He fully remodeled the building and opened &quot;Walton’s 5 and 10 Variety Store&quot; on March 18, 1951. This single store eventually led to the creation of Walmart, the world&#x27;s largest retailer, which still strongly influences the community today.

The late twentieth and early twenty-first century has seen a dramatic reduction in the manufacturing sector in Bentonville, corresponding with an increase in tourism and entertainment focused on the natural setting and outdoor opportunities of the area as well as the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which opened in 2011. This has resulted in Bentonville being the fastest growing city in Arkansas, and the larger Northwest Arkansas area one of the fastest growing in the United States.

The Northwest Arkansas National Airport is located to the southwest of Bentonville and is used to connect all of the northwest Arkansas region to the rest of the nation. For more than the last decade, Northwest Arkansas has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States.

==Economy==

Bentonville has been home to Walmart since Sam Walton purchased a store on the town square in 1950 and renamed it Walton&#x27;s 5 &amp; 10. The retailer continued a rapid growth, but Helen Walton wished to remain in Bentonville to raise the family, and thus by the time Walmart became the #1 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 in 2002, it was still based in Bentonville. The Walmart &quot;Home Office&quot; now includes more than 20 buildings throughout Bentonville, specifically along Walton Boulevard (US 71B) in the western part of the city. In 2017 Walmart announced their intention to construct a new central headquarters in Bentonville, consolidating many of their employees to a more centralized campus.

The impact from the Walmart Home Office is multiplied by the over 1,100 prospective Walmart vendors who have established sales offices in the region. The large number of satellite offices for companies of almost every industry means a large number of transplants from around the United States live in or near Bentonville. This phenomenon impacts the culture of Bentonville in addition to the city&#x27;s economy.

Bentonville is home to a growing entrepreneurial scene, with co-working spaces and startup incubators being added quickly over the last 5 years.

==Arts and culture==
Bentonville&#x27;s culture is a combination of a southern city, small town, global business hub, and the surrounding Northwest Arkansas metro.

Bentonville shares many of the characteristics commonly given to Arkansas as a Southern state, yet it has also absorbed minor cultural influence from the Midwest and West. Located firmly in the Mid-South, Bentonville&#x27;s culture is distinct and differs from the Delta portion of the state. Many of the city&#x27;s first settlers came from North Georgia, North Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee, because they found the Ozarks familiar, similar to the Appalachian Mountains back home. The uplands of Arkansas, including Northwest Arkansas, did not participate in large-scale plantation farming with slaves like the Arkansas delta, instead electing to settle in small clusters, relying largely on subsistence agriculture and hunting rather than the settlement patterns common in the Midwest and Deep South. The &quot;hillbilly&quot; stereotype given to the Ozarks and Appalachians is largely a derivative of the difficult topography, tendency to settle in clusters, and mostly cashless self-sustaining economy found in those regions. Bentonville&#x27;s large proportion of Southern Baptist and Methodist adherents does, however, reflect a trend often associated with the Deep South.

Due to Walmart&#x27;s prominence in the city, Bentonville is also an international focal point for retail suppliers and other supporting businesses. According to the Bentonville-Bella Vista Chamber of Commerce, over 1,250 suppliers have offices in Northwest Arkansas in an attempt to secure or retain Walmart&#x27;s business. Symbolic of Bentonville&#x27;s complex culture was a cricket game played between PepsiCo and Walmart, spectated by their respective chief executives Indra Nooyi and Doug McMillon, chronicled in an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; describing the complex Bentonville culture. The game was played on a baseball field in Bentonville not well suited for typical cricket, so the players adopted new rules. The city has a league with 18 teams and a host of fans, mostly derived from the thousands of Indian natives drawn to Bentonville by Walmart software and IT jobs. In late 2018 plans for a public cricket pitch were approved for a new park in the southwest of the city.

From the Walmart Museum on the downtown square to the over 20 buildings spread throughout the city, Walmart&#x27;s Home Office has a presence throughout Bentonville. The Northwest Arkansas National Airport has direct commercial flights from many large destination cities not typical of airports its size due to the supplier community. Bentonville, and the recently opened Bentonville West (located in Centerton) High Schools, have programs to assist the sizable transient student population, including international students, for those who have recently relocated to the area.

===Culture===

Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art is a $450 million museum of American Art designed by architect Moshe Safdie located within walking distance of downtown Bentonville.

On June 1, 2020, local residents held a non-violent demonstration at the statue in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, until later that night, when the Benton County Sheriff&#x27;s &quot;mobile field force&quot; ended the demonstration by deploying tear-gas on the assembled crowd and arresting several people. The statue was removed from the square in September 2020 and relocated to the new privately held James H. Berry Park in July 2023.

==Parks and recreation==

Formerly designated as Interstate 540 with the re-designation as Interstate 49 being granted by the U S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration on March 28, 2014, the highway became the first freeway in the area when it was completed in the 1990s to relieve the former US 71 (now US 71B) of a much-increased demand of through travelers following the unanticipated and rapid growth of the Northwest Arkansas metro. Future plans for the I-49 corridor include completion of a freeway segment through between Fort Smith and Texarkana. The Bella Vista Bypass to the north was completed and opened in late 2021.

<text>Bethel Heights was a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. Always a small, sparsely populated community, the region coalesced around a school named Bethel in the late 19th century but did not incorporate until 1967 to avoid annexation by larger neighboring communities. The town offered police and fire protection and wastewater service to residents, but sent students to Springdale Public Schools and purchased water from Springdale Water Utilities. By the 21st century, Northwest Arkansas was gaining population rapidly, and Bethel Heights reincorporated as a city and grew from a population of 714 in 2000 to 2,372 at the 2010 census. Growth put pressure on the city&#x27;s subsurface discharge wastewater treatment system, and following a series of wastewater treatment plant violations, voters dissolved the city and completely annexed into Springdale in August 2020.

==History==
Present-day Benton County was hunted by the Osage prior to, and after, the Louisiana Purchase. Following the Treaty of Fort Clark and establishment of Lovely County, white settlement in the area began. Settlers around Bethel Heights started claiming land in 1856.

As the communities of Lowell and Springdale expanded toward the Bethel area, residents incorporated as a town in 1967 to prevent annexation.

==Geography==

Bethel Heights was located in southern Benton County at (36.222843, -94.127671). It was bordered by Springdale to the east, south, and west, and by Lowell to the north. U.S. Route 71 Business (US 71B, Thompson Street) ran north–south along the western side of the city, and Highway 264 ran east–west through the center of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , of which , or 0.69%, is water.

===Region===

The area had a population of 347,045 at the 2000 census which had increased to 463,204 by the 2010 Census (an increase of 33.47 percent). The region does not consist of the usual principal-city-with-suburbs morphology. The principal cities retain individual identities, but have grown together along Interstate 49 (I-49). For more than the last decade, Northwest Arkansas has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States.

==Demographics==
As of 2010 Bethel Heights had a population of 2,372. The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 49.7% non-Hispanic white, 1.9% black or African American, 1.4% Native American, 3.0% Asian, 8.3% Pacific Islander, 21.6% from some other race, 2.2% from two or more races, and 34.7% Hispanic or Latino.

The average household size was 2.84 and the average family size was 3.10.

The city&#x27;s population was spread out, with 28.6% under the age of 18, 5.2% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 24.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the town was $48,750, and the median income for a family was $51,172. Males had a median income of $33,438 versus $26,625 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,001. About 1.9% of families and 4.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.8% of those under age 18 and 11.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
The majority of the former city of Bethel Heights is zoned for Springdale Public Schools while small sections are zoned to Rogers Public Schools.

The Bethel Heights area (the former municipality) in 2022, was zoned to the following: Bayyari, Hunt, and Monitor elementary schools take certain portions. Hellstern, Sonora, and Helen Tyson middle schools take certain portions. Central, Lakeside, and Southwest junior high schools take certain portions. Springdale High School and Har-Ber High School take certain portions of Bethel Heights.

Bethel Heights, in 2006, was divided between Bayyari, Hunt, and Lee elementary schools. It was also divided between Hellstern, J.O. Kelly, and Helen Tyson middle schools, and between Central, Southwest, and George junior high schools. Most of Bethel Heights was zoned to Springdale High, but with portions west of U.S. Route 71 zoned to Har-Ber.

Early residents established Benton County School District #66, and a small school known as Bethel or New Kirk, around Bethel Heights in the late 19th century. This school remained independent until consolidation with Springdale Public Schools in 1948. In 2018, Springdale Public Schools became the largest school district in the state with over 23,000 students. Bethel Heights students were zoned for graduation from Springdale High School.

==Government and politics==

===Mayor–city council===
Bethel Heights operated within the mayor-city council form of government. At founding as a town, Bethel Heights had a town council consisting of five aldermen elected at-large as the town&#x27;s unicameral legislature. Mayors served an unlimited number of four-year terms. The mayor was elected by a citywide election to serve as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the city by presiding over all city functions and allocated duties to city employees. Bethel Heights also elected a recorder and treasurer to two-year terms.

In the early 2000s, Bethel Heights became a second-class city, requiring the establishment of wards. Two council members were elected to two-year terms from each of the city&#x27;s three wards to establish an annual budget and consider ordinances. Council meetings were held on the third Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m. at City Hall, 530 Sunrise Drive. On August 21, 2020, Bethel Heights was annexed by Springdale.

==Infrastructure==
===Utilities===
The City provided wastewater service via a STEP system, installed in 2003. Bethel Heights struggled to maintain compliance with Arkansas Department of Health and Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality regulations. The system was out of compliance from August 2013 to January 2017, with sewage surfacing in neighbors&#x27; fields, livestock poisonings, multiple violations and fines resulting in a consent administrative order. Violations had continued in 2018 and 2019.

Potable water service was provided by Springdale Water Utilities. Following the sewer system violations, a moratorium on new water system connections was established in June 2019.

American Electric Power (AEP/SWEPCO) and Carroll Electric Cooperative provided electric power in Bethel Heights. Franchise utilities that served the community include AT&amp;T, Black Hills Energy, and Cox Communications.

<text>Centerton is a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. Located west of Bentonville on Highway 102, Centerton has grown from a railroad stop and fruit orchard community in the early 20th century into a suburban bedroom community within the rapidly growing Northwest Arkansas (NWA) region. The city&#x27;s population has grown from 491 in 1990 to 16,244 in 2019. Centerton is considered to be one of the fastest growing cities in Arkansas and consistently ranks amongst the safest cities in the state.

== History ==
Native American hunters and early settlers were drawn to present-day Centerton by natural springs, including what is now known as McKissick Spring. In the Antebellum South era, an early church and school built along the spring were named Center Point, for the community&#x27;s central location in Benton County. Though the area did not see any formal action during the Civil War, Union troops camped at McKissick Spring on March 5, 1862, shortly before the Battle of Pea Ridge.

After the Reconstruction era, the Arkansas-Oklahoma Railroad Company connected Rogers, Arkansas and Grove, Oklahoma through western Benton County. The railroad opened the apple and strawberry orchards of the county to new markets, bringing economic prosperity, development, and population growth to the region. Upon laying out the town in 1900, the name was changed to Centerton, as Center Point was already registered in Howard County.

==Geography==
Centerton is located near the center of Benton County and Arkansas Highway 102 runs through the center of the city and leads east to Bentonville and west to Decatur.

The city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.13%, is water.

The area had a population of 347,045 at the 2000 census which had increased to 463,204 by the 2010 Census (an increase of 33.47 percent). The region does not consist of the usual principal-city-with-suburbs morphology; though today Centerton is largely a suburb of Bentonville. The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport is located south of Centerton and is used to connect all of the Northwest Arkansas region to the rest of the nation. For more than the last decade, Northwest Arkansas has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States.

===Region===
The Northwest Arkansas economy was historically based upon agriculture and poultry. In recent decades, NWA has seen rapid growth and diversification of its economy based upon the big companies based there, Walmart, Tyson Foods, and J.B. Hunt, while also seeing a growing University of Arkansas and cultural amenities sector. Although impacted by the Great Recession, NWA&#x27;s economy fared better than most peer metropolitan areas, the state of Arkansas and the United States overall. Between 2007 and 2013, the region saw unemployment rates significantly below those of peer regions and the national average; while also seeing a 1% net growth of jobs. The NWA gross domestic product grew 7.0% over the aforementioned time period, and bankruptcies, building permits and per capita incomes are returning to pre-Recession rates.

The professional, education and health care sectors of the Northwest Arkansas economy have been growing steadily since 2007. Between 2007 and 2013, the region has seen a growth of 8,300 jobs in the region, with 6,100 added in education and health professions and 4,300 jobs added in the leisure and hospitality jobs related to the region&#x27;s cultural amenities. The government and transportation sectors have remained relatively constant between 2007 and 2013, however the manufacturing sector has seen steady decline, mirroring national averages. The construction and real estate sectors saw large declines attributable to the poor housing market during the economic downturn.

Gentry began as a rural Ozark agricultural community named Orchard City. Located in western Benton County, it was known for its apple orchards and other produce. The town began to grow when the Kansas City Southern Railroad was constructed through the town. In 1894, residents of the community petitioned the county to officially incorporate, and the city&#x27;s name was changed to Gentry, after an official in charge of the construction of the railroad.

The railroad proved important to Gentry, and by 1903 the town had grown to a population of 1,000.

The railroad company built a new depot in Gentry in 1926–1927. It was known as one of the nicest depots on the railway line. A banquet was held for the grand opening, and railway officials arrived on a special train to commemorate the event. Four to six passenger trains a week came through Gentry until passenger service was discontinued in 1964.

In 1937, Highway 59 was built, running through the city north and south. It remains the main highway through the city, linking Gentry with other west Benton County communities.

In 1946, the City Council voted to buy a water tank for $1,650 from the War Assets Corporation in Kentucky. In 1948, the city held a special election to issue bonds to install larger water mains and additional fireplugs. In the 1950s, the city purchased its own water company. At the beginning of the 21st century, Gentry was expanding water lines into rural areas surrounding the community.

Using donations, local businesses built the first auditorium at the intersection of Main and Collins streets. The building now houses the city&#x27;s courtroom.

In the 1960s, when agriculture was no longer the economic base it had once been for the city and the railroad, the train depot was torn down.

The next decade saw the beginning of the construction of a power plant by Southwestern Electric Power Company (often known as SWEPCO). The plant, located west of the city limits, is a coal-fueled electric generating facility called Flint Creek Power Plant. Today SWEPCO continues to provide electrical power, and SWEPCO Lake (shown on maps as &quot;Lake Flint Creek&quot;) is used for fishing and recreation. To ease traffic through downtown, a new Arkansas Highway 12 bypass was built on the southern edge of town. In the early 1970s, the Wild Wilderness Drive-Through Safari was established north of town. The park is home to a variety of exotic animals and consists of a drive-through, petting parks and walk-through areas for interaction with the animals. In 1983, the McKee Foods Corporation (then known as McKee Baking Company) opened its manufacturing facility in Gentry.

The city celebrated its centennial in 1994 and held a 110th Birthday Bash in 2004.

In September 2023, the board of Northwest Arkansas National Airport (XNA) voted to begin the process of detaching itself from the city of Highfill. The vote was unanimous among the board members present for the vote, while two board members were not present and did not vote.

Among the issues causing the dispute was the taxing of transactions at the airport. All airport transactions were subject to a Highfill city sales tax of 2%.

<text>Pea Ridge is a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. The name Pea Ridge is derived from a combination of the physical location of the original settlement of the town, across the crest of a ridge of the Ozark Mountains, and for the hog peanuts or turkey peas that had been originally cultivated by Native American tribes centuries before European settlement, which later helped to provide basic subsistence once those pioneer settlers arrived.

<text>Rogers is a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. Located in the Ozarks, it is part of the Northwest Arkansas region, one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. Rogers was the location of the first Walmart store, whose corporate headquarters is located in neighboring Bentonville. Daisy Outdoor Products, known for its air rifles, has both its headquarters and its Airgun Museum in Rogers. The city houses a popular shopping center, the Pinnacle Hills Promenade, and a music venue, the Walmart AMP, that has housed performances by big-name artists and local performers alike.

As of the 2020 US Census, the city had a population of 69,908. In 2022, the estimated population was 72,999 making it the sixth-most populous city in the state. Northwest Arkansas is the 98th biggest metropolitan area by population in the United States, with 576,403 inhabitants as of the 2022 U.S. Census Estimate.

==History==
Rogers was named after Captain Charles W. Rogers, who was vice-president and general manager of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, also known as the Frisco. The town was established in 1881, the year the Frisco line arrived; it was at this time the area residents honored Captain Rogers by naming it for him. The community was incorporated on June 6, 1881. In 1883, Rogers became the starting point of the Bentonville Railroad, which linked the town with Bentonville, about six miles. That line, under its subsequent owner the Arkansas and Oklahoma Railroad, later extended as far as Grove, Oklahoma. Today, only the Rogers-to-Bentonville segment remains in use.

===Historic commerce===
The first retail business owned by the Stroud family was a store in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, which was co-owned by Allen Bryant Stroud (1831–1914) and his son Harlan Lafayette (H.L.) Stroud (1858–1950). That business was established prior to 1879 and Allen Stroud also served as postmaster at Pea Ridge for a time. In 1884, H.L. Stroud sold his interest in the Stroud store in Pea Ridge and purchased a dry goods store at the corner of First and Walnut Streets in Rogers which he named Stroud&#x27;s Mercantile.

In 1887 he brought in his brother Evan Giesen (1868–1952) to serve as manager of his new business. In 1891 H.L. Stroud moved his business into a storefront on the north side of the 100 block of Walnut Street. Stroud&#x27;s continued to prosper, and in 1899 H.L. built the brick building at 114–116 West Walnut Street. Stroud&#x27;s continued to be the leading retail business in Rogers up into the 1960s, when in 1962 Sam Walton opened the first location of what would become the retail giant Walmart just seven blocks away. Walton&#x27;s new store combined with the nationwide movement of retail centers from aged downtowns to malls and shopping centers slowly eroded Stroud&#x27;s customer base, leading the locally beloved retailer to permanently close in 1993 after 109 years in business. In 1912 the city council formed a commission of local businessmen to facilitate the paving of downtown Rogers. Despite the constant complaints of dusty and muddy streets, and the enthusiastic support of prominent citizens such as Coin Harvey, bickering over the cost and method of paving delayed the start of the project until July 1924. The downtown area was paved with concrete and overlaid with bricks in rows, changing to a basket weave pattern at the intersections of streets. The work was completed in December 1924, and the brick pavement remains today, with renovations done to the streets in 2010.

===Transportation===
Siloam Springs traffic is primarily served by US 412 for east–west travel, connecting the city to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the west via the Cherokee Turnpike and to Bentonville, Fayetteville, and Springdale, Arkansas, to the east. US 59 runs south from West Siloam Springs to Stilwell and Sallisaw, Oklahoma, while Arkansas 59 runs north to Gravette and south to Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas. Within the city, major routes include Cheri Whitlock Drive, Lincoln Street, Main Street, Mount Olive Street, and University Street.

Smith Field, located east of town, serves small business jets as well as double- and single-engine aircraft. It serves exclusively general aviation operations.

Commercial air transportation is available from Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, about to the east-northeast.

===Utilities===

The city&#x27;s primary water source is the Illinois River, although some water is purchased from Benton - Washington Regional Public Water Authority, whose source is Beaver Lake. The water is treated with chlorine, and the by-products of this chlorination process are kept compliant with the Arkansas Department of Health standards. Fluoride is added to supplement the naturally occurring amount present prior to treatment.

Wastewater is treated at the Siloam Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant (SSWWTP). Since effluent is discharged into a tributary of the Illinois, the plant&#x27;s effluent is required to meet the treatment standards of both Arkansas and Oklahoma. The phosphorus load of the Illinois has been subject of controversy in the area, even reaching the United States Supreme Court in 1992. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified the Illinois as Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, listing it as an &quot;impaired and threatened water&quot; due to the high phosphorus loads. As a result of the applicable strict phosphorus effluent regulations, SSWWTP upgraded its system in 2011. The upgrades also increased capacity 25% to 5.5 million gallons per day (MGD) (14,474 liters per hour). Although presently a traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant capable of meeting the interim phosphorus limit, pilot tests have proven a chemical nutrient removal (CNR) and membrane biological reactor combination to be effective well below the possible future permit limit. However, due to the high cost, these phases have been delayed. Currently, a 3-year study is being conducted to determine the background phosphorus level in the Illinois. The future effluent limits will likely be written following the conclusion of the study. An EPA total maximum daily load (TMDL) study in the watershed is also ongoing.

<text>Springdale is a city in Washington and Benton counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The city had a population of 84,161 at the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Arkansas. It is included in the four-county Northwest Arkansas metropolitan area, which had 546,725 residents in 2020.

Located on the Springfield Plateau deep in the Ozark Mountains, Springdale has long been an important industrial city for the region. In addition to several trucking companies, the city is home to the world headquarters of Tyson Foods, the world&#x27;s largest meat producing company.

Springdale has been experiencing a population boom in recent years, as indicated by a 133% growth in population between the 1990 and 2010 censuses. During this period of rapid growth, the city has seen the establishment of a Springdale campus of Northwest Arkansas Community College and the Northwest Arkansas Naturals minor league baseball team move into Arvest Ballpark. Tyson remains the city&#x27;s top employer and is visible throughout the city. Governor Mike Beebe signed an act into law recognizing Springdale as &quot;The Poultry Capital of the World&quot; in 2013.

==History==
Springdale was formerly called Shiloh, after the local Shiloh church, and was platted under that original name in 1866. In 1878, the town was incorporated with the name of Springdale.

In 2020, voters of the city of Bethel Heights decided to merge with Springdale after the city sanitation plant received several violations from the Arkansas Health Department. The city was eventually annexed on August 21, 2020.

An intense EF3 tornado struck the town on March 30, 2022, heavily damaging or destroying several structures and injuring seven people.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it, or 0.62%, is water. The city limits extend north into southern Benton County. Springdale is bordered by the cities of Cave Springs, Lowell, to the north, by Elm Springs and Tontitown to the west, and by Johnson and Fayetteville to the south.

The city is located in both Benton and Washington counties along Interstate 49/US Highway 62/US Highway 71 (I-49/US 62/US 71). This is the only fully controlled access route through the area, which replaced the winding US 71 (now US 71B) in the 1990s. An interstate connection with Fort Smith to the south and Kansas City, Missouri, to the north has greatly helped to grow Springdale. Within Washington County, Springdale is bordered along the south by Fayetteville and Johnson. In some locations, this transition is seamless. The city extends west and east along Highway 412 toward Tontitown and Beaver Lake, respectively.

===Geology===
Springdale is located on the Springfield Plateau, a subset of The Ozarks which run through northwest Arkansas, southern Missouri, and Northeastern Oklahoma. In the Springdale area, sandstone and shale were deposited on top of the Springfield Plateau during the Pennsylvanian Period. These were eroded after the Ouachita orogeny and uplift, exposing Mississippian limestone formations of the Springfield Plateau visible today.

===Climate===
Springdale lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with influence from the humid continental climate type. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. The climate is similar to that of nearby Fayetteville.

July is the hottest month of the year, with an average high of and an average low of . Temperatures above are uncommon but not rare, occurring on average twice a year, with 57 days over annually. January is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . The city&#x27;s highest temperature was , recorded in 1954. The lowest temperature recorded was , in 1899. Precipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 84,161 people, 26,443 households, and 19,475 families residing in the city.

===2010 census===

According to the 2010 US census, the total population was 69,797. Of this, 45,185 (64.74%) were White, 15,332 (21.97%) were some other race, 3,976 (5.70%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders, 2,011 (2.88%) were two or more races, 1,363 (1.95%) were Asian, 1,251 (1.79%) were Black or African American, 679 (0.97%) were American Indian or Alaska Native. 24,592 (35.38%) were Hispanic or Latino (of any race)

There were 22,678 households, out of which 41.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.0% were married couples living together, 13.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.0% were non-families. 21.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.02 and the average family size was 3.54.

The median income for a household in the city was $26,523, and the median income for a family was $46,407. Males had a median income of $31,495 versus $26,492 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,645. 21.3% of the population and 17.4% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 33.6% of those under the age of 18 and 6.3% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

===Metropolitan area===
The Northwest Arkansas region consists of three Arkansas counties: Benton, Madison, and Washington. The area had a population of 347,045 at the 2000 census which had increased to 463,204 by the 2010 census (an increase of 33.47 percent). The Metropolitan Statistical Area does not consist of the usual principal-city-with-suburbs morphology; instead Springdale is bordered to the north by Rogers, the south by Fayetteville, and the northwest by Bentonville, with smaller cities like Lowell and Johnson in between.

===Marshallese population===

The city is home to the largest community of Marshall Islanders in the United States, which dates to the 1980s, when one Marshall Islander arrived in the city to work for Tyson Foods and subsequently spread word of plentiful jobs to others in the islands. The Marshall Islands opened a consulate in the city in 2008. The Marshallese could easily settle in the U.S. as their country is in a free association with the United States. Photographer Lawrence Sumulong stated that this is the largest concentration of ethnic Marshallese in the United States.

===Religion===
56.8% of Springdale&#x27;s population describes themselves as religious, slightly above the national average of 48.8%. 25.6% of people in Springdale who describe themselves as having a religion are Baptist (14.5% of the city&#x27;s total population). 12.5% of people holding a religion are Catholic (7.1% of the city&#x27;s total population).

==Economy==


Springdale has a robust poultry processing industry, including large hatcheries and/or processing plants owned and operated by Tyson Foods, Cargill, and George&#x27;s throughout the city. Since Tyson Foods and George&#x27;s are based in the city, a host of administrative/executive/support staff is also employed in Springdale to support these large operations. Springdale also has a variety of industrial/manufacturing employers present in the city, including Apex Tool Group, Ball Corporation, Brunner &amp; Lay, Dayco Products, and Pratt &amp; Whitney. This strong industrial sector differentiates the city among the four large principal cities of Northwest Arkansas.

Parsons Stadium in eastern Springdale is host to many events throughout the year, most notably the Rodeo of the Ozarks. This four-day event began in Springdale in 1944 and brings professional cowboys and cowgirls to the city for one of the nation&#x27;s top outdoor rodeos. Always hosted on Independence Day weekend, the event brings a parade, the Miss Rodeo of the Ozarks Pageant, and the Grand Entrance to the stadium. It also hosts Buckin&#x27; in the Ozarks (a Professional Bull Riders [PBR] event), Arenacross (a motocross competition with professional and amateur exhibitions) during Bikes Blues and BBQ weekend and other motorized exhibitions.

==Sports==
Springdale is home to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals, the minor league baseball team of the Texas League. The team, formerly known as the Wichita Wranglers, relocated in 2008 upon completion of Arvest Ballpark. The stadium has 6,500 seats and additional grass berm seating as well as suites and event space for private events. Approximately 70 Naturals home games are played in the stadium every year. In 2013, Arvest Ballpark hosted the 77th annual Texas League All-Star Game.

==Government==
Springdale operates within the mayor-city council form of government. The mayor is elected by a citywide election to serve as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the city by presiding over all city functions, policies, rules and laws. Once elected, the mayor also allocates duties to city employees. Mayors serve four-year terms and can serve unlimited terms. The city council consists of eight members who together form the legislative body for the city. Also included in the council&#x27;s duties is balancing the city&#x27;s budget and passing ordinances. The body also controls the representatives of specialized city commissions underneath their jurisdiction. Two members are elected from each of the city&#x27;s four wards. The Council meets every second and fourth Tuesday of the month at the City Administration Building.

Citizen input is welcomed through the use of various specialized groups. Positions are appointed by the Mayor and approved by the City Council. Springdale is represented by Republican Steve Womack Representative for Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
* Interstate 49
* US Route 62
* US Route 71
* US Route 412 Business
* US Route 71 Business
* Highway 112
* Highway 264
* Highway 265
The major through route in Springdale is Interstate 49/US 71/US 62 (the concurrent routes are unsigned and thus the route is simply known as I-49 in Springdale). This fully controlled access, four-lane expressway is a discontinuous piece of a route ultimately planned to connect Kansas City, Missouri to New Orleans, Louisiana. Formerly designated as Interstate 540 with the re-designation as Interstate 49 being granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration in 2014, the highway became the first freeway in the area when it was completed in the 1990s to relieve the former US 71 (now US 71B) of a much-increased demand of through travelers following the unanticipated and rapid growth of Northwest Arkansas. Major construction along the I-49 corridor included the Bella Vista Bypass, which was opened to traffic north of Springdale in October 2021. Future plans for the I-49 corridor include completion of a freeway segment through the Ouachita Mountains to Texarkana.

Springdale&#x27;s major provider of public transportation is Ozark Regional Transit. The bus-based regional transit system runs throughout Washington and Benton Counties and is administrated by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department. The nearest intercity bus service is provided by Jefferson Lines in nearby Fayetteville.

There is currently a .5-mile trail beginning at the parking area. This trail goes west to Flint Creek and then heads north, going under the HWY 12 bridge and meandering next to the creek through riparian forest. Another .14-mile trail spurs from Wasson Trail just down the path from the parking area. This trail is on an old railroad bed and offers nice views overlooking Flint Creek. All trails are easy hiking, except for a short scramble through rocks under the bridge.

<text>Sulphur Springs is a city in Benton County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 481 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Northwest Arkansas region.

==History==
Sulphur Springs got its start in 1885 as a mineral spa resort.

==Geography==
Sulphur Springs is located in northwest Benton County. The city center is about one mile south of the Missouri-Arkansas state line. Arkansas Highway 59 runs through the city, leading north to Noel, Missouri, and south to Gravette. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Sulphur Springs is in the Springfield Plateau subregion of the Ozarks. It has porous rocks through which rain easily can pass underground to the aquifers. When water in aquifers flow down a hillside, or are pushed up to the surface, this causes a spring. The springs in Sulphur Springs are exceptionally rich in several minerals, and historically the springs were labeled to indicate the purported mineral found in each:
*&quot;Black sulphur:&quot; Water with hydrogen sulfide that has come into contact with a metal such as iron, which then corrodes to create ferrous sulfide
*&quot;Chalybeate:&quot; High in iron salts, especially ferrous bicarbonate
*&quot;Lithium salts:&quot; A rare mineral water
*&quot;Magnesia:&quot; High in magnesium, often magnesium carbonate
*&quot;Nitre:&quot; High in potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter
*&quot;Potash sulphur:&quot; Containing potassium and sulfur
*&quot;White sulphur:&quot; Containing a high concentration of sulfur compounds, especially hydrogen sulfide gas and sulfates. &quot;White&quot; meant colorless.

==Ozark Colony==

Ozark Colony was originally a nearby community, but now is a Sulphur Springs neighborhood. In 1921, Walter R. Eaton, a retired oilman, established the colony with $25,000 capital (equivalent to about $436,200 in 2024) as an intellectual and artistic recreation-based cooperative: people would buy a plot of land and agree to work in community-held ventures with the proceeds going toward their vacation expenses in the colony. People worked in the 100-acre (40.4 ha) vineyard that was owned collectively under the name Ozark Colony Grape Club, and processed the grapes into juice and marmalade to sell. They also made hickory furniture and had a poultry club. Eaton, as president of the Ozark League Commission, also collaborated with neighboring tourist towns such as Eureka Springs to promote and market the home products and handicrafts made at the colony.

The colony had more than 40 cottages, a Grecian theater with classical recitals and costumed performers, a lodge with a dance floor and disco ball, manmade lakes stocked with trout for fishing, tennis courts, and a swimming pool. Seasonally, they had artist exhibits, art classes with visiting directors from the Kansas City Art Institute, music classes, and plays.

Artist, cabinet-maker, and resident Jim Sease made a totem pole (which were fashionable in tourist and resort areas at the time), telling the community&#x27;s history, from a generalized nod to native Americans, to the four springs for which Sulphur Springs is named, then the railroad and airplanes, and a modern city with resort hotels and John Brown University.

Painter John Eliot Jenkins kept a studio in the colony. His paintings are now in state capitols and libraries in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia, and his &quot;Snow in the Ozarks&quot; (1925) oil on canvas painting is part of the Foundation Collection at the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts in Little Rock, Arkansas.

<text>Alpena is a town in Boone and Carroll counties in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The population was 374 at the 2020 census.

The Boone County portion of Alpena is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Alpena Pass was founded in 1908 on top of a graveyard shortly after the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad was built through Boone County. In the 1950s, the word &quot;pass&quot; was dropped from the name, thus creating the current name, Alpena.

At the time of the town&#x27;s founding, the town of Carrollton was in decline. Many of the buildings of Carrollton were disassembled, moved and reassembled at Alpena Pass. MADtv&#x27;s Rice and Beans Tour once came through the town, doing a tongue-in-cheek exposé about rural America. They encountered a seemingly drug-intoxicated woman and had an interview with the &quot;mayor&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

<text>Bellefonte is a town in Boone County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 530 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area. Bellefonte gained national attention in 2013 when the city&#x27;s mayor, James Wiggs, was recognized as the oldest active mayor in the United States at 90 years of age.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===List of highways===

* US 62/US 412
* U.S. Highway 65
* Arkansas Highway 206

==History==
The area known as Bellefonte was originally settled by a few families. The community expanded when two stores were established. The community got its name as campers noted the beautiful springs. It was suggested the area be called &quot;Bellefonte&quot;, French for &quot;beautiful fountains.&quot;

As there were no church organizations in the settlement, services were originally held in private homes. Circuit riders generally provided the services.

Bellefonte grew rapidly by the second half of the 1860s. A post office was established.

By the early 1870s, what was referred to as &quot;North Arkansas College&quot; (not to be confused with the modern community college by the same name in Harrison, Arkansas) was founded and students from all over the state attended. In modern times, this would be considered a high school. A grade school was also established in Bellefonte around the same time.

Bellefonte continued to grow, becoming a large town. A number of businesses developed and a town square was built. (By 1939, the town square was gone.) Businesses included doctors&#x27; offices, drugstores, a livery stable, various general stores, a leather factory, saloons, a cotton gin and a flour mill.

When Boone County was formed, Bellefonte was the largest town, larger than relatively new Harrison. Bellefonte expected it should have the county seat. After arguing and a vote, Harrison ultimately won.

Bellefonte became an incorporated town in 1882. In that year it was also damaged by a significant fire due to buildings being close together. In the same year, the North Arkansas College building burned. Bellefonte stopped being an incorporated town after this great fire, not re-incorporating until 1963.

By 1898 things had gotten better. Around 1901, the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad ran through Bellefonte. This temporarily brought in business. There were various fires in 1912, which stifled Bellefonte until 1929 when things began to pick up a bit.

The Depression was directly felt in Bellefonte from 1930 to 1933. It took until 1935 for signs of relief.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 530 people, 197 households, and 124 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 173 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 97.80% white and 1.30% of two or more races.

The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 29.3% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 12.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 90.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.5 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $27,917, and the median income for a family was $30,729. Males had a median income of $24,500 versus $18,000 for females. The per capita income for the town was $12,958. About 13.7% of families and 18.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 32.4% of those under age 18 and 3.6% of those age 65 or over.

In modern times, Bellefonte first appeared in the US Census in 1970. It also appeared in 1880. This says nothing about when the community began; it merely identifies when it was recognized in the US Census.

<text>Bergman is a town in Boone County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 439 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

==History==
Areas very close to the current location of Bergman were known as Oregon Flat and Clabbie. There was also a town around one mile south of present-day Bergman called Keener. Keener was strong in the 1880s and had a population of about 1,000 people. But, Keener began to decline fast by 1892.

The town of Bergman was first incorporated on August 4, 1905. The name was derived from a Dr. Bergman, who provided the land and requested that it be named after her daughter. Miss Edith Bergman who was the daughter of Dr. Bergman (and hence the person who the town was named after) was the first postmistress.

Like a number of other towns in Boone County, Bergman was a railroad town. The White River Division Railway, which eventually was part of the Missouri Pacific Line, went through Bergman.

Before the increased prevalence of the automobile and better roads in the area such as Arkansas Highway 43 (which was built in 1927 and had been blacktopped by 1948), Bergman had a number of businesses and flourished as a small town.

The current incorporation took place on March 14, 1968. A new post office was located in Bergman in 1974.

Although Bergman has a school district as part of the Arkansas school consolidation of 1929, it is now largely a residential community.

<text>The city of Harrison is the county seat of Boone County, Arkansas, United States. It is named after Marcus LaRue Harrison, a surveyor who laid out the city along Crooked Creek at Stifler Springs. According to 2019 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 13,069, up from 12,943 at the 2010 census and it is the 30th largest city in Arkansas based on official 2019 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Harrison is the principal city of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Boone and Newton counties.

The community has a history of racism: there were two race riots in the early 20th century and an influx of white supremacist organizations during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

==History==
=== Precolonial history ===
Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the area, probably beginning with cliff dwellers who lived in caves in the bluffs along the rivers. In later times, the Osage, a branch of the Sioux, was the main tribe in the Ozarks, and one of their larger villages is thought to have been to the east of the present site of Harrison. The Shawnee, Quapaw, and Caddo people were also familiar to the area.

The Cherokee arrived around 1816 and did not get along with the Osage. This hostility erupted into a full-scale war in the Ozark Mountains. By the 1830s, both tribes were removed to Indian Territory.

It is possible that the first Europeans to visit the area were some forty followers of Hernando de Soto and that they camped at a Native village on the White River at the mouth of Bear Creek. It is more likely that the discoverers were French hunters or trappers who followed the course of the White River.

===19th century===
In early 1857, the Baker–Fancher wagon train assembled at Beller&#x27;s Stand, south of Harrison. On September 11, 1857, approximately 120 members of this wagon train were murdered near Mountain Meadows, Utah Territory, by a local Mormon militia and members of the Paiute Indian tribe. In 1955, a monument to memorialize the victims of the massacre was placed on the Harrison town square.

Boone County was organized in 1869, during Reconstruction after the Civil War. Harrison was platted and made the county seat. It is named after Marcus LaRue Harrison, a Union officer who surveyed and platted the town. The town of Harrison was incorporated on March 1, 1876.

===20th century===
====Harrison Race Riots of 1905 and 1909====
In 1905 and 1909, white race riots occurred in Harrison, which drove away black residents and established the community as one of hundreds of sundown towns in the country.

In 1901, the building of the St. Louis and North Arkansas Railroad through Harrison bolstered the local economy. Economic hardship ensued following the railroad&#x27;s bankruptcy on July 1, 1905. On October 2, 1905, a white mob breached the Harrison jail, captured two Black prisoners, drove the prisoners outside city limits, whipped them, and threatened them to leave the community. The white mob then went to the Black community and burned their houses and fired guns at their windows with the message that they should leave the town. At least one person, railroad worker George Richards, was murdered during the event. Local law enforcement declined to take action to press charges for the riot.

On January 18, 1909, Charles Stinnett was arrested and charged with the rape of a white woman named Lovett. Although Stinnett testified that he did not assault the woman and only meant to rob her, a jury sentenced him to hang on February 26, 1909. A mob arrived at the jail to lynch Stinnett after learning that Lovett was very ill, and the mob&#x27;s presence forced many remaining Black residents out of Harrison on January 28, 1909. Stinnet was set to be hanged on March 24, 1909, but his execution was delayed for three hours because he was drunk. Stinnet died as a result of strangulation from a failed hanging fifteen minutes after his execution began.

====Later 20th century====
The bank robber and convicted murderer Henry Starr was in Harrison on February 18, 1921, when Starr and three companions entered the People&#x27;s State Bank and robbed it of $6,000.00. During the robbery, Starr was shot by the former president of the bank, William J. Myers. Starr was carried to the town jail, where he died the next morning.

On May 7, 1961, heavy rain caused Crooked Creek, immediately south of the downtown business district, to flood the town square and much of the southwestern part of the city. Water levels inside buildings reached eight feet (2.5 m). Many small buildings and automobiles were swept away. According to the American Red Cross, four people died, 80 percent of the town&#x27;s business district was destroyed, and over 300 buildings were damaged or destroyed in losses exceeding $5.4 million.
In 1962, Sam Walton opened his second Walmart store in Harrison.

In 1982, Kingdom Identity Ministries, an anti-gay Christian Identity outreach ministry identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, was founded in Harrison.

===21st century===
Harrison&#x27;s Community Task Force on Race Relations was established in 2003 to &quot;promote diversity and respond to racial-bias accusations against the city&quot;. City officials have made efforts to counteract organized racist activity with educational forums and billboards promoting tolerance. They also attempted to downplay the city&#x27;s racist reputation and improve its image by editing the town&#x27;s Wikipedia article.

In 2014, a peace march and vigil celebrating the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. was held in downtown Harrison, hosted by the Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission. In December of the same year, a dedication was held for a Confederate monument in Harrison.

In 2017, Mayor Dan Sherrell and Boone County Judge Robert Hathaway signed proclamations recognizing June as Confederate Heritage and History Month.

Kevin Cheri, who became the first African-American employed in the area in 1978, received death threats shortly after his arrival, which prompted him to leave the area. He returned in 2007, and in 2019 was recognized by mayor Jerry Jackson when Harrison issued its first-ever Black History Month proclamation.

In June 2020, a group of around 300 gathered in Harrison to protest police brutality in the murder of George Floyd while 15 people armed with rifles and displaying Confederate and American flags looked on.
 the Southern Poverty Law Center has said that Kingdom Identity Ministries (founded in Harrison) has a location in the city.

The advertisement described churches of every main denomination, that the town had electric and telephone service, a bank, canning factory, feed stores, a machine shop, mill, a modern garage, lumber yards and various types of stores. The ad claimed the town was started in 1878 after J.H. Middleton of Missouri came and began a general store.

In the 1930s, the town attempted to qualify as a border city due to its proximity to the Arkansas/Missouri state line. Missouri&#x27;s gas taxes are lower than Arkansas&#x27;, thus Omaha tried to take advantage of the lower tax. That incorporation was found to be invalid by the state supreme court in 1941.

Old US 65 went through Omaha, causing travelers from further south in Arkansas (such as Harrison) to go through Omaha on the way to Missouri, and likewise for travelers heading further south from Missouri. Businesses along the route were able to thrive. Although the new U.S. Route 65, opened in late 1999, was judged to be safer and reduced travel time, it completely bypassed Omaha. Businesses deriving revenue from the tourist trade felt the impact on the first day of the new road opening. Ultimately, they were devastated. Some businesses planned to relocate to Branson at the time. Many noted that people will never even know Omaha exists. It was noted that old US 65 became so quiet that dogs could safely lie in the street.

Former University of Arkansas football All-American Brandon Burlsworth is buried at Gass Cemetery in Omaha.

<text>Zinc is a town near the east-central edge of Boone County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 92 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area. A chapter of the Ku Klux Klan operates in Zinc.

==History==
Zinc mining in the area gave the town its name. Zinc and lead mining began in the 1890s and peaked during World War I (1914–1918). A post office was established in Zinc in 1900 and the town was incorporated in 1904.

The town had a number of business establishments and a school in the 1920s, but a flood in 1927 caused damage to homes and businesses. Zinc&#x27;s population was 188 in 1930 and declined thereafter. The last store closed in Zinc in the late 1960s and the post office closed in 1975.

Zinc, in the 21st century, became the headquarters of a chapter of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The &quot;Christian Revival Center&quot; near Zinc belongs to a preacher named Thomas Robb who is also the leader of the Knights of the KKK. The center hosts events connected with the KKK, including in 2013 a &quot;Klan Kamp&quot; called the &quot;Soldiers of the Cross Training Institute&quot; to instill &quot;the tools to become actively involved&quot; in the &quot;struggle for our racial redemption&quot;.

Other activities of the KKK near Zinc include the placement of signs along highways with messages such as &quot;Diversity is a code for #whitegenocide&quot;.

In May 2022, English YouTuber Niko Omilana published a video documenting his experiences in Zinc and Harrison while disguised as a journalist for the BBC. The video includes an interview with Robb, where Robb unwittingly shouts out fake Instagram users whose names phoneticize phrases such as &quot;BLM&quot;.

<text>Warren is a city in and the county seat of Bradley County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,003.

==History==
When settlers from the east began to arrive in south Arkansas, the land was inhabited by the indigenous tribe known as the Quapaw. The earliest cession of territory was made in 1818, with a later boundary against the neighboring Choctaw tribe in 1820, opening up the southeastern corner of the Arkansas Territory for settlement. Although the area had been settled by European-Americans for approximately thirty years, the city itself was not incorporated until 1851. Tradition says the city is named after a former slave, freed by Captain Hugh Bradley, the namesake of the county and leader of the main early settlement party which established the city. The original plat was laid out on land donated by Isaac Pennington, a key member of Bradley&#x27;s company.

The Missouri Pacific Railroad map dated 1891 shows a railroad to Warren. A main railroad line ran between Pine Bluff, Arkansas and Monroe, Louisiana with spurs to Warren, Arkansas and Arkansas City, Arkansas.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, Warren found itself in the middle of a boom in the timber industry. In March 1901, the Arkansas Lumber Company with headquarters in Warren was incorporated by Moses Rittenhouse and John Embree. In Sept. 1901, the Bradley Lumber Company of Warren was created by Samuel Holmes Fullerton of St. Louis, MO. In 1902, the Southern Lumber Company of Warren was created.

During the 1950s, Potlatch Forests Inc. purchased the Bradley Lumber Company and Southern Lumber Company. The Arkansas Lumber Company went out of business.

Timber and lumber continues to be important to the city&#x27;s economy, although the lumber yards that were vital to Warren throughout the past century are no longer in operation.

The city&#x27;s Victorian-era courthouse was originally built in 1903 and still maintains the exterior character, despite necessary refurbishments to the interior offices and courtroom.

==Geography==
Warren is located in northeast Bradley County on high ground west of the Saline River, a tributary of the Ouachita River. U.S. Route 63 passes through the center of the city, leading north to Pine Bluff and southwest to El Dorado.

<text>Eureka Springs is a city in Carroll County, Arkansas, United States, and one of two county seats for the county. It is located in the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas, near the border with Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,166.

In 1970 the entire city, as of its borders at that time, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Eureka Springs Historic District. Eureka Springs has been selected as one of &quot;America&#x27;s Distinctive Destinations&quot; by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Eureka Springs was originally called &quot;The Magic City&quot;, &quot;Little Switzerland of the Ozarks&quot;, and later the &quot;Stairstep Town&quot; because of its mountainous terrain and the winding, up-and-down paths of its streets and walkways.

It is a tourist destination for its unique character as a Victorian resort, which first attracted visitors to use its then believed healing springs. The city has steep winding streets filled with Victorian-style cottages and manors. The historic commercial downtown of the city has an extensive streetscape of well-preserved Victorian buildings. The buildings are primarily constructed of local stone, built along limestone streets that curve around the hills, and rise and fall with the topography in a five-mile long loop. Some buildings have street-level entrances on more than one floor and other such oddities: the Basin Park Hotel has its front entrances on the floor below first, and a ground-level emergency exit in the back of the building on the fifth floor. The streets wind around the town, with few intersecting at right angles. There are no traffic lights.

==History==


===19th century===
Native American legends tell of a Great Healing Spring in the Eureka Springs area. People of various indigenous cultures long visited the springs for this sacred purpose. The hills and valleys of the area are ancestral lands of the historic Osage Nation, and bands of Delaware and Shawnee peoples also lived in the area before the federal government conducted Indian removal further west.

The European Americans also believed that the natural springs had healing powers. After European Americans arrived, they described the waters of the springs as having magical powers. Dr. Alvah Jackson was credited in American history with locating the major spring, and in 1856 claimed that the waters of Basin Spring had cured his eye ailments. Dr. Jackson established a hospital in a local cave during the Civil War and used the waters from Basin Spring to treat his patients. After the war, Jackson marketed the spring waters as &quot;Dr. Jackson&#x27;s Eye Water&quot;.

In 1879 Judge J.B. Saunders, a friend of Jackson, claimed that his crippling disease was cured by the spring waters. Saunders started promoting Eureka Springs to friends and family members across the state and created a boomtown. Within a period of little more than one year, the city expanded from a rural spa village to a major city. Within a short time in the late 19th century, Eureka Springs had become a flourishing city, spa and tourist destination.

On February 14, 1880, Eureka Springs was incorporated as a city. Thousands of visitors came to the springs based on Saunders&#x27;s promotion, and covered the area with tents and shanties. In 1881, Eureka Springs enjoyed the status of Arkansas&#x27;s fourth-largest city, and by 1889 it had become the second largest city, behind Little Rock.

Early African-American residents were freedmen who had moved to the city from farms where they were previously enslaved. Some visited for employment or for health benefits and stayed. During decades of segregation, Black-owned hotels were available for Black visitors, who were prohibited from whites-only lodging. A school and African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Pilgrim&#x27;s Chapel were established in the 1890s by the Black community. Segregation increased in the area after the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, allowing &quot;separate but equal&quot; facilities. African Americans were banned from all springs except Harding Spring.

After his term as a Reconstruction-era governor of Arkansas, Republican Powell Clayton moved to the strongly Unionist Eureka Springs in 1872 and began promoting the city and its commercial interests. Clayton marketed the town as a retirement community for the wealthy. Eureka Springs soon became known for gracious living and a wealthy lifestyle.

In 1882, the Eureka Improvement Company was formed to attract a railroad to the city. With the completion of the railroad, Eureka Springs became a more accessible destination and became known as a vacation resort. In two years, thousands of homes and commercial enterprises were constructed. The Crescent Hotel was built in 1886 and the Basin Park Hotel in 1905. In 1892, the New Orleans Hotel and Spa was built along Spring Street. In the 21st century, it operates as an all-suite hotel, furnished with Victorian furniture and art.

These many Victorian buildings have been well preserved, forming a coherent streetscape that has been recognized for its quality. Some continue to be operated for their original purposes others have been adapted for other uses.

===20th century===
The Ozarka Water Company was formed in Eureka Springs in 1905. Carrie Nation moved there toward the end of her life, founding Hatchet Hall on Steele Street. The building was later operated as a museum, but is now closed.

The only bank robbery to occur in Eureka Springs was on September 27, 1922, when five outlaws from Oklahoma tried to rob the First National Bank. Three of the men were killed and the other two wounded. Today it is reenacted every year during the antique car parade which is NW Arkansas&#x27; longest running car show and was started by Bobby Ball and Frank Green. In 2018 it celebrated its 48th year.

Economic decline, racial segregation and discrimination, Klan activities, and collapse of tourism during World War I resulted in a slow decline of the African-American community through the 1920s and 1930s. The AME church disbanded in 1925. Mattie, Alice, and Richard Banks, descendants of the African-American Fancher family, which had long been associated with the city, continued to reside there until their deaths in 1966, 1969, and 1975, respectively.

Opera in the Ozarks at Inspiration Point was founded in 1950. The organization continues to present an annual summer opera festival in Eureka Springs.

In 1964, Gerald L.K. Smith began building a religious theme park named Sacred Projects that was proposed to include a life size recreation of Jerusalem. The project never fully developed but two of the components are major city-defining projects today—the seven-story Christ of the Ozarks statue designed by Emmet Sullivan and the nearby &quot;The Great Passion Play&quot; performed during the summer. It is regularly performed from May through October by a cast of 170 actors and dozens of live animals. The script of &quot;The Great Passion Play&quot; has been altered from the original, which set Jesus&#x27;s beating at Herod&#x27;s court and included a monologue blaming his death on the Jews. It has been seen by an estimated 7.7 million people, which makes it the largest-attended outdoor drama in the United States, according to the Institute of Outdoor Theatre of the University of East Carolina at Greenville, North Carolina. Christian-themed attractions have been added in association with the drama production. These include a New Holy Land Tour, featuring a full-scale re-creation of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness; a section of the Berlin Wall; and a Bible Museum featuring more than 6,000 Bibles. (Items include an original 1611 King James Bible, a leaf from a Gutenberg Bible, and the only Bible signed by all of the original founders of the Gideons.)

Isolation and affordable property made Eureka Springs an attractive back-to-the-land destination for hippies, counterculture radicals, and lesbian separatists in the late 1960s and 1970s. While first facing resistance from many locals, as businesses were established and increased tourism, so did mutual respect. The accepting environment fostered a network of gay and lesbian business owners, and the town became known as a resort town for LGBT tourism. During the AIDS crisis, community members formed the Ozark AIDS Resources and Service to distribute mutual aid and care. Eureka Springs suffered stronger impacts than other parts of the state, and the community lost many leaders and establishments.

Architect E. Fay Jones designed Thorncrown Chapel in 1980, and it was selected for the &quot;Twenty-five Year Award&quot; by the American Institute of Architects in 2006. The award recognizes structures that have had significant influence on the profession. The chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 because of the special nature and quality of its architecture.

===21st century===
On May 10, 2014, Eureka Springs became the first city in Arkansas to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On May 12, 2015, Eureka Springs passed a Non-Discrimination Ordinance (Ord. 2223), with voters choosing 579 for to 261 against.

It became the first city in Arkansas to have such a law to cover LGBT residents and tourists.
But a state law intended to invalidate the anti-discrimination ordinance went into effect July 22, 2015.

This Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act, sponsored by state senator Bart Hester, &quot;prohibits cities from passing civil rights ordinances that extend protections beyond those already afforded by state law.&quot; In response, the town&#x27;s mayor stated that they would be &quot;prepared to defend their ordinance in court.&quot;
==Geography==
Eureka Springs is located in western Carroll County. The center of the city is in a narrow valley at the headwaters of Leatherwood Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the White River. Houses and streets climb both sides of the valley to the surrounding ridgecrests. U.S. Route 62 runs along a ridgecrest through the southern part of the city and leads east to Berryville and west to Rogers. Arkansas Highway 23 is Main Street through the center of Eureka Springs and leads north to the Missouri state line.

The city was founded when the springs at this location were more evident. Over-extraction of water from the springs has greatly diminished their flow rates. All of the more than 140 springs in the town are cold-water springs.

===Climate===

== Early History ==
The first known settler in the area was John Scott, “a maker of sheep and cowbells,” who was also briefly the postmaster and named the town Scott&#x27;s Prairie after himself. First Baptist Church was built from logs in 1854 and was the local school. The Methodist Church opened in 1857.

In June 1861, up to 5,000 Confederate soldiers led by Brig. Gen. James H. McBride set up camp in and around town, prompting Yankees in November 1863 under Maj. Austin A. King to burn the town to the ground. However, the Skirmish of Yocum Creek resulted in the only known casualties between Southern defenders and a Union patrol evacuating northern sympathizers, who were not exactly popular after the Yankees burned down Berryville, too.

The town was rebuilt and a new post office opened in 1867 with John Grim as postmaster. When clearing land on his farm, Grim had left a grove of shade trees untouched, which his neighbors dubbed “Green Forest”—or according to some accounts &quot;Grim&#x27;s Forest.&quot;

By 1889 the town had a cotton gin operated by J. R. Hanby. The Green Forest Tribune began publication in 1889. A three-story school was built in 1893, replacing an earlier thirty-by-twenty-five-foot schoolhouse.

After Eureka Springs succeeded in dividing the county into two judicial districts, claiming the western district as its own, Green Forest proposed becoming the county seat for the eastern district, but was outvoted by larger Berryville.

In 1901, the St. Louis and North Arkansas Railroad built a rail line connecting Eureka Springs to Harrison. Stores and businesses sprang up around the Green Forest railroad depot. On September 20, 1902, a fire destroyed several businesses around the depot, including the Stone Hotel, Dr. Morrow’s Drug Store, W. L. Crow’s Store, and the printing offices of Crow &amp; Pyron.

A new school building was erected in 1905, costing $5,000 to construct and $900 to furnish. The school was never used, though, as it was destroyed by fire on August 8, 1905. Another new school was quickly built, financed by 70 property owners who pledged two dollars for every $100 of property they owned, according to the Carroll County assessments.

Around that time, traveling preacher Lester Sumrall held a six-week revival. It was interrupted by an angry farmer in the middle of the sermon one night, who called out a neighbor who&#x27;d been cavorting with the farmer’s wife. The farmer shot the neighbor dead in front of the congregation. According to Sumrall&#x27;s autobiography, the altar call drew quite a response that night, resulting in the founding of today&#x27;s First Assembly of God.

In 1906, Willis Wood and Will Huttig of Kansas City along with engineer E. S. W. Drought and government assayer H. S. Mohun, drilled a 140-foot well and reported finding gold. Prospective investors hurried to profit, but it turned out the drillers were crooks—no gold.

By 1927, the town&#x27;s businesses included the First National Bank of Green Forest, chartered in 1901, several grocery stores, a marble and granite works, a wood milling company, a blacksmith, a hardware company, a tomato cannery, a telephone company, a bakery, a feed mill and a car dealership in what had been the Hanby cotton gin. It later became Tanner’s Hardware, the Country Rooster Cafe and now is Grace Baptist Church on the Square.

Most of the businesses around the train depot were destroyed along with the town of Denver in a 1927 tornado. Main Street survived, but the business district around the depot was devastated and not rebuilt. Denver, Arkansas, never recovered. The destroyed Green Forest train station was patched together with the old depot at Urbanette.

Today&#x27;s restored Green Forest train station next to the soccer and baseball fields at the city park still has Urbanette markings on the big cargo door.

The public library opened in 1935.

Green Forest is the birthplace and childhood home of the late Cosmopolitan magazine publisher Helen Gurley Brown. It is also the birthplace of Baptist missionary David Crockett Graham, who also studied Chinese culture as an anthropologist.

In June 2008, construction was completed to convert the two-lane combined highway of 82, 65 and 278 inside of the city limits of Lake Village into a four-lane highway, with an added stoplight and sidewalks on both sides of the road. There has been no indication of whether plans for widening the highway further south to the Greenville Bridge over the Mississippi are still viable, or when construction might begin.

<text>Amity is a city in Clark County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 723 at the 2010 census. The city began on the Caddo River in the mid-19th century when William F. Browning and others, including A.B. Clingman, at various times moved to the area.

==History==
Amity was founded in 1847 by several pioneer families from the Mount Bethel area of Clark County under the leadership of William F. Browning, who served as the Clark County surveyor from 1846 until his death in 1854. The group settled along the Caddo River, drawn to the area by an abundance of rich bottomland and fresh water. Browning constructed a two-story log house just west of Caney Creek, which soon became the center of the expanding community. It was Browning who gave Amity its name.

Together with other citizens, Browning formed the Caddo Valley Baptist Church of Christ, which before several other names would later develop into the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Glenwood and First Baptist Church in Amity. It is thought to be the first religious organization in the area, though A.B. Clingman, a physician and minister associated with the Church of Christ was in the area before Browning&#x27;s group arrived. Browning&#x27;s group built a large log house that would serve as both the church and the school house. The first school teacher was Captain Robert S. Burke, a former military officer and Browning&#x27;s brother-in-law. A few months later, the first Amity Post Office was established nearby.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, the community saw dark times. Initially in support of the Confederacy, soon the community became divided, with the men of Amity leaving to fight in both the Confederate Army and the Union Army. In several cases, families were split by their loyalties, causing turmoil within the small community. Midway through the war, Union soldiers burned the Burke schoolhouse and the Browning cotton press.

Following the war&#x27;s end, the center of the community shifted to a location south of the Caddo River, first settled by John Hays Allen and Amariah Biggs. Biggs was widely known as a physician and Methodist minister, and first settled in the area around 1850. The Amity Post Office was soon after relocated to this area. In 1870, retired army Colonel Philander Curtis, a Connecticut native, settled in the area. Curtis built the first house where the town of Amity now stands, and served for several years as the town&#x27;s postmaster. In 1871, Col. Curtis and businessmen Riley Thompson and Jacob H. Lightsey purchased property from John Hays Allen, and on that property they laid out plans for the town, centering on a public square. By 1874 Amity had become a thriving village, with several new businesses and churches. In 1877 an adjacent area became &quot;Amity Township&quot;, and in 1880 the town made a move to become incorporated, but it did not come to pass until 1907.

In the late 1870s a new schoolhouse was built. Its first teacher was Richard Melancthon Burke, son of Captain Robert Burke. The residents also formed the Amity Male and Female Academy, which eventually became Amity High School. Richard Burke died in 1883, and the school struggled until 1888, when Samual M. Samson arrived in Amity. Samson spent the next twenty years as the head of the high school, which at that time was a private school. After his departure, it was absorbed into the Amity Public School System.

In 1887, a false rumor that gold had been discovered in an area then known as the Trap Mountains resulted in a brief gold rush, which ended when the rumor proved false. Shortly after 1900, the Gurdon and Fort Smith Railroad was constructed through Amity, greatly improving the economy of the town. Soon, the logging industry began to thrive, with large sawmills opening in Rosboro and Glenwood. Amity became a main shipping and trade center for the area, and in 1905 the Bank of Amity opened, which now is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1899 the town&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Amity Enterprise&quot;, went into circulation, followed by the &quot;Four-County Courier&quot; in 1915 and the &quot;Amity Owl&quot; in 1922. Just before World War II, the shortage of cinnabar caused a brief but productive mining industry in the nearby mountains south of the town, a phenomenon which became known as the Quicksilver Rush. However, any significant mining had ended by 1940, and following the war and an increased worldwide supply, the mines closed.

===Recent history===
With the Bean Lumber Company opening in 1940, followed by the Barksdale Lumber Company, logging soon became the main source of employment for the town. At its peak, the Bean Lumber Company was producing more than 150 million board feet of pine lumber and 120 million board feet of treated lumber annually, making it one of the largest distributors of southern pine in the United States. The Bean Lumber Company would later open mills in Glenwood and in Buckner, Missouri.

A.J. Hunter, who had originally come to town in 1905 to manage the city&#x27;s first telephone exchange and who would later, upon the closure of the city&#x27;s newspaper, begin &quot;The Owl,&quot; sold the paper in the 1940s to Marvin C. Bass of Little Rock. The paper then operated until the mid-1950s and closed, though no one remembers when or why it closed.

By 2007 Bean Lumber was struggling financially and was under investigation for financial matters. The Amity mill closed, though the planer and treatment plants remained open. The Glenwood mill, which employed many Amity residents, closed and did not reopen until 2008. All of these events thoroughly affected the local economy, diminishing employment opportunities in the community, as well as briefly diminishing the population of the town, with many people being forced to search for work elsewhere.

In 1995, Amity School District merged with Glenwood School District to create Centerpoint High School, located midway between the two towns, in Rosboro, Pike County. The private Ouachita Hills Academy and Ouachita Hills College, associated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, are located southwest of Amity on the Clark-Pike county line. Word of Faith Christian Academy is located east of town between Amity and Alpine.

In 1996, Arkadelphia native Joe May founded the city&#x27;s fourth newspaper, &quot;The Standard&quot;. The paper is a weekly publication and covers Clark and Pike counties as well as the Bismarck, Arkansas, area. In addition to publishing the newspaper, May Publishing Company puts out the Trade Days Gazette, a free-circulation paper at the monthly Amity Trade Days event. They also publish the Old Time Chronicle, a quarterly folk history magazine covering South Arkansas.

In 2007, the city observed its 100th anniversary of incorporation with a two-day festival on the square. In 2008, the city&#x27;s businesspeople formed the Amity Area Chamber of Commerce.

In 2015, Russell and Kim Jones of Rosboro started Amity Trade Days in the former Bean Lumber Company&#x27;s sawmill facility. Trade Days is a monthly flea market modeled after those in Canton, Texas. It attracts more than 6,000 people per month and has nearly 200 venders. It is held the first weekend (Thursday-Sunday) after the first Monday of each month.

Piggott is perhaps best known for its association with American writer and Nobel laureate Ernest Hemingway, whose second wife Pauline Pfeiffer was the daughter of prominent local landowner and businessman Paul Pfeiffer. After meeting and marrying in Paris in the late 1920s, Hemingway and Pauline made frequent and lengthy visits to her parents&#x27; home in Piggott, where Ernest Hemingway wrote portions of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, and other works. The Pfeiffer House and Carriage House are now preserved as the Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum and Educational Center, run by Arkansas State University.

The Piggott Post Office is the home of an oil-on-canvas mural &quot;Air Mail&quot; painted in 1941 by Dan Rhodes and funded by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, a New Deal public art program. The mural was featured on a sheet of U.S. postage stamps, &quot;Post Office Murals,&quot; issued on April 10, 2019.

== History ==

Initially named Sugar Loaf, Heber Springs was founded by Max Frauenthal. In 1881, Frauenthal bought land in Van Buren County from John T. Jones. He founded the Sugar Loaf Springs Company and plotted a town site which was incorporated as &quot;Sugar Loaf&quot; on October 4, 1882. In 1883, Frauenthal donated land for the courthouse square, built a frame courthouse to be used by the soon-to-be-created Cleburne County, and donated the land for Spring Park, thus securing the county seat for the new town. Frauenthal chose the name Cleburne County to honor Confederate General Patrick Cleburne, who was killed in the Battle of Franklin in 1864. In 1910, Sugar Loaf&#x27;s name was changed to Heber Springs in order to avoid confusion with another town with a post office named Sugar Loaf. Frauenthal chose the new name to honor John T. Jones&#x27;s son, Dr. Heber Jones, who was a prominent physician in Memphis, Tennessee, where Frauenthal had since moved.

The 200–300 feet long &quot;Swinging Bridge&quot; over the Little Red River was erected in 1912, closed for vehicles 1972 and kept for pedestrians in a recreational area and placed in National Register of Historic Places in 1985. On 28 October 1989 30 to 50 young pedestrians rocked the span back and forth until the upstream steel cable of the suspension bridge broke. The span flipped, the other cable broke and the bridge collapsed and fell 30 feet deep into the river. At least 5 people died, 18 were hurt.

=== Greers Ferry Dam ===
Located on the Little Red River, the dam was dedicated in October 1963 by President John F. Kennedy just one month before his assassination. This event marks the only time a sitting president has visited Cleburne County.

In May 2003, the 63-year-old main building at the Kingsland School was destroyed by fire. Damages were estimated to be over $2.1 million. The building&#x27;s old pine, along with the varnish on the floors, oil on the wood inside, and a gas heating system all contributed to the fierce blaze.

<text>Rison, officially the City of Rison, is a city in and the county seat of Cleveland County, Arkansas, United States. Its population was 1,344 at the 2010 U.S. census. It is included in the Pine Bluff, Arkansas Metropolitan Statistical Area. Rison is a bedroom community for people who work in Pine Bluff (in neighboring Jefferson County). The largest employers are the city and county governments, the Cleveland County School District, the Cleveland County Nursing Home. There are two banks, eight churches, and about forty-five businesses within the city limits. Among the local properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Rison Cities Service Station and the Rison Texaco Service Station.

==History==
The Texas and St. Louis Railroad gave rise to Rison. The county seat of Dorsey County (present day Cleveland County) was originally Toledo. When the railroad was routed through the county in 1882, Rison did not exist. Samuel Fordyce of Huntsville, Alabama, a former Union army officer, was authorized to determine the route of the railroad from Texarkana to Birds Point, Missouri. According to unsubstantiated legend, when the leading citizens of Toledo snubbed his plans to route the railroad through that community, Fordyce planned a route three miles north and built a station through land that would later become Rison.

Fordyce named the new station for William Rison, his former business partner in a banking venture in Alabama, who had fought on the opposite side of the Civil War. The first home erected in the community the small settlement that grew up around the new station was built in 1880 by lawyer and farmer James McMurtrey. In 1883, the Southwest Improvement Association, a subsidiary of the railroad company, presented a parcel of land for use by the inhabitants of the area that became Rison. The settlement was incorporated on August 26, 1890, with J. T. Renfrow as mayor. The name of the county was changed from Dorsey to Cleveland in 1885; the popularity of U.S. Senator Stephen Dorsey had waned, and President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s name was substituted. The Arkansas Supreme Court relocated the county seat from Toledo to Rison in 1891 after a spirited battle among the leading contenders, Toledo, Kingsland, and Rison.

The railroad remained Rison&#x27;s point of reference for decades. “Rison on the Cotton Belt” was the affectionate way residents referred to their community. The commercial value of the railroad was felt from the beginning. The economy depended on the production of cotton, lumber, and, ultimately, a wide variety of wood products, including pulpwood, piling, pallets, broom handle squares, ammunition boxes, and Army pup tent poles.

The financial make-up of the community was divided for several decades into owners and sharecroppers. The emergence of the timber-related wood products business ultimately skewed that economic picture, with the corresponding rise of the merchant entrepreneurs also affecting it somewhat. Nevertheless, family fortunes were built on the owner/sharecropper system, and they influenced the financial and social structure of the town. Sharecropping was the prevailing structure of the primary business enterprise in the county until the land became depleted by failure to rotate crops adequately.

The Cleveland County Courthouse was built in 1911 after two contested elections. Two years later, the Phoenix Hotel was built and served as a popular gathering spot for the local community.

Three cotton gins operated in and around Rison. The largest and most efficient gin was owned by Ira E. Moore. That gin was built in 1933 to replace one owned by Moore that was built in 1926 and burned in 1933. The more modern and efficient all-electric gin built in 1933 was the first of its kind in the area.

Residents of Rison owned and operated a dozen or more sawmills. The largest lumber mills were the J. I. Porter Lumber Company and the Clio Lumber Company. The Clio mill was built in 1887 five miles north of Rison. According to a 1909 issue of &quot;Lumberman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the Clio mill owned several thousand acres of timberland and had 432 employees in the sawmill, 130 on the woods crew, and eighty operating the tramlines that transported the logs to the mill. Other mills that added significantly to the economy were the J. L. Sadler Lumber Company, the C. L. Garner &amp; Sons Lumber Company, and the Elrod Lumber Company. In the 1950s, Elrod employed about one-third of Rison&#x27;s population, more than 300.

During World War II, many Rison residents secured war-related jobs in nearby towns. These included the Pine Bluff Arsenal (Jefferson County) and the Naval Ammunition Depot at Camden (Ouachita County). Others went to California to work in the shipbuilding industry. The Rison high school&#x27;s football program was suspended until the end of the war due to a lack of players and coaches, as well as financial constraints. One of Rison&#x27;s citizens, Airman Roy Martin, was shot down over occupied France and classified as missing in action. The French underground secured his freedom by hiding him in attics, barns, and other places not known to the German occupying forces. When the news of Martin&#x27;s survival reached Rison, a wild celebration broke out in streets and homes.

The Arkansas Board of Education (ABE) voted to dissolve the Stephens School District in 2014, and the portion serving McNeil was given to the Magnolia School District. Before the ABE made its final decision to break up the Stephens district, it was deciding whether to consolidate it entirely with the Nevada School District or divide it into three pieces. McNeil residents favored the split-up proposal because their children could go to school in Magnolia, which is closer to McNeil than Stephens; Magnolia is from McNeil.

==History==
Plumerville began as Plummer&#x27;s Station, a stage station on the Fort Smith to Memphis branch of the Butterfield Overland Mail.

The old downtown area of Plumerville was completely destroyed by fire in 1987. The old town jail or &quot;calaboose&quot; (built circa 1880) still stands intact on Springfield Street near the new city hall.

===Assassination===
John Middleton Clayton (October 13, 1840 – January 29, 1889) was a Republican carpetbagger to Arkansas, originally from Pennsylvania. He was also the younger brother of Powell Clayton, a Governor of Arkansas.

In 1871, John Clayton was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives, representing Jefferson County, and in 1873 he served in the Arkansas Senate representing Jefferson, Bradley, Grant and Lincoln counties, also serving as Speaker of the Senate &quot;pro tempore&quot; for part of his term.

He is best remembered today from his mysterious assassination in 1889. In 1888, he ran for the office of Arkansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, going up against incumbent Democrat Clifton R. Breckinridge. The election became one of the most fraudulent in Arkansas&#x27; history. Clayton lost the election by a margin of 846 votes of over 34,000 votes cast. However, in one case in Conway County, four masked, armed white men stormed into a predominantly black voting precinct and, at gunpoint, stole the ballot box that contained a large majority of votes for Clayton. Losing under such circumstances, Clayton decided to contest the election and went to Plumerville to start an investigation on the matter. On the evening of January 29, 1889, an unknown assailant shot through the window to the room he was staying in at a local boarding house (still standing at 101 N. Springfield Street) and killed him instantly. He was later declared the winner of the election and Breckinridge was unseated and the seat declared vacant. Clayton&#x27;s assassin was never found. Breckinridge was not found guilty in any wrongdoing in the rigged election or in Clayton&#x27;s assassination and was elected to fill the vacant seat in 1890.

==Education==
It is within the South Conway County School District. It operates Morrilton High School.

In 1980 the East Side, Morrilton, and Plumerville School districts consolidated to form the new South Conway County district.

*Maurice Jeffers (1979-) Professional basketball player
*John H. Yancey, (1918-1986) Highly decorated United States Marine Corps combat veteran of World War II and the Korean War.
