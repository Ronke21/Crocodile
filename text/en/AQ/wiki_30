<text>Petaluma is a city in Sonoma County, California, United States, located in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Its population was 59,776 according to the 2020 census.

Petaluma&#x27;s name comes from the Miwok village named &quot;Péta Lúuma&quot; that was located on the banks of the Petaluma River. The modern city originates in Rancho Petaluma, granted in 1834 to famed Californio statesman Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, considered to be the founder of Petaluma. Today, Petaluma is known for its well-preserved historic center and as a local hub for the Petaluma Valley region of Sonoma County.

==History==
The Coast Miwok resided throughout Marin and southern Sonoma County. The village of (Coast Miwok for &quot;backside of the hill&quot;, or &quot;sloping ridge&quot;) was east of the Petaluma River, with a number of other Coast Miwok villages nearby: was immediately to the south of , on the opposite side of the river; and were near today&#x27;s downtown; and and were just north of today&#x27;s city limits.

The Petaluma area was part of a 1834 Mexican land grant by Governor Jose Figueroa to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo called Rancho Petaluma. In 1836, Vallejo ordered construction of his Rancho Petaluma Adobe, a ranch house near Petaluma, which his family often used as a summer home, while he resided in the neighboring town of Sonoma. Vallejo&#x27;s influence and Mexican control in the region began to decline after Vallejo&#x27;s arrest during the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846.

Pioneers moved to Petaluma from the eastern United States after James Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada in 1848. The town&#x27;s position on the Petaluma River in the heart of productive farmland was critical to its growth during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Sailing scows, such as the scow schooner &quot;Alma&quot; (1892), and steamers plied the river between Petaluma and San Francisco, carrying agricultural produce and raw materials to the burgeoning city of San Francisco during the California Gold Rush.

There were brothels downtown along Petaluma Boulevard, which used to be the main thoroughfare until U.S. Highway 101 was constructed in the 1950s. The Petaluma Historic Commercial District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Sonoma County Bank Building was the home of the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company and the Petaluma Seed Bank until 2019. It was built in 1926.

Petaluma soon became known for its grain milling and chicken processing industries, which continue to the present day as a smaller fraction of its commerce. At one time, Petaluma was known as the &quot;Egg Capital of the World,&quot; sparking such nicknames as &quot;Chickaluma&quot;. Petaluma hosted the only known poultry drugstore and is the place where the coal lamp egg incubator was invented by Lyman Byce in 1879.

One of the largest historic chicken processing plants still stands in the central area of town; this 1930s brick building is no longer used for the chicken industry, but is being evaluated for preservation and change of use. While it is no longer known as the Egg Capital of the World, Petaluma maintains a strong agricultural base today with dairy farms, olive groves, vineyards, and berry and vegetable farms.

According to the Army Museum at the Presidio, San Francisco, Petaluma was relatively unharmed during the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, due to significant stable bedrock underlying the region. As one of the few communities in the region left standing after the earthquake, Petaluma was the staging point for most Sonoma County rescue and relief efforts.

There are extant pre-1906 buildings and Victorian homes on the western side of the river. The downtown area has suffered many river floods over the years and during the Depression commerce declined. A lack of funds prevented the demolition of the old homes and buildings. In the 1960s there was a counterculture migration out of San Francisco into Marin County and southern Sonoma County, in search of inexpensive housing in a less urban environment. The old Victorian, Queen Anne and Eastlake-style houses were restored. Historic iron-front buildings in the downtown commercial district were also rescued. Traffic and new home development for the most part was rerouted to the east of downtown by the construction of Highway 101.

The first official airmail flight took place in 1911, when Fred Wiseman carried a handful of mail from Petaluma to Santa Rosa, including letters from Petaluma postmaster John E. Olmstead and the mayor of Petaluma. Wiseman&#x27;s plane ended up in the National Air and Space Museum.

There was a substantial influx of Jewish residents to the area in the first three decades of the 20th century. Most of the settlers were secular Eastern European Jews; they founded today&#x27;s B&#x27;nai Israel Jewish Center as a secular Jewish community center with no rabbi and only a small area for prayer. The community became active in the poultry industry, and some settlers joined the local labor movement and participated in leftist political organizing, leading to significant conflicts between integrationists who aimed to quietly integrate into Petaluma society and socialists who hoped to change it.

With its large stock of historic buildings, Petaluma has been used as the filming location for numerous movies set in the 1940s through the 1960s (see list of movies below). The historic McNear Building is a common film location.

Petaluma pioneered the time-controlled approach to development. After Highway 101 was re-aligned as a freeway in 1955, residential development permits tripled, from 300 in 1969 to 900 in 1971. Because of the region&#x27;s soaring population in the sixties, the city enacted the &quot;Petaluma Plan&quot; in 1971. This plan limited the number of building permits to 500 annually for a five-year period beginning in 1972. At the same time Petaluma created a redbelt around the town as a boundary for urban expansion for a stated number of years. Similar to Ramapo, New York, a Residential Development Control System was created to distribute the building permits based on a point system conforming to the city&#x27;s general plan to provide for low and moderate income housing and divide development somewhat equally between east and west and single family and multi-family housing.

The stated objectives of Petaluma&#x27;s time controlled growth management were to ensure orderly growth; to protect the city&#x27;s small town character and surrounding green space; to provide a variety of housing choices; and to maintain adequate water supply and sewage treatment facilities.

The controlled development plan attracted national attention in 1975 when the city was taken to court by the Construction Industry Association. The city&#x27;s restriction was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court in 1975 and the Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of in 1976. This court ruling still forms the foundation for most local growth management ordinances in California.

Despite this history of planned development, the Petaluma City Council voted on April 13, 2009, to eliminate the entire planning department and lay off the whole planning staff. Planning Division responsibilities were subsequently contracted out to the consulting firm Metropolitan Planning Group, which re-hired some of the former planning staff and continues to operate planning services for the city.

In the late 1990s, Petaluma was also known as Telecom Valley due to the telecom startup companies that seemed to multiply from one another, and offer great riches for early stockholders and employees. Two success stories were that of Advanced Fibre Communications (AFC) (now Tellabs), and Cerent, which was purchased by Cisco. Some Cerent employees went on to purchase the Phoenix Theater, a local entertainment venue, which was once an opera house.

In 2021, Petaluma established a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. In March of that year, the city formally prohibited construction of new gas stations, becoming the first municipality in the world to enact such a ban. The city also streamlined the process of building EV charging stations and potential hydrogen filling stations.

The city has identified about two dozen buildings and districts as Petaluma landmarks.

<text>Rohnert Park is a city in Sonoma County, California, United States, located approximately north of San Francisco. The population at the 2020 United States Census was 44,390. It is an early planned city and is the sister city of Hashimoto in Japan. Sonoma State University, part of the California State University system, is located nearby.

==History==

Originally home of the Coast Miwok native people, the Mexican government granted Rancho Cotate to Captain Juan Castaneda in July 1844 for his military services in the region. The grant encompassed present-day Penngrove, Cotati and Rohnert Park. &quot;Cotate Rancho is a part of the Vallejo Township which is the plain between Sonoma Mountain and Petaluma Creek San Pablo Bay, and an east and west line dividing the tract from Santa Rosa Township.&quot; In 1849, Dr. Thomas S. Page, of Cotati, bought Rancho Cotate. Over time, the property was broken up and sold off piecemeal to incoming settlers.

The town of Rohnert Park was named after the Rohnert family, which owned the Rohnert Seed Farm. In 1929, a successful businessman, Waldo Emerson Rohnert (1869–1933), a native of Detroit, Michigan, purchased a large ranch in the area and minimized flooding in the fields with a crude drainage system. He died shortly thereafter. His son, Fred Rohnert, a graduate of Stanford Law School, took over the ranch and developed a seed growing business, the Rohnert Seed Farm, which became a major horticultural success for the county.

In 1956, only four adults resided within the district boundaries. In 1956 and 1957, with the U.S. Route 101 Freeway recently completed at the Cotati bypass, Rohnert Park began to be laid out and built as a planned city. In a summer election in 1962, Rohnert Park was incorporated, comprising , housing an estimated 2,775 persons. It was the first town to incorporate in Sonoma County since 1905. The neighboring town of Cotati, California, voted to incorporate the following year.

===21st-century development===
Sonoma Mountain Village Rohnert Park is a , solar-powered, zero-waste community currently under development.

The Graton Resort &amp; Casino opened on November 5, 2013.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Rohnert Park has a total area of , 99.93% of it land and 0.07% of it water.

The city neighborhoods east of Highway 101 are organized into sections, generally designated by the letters A–H, J-M, R, S, and W. In most cases, the names of streets and parks begin with the letter of the section they are in. K Section is also referred to as the &quot;University District&quot; and is the residential development of the city&#x27;s University Specific Plan Area; W Section is also referred to as &quot;Willowglen&quot; and is the residential development of the city&#x27;s Southeast Specific Plan Area.

There is a small reservoir called Roberts Lake at the north end of the city and a number of creeks. Important creeks include the Laguna de Santa Rosa (which forms part of the border with the City of Cotati), Copeland Creek, Hinebaugh Creek, Crane Creek and Five Creek. All creeks within the city limits have been channelized. Spivock Creek, Coleman Creek, Wilfred Channel, and Labath Channel are artificial channels designed to convey runoff.
Riparian communities within the city are limited by channelization of creekbeds. Vegetation alongside the city&#x27;s streams primarily consists of grass and sedge species. The Laguna de Santa Rosa contains bands of thick native riparian vegetation, including willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.) and alder (&quot;Alnus&quot; spp.) trees.

Sudden oak death fungus risks are present in the Rohnert Park area. Research is ongoing at the nearby Fairfield Osborn Preserve.

===Geology===
The Rodgers Creek Fault is an active fault influencing earthquake activity in the Rohnert Park area. The city also experiences earthquakes from the San Andreas Fault.

====Shooting of Kuanchung Kao====

On April 29, 1997, Kuanchung Kao was waving a wooden stick in the street in front of his driveway. When some neighbors called 911, two officers, Jack Shields and Mike Lynch, responded. Shields shot Kao once in the chest. Shields stated that he believed Kao was waving the stick in a martial arts fashion, and that he and Lynch had to respond by using deadly force. The incident was investigated by the Sonoma County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the Sonoma County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, and FBI, who all cleared Shields. Kao&#x27;s family and attorney John Burris filed a lawsuit against the city of Rohnert Park, and received a settlement of $1 million in 2001.

====2015 police controversy====
On July 29, 2015, Rohnert Park Public Safety Officer Dave Rodriguez drew his sidearm during an encounter with city resident, while the resident was hitching his boat trailer to his vehicle. The resident recorded the incident and posted it on YouTube.

Rodriguez was placed on administrative leave while the city conducted an internal investigation into the incident. In August 2015, the city engaged an independent investigator, who found that Rodriguez&#x27;s actions were within the law and followed department policy.

A civil rights claim filed on behalf of the resident asserted that Rodriguez was trying to intimidate him. The lawsuit concluded in a settlement.

On November 16, 2018, a civil rights lawsuit was filed against Rohnert Park alleging that Rohnert Park police &quot;conspired to expand the legitimate interdiction mission to one of personal financial gain, and over the years seized thousands of pounds of cannabis and hundreds of thousands of dollars of currency without issuing receipts for the seizures, without making arrests for any crimes, and without any official report of the forfeitures being made&quot;. KQED published an investigation in June 2018, quoting complaints by other motorists saying they were &quot;robbed&quot; by the Rohnert Park police, including the officers named in the lawsuit. The police department has since ceased most of its seizure efforts.

In 2020, the city agreed to a $2 Million settlement with the family of Branch Wroth, who died in police custody in 2017, after a $4 Million judgment was vacated on appeal.

<text>Santa Rosa (Spanish for &quot;Saint Rose&quot;) is a city in and the county seat of Sonoma County, in the North Bay region of the Bay Area in California. Its population as of the 2020 census was 178,127. It is the largest city in California&#x27;s Wine Country and Redwood Coast. It is the fifth most populous city in the Bay Area after San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, and Fremont; and the 25th-most populous city in California.

==History==
===Early history===


Before the arrival of Europeans, what became known as the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of Pomo people known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day Spring Lake Regional Park.

Following the arrival of Europeans, initially Spanish explorers and colonists, the Pomos were decimated by violence, land theft, slavery, genocide and smallpox brought from Europe. Social displacement and disruption followed. There are descendants of survivors still living in the region today.

===19th century===
Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named by Mexican colonists after Saint Rose of Lima. The first known permanent European settlement here was the homestead of the Carrillo family of California, in-laws to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, who settled the Sonoma pueblo and Petaluma area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of María López de Carrillo built an adobe house on their Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. By the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, Spanish and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south were known to raise livestock in the area.

They slaughtered animals at the fork of the Santa Rosa Creek and Matanzas Creek, near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa and Sonoma avenues. This is thought to have been the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek; because it was a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called &quot;La Matanza.&quot;

By the 1850s, after the United States annexed California following its victory in the Mexican-American War, a Wells Fargo post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a public square in the center. This pattern has been largely maintained in downtown to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.

In 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city; in 1868, the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it the third incorporated city in Sonoma County after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.

United States Census Bureau records show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily, though it lagged behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. In the 1870 census, Santa Rosa was the eighth-largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California.

===20th century===

By 1900, the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.

According to a 1905 article in the &quot;Press Democrat&quot; reporting on the &quot;Battle of the Trains&quot;, the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city&#x27;s population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.

Santa Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa, the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the Russian River.

The population increased by two-thirds between 1950 and 1970, with an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20-year period. Some of the increase was from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.

In 1958, the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included American Samoa, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for civil defense activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense&#x27;s 69-year history.

When the City Council adopted the city&#x27;s first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year—triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.

&quot;Santa Rosa 2010&quot;, the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city&#x27;s urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa&#x27;s &quot;ultimate&quot; boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as urban sprawl became routine infill development.

At the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it &quot;Vision 2020&quot; (updated to &quot;Santa Rosa 2020&quot;, and then again to &quot;Santa Rosa 2030 Vision&quot;), and added more land and population.

Santa Rosa annexed the community of Roseland in November 2017.

===2017 firestorm===
Beginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city&#x27;s homes were destroyed in the Tubbs Fire, a 45,000-acre wildfire that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County. Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in adjacent Napa County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history. Most homes in the Coffey Park, Larkfield-Wikiup, and Fountain Grove neighborhoods were destroyed.

A notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1,000 animals at the renowned Safari West Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa. All of the preserve&#x27;s animals were saved by owner Peter Lang. At age 76, he single-handedly and successfully fought back the flames for more than 10 hours using garden hoses.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Of that area, is land and , comprising 0.49%, is water.

The city is part of the North Bay region, which includes such cities as Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Windsor, and smaller cities as Sonoma, Healdsburg, Sebastopol. It lies along the US Route 101 corridor, approximately north of San Francisco, via the Golden Gate Bridge.

Santa Rosa lies on the Santa Rosa Plain. The city&#x27;s eastern extremities stretch into the Valley of the Moon, and the Sonoma Creek watershed known as the Sonoma Valley. The city&#x27;s western edge lies in the Laguna de Santa Rosa catchment basin.

The city is in the watershed of Santa Rosa Creek, which rises on Hood Mountain and discharges to the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Tributary basins to Santa Rosa Creek lying significantly in the city are Brush Creek, Matanzas Creek, and Piner Creek. Other water bodies within the city include Fountaingrove Lake, Lake Ralphine, and Santa Rosa Creek Reservoir.

The prominent visual features east of the city include Bennett Peak, Mount Hood, and Sonoma and Taylor mountains.

===Climate===
Santa Rosa has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to very warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is , falling on 74 days annually. The wettest “rain year” was from July 1982 to June 1983 with and the driest from July 1976 to June 1977 with . The most rainfall in one month was in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was on December 19, 1981. Measurable snowfall is extremely rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.

There are an average of 28.9 afternoons with highs of or more and an average of 30.2 mornings with lows reaching the freezing mark. The record high was on September 6, 2022, and the record low was on December 25, 1924.
===Seismicity===
Santa Rosa lies atop the Healdsburg-Rodgers Creek segment of the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault System. The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities estimated a minimum 27 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on this segment by 2037.

On November 21, 2005, the United States Geological Survey released a map detailing the results of a new tool that measures ground shaking during an earthquake. The map determined that the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was most powerful in an area between Santa Rosa and what is now Sebastopol, causing more damage in Santa Rosa (for its size) than any other city affected.

On October 1, 1969, two earthquakes of magnitudes 5.6 and 5.7 shook Santa Rosa, damaging about 100 structures. They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about north of Santa Rosa.

===Nature and wildlife===
Due to its population, much of Santa Rosa&#x27;s remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of Santa Rosa Creek and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. Great blue herons, great egrets, snowy egrets and black-crowned herons nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. Deer often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of wild turkeys are relatively common in some areas; and mountain lions are occasionally observed within city limits. Raccoons and opossums are a common sight throughout the city, while foxes, and rabbits may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. Trione-Annadel State Park also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.

===Neighborhoods===

Santa Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. U.S. Route 101 runs roughly north–south through the city, and divides it into east and west sides. State Route 12 runs roughly east–west, and divides the city into north and south sides.

Neighborhoods, including both current ones and areas formerly known and named, include:

Downtown Santa Rosa, including its outskirts and the area south of the Santa Rosa Mall (Wilson and Morgan Street) and Mendocino Avenue area, South Park/Fairgrounds area, Santa Rosa Avenue, West Steele Lane, and the Joe Rodota Trail/Stony Point districts and neighborhoods have been concentrations of homeless people since the 2000s. Homeless services can be found in the Wilson Street area.

==Economy==
&quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine ranked the Santa Rosa metropolitan area 185th out of 200 on its 2007 list of Best Places For Business And Careers. It was second on the list five years earlier. It was downgraded because of an increase in the cost of doing business, and reduced job growth—both blamed on increases in the cost of housing.

===Top employers===

According to the city&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the city&#x27;s top employers are:
Santa Rosa is also home to notable smaller businesses such as Moonlight Brewing Company, Russian River Brewing Company, and other companies.

===Retail===
As of 2014, Santa Rosa has 12 neighborhood shopping centers and 17 commercial districts, including three sizeable shopping malls: Santa Rosa Plaza, with more than 100 merchants; Coddingtown Mall, with over 40; and Montgomery Village, an open-air mall with more than 70 shops, a supermarket, five banks, and a satellite U.S. Post Office.

==Arts and culture==

===Libraries===
The Sonoma County Library offers a Central Library in downtown Santa Rosa, a Roseland branch on Sebastopol Road, a Northwest branch at Coddingtown Mall, and a Rincon Valley branch in east Santa Rosa. It is a member of the North Bay Cooperative Library System. The Santa Rosa Central Library, the largest branch of the Sonoma County Library system, has a Local History and Genealogy Annex behind it.

The Sonoma County Public Law Library is at the Sonoma County Courthouse.

At Santa Rosa Junior College, the four-story Frank P. Doyle Library houses the Library, Media Services, and Academic Computing Departments, as well as the college art gallery, tutorial center and Center for New Media, a multimedia production facility for SRJC faculty.

===Tourism===
Santa Rosa sits at the northwestern gateway to the Sonoma and Napa Valleys of California&#x27;s famed Wine Country. Many wineries and vineyards are nearby, as well as the Russian River resort area, the Sonoma Coast along the Pacific Ocean, Jack London State Historic Park, and the redwood trees of Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve.

The City Council pays the Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce to operate the Santa Rosa Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. The Chamber&#x27;s visitors center is in the city-owned old railroad depot at the bottom of Fourth Street, in Historic Railroad Square. The SRC&amp;VB has been a California Welcome Center since 2003.

Downtown Santa Rosa, including the central Old Courthouse Square and historic Railroad Square, is an area of shopping, restaurants, nightclubs, and theaters. Downtown also includes City Hall, state and federal office buildings, many banks, and professional offices. The Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital medical center is just to the east of downtown.

Although there are co-op network atms and several credit unions, there is no shared branching for credit unions in Santa Rosa.

The city council funds a private booster group, Santa Rosa Main Street, which lobbies the city to revitalize the traditional business district. Three new mixed-use, high-rise buildings, and a new city parking garage, are under development. (WHEN?) The council and downtown business boosters hope condos atop the new buildings will house a population to keep the area active 24 hours a day.

The nearby cities and towns of Bodega Bay, Calistoga, Guerneville, Healdsburg, Petaluma, Sebastopol, Sonoma, and Windsor are popular with tourists and readily accessible from Santa Rosa.

Railroad Square is the portion of downtown that is on the west side of U.S. Route 101 and has the highest concentration of historic commercial buildings. Of particular note are the four rough-hewn stone buildings at its core, two of which are rare in that they predate the 1906 earthquake. They include the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot, prominently seen in the beginning and the end of the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, and the still-functioning Hotel La Rose, built in 1907 and registered as one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s Historic Hotels of America. The area contains numerous other historic buildings, such as the former Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad depot, and the Lee Bros. Building, both at the corner of 4th and Wilson Streets. Near it in the West End district are numerous other old buildings, including not only many old houses but the masonry DeTurk Winery complex, dating to the 1880s–1890s, and the DeTurk round barn. Also of note nearby is the former Del Monte Cannery Building, built in 1894. One of the oldest surviving commercial buildings in town, it was renovated into the 6th Street Playhouse in 2005.

As a result, Santa Rosa has a number of old neighborhoods in and around downtown, several historically designated. These contain numerous old homes, including many Victorians. Most of these are on quiet, often tree-lined streets. An example of one of these houses would be the McDonald Mansion, near downtown.

The Santa Rosa Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services. Ambulance services are provided by Sonoma County Fire Department working in partnership with Medic Ambulance Service.

The Santa Rosa Fire Department, like many departments across the United States, made its start as a volunteer organization on February 12, 1861. Decades later in 1894 the department made its transition to a paid organization. In 1906 a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake destroyed most of Santa Rosa. The department grew to 100 firefighters in 1983 with the addition of the city of Roseland to the SRFD responsibility area. Many members of the department serve as part of the California Task Force 4, one of the eight FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces throughout the state. The team, which is deployed as part of the nation&#x27;s response to disasters both within and outside of the United States, specializes in dealing with large-scale disasters.

==Notable people==
==Representation in other media==
Director Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist, as there was major reconstruction in the late 20th century following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. But the rough-stone Northwestern Pacific Railroad depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower) still survive. A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present-day Old Courthouse square); the Kress building on Fourth Street is also visible. The courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers&#x27; film &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001) is set in Santa Rosa .

<text>Sonoma () is a city in Sonoma County, California, United States, located in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. Sonoma is one of the principal cities of California&#x27;s Wine Country and the center of the Sonoma Valley AVA. Sonoma&#x27;s population was 10,739 as of the 2020 census, while the Sonoma urban area had a population of 32,679. Sonoma is a popular tourist destination, owing to its Californian wineries, noted events like the Sonoma International Film Festival, and its historic center.

In 1823, Spaniard José Altimira established Mission San Francisco Solano, under the direction of Governor Luis Antonio Argüello. Following the Mexican secularization of the missions, Californio statesman Mariano G. Vallejo founded Sonoma on the former mission&#x27;s lands in 1835. Sonoma served as the base of General Vallejo&#x27;s operations until the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846, when American filibusters overthrew the local Mexican government and declared the California Republic, ushering in the American Conquest of California.

==History==
When the first Spaniards arrived, the area was near the northeast corner of the Native Americans / Aboriginal peoples (Indians) of the Coast Miwok territory, with Southern Pomo to the northwest, Wappo to the northeast, Suisunes and Patwin peoples to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/PSHPA&quot;&gt;S/PSHPA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission era===
Mission San Francisco Solano is the direct predecessor to the founding of the town of Sonoma. The mission, the only to be constructed not by the Spanish but by the later Mexican authorities seeking independence and succeeding to the Royal Spanish Viceroyalty at that time, was built as part of a larger plan Governor Luis Antonio Argüello had devised to fortify the Spanish presence north of the San Francisco Bay and thus deter Russian Empire (Russia) encroachment southward from further north in Russian America (where they&#x27;d established a presence back in the 1740s, a half-century before) into the Pacific Ocean coastal region. Franciscan padre / priest José Altimira worked with Governor Argüello to plan the mission, against the desires of José Francisco de Paula Señan, then the President-General of the Spanish missions in California, who disapproved of secular government intervention into religious matters.

A decade later in 1833 the Congress of the Union (Mexican Congress) passed the Mexican secularization act of 1833, ending Roman Catholic Church mission stewardship and control of huge tracts of associated lands in California, one goal being to diminish the church&#x27;s highly influential standing in California&#x27;s economy and political system. Then Governor José Figueroa appointed Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, then the Commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, as administrator (&quot;comisionado&quot;) to oversee the closing of Mission San Francisco Solano and its conversion into a civilian town.

===General Vallejo era===


Governor Figueroa had received instructions from the Mexican Congress further south in the capital city of Mexico City to establish a strong presence in the region north of the San Francisco Bay to protect the area from encroachments of foreigners. An immediate concern was the further south and eastward movement to the interior of the Russian America Company from their settlements at Fort Ross and Bodega Bay on the Northern California coastline.

Figueroa&#x27;s next step in implementing his instructions was to name Lieutenant Vallejo as Military Commander of the Northern Frontier and to order the Army units of officers / soldiers, arms and materiel supplies at the Presidio of San Francisco moved to the site of the recently secularized Mission San Francisco Solano. The Sonoma Barracks were then built to house the troops. Until the building was habitable, the soldiers were housed in the buildings of the old Mission. In 1834, George C. Yount, the first European American permanent settler in the Napa Valley, north of San Francisco Bay, was employed as a carpenter by Mexican Army General Vallejo.

The Governor granted Lieutenant Vallejo the initial lands (approximately ) of Rancho Petaluma immediately west of Sonoma. Vallejo was also named Director of Colonization which meant that he could initiate land grants for other colonists (subject to the approval of the governor) and the &quot;diputación&quot; (Alta California&#x27;s nominal assembly / legislature).

Vallejo had also been instructed by Governor Figueroa to establish a pueblo at the site of the old Mission. In 1835, with the assistance of William A. Richardson, he laid out a grid, in accordance with the Spanish Laws of the Indies, of the streets, building lots, central plaza and broad main avenue of the newly planned &quot;Pueblo de Sonoma&quot;.

Although Sonoma had been founded as a pueblo in 1835, it still remained under military control, lacking the political structures of civilian municipal self-government of other Alta California pueblos. In 1843, now Lieutenant Colonel Vallejo wrote to the Governor recommending that a civil government be organized for Sonoma. A town council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) was established in 1844 and Jacobo Leese was named first &quot;alcalde&quot;, and Cayetano Juárez second &quot;alcalde&quot;.

===Bear Flag Revolt===


Before dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, thirty-three Americans, already in rebellion against the Alta California provincial government of Mexico, arrived in Sonoma. Some of the group had traveled from the camp of United States Army Brevet Captain John C. Frémont (1813-1890), who had entered California illegally from across the Great Plains and through the Rocky Mountains chain from the east in late 1845 with his exploration and mapping expedition. Others had joined along the way. As the number of immigrants arriving in California had swelled, the Mexican government barred them from buying or renting land and threatened them with expulsion because they had entered without official permission. Mexican officials were concerned about the coming Mexican–American War of 1846-1848, with the United States coupled with the growing influx of American and other European immigrants into California, both by overland wagon trains from the east and by ship on the West Coast and Pacific Ocean.

A group of rebellious Americans had departed from Captain Frémont&#x27;s military camp on June 10 and captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by Californio / Mexican Army soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to Alta California&#x27;s Commandante General José Castro in Santa Clara. The insurgents next determined to seize the weapons, gunpowder and materiel stored in the Sonoma Barracks and to deny Sonoma to the Californios as a rallying point north of the San Francisco Bay.

Meeting no resistance, they approached the home of General Vallejo, who invited the filibusters&#x27; leaders into his home to negotiate terms. However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse and accept it. Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole, they insisted they be held as hostages. William Ide (1796-1852), gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic. Afterwards, Vallejo and his three associates were taken as prisoners and placed on horseback and taken to Captain Frémont.

The Sonoma Barracks became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag. After the flag was raised Californios called the insurgents &quot;Los Osos&quot; (The Bears) because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance. The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising became known as the Bear Flag Revolt. There were some small unit skirmishes between the Bears and the Californios but no major confrontations.

After hearing reports that General José Castro was preparing to attack Sonoma, Frémont left Sutter&#x27;s Fort with his forces for Sonoma. There he called a meeting with &quot;the Bears&quot; and united his forces with the revolters to form a single military unit. Frémont then took the majority of the men back to Sutter&#x27;s Fort and left fifty men to defend Sonoma. The Bear Flag Revolt ended and the California Republic ceased to exist on July 9 when Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere of the U.S. Navy raised the United States flag in front of the Sonoma Barracks.

===Post-Conquest era===
Following the American Conquest of California and the advent of the California Gold Rush, local businesses prospered with the business brought by the soldiers as well as miners traveling to and from the gold fields. The prosperity and optimism about Sonoma&#x27;s future promoted land speculation which was particularly problematic because of the cloudy records regarding land ownership.

Vallejo had granted land by virtue of his office as Director of Colonization before the pueblo was organized. Among the traditional duties of Alta California&#x27;s &quot;alcaldes&quot; was the selling of town lots. Political factions backed different Sonoma &quot;alcaldes&quot; (John H. Nash, supported by American immigrants, and Lilburn Boggs (1796-1860), supported by Vallejo and the Californios) made the situation more complex. Some property was sold more than once. A valid land sale depended on proof of the seller&#x27;s chain of title. Over thirty subsequent years of lawsuits and land disputes were required before land owners in Sonoma were able to obtain clear titles.

When the California interim government and U.S. military occupation beginning 1846, finally ended after four years in 1850, when California was admitted as the 31st state to the federal Union by act of the U.S. Congress]], approved by the President, on September 9, 1850, Sonoma was then named the first county seat town for Sonoma County. About that time the flow of miners had slowed and the U.S. Army was soon leaving Sonoma. Business in Sonoma moved into an economic recession in 1851. Surrounding towns such as Petaluma and Santa Rosa were developing and gaining population much faster than Sonoma. An 1854 special election then moved the county seat and courthouse and its legal work and entailed economic activity to Santa Rosa.

===Contemporary era===
The Sonoma City Hall, located in the center of the Sonoma Plaza, was dedicated on September 9, 1908.

The United States Navy operated a rest center at the Mission Inn through World War II.

Parts of Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; (1996) were filmed in the city, with shots of the Sonoma Community Center masked as Westboro High School.

The center of town, known as the Plaza, is home to a particularly vibrant Farmers Market on Tuesdays during season.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the Sonoma Valley, with the Mayacamas Mountains to the east and the Sonoma Mountains to the west, with the prominent landform Sears Point to the southwest. Sonoma has an area of .

The principal watercourse in the town is Sonoma Creek, which flows in a southerly direction to discharge ultimately to the Napa Sonoma Marsh; Arroyo Seco Creek is a tributary to Schell Creek with a confluence in the eastern portion of the town.
The active Rodgers Fault lies to the west of Sonoma Creek; however, the risk of major damage is mitigated by the fact that most of the soils beneath the city consist of a slight alluvial terrace underlain by strongly cemented sedimentary and volcanic rock. To the immediate south, west and east are deeper rich, alluvial soils that support valuable agricultural cultivation. The mountain block to the north rises to and provides an important scenic backdrop.

===Climate===
Sonoma has a typical lowland near-coastal Californian warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;) with hot, dry summers (although nights are comfortably cool) and cool, wet winters. In January, the normal high is and the typical low is . In July, the normal high is and the normal low is . There are an average of 58.1 days with highs of or higher and 12.1 days with highs of . The highest temperature on record was on July 13, 1972, and the lowest temperature was on December 22, 1990. Normal annual precipitation is . The wettest month on record was in January 1995. The greatest 24-hour rainfall was on January 4, 1982. There are an average of 68.6 days with measurable precipitation. Snow has rarely fallen, but fell in January 1907; more recently, snow flurries were observed on February 5, 1976, and in the winter of 2001.

==Demographics==
===2010===

<text>Windsor is an incorporated town in Sonoma County, California, United States. The town is 9 miles north of Santa Rosa and 63 miles north of San Francisco. The population was 26,344 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
===Founding===
The site now occupied by the town of Windsor was originally inhabited by the Southern Pomo. It was known as Tsoliikawai (&quot;ćol:ik:o=wi&quot;), meaning &quot;blackbird field&quot;, a name also applied to the village, tribe or tribelet at the site. This group was probably part of the Kaitactemi tribe that ruled from the Healdsburg area down to Mark West Creek.

Windsor&#x27;s first European settlers arrived in 1851. In 1855, a post office was established in Windsor and Hiram Lewis, a Pony Express rider, became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. He named the town Windsor because it reminded him of the grounds around Windsor Castle, a medieval castle from his home country of England. The following year, a business enterprise was built in eastern Windsor, which included a goods store, a shoe shop, a grocery and meat market, a saloon, a hotel, a boarding house, and two confectionery shops. The Northwestern Pacific Railroad was completed through the town in 1872, providing a faster and cheaper link to the Bay Area.

On May 21, 1905, a fire destroyed the center of Windsor. Fanned by heavy winds, the fire destroyed several businesses, including a hotel and a barber shop. An estimated $30,000 worth of property was damaged.

The Great San Francisco Earthquake caused major damage to numerous buildings in Windsor, many of which were still in the process of repair and reconstruction from 1905 fire.

In 1915, the Old Redwood Highway through Windsor was paved. Up until then, all roads in the area had been dirt.

During World War II, a United States Army Air Forces training air base (currently the Charles M. Schulz – Sonoma County Airport) was built in southern Windsor, and it was common to hear fighter aircraft and bombers flying over the town.

In 1943, a camp for German prisoners of war was built west of downtown Windsor, on the site of a former migrant labor camp. The camp was a branch camp of the much larger Camp Beale POW camp. Those assigned to the camp worked (for $0.80 per day) at farms in the county, picking apples, prunes, hops, and other crops, packing apples, and doing similar work.

=== Incorporation and modern history ===
On July 1, 1992, Windsor was incorporated as a town. Prior to that, it had been part of unincorporated Sonoma County. Windsor&#x27;s economic growth and population boomed in the 1980s, when many housing developments were built. Prior to that, Windsor&#x27;s economy was predominately based on agricultural work, mainly involving wine grapes.

In 1996, Windsor adopted its current General Plan. Since that time the Town has grown and changed. When the last General Plan was adopted, the internet was not widely used and the youngest members of today&#x27;s workforce had not been born yet.

Del Rio has been subject to a number of planning activities, beginning with the 1992 analysis by Stanislaus County regarding the projected growth impacts of this area. This plan, an integral part of the county General Plan, emphasized a continuation of the low density development of the Del Rio area, with balanced uses based upon the historic residential, agricultural and open space precedent land uses. The plan included prioritization of high quality residential development and the undergrounding of all utility infrastructure.

In regard to environmental factors the 1992 plan called for extensive protection of riparian zones along the Stanislaus River. The plan also analyzed air quality impacts of future land development and transportation change; these studies were carried out in a companion document prepared by Earthmetrics, and these analyses were used to size the future roadway system and intersection controls.

<doc id="108257" wikidata="Q18180" url="?curid=108257" title="Korean Air Lines Flight 007">
<text>Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KE007/KAL007) was a scheduled Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the flight was shot down by a Soviet Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor aircraft. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but owing to a navigational mistake made by the crew, the airliner drifted from its planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace over underground silos with intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Soviet Air Forces treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and destroyed it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots. The South Korean airliner eventually crashed into the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan, killing all 246 passengers and 23 crew aboard, including Larry McDonald, a United States representative. It is the worst Korean Airlines disaster to date. The Soviet Union found the wreckage under the sea two weeks later on September 15 and found the flight recorders in October, but this information was kept secret by the Soviet authorities until 1992, after the country&#x27;s dissolution.

The Soviet Union initially denied knowledge of the incident, but later admitted to shooting down the aircraft, claiming that it was on a MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union&#x27;s military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The U.S. accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released ten years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

As a result of the incident, the United States altered tracking procedures for aircraft departing from Alaska, and President Ronald Reagan issued a directive making American satellite-based radio navigation Global Positioning System freely available for civilian use, once it was sufficiently developed, as a common good.

==Details of the flight==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft flying as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was a Boeing 747-230B jet airliner with Boeing serial number 20559. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A engines.

===Passengers and crew===
The aircraft flying as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 departed from Gate 15 of John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, on August 31, 1983, at 00:25 EDT (04:25 UTC), bound for Kimpo International Airport in Gangseo District, Seoul, 35 minutes behind its scheduled departure time of 23:50 EDT, August 30 (03:50 UTC, August 31). The flight was carrying 246 passengers and 23 crew members. After refuelling at Anchorage International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska, the aircraft departed for Seoul at 04:00 AHDT (13:00 UTC) on August 31, 1983. This leg of the journey was piloted by Captain Chun Byung-in (45), First Officer Son Dong-hui (47), and Flight Engineer Kim Eui-dong (31). Captain Chun had a total of 10,627 flight hours, including 6,618 hours in the 747. First Officer Son had a total of 8,917 flight hours, including 3,411 hours in the 747. Flight Engineer Kim had a total of 4,012 flight hours, including 2,614 hours on the 747.

The aircrew had an unusually high ratio of crew to passengers, as six deadheading crew were on board. Twelve passengers occupied the upper deck, first class, while in business class almost all of the 24 seats were taken; in economy class, approximately 80 seats were empty. There were 22 children under the age of 12 years aboard. 130 passengers planned to connect to other destinations such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Taipei.

United States Congressman Larry McDonald from Georgia, who at the time was also the second president of the conservative John Birch Society, was on the flight. The Soviets contended former U.S. president Richard Nixon was to have been seated next to Larry McDonald on KAL 007 but that the CIA warned him not to go, according to the &quot;New York Post&quot; and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS); this was denied by Nixon.

===Flight deviation from assigned route===
Less than a half-minute after taking off from Anchorage, KAL 007 was directed by air traffic control (ATC) to turn to a magnetic heading of 220°. This sharp turn, 100° to the left, was only to transition the plane from its initial heading at take-off (320° magnetic, in line with the runway it used), to bring it closer to a route known as J501, which KAL 007 was to take to Bethel. Approximately 90 seconds later, ATC directed the flight to &quot;proceed direct Bethel when able.&quot; In response, the plane immediately began a slight turn to the right, to align it with route J501, and less than a minute later (3 minutes after take-off) was on a magnetic heading of approximately 245°, roughly toward Bethel.

Upon KAL 007’s arrival over Bethel, its flight plan called for it to take the northernmost of five airways, known as the NOPAC (North Pacific) routes, that bridge the Alaskan and Japanese coasts. That particular airway, R20 (&quot;Romeo Two Zero&quot;), passed as close as from what was then Soviet airspace off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The lateral navigation half of the autopilot system of the 747-200 has four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, which led to a specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.

When the INS navigation systems were properly programmed with the filed flight plan waypoints, the pilot could turn the autopilot mode selector switch to the INS position and the plane would then automatically track the programmed INS course line, provided the plane was headed in the proper direction and within of that course line. If, however, the plane was more than from the flight-planned course line when the pilot turned the autopilot mode selector from HEADING to INS, the plane would continue to track the heading selected in HEADING mode as long as the actual position of the plane was more than from the programmed INS course line. The autopilot computer software commanded the INS mode to remain in the &quot;armed&quot; condition until the plane had moved to a position less than from the desired course line. Once that happened, the INS mode would change from &quot;armed&quot; to &quot;capture&quot; and the plane would track the flight-planned course from then on.

The HEADING mode of the autopilot would normally be engaged sometime after takeoff to follow vectors from ATC, and then after receiving appropriate ATC clearance, to guide the plane to intercept the desired INS course line.

The Anchorage VOR beacon was not operational at the time, as it was undergoing maintenance. The crew received a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) of this fact, which was not seen as a problem, as the captain could still check his position at the next VORTAC beacon at Bethel, away. The aircraft was required to maintain the assigned heading of 220 degrees until it could receive the signals from Bethel, then it could fly direct to Bethel, as instructed by ATC, by centering the VOR &quot;to&quot; course deviation indicator (CDI) and then engaging the autopilot in the VOR/LOC mode. Then, when over the Bethel beacon, the flight could start using INS mode to follow the waypoints that make up route &quot;Romeo-20&quot; around the coast of the U.S.S.R. to Seoul. The INS mode was necessary for this route since after Bethel the plane would be mostly out of range from VOR stations.
At about 10 minutes after take-off, flying on a heading of 245 degrees, KAL 007 began to deviate to the right (north) of its assigned route to Bethel and continued to fly on this constant heading for the next five and a half hours.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) simulation and analysis of the flight data recorder determined that this deviation was probably caused by the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot system operating in HEADING mode, after the point that it should have been switched to the INS mode. According to the ICAO, the autopilot was not operating in the INS mode either because the crew did not switch the autopilot to the INS mode (as they should have shortly after Cairn Mountain), or they did select the INS mode, but the computer did not transition from &quot;armed&quot; to &quot;capture&quot; condition because the aircraft had already deviated off track by more than the tolerance permitted by the inertial navigation computer. Whatever the reason, the autopilot remained in HEADING mode, and the problem was not detected by the crew.

At 27 minutes after KAL 007&#x27;s take-off, civilian radar at Kenai, located about southwest of Anchorage and with coverage of up to , showed it passing near Cairn Mountain, about west of Anchorage. It also showed that the aircraft by then was already off course—about north of its expected route to Bethel.

Later, at 13:49 UTC (49 minutes after take-off), KAL 007 reported that it had reached its Bethel waypoint, about west of Anchorage. But traces from military radar at King Salmon, Alaska, showed that the aircraft then was actually about north of that location—and heading farther off course. There is no evidence to indicate that anyone with access to King Salmon radar output that night—civil air traffic controllers or military radar personnel—was aware in real-time of KAL 007&#x27;s deviation and in a position to warn the aircraft. But had the aircraft been steered under INS control, as was intended, such an error would have been far greater than the INS&#x27;s nominal navigational accuracy of less than per hour of flight.

KAL 007&#x27;s divergence prevented the aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter-range very-high-frequency radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL 015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL 007 requested KAL 015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43 UTC, KAL 007 directly transmitted a change of estimated time of arrival for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions can typically be heard at a greater distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference and is preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications via VHF did not alert the pilots of KAL 007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL 007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of &quot;Romeo 20&quot; and off-limits to civilian aircraft.

Sometime after leaving American territorial waters, KAL Flight 007 crossed the International Date Line, where the local date shifted from August 31, 1983, to September 1, 1983.

KAL 007 continued its journey, ever-increasing its deviation— off course at waypoint NABIE, off course at waypoint NUKKS, and off course at waypoint NEEVA—until it reached the Kamchatka Peninsula.

===Shoot-down===

In 1983, Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union had escalated to a level not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis because of several factors. These included the United States&#x27; Strategic Defense Initiative, its planned deployment of the Pershing II weapon system in Europe in March and April, and FleetEx &#x27;83-1, the largest naval exercise held to date in the North Pacific. The military hierarchy of the Soviet Union (particularly the old guard led by Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov and Minister of Defence Dmitry Ustinov) viewed these actions as bellicose and destabilizing; they were deeply suspicious of U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s intentions and openly fearful he was planning a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. These fears culminated in RYAN, the code name for a secret intelligence-gathering program initiated by Andropov to detect a potential nuclear sneak attack which he believed Reagan was plotting.

Aircraft from and repeatedly overflew Soviet military installations in the Kuril Islands during FleetEx &#x27;83 naval exercise (29 March to 17 April 1983), resulting in the dismissal or reprimanding of Soviet military officials who had been unable to shoot them down. On the Soviet side, RYAN was expanded. Lastly, there was a heightened alert around the Kamchatka Peninsula at the time that KAL 007 was in the vicinity, because of a Soviet missile test at the Kura Missile Test Range that was scheduled for the same day. A United States Air Force Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft flying in the area was monitoring the missile test off the peninsula.

At 15:51 UTC, according to Soviet sources, KAL 007 entered the restricted airspace of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The buffer zone extended from Kamchatka&#x27;s coast and is known as a flight information region (FIR). The radius of the buffer zone nearest to Soviet territory had the additional designation of prohibited airspace. When KAL 007 was about from the Kamchatka coast, four MiG-23 fighters were scrambled to intercept the Boeing 747.

Significant command and control problems were experienced trying to vector the fast military jets onto the 747 before they ran out of fuel. In addition, the pursuit was made more difficult, according to Soviet Air Force Captain Aleksandr Zuyev, who defected to the West in 1989, because, ten days before, Arctic gales had knocked out the key warning radar on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Furthermore, he stated that local officials responsible for repairing the radar lied to Moscow, falsely reporting that they had successfully fixed the radar. Had this radar been operational, it would have enabled an intercept of the stray airliner roughly two hours earlier with plenty of time for proper identification as a civilian aircraft. Instead, the unidentified jetliner crossed over the Kamchatka Peninsula back into international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk without being intercepted. In his explanation to &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Zuyev stated: &quot;Some people lied to Moscow, trying to save their ass.&quot;

The Commander of the Soviet Far East District Air Defense Forces, General Valeri Kamensky, was adamant that KAL 007 was to be destroyed even over neutral waters but only after positive identification showed it not to be a passenger plane. His subordinate, General Anatoly Kornukov, commander of Sokol Air Base and later to become commander of the Russian Air Force, insisted that there was no need to make positive identification as the intruder aircraft had already flown over the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Units of the Soviet Air Defence Forces that had been tracking the South Korean aircraft for more than an hour while it entered and left Soviet airspace now classified the aircraft as a military target when it re-entered their airspace over Sakhalin. After a protracted ground-controlled interception, the three Su-15 fighters (from nearby Dolinsk-Sokol airbase) and the MiG-23 (from Smirnykh Air Base) managed to make visual contact with the Boeing, but, owing to the black of night, failed to make critical identification of the aircraft which Russian communications reveal. The pilot of the lead Su-15 fighter fired warning shots with its cannon, but recalled later in 1991, &quot;I fired four bursts, more than 200 rounds. For all the good it did. After all, I was loaded with armor-piercing shells, not incendiary shells. It&#x27;s doubtful whether anyone could see them.&quot;

At this point, KAL 007 contacted Tokyo Area Control Center, requesting clearance to ascend to a higher flight level for reasons of fuel economy; the request was granted, so the Boeing started to climb, gradually slowing as it exchanged speed for altitude. The decrease in speed caused the pursuing fighter to overshoot the Boeing and was interpreted by the Soviet pilot as an evasive maneuver. The order to shoot KAL 007 down was given as it was about to leave Soviet airspace for the second time. At around 18:26 UTC, under pressure from General Kornukov and ground controllers not to let the aircraft escape into international airspace, the lead fighter was able to move back into a position where it could fire two K-8 (NATO reporting name: AA-3 &quot;Anab&quot;) air-to-air missiles at the plane.

====Soviet pilot&#x27;s recollection of shoot-down====
In a 1991 interview with &quot;Izvestia&quot;, Major Gennadiy Osipovich, pilot of the Su-15 interceptor that shot the aircraft down, spoke about his recollections of the events leading up to the shoot-down. Contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, he recalled telling ground controllers that there were &quot;blinking lights&quot;. He continued, saying of the 747-230B, &quot;I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. I knew this was a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use.&quot; Osipovich stated, &quot;I did not tell the ground that it was a Boeing-type plane; they did not ask me.&quot;
Commenting on the moment that KAL 007 slowed as it ascended from flight level 330 to flight level 350, and then on his maneuvering for a missile launch, Osipovich said:

Osipovich died on September 23, 2015, after a protracted illness.

====Soviet command hierarchy of shoot-down====
The Soviet real-time military communication transcripts of the shoot-down suggest the chain of command from the top general to Major Osipovich, the Su-15 interceptor pilot who shot down KAL 007. In reverse order, they are:

* Major Gennadiy Nikolayevich Osipovich,
* Captain Titovnin, Combat Control Center – Fighter Division
* Lt. Colonel Maistrenko, Smirnykh Air Base Fighter Division Acting Chief of Staff, confirmed the shoot-down order to Titovnin.
* Lt. Colonel Gerasimenko, Acting Commander, 41st Fighter Regiment.
* General Anatoly Kornukov, Commander of Sokol Air Base – Sakhalin.
* General Valery Kamensky, Commander of Far East Military District Air Defense Forces.
* Army General Ivan Moiseevich Tretyak, Commander of the Far East Military District.

====Post-attack flight====
At the time of the attack, the plane had been cruising at an altitude of about . Tapes recovered from the airliner&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder indicate that the crew was unaware that they were off course and violating Soviet airspace. Immediately after missile detonation, the airliner began a 113-second arc upward because of a damaged crossover cable between the left inboard and right outboard elevators.

At 18:26:46 UTC (03:26 Japan Time; 06:26 Sakhalin time), at the apex of the arc at altitude , the autopilot disengaged (this was either done by the pilots, or it disengaged automatically). Now being controlled manually, the plane began to descend to . From 18:27:01 until 18:27:09, the flight crew reported to the Tokyo Area Control Center informing that KAL 007 would &quot;descend to 10,000&quot; [feet; 3,000m]. At 18:27:20, ICAO graphing of Digital Flight Data Recorder tapes showed that after a descent phase and a 10-second &quot;nose-up&quot;, KAL 007 was leveled out at pre-missile detonation altitude of , forward acceleration was back to pre-missile detonation rate of zero acceleration, and airspeed had returned to pre-detonation velocity.

Yaw oscillations, beginning at the time of missile detonation, continued decreasingly until the end of the 1-minute 44-second section of the tape. The Boeing did not break up, explode, or plummet immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then leveled off at (18:30–18:31 UTC), rather than continuing to descend to as previously reported to Tokyo Area Control Center. It continued at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35 UTC).

The last cockpit voice recorder entry occurred at 18:27:46 while in this phase of the descent. At 18:28 UTC, the aircraft was reported turning to the north. ICAO analysis concluded that the flight crew &quot;retained limited control&quot; of the aircraft. However, this lasted for only five minutes. The crew then lost all control. The aircraft began to descend rapidly in spirals over Moneron Island for . The aircraft then broke apart in mid-air and crashed into the ocean, just off the west coast of Sakhalin Island. All 269 people on board were killed. The aircraft was last seen visually by Osipovich, &quot;somehow descending slowly&quot; over Moneron Island. The aircraft disappeared off long-range military radar at Wakkanai, Japan, at a height of .

KAL 007 was probably attacked in international airspace, with a 1993 Russian report listing the location of the missile firing outside its territory at , although the intercepting pilot stated otherwise in a subsequent interview. Initial reports that the airliner had been forced to land on Sakhalin were soon proven false. One of these reports conveyed via phone by Orville Brockman, the Washington office spokesman of the Federal Aviation Administration, to the press secretary of Larry McDonald, was that the FAA in Tokyo had been informed by the Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau that &quot;Japanese self-defense force radar confirms that the Hokkaido radar followed Air Korea to a landing in Soviet territory on the island of Sakhalinska and it is confirmed by the manifest that Congressman McDonald is on board&quot;.

A Japanese fisherman aboard &quot;58th Chidori Maru&quot; later reported to the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (this report was cited by ICAO analysis) that he had heard a plane at low altitude, but had not seen it. Then he heard &quot;a loud sound followed by a bright flash of light on the horizon, then another dull sound and a less intense flash of light on the horizon&quot; and smelled aviation fuel.

====Soviet command response to post-detonation flight====
Though the interceptor pilot reported to ground control, &quot;Target destroyed&quot;, the Soviet command, from the general on down, indicated surprise and consternation at KAL 007&#x27;s continued flight, and ability to regain its altitude and maneuver. This consternation continued through to KAL 007&#x27;s subsequent level flight at altitude , and then, after almost five minutes, through its spiral descent over Moneron Island. (See from 18:26 UTC onwards: &quot;Lt. Col. Novoseletski: Well, what is happening? What is the matter? Who guided him in?  He locked on; why didn&#x27;t he shoot it down?&quot;)

====Missile damage to plane====
The following damage to the aircraft was determined by the ICAO from its analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder:

=====Hydraulics=====
KAL 007 had four redundant hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There was no evidence of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation of all primary and secondary flight controls (except leading edge slats in the latter) as well as landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward after missile detonation (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring the plane down to its former altitude of . This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane&#x27;s elevators, was damaged or out. KAL 007&#x27;s airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb. At twenty seconds after the missile detonation, a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the &quot;automatic pilot disconnect warning&quot; sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds. This failure of the manual system to engage upon command indicates failure in hydraulic systems one and two. With wing flaps up, &quot;control was reduced to the right inboard aileron and the innermost of spoiler section of each side&quot;.

=====Left wing=====
Contrary to Major Osipovich&#x27;s statement in 1991 that he had taken off half of KAL 007&#x27;s left wing, ICAO analysis found that the wing was intact: &quot;The interceptor pilot stated that the first missile hit near the tail, while the second missile took off half the left wing of the aircraft... The interceptor&#x27;s pilot&#x27;s statement that the second missile took off half of the left wing was probably incorrect. The missiles were fired at a two-second interval and would have detonated at an equal interval. The first detonated at 18:26:02 UTC. The last radio transmissions from KE007 to Tokyo Radio were between 18:26:57 and 18:27:15 UTC using HF [high frequency]. The HF 1 radio aerial of the aircraft was positioned in the left wing tip suggesting that the left wing tip was intact at this time. Also, the aircraft&#x27;s maneuvers after the attack did not indicate extensive damage to the left wing.&quot;

=====Engines=====
The co-pilot reported to Captain Chun twice during the flight after the missiles&#x27; detonation, &quot;Engines normal, sir.&quot;

=====Tail section=====
The first missile was radar-controlled and proximity fuzed, and detonated behind the aircraft. Sending fragments forward, it either severed or unraveled the crossover cable from the left inboard elevator to the right elevator. This, with damage to one of the four hydraulic systems, caused KAL 007 to ascend from , at which point the autopilot was disengaged.

=====Fuselage=====
Fragments from the proximity fuzed air-to-air missile that detonated behind the aircraft, punctured the fuselage and caused rapid decompression of the pressurised cabin. The interval of 11 seconds between the sound of missile detonation picked up by the cockpit voice recorder and the sound of the alarm sounding in the cockpit enabled ICAO analysts to determine that the size of the ruptures to the pressurised fuselage was .

==Search and rescue==
As a result of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue operations of the Soviet Union were not coordinated with those of the United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently, no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels if they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.

===Soviet search and rescue mission to Moneron Island===
The Soviets did not acknowledge shooting down the aircraft until September 6, five days after the flight was shot down. Eight days after the shoot-down, Marshal of the Soviet Union and Chief of General Staff Nikolai Ogarkov denied knowledge of where KAL 007 had gone down; &quot;We could not give the precise answer about the spot where it [KAL 007] fell because we ourselves did not know the spot in the first place.&quot;

Nine years later, the Russian Federation handed over transcripts of Soviet military communications that showed that at least two documented search and rescue (SAR) missions were ordered within a half-hour of the attack, to the last Soviet-verified location of the descending jumbo jet over Moneron Island. The first search was ordered from Smirnykh Air Base in central Sakhalin at 18:47 UTC, nine minutes after KAL 007 had disappeared from Soviet radar screens and brought rescue helicopters from Khomutovo Air Base (the military unit at Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport in southern Sakhalin), and Soviet Border Troops boats to the area.

The second search was ordered eight minutes later by the Deputy Commander of the Far Eastern Military District, General Strogov, and involved civilian trawlers that were in the area around Moneron. &quot;The border guards. What ships do we now have near Moneron Island? If they are civilians, send [them] there immediately.&quot; Moneron is just long and wide, located due west of Sakhalin Island at ; it is the only land mass in the whole Tatar Straits.

===Search for KAL 007 in international waters===

Immediately after the shoot-down, South Korea, the owner of the aircraft and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States would now be legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of any part of the plane.

On the same day as the shoot-down, Rear Admiral William A. Cockell, Commander, Task Force 71, and a skeleton staff, taken by helicopter from Japan, embarked in (stationed off Vladivostok at time of the flight) on September 9 for further transfer to the destroyer to assume duties as Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) of the Search and Rescue (SAR) effort. A surface search began immediately and on into September 13. U.S. underwater operations began on September 14. On September 10, 1983, with no further hope of finding survivors, Task Force 71&#x27;s mission was reclassified from a &quot;Search and Rescue&quot; (SAR) operation to a &quot;Search and Salvage&quot; (SAS).
On October 17, Rear Admiral Walter T. Piotti, Jr. took command of the task force and its search and salvage mission from Rear Admiral Cockell. First to be searched was a &quot;high probability&quot; area. This was unsuccessful. On October 21, Task Force 71 extended its search within coordinates encompassing, in an arc around the Soviet territorial boundaries north of Moneron Island, an area of , reaching to the west of Sakhalin Island. This was the &quot;large probability&quot; area. The search areas were outside the Soviet-claimed territorial boundaries. The northwesternmost point of the search touched the Soviet territorial boundary closest to the naval port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin. Nevelsk was from Moneron. This larger search was also unsuccessful.

The vessels used in the search, for the Soviet side as well as the US side (US, South Korea, Japan) were both civilian trawlers, specially equipped for both the SAR and SAS operations, and various types of warships and support ships. The Soviet side also employed both civilian and military divers. The Soviet search, beginning on the day of the shoot-down and continuing until November 6, was confined to the &quot;high probability&quot; area in international waters, and within Soviet territorial waters to the north of Moneron Island. The area within Soviet territorial waters was off-limits to the U.S., South Korean, and Japanese boats. From September 3 to 29, four ships from South Korea joined in the search.

Piotti Jr, commander of Task Force 71 of the 7th Fleet would summarize the US and Allied, and then the Soviets&#x27;, Search and Salvage operations:


These missions met with interference by the Soviets, in violation of the 1972 Incidents at Sea agreement, and included false flag and fake light signals, sending an armed boarding party to threaten to board a U.S.-chartered Japanese auxiliary vessel (blocked by U.S. warship interposition), interfering with a helicopter coming off the USS &quot;Elliot&quot; (Sept. 7), attempted ramming of rigs used by the South Koreans in their quadrant search, hazardous maneuvering of &quot;Gavril Sarychev&quot; and near-collision with the (September 15, 18), removing U.S. sonars, setting false pingers in deep international waters, sending Backfire bombers armed with air-to-surface nuclear-armed missiles to threaten U.S. naval units, criss-crossing in front of U.S. combatant vessels (October 26), cutting and attempted cutting of moorings of Japanese auxiliary vessels, particularly &quot;Kaiko Maru III&quot;, and radar lock-ons by a Soviet , &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, and a , &quot;Odarennyy&quot;, targeting U.S. naval ships and the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter USCGC &quot;Douglas Munro&quot; (WHEC-724), , escorting , experienced all of the above interference and was involved in a near-collision with &quot;Odarennyy&quot; (September 23–27).

According to the ICAO: &quot;The location of the main wreckage was not determined... the approximate position was , which was in international waters.&quot; This point is about from Moneron Island, about from the shore of Sakhalin and from the point of attack.

Piotti Jr, commander of Task Force 71 of 7th Fleet, believed the search for KAL 007 in international waters to have been a search in the wrong place and assessed:

Had TF [task force] 71 been permitted to search without restriction imposed by claimed territorial waters, the aircraft stood a good chance of having been found. No wreckage of KAL 007 was found. However, the operation established, with a 95% or above confidence level, that the wreckage, or any significant portion of the aircraft, does not lie within the probability area outside the 12 nautical mile area claimed by the Soviets as their territorial limit.
At a hearing of the ICAO on September 15, 1983, J. Lynn Helms, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, stated: &quot;The USSR has refused to permit search and rescue units from other countries to enter Soviet territorial waters to search for the remains of KAL 007. Moreover, the Soviet Union has blocked access to the likely crash site and has refused to cooperate with other interested parties, to ensure prompt recovery of all technical equipment, wreckage, and other material.&quot;

==Human remains and artifacts==
===Surface finds===
No body parts were recovered by the Soviet search team from the surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation at Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat &quot;Tsugaru&quot;, had met a six-man Soviet delegation at the port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired footwear. With footwear that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items were all that they had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.

Family members of KAL 007 passengers later stated that these shoes were worn by their loved ones for the flight. Sonia Munder had no difficulty recognizing the sneakers of her children, one from Christian, age 14, and one from Lisi, age 17, by the intricate way her children laced them. Another mother says, &quot;I recognized them just like that. You see, there are all kinds of inconspicuous marks that strangers do not notice. This is how I recognized them. My daughter loved to wear them.&quot;

Another mother, Nan Oldham, identified her son John&#x27;s sneakers from a photo in &quot;Life&quot; magazine of 55 of the 213 shoes—apparently a random array on display those first days at Chitose Air Force Base in Japan. &quot;We saw photos of his shoes in a magazine,&quot; says Oldham, &quot;We followed up through KAL and a few weeks later, a package arrived. His shoes were inside: size 11 sneakers with cream white paint.&quot; John Oldham had taken his seat in row 31 of KAL 007 wearing those cream white paint-spattered sneakers.

Nothing was found by the joint U.S.–Japanese–South Korean search and rescue/salvage operations in international waters at the designated crash site or within the search area.

===Hokkaido finds===
Eight days after the shoot-down, human remains and other types of objects appeared on the north shore of Hokkaido, Japan. Hokkaido is about below the southern tip of Sakhalin across the La Pérouse Strait (the southern tip of Sakhalin is from Moneron Island which is west of Sakhalin). The ICAO concluded that these bodies, body parts, and objects were carried from Soviet waters to the shores of Hokkaido by the southerly current west of Sakhalin Island. All currents of the Strait of Tartary relevant to Moneron Island flow to the north, except this southerly current between Moneron Island and Sakhalin Island.

These human remains, including body parts, tissues, and two partial torsos, totaled 13. All were unidentifiable, but one partial torso was that of a Caucasian woman as indicated by auburn hair on a partial skull, and one partial body was of an Asian child (with glass embedded). There was no luggage recovered. Of the non-human remains that the Japanese recovered were various items including dentures, newspapers, seats, books, eight KAL paper cups, shoes, sandals, sneakers, a camera case, a &quot;please fasten seat belt&quot; sign, an oxygen mask, a handbag, a bottle of dishwashing fluid, several blouses, an identity card belonging to 25-year-old passenger Mary Jane Hendrie of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, and the business cards of passengers Kathy Brown-Spier and Mason Chang. These items generally came from the passenger cabin of the aircraft. None of the items found generally came from the cargo hold of the plane, such as suitcases, packing boxes, industrial machinery, instruments, and sports equipment.

In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; published a series of interviews with Soviet military personnel who had been involved in salvage operations to find and recover parts of the aircraft. After three days of searching using trawlers, side-scan sonar, and diving bells, Soviet searchers located the aircraft wreckage at a depth of near Moneron Island. Since no human remains or luggage were found on the surface in the impact area, the divers expected to find the remains of passengers who had been trapped in the submerged wreckage of the aircraft on the seabed. When they visited the site two weeks after the shoot-down, they found that the wreckage was in small pieces, and found no bodies:

I had the idea that it would be intact. Well, perhaps a little banged up... The divers would go inside the aircraft and see everything there was to see. It was completely demolished, scattered about like kindling. The largest things we saw were the especially strong braces—they were about one and a half or two meters long and 50–60 centimeters wide. As for the rest—broken into tiny pieces...

According to &quot;Izvestia&quot;, the divers had only ten encounters with passenger remains (tissues and body parts) in the debris area, including one partial torso.

&quot;Tinro ll&quot; submersible Captain Mikhail Igorevich Girs&#x27; diary: Submergence 10 October. Aircraft pieces, wing spars, pieces of aircraft skin, wiring, and clothing. But—no people. The impression is that all of this has been dragged here by a trawl rather than falling down from the sky...

Vyacheslav Popov: &quot;I will confess that we felt great relief when we found out that there were no bodies at the bottom. Not only were no bodies; there were also no suitcases or large bags. I did not miss a single dive. I have quite a clear impression: The aircraft was filled with garbage, but there were really no people there. Why? Usually when an aircraft crashes, even a small one... As a rule, there are suitcases and bags, or at least the handles of the suitcases.&quot;
Some civilian divers, whose first dive was on September 15, two weeks after the shoot-down, state that Soviet military divers and trawls had been at work before them:

Diver Vyacheslav Popov: &quot;As we learned then, before us the trawlers had done some &#x27;work&#x27; in the designated quadrant. It is hard to understand what sense the military saw in the trawling operation. First, drag everything haphazardly around the bottom by the trawls, and then send in the submersibles?...It is clear that things should have been done in the reverse order.&quot;

ICAO also interviewed a number of these divers for its 1993 report: &quot;In addition to the scraps of metal, they observed personal items, such as clothing, documents, and wallets. Although some evidence of human remains was noticed by the divers, they found no bodies.&quot;

==Political events==
===Initial Soviet denial===
General Secretary Yuri Andropov, on the advice of Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, but against the advice of the Foreign Ministry, initially decided not to make any admission of downing the airliner, on the premise that no one would find out or be able to prove otherwise. Consequently the TASS news agency reported twelve hours after the shoot-down only that an unidentified aircraft, flying without lights, had been intercepted by Soviet fighters after it violated Soviet airspace over Sakhalin. The aircraft had allegedly failed to respond to warnings and &quot;continued its flight toward the Sea of Japan&quot;. Some commentators believe that the inept manner in which the political events were handled by the Soviet government was affected by the failing health of Andropov, who was permanently hospitalised in late September or early October 1983 (Andropov died the following February).

In a 2015 interview Igor Kirillov, the senior Soviet news anchor said that he was initially given a printed TASS report to announce over the news on September 1, which included an &quot;open and honest&quot; admission that the plane was shot down by mistake (a wrong judgment call by the Far Eastern Air Defence Command). However, at the moment the opening credits of the &quot;Vremya&quot; evening news programme rolled in, an editor ran in and snatched the sheet of paper from his hand, handing him another TASS report which was &quot;completely opposite&quot; to the first one and to the truth.

===U.S. reaction and further developments===
The shoot-down happened at a very tense time in the U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing a substantial amount of hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union.

Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government announced that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets and that all passengers and crew were safe. U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz held a press conference about the incident at 10:45 on September 1, during which he divulged some details of intercepted Soviet communications and denounced the actions of the Soviet Union.

On September 5, 1983, President Reagan condemned the shooting down of the airplane as the &quot;Korean airline massacre&quot;, a &quot;crime against humanity [that] must never be forgotten&quot; and an &quot;act of barbarism... [and] inhuman brutality&quot;. The following day, the U.S. ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick delivered an audio-visual presentation in the United Nations Security Council, using audio tapes of the Soviet pilots&#x27; radio conversations and a map of Flight 007&#x27;s path in depicting its shooting down. Following this presentation, TASS acknowledged for the first time that the aircraft had indeed been shot down after warnings were ignored. The Soviets challenged many of the facts presented by the U.S. and revealed the previously unknown presence of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft whose path had crossed that of KAL 007.
On September 7, Japan and the United States jointly released a transcript of Soviet communications, intercepted by the listening post at Wakkanai, to an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council. Reagan issued a National Security Directive stating that the Soviets were not to be let off the hook, and initiating &quot;a major diplomatic effort to keep international and domestic attention focused on the Soviet action&quot;. The move was seen by the Soviet leadership as confirmation of the West&#x27;s bad intentions.

A high-level U.S.–Soviet summit, the first in nearly a year, was scheduled for September 8, 1983, in Madrid. The Shultz–Gromyko meeting went ahead but was overshadowed by the KAL 007 events. It ended acrimoniously, with Shultz stating: &quot;Foreign Minister Gromyko&#x27;s response to me today was even more unsatisfactory than the response he gave in public yesterday. I find it totally unacceptable.&quot; Reagan ordered the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on September 15, 1983, to revoke the license of Aeroflot Soviet Airlines to operate flights to and from the United States. Aeroflot flights to North America were consequently available only through Canadian and Mexican cities, forcing the Soviet foreign minister to cancel his scheduled trip to the UN. Aeroflot service to the U.S. was not restored until April 29, 1986.

An emergency session of the ICAO was held in Montreal, Canada. On September 12, 1983, the Soviet Union used its veto to block a United Nations resolution condemning it for shooting down the aircraft.

Shortly after the Soviet Union shot down KAL 007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operating the commercial airports around New York City, denied Soviet aircraft landing rights, in violation of the United Nations Charter that required the host nation to allow all member countries access to the UN. In reaction, TASS and some at the UN raised the question of whether the UN should move its headquarters from the United States. Charles Lichenstein, acting U.S. permanent representative to the UN under Ambassador Kirkpatrick, responded, &quot;We will put no impediment in your way. The members of the U.S. mission to the United Nations will be down at the dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail off into the sunset.&quot; Administration officials were quick to announce that Lichenstein was speaking only for himself.

In the Cold War context of Operation RYAN, the Strategic Defence Initiative, Pershing II missile deployment in Europe, and the upcoming Exercise Able Archer, the Soviet Government perceived the incident with the South Korean airliner to be a portent of war. The Soviet hierarchy took the official line that KAL Flight 007 was on a spy mission, as it &quot;flew deep into Soviet territory for several hundred kilometres [miles], without responding to signals and disobeying the orders of interceptor fighter planes&quot;. They claimed its purpose was to probe the air defences of highly sensitive Soviet military sites in the Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island. The Soviet government expressed regret over the loss of life, but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation. Instead, the Soviet Union blamed the CIA for this &quot;criminal, provocative act&quot;.

In a comparative study of the two tragedies published in 1991, political scientist Robert Entman points out that with KAL 007, &quot;the angle taken by the US media emphasised the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation. With Iran Air 655, the frame de-emphasised guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology&quot;.

==Investigations==
===NTSB===
Since the aircraft had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals had died in the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington at the behest of the State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.

The U.S. State Department, after closing the NTSB investigation on the grounds that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.

===Initial ICAO investigation (1983)===
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had only one experience of investigation of an air disaster before the KAL 007 shoot-down. This was the incident of February 21, 1973, when Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 was shot down by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula. ICAO convention required the state in whose territory the incident had taken place (the Soviet Union) to conduct an investigation together with the country of registration (South Korea), the country whose air traffic control the aircraft was flying under (Japan), as well as the country of the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturer (US).

The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did not have the authority to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation did not have access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).

The ICAO released their report on December 2, 1983, which concluded that the violation of Soviet airspace was accidental: One of two explanations for the aircraft&#x27;s deviation was that the autopilot had remained in hold instead of mode after departing Anchorage. They postulated that this inflight navigational error was caused by either the crew&#x27;s failure to select mode or the inertial navigation not activating when selected because the aircraft was already too far off track. It was determined that the crew did not notice this error or subsequently perform navigational checks, which would have revealed that the aircraft was diverging further and further from its assigned route. This was later deemed to be caused by a &quot;lack of situational awareness and flight deck coordination&quot;.

The report included a statement by the Soviet Government claiming &quot;no remains of the victims, the instruments or their components or the flight recorders have so far been discovered&quot;. This statement was subsequently shown to be untrue by Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s release in 1993 of a November 1983 memo from KGB head Viktor Chebrikov and Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to Yuri Andropov. This memo stated, &quot;In the third decade of October this year the equipment in question (the recorder of in-flight parameters and the recorder of voice communications by the flight crew with ground air traffic surveillance stations and between themselves) was brought aboard a search vessel and forwarded to Moscow by air for decoding and translation at the Air Force Scientific Research Institute.&quot; The Soviet Government statement would further be contradicted by Soviet civilian divers who later recalled that they viewed the wreckage of the aircraft on the bottom of the sea for the first time on September 15, two weeks after the plane had been shot down.

Following the publication of the report, the ICAO adopted a resolution condemning the Soviet Union for the attack. Furthermore, the report led to a unanimous amendment in May 1984—though not coming into force until October 1, 1998—to the Convention on International Civil Aviation that defined the use of force against civilian airliners in more detail. The amendment to section 3(d) reads in part: &quot;The contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and that, in case of interception, the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft must not be endangered.&quot;

===U.S. Air Force radar data===
It is customary for the Air Force to impound radar trackings involving possible litigation in cases of aviation accidents. In the civil litigation for damages, the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska, pertinent to KAL 007&#x27;s flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shoot-down. Later, he said he had &quot;misspoken&quot; and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A Pentagon spokesman concurred, saying that the tapes are recycled for re-use from 24–30 hours afterward; the fate of KAL 007 was known inside this timeframe.

===Interim developments===

Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose daughter Alice Ephraimson-Abt had died on the flight, chaired the &quot;American Association for Families of KAL 007 Victims&quot;. He single-handedly pursued three U.S. administrations for answers about the flight, flying to Washington 250 times and meeting with 149 State Department officials. Following the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., Ephraimson-Abt persuaded U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy, Sam Nunn, Carl Levin, and Bill Bradley to write to the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev requesting information about the flight.

&quot;Glasnost&quot; reforms in the same year brought about a relaxation of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location of the wreckage and had possession of the flight recorders. On December 10, 1991, Senator Jesse Helms of the Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin requesting information concerning the survival of passengers and crew of KAL 007 including the fate of Congressman Larry McDonald.

On June 17, 1992, President Yeltsin revealed that after the 1991 failed coup attempt, concerted attempts were made to locate Soviet-era documents relating to KAL 007. He mentioned the discovery of &quot;a memorandum from K.G.B. to the Central Committee of the Communist Party,&quot; stating that a tragedy had taken place and adding that there are documents &quot;which would clarify the entire picture.&quot; Yeltsin said the memo continued to say that &quot;these documents are so well concealed that it is doubtful that our children will be able to find them.&quot; On September 11, 1992, Yeltsin officially acknowledged the existence of the recorders and promised to give the South Korean government a transcript of the flight recorder contents as found in KGB files.

In October 1992, Hans Ephraimson-Abt led a delegation of families and U.S. State Department officials to Moscow at the invitation of President Yeltsin. During a state ceremony at St. Catherine&#x27;s Hall in the Kremlin, the KAL family delegation was handed a portfolio containing partial transcripts of the KAL 007 cockpit voice recorder, translated into Russian, and documents of the Politburo pertaining to the tragedy.

During an official visit to Seoul in November 1992 to improve bilateral relations, President Yeltsin handed the two recorder containers to Korean President Roh Tae-woo, but not the tapes themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL 007 investigations in order to take the newly released information into account. The tapes were handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over at the same time were tapes of the ground-to-air communications of the Soviet military. The tapes were transcribed by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.

A 1993 official enquiry by the Russian Federation absolved the Soviet hierarchy of blame, determining that the incident was a case of mistaken identity. On May 28, 1993, the ICAO presented its second report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

====Soviet memoranda====
In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos dating from a few weeks after the downing of KAL 007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yuri Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL 007&#x27;s wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL 007&#x27;s flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.

The third memo acknowledges that analysis of the recorder tapes showed no evidence of the Soviet interceptor attempting to contact KAL 007 via radio nor any indication that the KAL 007 had been given warning shots.

However in case the flight recorders shall become available to the western countries their data may be used for Confirmation of no attempt by the intercepting aircraft to establish radio contact with the intruder plane on 121.5 MHz and no tracers warning shots in the last section of the flight
That the Soviet search was simulated (while they knew the wreckage lay elsewhere) also is suggested by the article of Mikhail Prozumentshchikov, Deputy Director of the Russian State Archives of Recent History, commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the airplane&#x27;s shoot-down. Commenting on the Soviet and American searches: &quot;Since the U.S.S.R., for natural reasons, knew better where the Boeing had been downed...it was very problematical to retrieve anything, especially as the U.S.S.R. was not particularly interested&quot;.

===Revised ICAO report (1993)===
On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a goodwill gesture to South Korea during a visit to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL 007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL 007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew&#x27;s conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.

In addition, the Russian Federation released &quot;Transcript of Communications. U.S.S.R. Air Defence Command Centres on Sakhalin Island&quot; transcripts to ICAO—this new evidence triggered the revised ICAO report in 1993 &quot;The Report of the Completion of the Fact-Finding Investigation&quot;, and is appended to it. These transcripts (of two reels of tape, each containing multiple tracks) are time specified, some to the second, of the communications between the various command posts and other military facilities on Sakhalin from the time of the initial orders for the shoot-down and then through the stalking of KAL 007 by Major Osipovich in his Su-15 interceptor, the attack as seen and commented on by General Kornukov, Commander of Sokol Air Base, down the ranks to the Combat Controller Captain Titovnin.

The transcripts include the post-attack flight of KAL 007 until it had reached Moneron Island, the descent of KAL 007 over Moneron, the initial Soviet SAR missions to Moneron, the futile search of the support interceptors for KAL 007 on the water, and ending with the debriefing of Osipovich on return to base. Some of the communications are the telephone conversations between superior officers and subordinates and involve commands to them, while other communications involve the recorded responses to what was then being viewed on radar tracking KAL 007. These multi-track communications from various command posts telecommunicating at the same minute and seconds as other command posts were communicating provide a &quot;composite&quot; picture of what was taking place.

The data from the CVR and the FDR revealed that the recordings broke off after the first minute and 44 seconds of KAL 007&#x27;s post-missile detonation 12 minute flight. The remaining minutes of the flight would be supplied by the Russia 1992 submission to ICAO of the real-time Soviet military communication of the shoot-down and aftermath. The fact that both recorder tapes stopped exactly at the same time 1 minute and 44 seconds after missile detonation (18:38:02 UTC) without the tape portions for the more than 10 minutes of KAL 007&#x27;s post-detonation flight before it descended below radar tracking (18:38 UTC) finds no explanation in the ICAO analysis: &quot;It could not be established why both flight recorders simultaneously ceased to operate 104 seconds after the attack. The power supply cables were fed to the rear of the aircraft in raceways on opposite sides of the fuselage until they came together behind the two recorders.&quot;

===Passenger pain and suffering===
Passenger pain and suffering was an important factor in determining the level of compensation that was paid by Korean Air Lines.

Fragments from the proximity fused R-98 medium range air-to-air missile exploding behind the tail caused punctures to the pressurized passenger cabin. When one of the flight crew radioed Tokyo Area Control one minute and two seconds after missile detonation his breathing was already &quot;accentuated&quot;, indicating to ICAO analysts that he was speaking through the microphone located in his oxygen mask, &quot;Korean Air 007 ah... We are... Rapid compressions. Descend to 10,000.&quot;

Two expert witnesses testified at a trial before then Magistrate Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They addressed the issue of pre-death pain and suffering. Captain James McIntyre, an experienced Boeing 747 pilot, and aircraft accident investigator, testified that shrapnel from the missile caused rapid decompression of the cabin, but left the passengers sufficient time to don oxygen masks: &quot;McIntyre testified that, based upon his estimate of the extent of damage the aircraft sustained, all passengers survived the initial impact of the shrapnel from the missile explosion. In McIntyre&#x27;s expert opinion, at least 12 minutes elapsed between the impact of the shrapnel and the crash of the plane, and the passengers remained conscious throughout.&quot;

==Conspiracy theories==

Flight 007 has been the subject of ongoing controversy and has spawned a number of alternate theories. Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the flight data recorders, unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, the untimely destruction of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s King Salmon radar data, Cold War disinformation and propaganda and Gennadiy Osipovich&#x27;s (the Soviet fighter pilot who shot down flight 007) statement that although he knew the plane was a civilian aircraft, he suspected that it could have been used as a spy plane.

Alexander Dallin in his 1985 book concluded that no hypothesis of inadvertent intrusion of the Boeing 747 into the Soviet prohibited airspace survives scrutiny, albeit there is no direct evidence of deliberate intrusion either. 

==Aftermath==

Two television movies were produced about the incident; both films were produced before the fall of the Soviet Union allowed access to archives. &quot;Shootdown&quot; (1988), a telemovie starring Angela Lansbury, John Cullum, and Kyle Secor, was based on the book of the same title by R.W. Johnson, about the efforts of Nan Moore (Lansbury), the mother of a passenger, to get answers from the U.S. and Soviet governments. Then the British Granada Television documentary drama &quot;Coded Hostile&quot;, screened on ITV on September 7, 1989, detailed the U.S. military and governmental investigation, highlighting the likely confusion of Flight 007 with the USAF RC-135 in the context of routine US SIGINT/COMINT missions in the area. Written by Brian Phelan and directed by David Darlow, it starred Michael Murphy, Michael Moriarty, and Chris Sarandon. An updated version was screened by Channel 4 in the UK on August 31, 1993, incorporating details of the 1992 UN investigation.

On 26 September 1983, a nuclear false alarm incident occurred, which almost led to nuclear war. In the aftermath of the airliner shootdown, the Soviet military system was geared to detect a first strike and immediately retaliate, and an optical illusion led the early warning system to malfunction and trigger a false alarm.

===Airway closed===
The FAA temporarily closed Airway R-20, the air corridor that Korean Air Flight 007 was meant to follow, on September 2. Airlines fiercely resisted the closure of this popular route, the shortest of five corridors between Alaska and Eastern Asia. It was therefore reopened on October 2 after safety and navigational aids were checked.

NATO had decided, under the impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and Gryphon cruise missiles in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering and it looked doubtful that it would be carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.

The unprecedented disclosure of the communications intercepted by the United States and Japan revealed a considerable amount of information about their intelligence systems and capabilities. National Security Agency director Lincoln D. Faurer commented: &quot;...as a result of the Korean Air Lines affair, you have already heard more about my business in the past two weeks than I would desire... For the most part, this has not been a matter of unwelcome leaks. It is the result of a conscious, responsible decision to address an otherwise unbelievable horror.&quot; Changes that the Soviets subsequently made to their codes and frequencies reduced the effectiveness of this monitoring by 60%.

The U.S. KAL 007 Victims&#x27; Association, under the leadership of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully lobbied U.S. Congress and the airline industry to accept an agreement that would ensure that future victims of airline incidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering the burden of proof of airliner misconduct. This legislation has had far-reaching effects for the victims of subsequent aircraft disasters.

The U.S. decided to utilize military radars to extend air traffic control radar coverage from out from Anchorage. The FAA also established a secondary radar system (ATCBI-5) on Saint Paul Island. In 1986, the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union set up a joint air traffic control system to monitor aircraft over the North Pacific, thereby giving the Soviet Union formal responsibility to monitor civilian air traffic, and setting up direct communication links between the controllers of the three countries.

On September 16, 1983 a White House press secretary read a statement on the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. It is announced that the GPS system should be available for civil aviation with the planned completion in 1988. This communication was sometimes understood as the release of the military project for the general public. However, the GPS system was developed from the start for military and civilian navigation.

The regular air route between Seoul and Moscow started in April 1990 as the result of the Nordpolitik policy of South Korea, operated by Aeroflot and Korean Air; meanwhile, all 9 of Korean Air&#x27;s European routes would start passing through Soviet airspace. This was the first time Korean Air aircraft was officially permitted to pass through Soviet airspace.

Alvin Snyder, the director of worldwide television for the United States Information Agency, was the producer of the video shown to the U.N. Security Council on September 6, 1983. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on September 1, 1996, he stated that he had been given only limited access to the transcripts of the Soviet communication when he produced the video in 1983. When he received full insight into the Soviet transmissions in 1993, he says he realized that: &quot;The Russians (sic) believed the plane to be an RC-135 reconnaissance plane&quot; and that &quot;Osipovich (the Soviet fighter pilot) could not identify the plane&quot; and &quot;That he fired warning cannon shots and tipped his wings, an international signal to force the plane to land&quot;. Some of these statements were contradicted by the pilot in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he confirmed that he did fire warning shots, but that they would not have been visible as they were not tracers.

In a March 15, 2001, interview, Valery Kamensky, then Commander of the Soviet Far East Military District Air Defense Force and direct superior to General Kornukov, opined that such a shoot-down of a civilian passenger plane could not happen again in view of the changing political conditions and alliances. In this interview, Kamensky stated, &quot;It is still a mystery what happened to the bodies of the crew and passengers on the plane. According to one theory, right after the detonation of the rocket, the nose and tail section of the jumbo fell off and the mid-fuselage became a sort of wind tunnel so the people were swept through it and scattered over the surface of the ocean. Yet in this case, some of the bodies were to have been found during the search operations in the area. The question of what actually happened to the people has not been given a distinct answer.&quot;

On September 1, 2003, commenting on the 20th anniversary of the shoot-down article in RIA Novosti, Mikhail Prozumentshchikov, Deputy Director of the Russian State Archives of Recent History, disclosed that the Soviet naval forces in the search for KAL 007 in international waters, already &quot;knew better where [it] had been downed&quot; while conducting their search and that nothing was found &quot;especially as the USSR was not particularly interested.&quot;

Korean Air still flies from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Seoul. However, the flight no longer stops at Anchorage or flies to Gimpo International Airport as it now flies directly to Incheon International Airport. Flight number 007 has been retired since, using flight numbers for 3 separate flights as 82, 86 and 250. , the separate flights are being served using Boeing 777F for flight 250 as a cargo flight, a Boeing 747-8I for flight 86 and a Airbus A380 for flight 82.

==In popular culture==
The American science fiction television drama series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, referenced the flight in season 2, episode 7, by adding NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine as a passenger on the flight. Characters suggest various explanations for the downing, including the spy plane theory (as the plane was flying over the launch site of Buran in the series), or alternatively positioning him as the root target that led to the downing of the flight, in the show&#x27;s alternate depiction of how the Space Race could have gone.

Lee Greenwood wrote the song &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; in response to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Greenwood stated in the book &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; (written by himself and Gwen McLin) that the song&#x27;s lyrics flowed naturally from the music as an honest reflection of his pride to be American.

In November 1983, KGO-TV in San Francisco aired an advertisement for an upcoming news special report titled &quot;Green Street Reds&quot;, about suspicious activities at the Soviet consulate. In the ad, they depicted Santa Claus and his reindeer being shot down by a Soviet missile. The advertisement was produced by Richard Williams Animation. Angry parents complained to KGO about the poor impression the image of Santa&#x27;s death made upon young children.

In 1984, a song about Flight 007 was featured on the Gary Moore album &quot;Victims of the Future&quot; under the title &quot;Murder in the Skies&quot;.

In 1989, HBO released the film &quot;&quot;, with Michael Moriarty, Michael Murphy, Chris Sarandon, and Harris Yulin, about the case of Korean Air Lines flight 007.

The disaster was referenced several times in the 1991 thriller film &quot;A Kiss Before Dying.&quot;

The story of the disaster was featured on the ninth season of Cineflix television show &quot;Mayday&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;Target Is Destroyed&quot; (S09E05).

<doc id="108259" wikidata="Q204561" url="?curid=108259" title="Modesto, California">
<text>Modesto (; ) is the county seat and largest city of Stanislaus County, California, United States. With a population of 218,069 according to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, it is the 19th-most populous city in California.

Modesto is located in the Central Valley region, south of Sacramento and north of Fresno. Distances from other places include: north of Merced, California, east of San Francisco, west of Yosemite National Park, and south of Stockton.

The city, in the San Joaquin Valley, is surrounded by rich farmland. Stanislaus County ranks sixth among California counties in farm production. It is home to Gallo Family Winery, the largest family-owned winery in the United States.
Led by milk, almonds, chickens, walnuts, and corn silage, the county grossed nearly $3.1 billion in agricultural production in 2011. The farm-to-table movement plays a central role in Modesto living in the Central Valley.

Modesto has been often honored as a Tree City USA.

==History==
The City of Modesto was originally a stop on the railroad connecting Sacramento to Los Angeles, built by Central Pacific Railroad. When Modesto was founded in 1870, the railroad company co-founder Mark Hopkins Jr. suggested to name it after his associate the banker William C. Ralston. Ralston asked that another name be found, and a railroad employee exclaimed loudly in Spanish that Ralston was a modest man. The railroad company co-founder Charles Crocker then named the town Modesto in recognition of Ralston&#x27;s modesty.

Modesto&#x27;s population exceeded 1,000 residents in 1884. With fields of grain, the nearby Tuolumne River for grain barges, and railroad traffic, the town grew. Irrigation water came from dams in the foothills, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit and nut trees flourished. By 1900, Modesto&#x27;s population was more than 4,500. During World War II, the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US armed forces and Allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto&#x27;s population grew about two percent per year, to over 100,000 in 1980 and over 200,000 in 2001.

The city&#x27;s official motto, &quot;Water Wealth Contentment Health,&quot; is emblazoned on the downtown Modesto Arch, which is featured in local photographs and postcards. The motto was selected in a contest held in 1911, with a $3 prize for the winner. (The original winning motto, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s got Modesto&#x27;s goat&quot;, was later declined by town officials.) Modesto&#x27;s motto is sometimes spoofed as &quot;The land gets the water, the bankers get the wealth, the cows get contentment, and the farmers get the health.&quot;

===Planning and environment===
In 1885, Modesto enacted what is now considered to be the first zoning ordinance. The ordinance&#x27;s primary goal was to keep laundries (which were primarily Chinese run), out of the city. After an arrested man filed to contest the constitutionality of the ordinance, the case escalated to the California Supreme Court which found the law to be constitutional.

In the late 1980s Modesto embarked on an update to the city&#x27;s general plan pursuant to requirements of the State of California. The result was a comprehensive evaluation of alternative population and land use projections along with associated environmental impact analysis. Some of the environmental factors technically assessed were air quality, water quality, environmental noise, soil contamination and visual impacts.

Much of the soils in Modesto are classified as part of the Hanford series: (HbpA) fine sandy loam, moderately deep over silt. These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse-textured soils derived from alluvium from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production of a wide variety of irrigated orchard, field, and truck crops.

Vicinity watercourses include the Stanislaus River, the Tuolumne River and Dry Creek which empties into the Tuolumne River. Area groundwater, which is the principal source of water supply in the city, has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Reservoir is now used to augment city water. In various parts of the city and its perimeter the following water pollutants have occurred from time to time: nitrates, dibromochloromethane, volatile organics, salinity, total dissolved solids and other pesticides. Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.

The EPA rates air quality in Modesto as a 23 on a scale to 100 (higher is better), making Modesto an unhealthy place to live for those with breathing difficulties. This is based on ozone alert days and number of pollutants in the air. In May 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, in association with the American Lung Association, indicated that Modesto was one of the top 25 most polluted cities in the U.S.

===Downtown revitalization===

As of the 2000s, downtown Modesto (DOMO) has new attractions including the Gallo Center for the Arts and the new Downtown Plaza adjacent to Modesto Centre Plaza. Downtown Modesto has lost the Hotel Covell, the art deco Strand Theatre, and the Sears building.

Historic 10th and 11th streets, which were the original locations of the cruising featured in &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, have been designated by the City of Modesto as the Historic Cruise Route. This is now a tourist walk with information about Modesto&#x27;s music, car and Graffiti culture.

In 2014, the Walk of Fame was launched on the Historic Cruise Route with markers celebrating classic legends like George Lucas, Gene Winfield, Bart Bartoni and others.

Classic Community Murals was launched by Modesto magazine &quot;ModestoView&quot; and the Peer Recovery Art Center to create a series of large scale murals celebrating the Modesto Classic Graffiti heritage. Many of these are on the Cruise Route.

New business incentives have been created to enhance facades, signage, and permitting. A promenade is being designed to create a special entertainment zone along the corridor between the Modesto Centre Plaza and the Gallo Center for the Arts and the adjacent core streets of 10th, 11th and J streets.

==Geography==

Modesto is located in the center of the Central Valley surrounded by the Coastal Ranges and the Sierra Nevada, and close by, the numerous farmlands that produce a majority of several crops for the United States. There are also grassy and tree-filled preserves nearby. The city is in between the Tuolumne River and the nearby Stanislaus River. There is a small creek named Dry Creek, which is badly polluted by agricultural runoff and is adjacent to several parks. Rivers and lakes near Waterford are accessible for a kayak, or small motorboat, and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when hydroelectric power dams were installed upstream for flood control, irrigation, and electric power generation. The nearest large open seaport is the Port of Stockton, used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.

===Climate===
Modesto has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) under the Köppen climate classification. It has cool to mild winters with moderate rainfall and hot, dry summers. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and the annual total is . The highest rainfall in a season was in 1982–83 and the lowest being in 1912–1913. Precipitation usually comes in the form of atmospheric rivers or bomb cyclones and some of the most precipitation can come during the El Niño years. In addition, Modesto experiences drought cycles like the rest of California where the seasonal rainfall can be a few inches below average in dry seasons and a few inches above during wet seasons. The city does not have a full storm sewer system, and many streets flood during winter rain storms. Measurable snowfall has only been recorded in only 4 months in the last 100 years with the highest amount being 1.5 inches that fell in January 1962.

Usually on average the weather does not go below 30 °F and not above 103 °F. Average January temperatures range from in the day to at night. There are about 20 days per year that see temperatures at or below and 79 that are at or above . Winter days that receive precipitation tend to be milder while drier days have freezing nights that allow for frost build up until the morning. Thus, winter temperatures can vary from lows in the low 30s in dry months to 40s in wetter months. Days in the winter can occasionally be as high as , but there can also be cool rainy days as late as May reaching only . Average July temperatures range from in the day to at night. During the summer months there can be multiple days in a row with high temperatures exceeding . This can pose health risks for people with weak constitutions or who ignore the dangers of heat stroke. Onshore breezes (known locally as the &quot;delta breeze&quot;) moderate these high temperatures somewhat, with cooler air coming in after 8 or 9 pm on summer nights, making Modesto potentially a couple or few degrees cooler than the northern and southern parts of the Central Valley.

The Rancho Del Puerto Mexican land grant to Mariano and Pedro Hernandez in 1844 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena extended east of the present-day Highway 33 to the San Joaquin River. The northern boundary was Del Puerto Creek and the southern boundary was just south of present-day Marshall Road.

== Politics ==
According to Salida resident, Lee Sell, there was a movement to incorporate Salida as a city during the 1950s but it failed due to lack of tax base. Incorporation discussion surfaced again in 2007.

In 1996, the City of Modesto sought to annex Salida and Wood Colony&#x27;s &quot;Beckwith Triangle&quot; which was voted down by LAFCO. At an August 2013 Modesto Planning Commission workshop, Modesto city planners unveiled a new general plan update to annex Salida and doubled the size of land they wanted to annex in and around the Beckwith Triangle.

Terry Withrow, Stanislaus County Supervisor whose district covers Salida, authored an opinion piece which appeared in the Modesto Bee on August 20, 2011, in favor of annexing Salida to the City of Modesto. After being elected in a run-off, Modesto Mayor Garrad Marsh expressed his support of annexing Salida in his &quot;State of the City&quot; speech in March 2012. Both politicians met with a contentious crowd of over 200 residents who filled the Salida Municipal Advisory Council meeting room on January 29, 2013. The majority of residents spoke against annexation.

With the election of the new Modesto Mayor, Ted Brandvold, along with several new city council members, 2016 saw a &quot;reset&quot; to Modesto&#x27;s 1995 General Plan boundaries. The 1995 General Plan includes Salida and the Beckwith Triangle area of Wood Colony, leaving the two unincorporated communities still susceptible to annexation by the City of Modesto.

<text>Turlock is a city in Stanislaus County, California, United States. Its population was 72,740 at the 2020 United States Census, making it the second-largest city in Stanislaus County after Modesto.

==History==
Founded on December 22, 1871, by prominent grain farmer John William Mitchell, the town consisted of a post office, a depot, a grain warehouse and a few other buildings. Mitchell declined the honor of having the town named for himself. The name &quot;Turlock&quot; was then chosen instead. The name is believed to originate from the Irish village of Turlough. In October 1870, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published an excerpt from English novelist James Payn&#x27;s story &quot;Bred in the Bone&quot;, which includes the mention of a town named &quot;Turlock&quot;. Local historians believe that the issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; was read by early resident H.W. Lander, who suggested the alternate name.

Mitchell and his brother were successful businessmen, buying land and developing large herds of cattle and sheep that were sold to gold miners and others as they arrived. They were also leaders in wheat farming and cultivated tracts of land under the tenant system. Eventually, the Mitchells owned most of the area, over 100,000 acres, from Keyes to Atwater. In the early 20th century, 20-acre lots from the Mitchell estate were sold for $20 an acre.

While it grew to be a relatively prosperous and busy hub of activity throughout the end of the 19th century, it was not incorporated as a city until February 15, 1908. By that time intensive agricultural development surrounded most of the city (agriculture remains the major economic force in the region in current times). Many of the initial migrants to the region were Swedish. As an early &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article stated of the region and the community&#x27;s lacteal productivity, &quot;you have to hand it to the Scandinavians for knowing how to run a dairy farm.&quot;

Turlock went on to become known as the &quot;Heart of the Valley&quot; because of its agricultural production. With the boom came racial and labor strife. In July 1921, a mob of 150 white men evicted 60 Japanese cantaloupe pickers from rooming houses and ranches near Turlock, taking them and their belongings on trucks out of town. The white workers claimed they were being undercut by the Japanese who were working for lower wages. In protest, fruit growers briefly threatened not to hire any white workers who supported the eviction, preferring to let their melons rot on the vines, rather than hire such characters. As a result of this stance, the eviction had the opposite effect of what the mob had intended. By August 1921, Japanese workers had returned to the Turlock area and were nearly the only people employed to pick melons.

The incident gained national attention, and California Governor William Stephens vowed that justice would be served. Six men were promptly arrested but were apparently untroubled by the charges, stating that leaders of Turlock&#x27;s American Legion and Chamber of Commerce had told them that no trouble would result from their actions. Although a former Turlock night watchman testified that one of the accused had disclosed a plan &quot;to clean up Turlock of the Japs,&quot; all six men were acquitted.

An editorial in the July 22, 1921 edition of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; opposed both the evictions and Japanese labor, with one column stating that &quot;we in California are determined that Oriental workers shall be kept out of the state. But that does not mean that the decent citizens of California will tolerate for one moment such proceedings as the attack of a mob on the Japanese cantaloupe workers in the Turlock district.&quot;

In 1930, Turlock&#x27;s population was 20% Assyrian. They were such a significant part of the population that the southern part of town even became referred to as Little Urmia, referring to the region of northwestern Iran from which most had come. In the 1930s, Turlock was cited by &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; as having the most churches per capita in the US, which had partly to do with the variety of ethnic churches established for the relatively small settler population. Various religious centers reflecting a diverse population, such as Sikh Gurdwaras, various Assyrian Christian churches, and many mainline Protestant, Mormon and Roman Catholic churches have been built.

During World War II, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US government placed Japanese Americans into concentration camps all over the country. The Stanislaus County Fairgrounds was the site of one of 15 temporary &quot;assembly centers&quot; and held 3,669 Japanese Americans, most of whom were US citizens. The US Army also built the Ballico Auxiliary Field (1942–1946) for training pilots in Turlock.

In 1960, California State University, Stanislaus, opened to students, helping to spur growth in the city as the university expanded in its early years. In the 1970s, State Route 99 (formerly U.S. Route 99) was completed through the area, largely bypassing the then-incorporated areas of Turlock in a route to the west of the city through mostly undeveloped land. Since that time, the city has grown westward considerably to meet the freeway&#x27;s north–south path, but urban development west of the freeway has only recently begun to take hold. In an attempt to allow for orderly growth of the city, comprehensive growth master plans have established urban growth boundaries since the 1960s.

In the 1980s, Turlock experienced extensive growth of both residential and commercial areas, following a statewide boom in housing demand and construction. The housing boom of the 1980s diminished in the early 1990s but increased again in the second half of the decade, partly as a result of growth in the San Francisco Bay Area, which placed a higher demand for more affordable housing in outlying areas. After the dot-com bust, housing demand intensified, producing much higher housing prices in an area formerly known for affordable housing. A recent boom in the retail sector has produced considerable growth along the Highway 99 corridor. Turlock reached its northern urban growth boundary, Taylor Road, in the late 1990s, and growth beyond it is restricted by the city&#x27;s Master Plan.

The Stanislaus County Fairgrounds are located in Turlock. Before the land was known as Stanislaus County Fairgrounds it was first known as Melon Carnival because of its crop of cantaloupes, the main source of Turlock&#x27;s economy. In 1911, the first Melon Carnival was held in downtown Turlock. Eventually, the Melon Carnival became the Stanislaus County Fair and was held at the Stanislaus County Fairgrounds. Promoting agriculture, entertainment and technology with the help of the community, is the main mission of the Stanislaus County fairgrounds.

==Geography==

== History ==
The community which became Waterford began to form in the latter half of the 19th century, after surrounding regions became populated with 49ers. At this time the area was known as Bakersville, after one of the town&#x27;s influential members. It soon became apparent that mail was being mistaken between Bakersville and Bakersfield, California, and the smaller of the two was forced to change its name. At that time, the Tuolumne River did not have a bridge, and instead was crossed by Roberts Ferry on the waterfront. Since the area was well known for this ford, the town adopted the name of Waterford. For several decades, a regular steam locomotive could traverse the Tuolumne in Waterford on a trestle bridge, which was demolished in the second half of the 20th century. There are now no longer railway lines running through or near Waterford, even though many maps will still show the tracks going through the post office building.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Stanislaus Regional Transit Authority bus service.

Waterford has two main highways: CR J9, &quot;F Street&quot;, and State Route 132, &quot;Yosemite Blvd.&quot; Both intersect in Waterford. &quot;F Street&quot; goes to Oakdale to the north, and Turlock to the south. Yosemite goes to Modesto westbound, and to the Gold Country eastbound.

The Hickman-Waterford bridge is also located in Waterford. It is the only bridge for about both east and west to cross the Tuolumne River after Geer Road.

==History==

===The Oxford Tire Pile===
Oxford Energy had a major stake in a large local scrap tire pile operation. When it mostly burnt down in 1997, it was the largest single collection of waste tires on the west coast.

Filbin had begun trucking used tires into Ed&#x27;s Tire Disposal even before the construction of I-5 between 1956 and 1979. Oxford Energy had been dumping near Westley in various piles since the 1950s.

Oxford Energy officials heard about it causing an eyesore and environmental blight and in 1984 approached both Filbin and the county, proposing the tire-to-energy project. However, it was turned down on environmental grounds.

About 10,000-20,000 tires were being dumped there each day in 1957. It was under a 24-hour security guard.

Some 40 years later the dump had grown to about 6,000,000 tires. In 1997, the state stepped in under a special local legislative mandate to dispose of them.

Shortly after a local photographer, Mr Burtynsky, had photographed Oxford Pile #8, a lightning strike in the facility started a fire that took weeks to extinguish.

<text>Sutter, formerly South Butte and Sutter City, is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sutter County, California, United States. It is part of the Yuba City Metropolitan Statistical Area within the Greater Sacramento CSA. The population as of the 2010 census was 2,904, up from 2,885 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Originally a settlement called South Butte, established in the vicinity of the stage station at Butte House east of the current town. It had a post office from August 7, 1871, until December 17, 1878, and from February 18, 1879, to January 20, 1888, when it was moved to the new Sutter City Post Office nearby. The Sutter Cemetery originally South Butte Cemetery, lay to the west on the stage road, and beside it was the school house, that was dismissed when there was a funeral.

Sutter City was the result of an attempt to take advantage of the boom in California in the late 1880s. The town was located south of the Cemetery along the path of a railroad line projected to pass through the town and it hoped to become the new county seat, because it was near the geographical center of the county. However the rail line was never built and it never became the county seat.

The Sutter City post office name was changed to Sutter on January 26, 1895.

<text>Yuba City (Maidu: &quot;Yubu&quot;) is a city in Northern California and the county seat of Sutter County, California, United States. The population was 70,117 at the 2020 census. Yuba City is the principal city of the Yuba City Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Sutter County and Yuba County. The metro area&#x27;s population is 164,138. It is the 21st largest metropolitan area in California, ranked behind Redding and Chico. Its metropolitan statistical area is part of the Greater Sacramento CSA.

==History==

===Early history===
The Maidu people were settled in the region when they were first encountered by Spanish and Mexican scouting expeditions in the early 18th century. One version of the origin of the name &quot;Yuba&quot; is that during one of these expeditions, wild grapes were seen growing by a river, and so it was named &quot;Uba&quot;, a variant spelling of the Spanish word &quot;uva&quot; (grape). On the map of the area made by Jean Jacques Vioget in 1841, a Maidu rancheria called Buba, noted in Stephen Powers&#x27; 1877 book &quot;The Tribes of California&quot; as the village of Yú-ba, was located at the present site of Yuba City.

The Mexican government granted a large expanse of land, which included the area in which Yuba City is situated, to John Sutter—the same John Sutter upon whose land gold was subsequently discovered in 1848. He sold part of this tract to some enterprising men who wished to establish a town near the confluence of the Yuba River and the Feather River, tributaries of the Sacramento River, with an eye to developing a commercial center catering to the thousands of gold miners headed upstream to the gold fields. At the same time, another town was developing on the eastern bank of the Feather River, the beginnings of what later would become Marysville.

By 1852, Yuba City was a steamboat landing, had one hotel, a grocery store, a post office, and approximately 20 dwelling homes with a population of about 150.

Yuba City was chosen as county seat for Sutter County in 1854. The same year, however, voters decided that Nicolaus would be a better location, and the county seat was moved there. County voters returned to their first choice of Yuba City two years later, in 1856, and it has remained the county seat since.

Yuba City saw its first major influx of population after World War II, pushing residential areas west and south from the city&#x27;s original center. Orchards were turned into residential areas as new homes were built for people migrating to the city.

===Flood of 1955===
In December 1955, a series of storms dropped torrential rain throughout northern California. The deluge caused all the rivers in the region to overflow their banks and to break through levees. The Christmas Eve levee break at Yuba City was particularly disastrous, with 38 people losing their lives, and heavy damage occurring in the downtown section. According to Dick Brandt, manager of the Yuba County airport in 1955, between 550 and 600 Sutter County residents were rescued from the floodwater by helicopter.

===1961 B-52 airplane crash===
On March 14, 1961, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrying nuclear weapons, flying near Yuba City, encountered a pressurization problem, and had to drop to a lower altitude. Because of this, more fuel than expected was used, and the aircraft ran out of fuel. It crashed before meeting with a tanker aircraft. The pilot gave the bailout command, and the crew egressed at 10,000 ft, except for the pilot, who ejected at 4,000 ft, while avoiding a populated area. The aircraft was destroyed. The weapons, two Mark 39 (3.8 megatons each) thermonuclear bombs (identified from declassified Department of Energy films and photographs) were destroyed on impact though no explosion took place, and there was no release of radioactive material as a result.

===1976 school bus crash===

On May 21, 1976, a school bus carrying members of the Yuba City High School&#x27;s choir to a performance at Miramonte High School in Orinda, California plunged 28 feet off the exit ramp on I-680 at Marina Vista Road in Martinez, California. Twenty-seven students and one adult chaperone died and twenty-three students were seriously injured.

===1978 missing person case===

On February 24, 1978, five young men from Yuba City, Gary Dale Mathias, Jack Madruga, Jackie Huett, Theodore (Ted) Weiher and William Sterling, aged between 24 and 32 years, disappeared under mysterious circumstances. They went to a basketball game in Chico and on their way back drove up to a mountain road away from the main road back to Yuba, where their car had been found later, undamaged and with enough gas to drive back to Yuba City.

Four of the men were later found in and near a trailer on June 4 of the same year. Ted Weiher was found inside the trailer, starved, covered in blankets. Inside the trailer there was enough food to supply all five men for about a year, and enough paper and wood to light a fire, but nothing was used this way. The corpses and bones of three of the other men were found outside the trailer, but Gary Mathias was never found.

===1994 mosque burning===
Yuba City has been home to a significant Muslim population, including Pakistani Americans descended from 1902 immigrants. In 1994 the Muslim community completed a mosque that cost an estimated $1.8 million and many hours of donated work. Soon after, the mosque was destroyed by an act of arson, the first time that a mosque was destroyed in the United States. Eventually the mosque was rebuilt with help of Sikhs, Mormons, Christians, and other groups. The story is told in the 2012 documentary &quot;An American Mosque&quot;.

===2020 police brutality incident===
On April 12, 2020, a retired 64 year old veteran named Gregory Gross was assaulted by Yuba City police officers Joshua Jackson, Scott Hansen and Nathan Livingston after they had charged Gross for driving while intoxicated. Gross was handcuffed and compliant at the time of the incident. After twisting his arm and stating that he was now using &quot;pain compliance techniques,&quot; Jackson proceeded to throw Gross face first into the ground, severing his vertebrae and leaving him permanently paralyzed. Jackson was afterwards allowed to retire, while Hansen and Livingston remained officers with the Yuba City Police Department. No charges have been brought against any of the officers, despite body camera video emerging which captured the prolonged abuse of the handcuffed senior citizen. 

In 2022, after several surgeries and years of physical therapy, Gross sued the police department, ultimately winning a $20 million settlement, which was one of the largest such settlements in U.S. history.

==Geography==
Yuba City is located at 39°8&#x27;5&quot; North, 121°37&#x27;34&quot; West (39.134792, −121.626201).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 0.52% water.

The Yuba City area is located north of Sacramento and situated in the Sacramento Valley. It is home to the Sutter Buttes, the smallest mountain range in the world. The Feather River borders the city to the east and the area is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Feather River Valley&quot;, which divides the city from its neighbor Marysville.

==Climate==
Yuba City has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification system) which consists of cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. On average, January is the coolest and wettest month, and July is the hottest and driest. During the wet season from mid-October to mid-April, Yuba City sees frequent rain and is usually under the tule fog. Snow is rare in the valley, but cold waves from the north may bring some light snow and ice. Spring is wet in the beginning but becomes drier and warmer as summer months approach. May has some rain, but usually from thunderstorms rather than from winter storms. Rain is rare from June to September. The Delta Breeze, which comes from the Bay Area on summer nights, helps cool temperatures and adds humidity. At times the Delta Breeze is strong enough to bring coastal fog inland to the Sacramento Valley. Autumn starts out warm but becomes cooler, wetter, and foggier as the season progresses.

<text>Red Bluff is a city in and the county seat of Tehama County, California, United States. Its population was 14,710 at the 2020 census, up from 14,076 at the 2010 census.

It is located north of Sacramento, south of Redding, and it is bisected by Interstate 5. Red Bluff is situated on the banks of the upper Sacramento River. Located in the northernmost part of California’s Central Valley, the city marks the northern end of a vast contiguously cultivated area that extends all the way to Bakersfield, to the south. Mildly rugged terrain, used as rangeland, separates Red Bluff from the next crop areas to the north in Cottonwood.

It was originally known as Leodocia, but was renamed to Covertsburg in 1853, then its current name in 1854. Located at the head of navigation on the Sacramento River, the town flourished in the mid- to late 19th century as a landing point for miners heading to the Trinity County gold fields and later as a temporary terminus for the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s northward expansion.

== Geography ==

Red Bluff is on the northern edge of the Sacramento Valley, and is the third=largest city in the Shasta Cascade region. It is about south of Redding, northwest of Chico, and north of Sacramento.

The city is located at (40.176640, -122.237951). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and (1.48%) of it is covered by water. 

== History ==


In the early 19th century, the Siskiyou Trail was the main north-south path connecting Northern California and Southern Oregon first used by the Native Americans and later fur trappers and hunters. The first European to settle the northern Sacramento Valley in what was then Alta California was Peter Lassen, who in 1844 was granted the Rancho Bosquejo tract from the Mexican government near present-day Vina, about southeast of Red Bluff. There, he proposed to establish a town, but his attempts were thwarted when the California Gold Rush stole the focus of the settlers he had gathered in Missouri. Regardless, the publicity from his colonization efforts attracted new settlers to the valley. In the late 1840s, riverboat traffic began expanding northward along the Sacramento River. Lassen&#x27;s initial attempt to navigate to his ranch in 1849 had failed, but the following year, a riverboat managed to make the arduous journey from Sacramento in 5 months before ultimately being sunk. The discovery of gold near Yreka, California, in 1851 brought a new rush northward and settlers soon flooded the area, looking for the quickest route to the gold fields. A site on the Sacramento River just north of Reeds Creek was determined to be the river&#x27;s navigable head, and a small community soon sprung up around the important landing. First known as Leodocia then Covertsburg, by the time a post office was established on October 17, 1853 residents had settled on the name Red Bluff, in recognition of the titular geographical features once prominent along the banks of the Sacramento River. The first postmaster was Samuel Bishop.

Tehama County was created in 1856 and Red Bluff was chosen as the seat of the new county. By 1859, the first permanent courthouse was constructed.

As early as 1854, committees were brought together at Red Bluff to plan a railroad route connecting California to southern Oregon through the Siskyou Mountains via Nobles Pass. The railroad finally reached Red Bluff in 1872, and for a few years, it was the terminus, increasing the town&#x27;s wealth greatly. In the 1880s, White supremacists in Red Bluff began an ethnic-cleansing campaign against the Chinese residents. In February 1886, thousands of Whites in the &quot;Anti-Coolie League&quot; marched on Chinatown and went from house to house, ordering the occupants to leave within 10 days. Later that year, after the Chinese population had been expelled, the Chinatown was burned.

Growth slowed by the late 1880s, when the railroad was continued north towards Redding, but riverboat commerce continued well into the 20th century. Mining was largely replaced by agriculture, and Red Bluff remained a vital shipping point by rail and eventually highway.

On June 27, 2020, a local Walmart distribution center was the site of a workplace shooting, in which one employee was killed and another four were wounded. The shooter, identified as a former employee, was then killed by responding police officers.

<text>Tehama (Wintun for &quot;high water&quot;) is a city in Tehama County, California, United States. The population was 418 at the 2010 census, down from 432 at the 2000 census.

== Etymology ==
Tehama is most commonly believed to be derived from the Wintun word for &quot;high water&quot;, though there are others definitions that have been proposed such as &quot;low land&quot;, &quot;salmon&quot;, &quot;mother nature&quot; or &quot;shallow&quot; — any of which would be an accurate description of a location where the river is normally shallow enough to ford, where fishermen are a common sight during the salmon run, and winter floods are a regular occurrence.

==History==
A Nomlaki village of Wintun people once stood on the site of modern-day Tehama on the western bank of the Sacramento River.

Tehama (pronounced Tuh-HAY-muh) was founded by Robert Hasty Thomes, who arrived in the area that is now Tehama County in the company of Albert G. Toomes, William Chard, and Job Francis Dye. The four men travelled northward from San Francisco, and were each given land grants from the government of Mexico in 1844, with Thomes&#x27; portion being Rancho Saucos.

Tehama was one of the earliest California settlements north of Sacramento. Thomes mapped out the city in 1850, with First through Fifth Streets running north–south, and B through I Streets running east–west. First Street no longer exists; it was eroded away by the river. It was the last stop for the riverboats for a few years, and the town thrived on the riverboat traffic. When the boats started going farther up the river, Red Bluff became the center of trade. When Tehama County was formed in 1856, Tehama was established as the County Seat. However, the seat was moved to Red Bluff, by county-wide election, the very next year, although various local stories have circulated about how Red Bluff &quot;stole&quot; its county seat status from Tehama.
Tehama had a reputation of being somewhat more liberal and freewheeling than the rest of the county, being the last town to go &quot;dry&quot; before Prohibition, and a center for bootleggers and gamblers.

Tehama&#x27;s population peaked in the 1890s, at about 2000 residents, including a sizable Chinese quarter. The city was incorporated in 1906 when plans were being made for an electric railway through the Sacramento Valley, however the railway was never built. A disastrous fire in 1908 combined with the decline of the riverboat traffic, caused the city to gradually lose prominence and population.

Tehama is home to two parks: Habert Park on C Street, and Belbeck Park, which contains an old brick schoolhouse, now used for the Head Start program. The Tehama County Museum, housed in what was once the Masonic Hall, is located at the corner of C and Third Street.

<text>Weaverville (Chimariko: ) is a census-designated place and the county seat of Trinity County, California, United States. Its population is 3,667 as of the 2020 census, up from 3,600 from the 2010 census.

==History==

Founded in 1850, Weaverville is a historic California Gold Rush town. Located at the foot of the current Trinity Alps Wilderness Area, Weaverville was once home to approximately 2,000 Chinese gold miners and had its own Chinatown. Many of these miners left once the gold rush ended, and the majority of the Chinatown burned down in a 1911 fire. Historical monuments and architecture throughout the town keep this history alive. The Joss House is California&#x27;s oldest active Chinese temple, housing Chinese artifacts from the 19th century, and is Weaverville&#x27;s oldest building, built in 1852. 

A self-guided walking tour of historic downtown buildings (some said to be haunted) is the best way to experience the ambiance and quaint shops and businesses.

Logging and tourism were the economic mainstays of Weaverville for many years. Weaverville is now more known for its robust trail system and quaint historic downtown. The Trinity Alps Basin Trails system starts in Weaverville and is a network of professionally maintained hiking and biking trails ranging in difficulty in and around Trinity Alps and its majestic lakes. 

Weaverville has notable and unusual original gold rush historical architecture, like its iconic spiral staircases on Main St., an old Bandstand, and red Courthouse. The Jake Jackson Museum on Main Street is an original building from the 1850&#x27;s and displays gold rush equipment, tools, photos and memorabilia. The Diggins Saloon and New York Saloon are still open and welcoming customers since the gold rush era.

Historically, Trinity Lake (off Highway 3 just 15 minutes from Weaverville) is a man-made lake providing water to nearby Whiskeytown Lake in neighboring Shasta County, and farmers as far as the Central Valley of California. It became a popular secret recreation area for campers, boaters, and motorcyclists in the 1970&#x27;s and continues its popularity in non-drought years. 

Weaverville has relied on the Trinity Journal as its main source of county news, event calendar, and business advertisements since 1856. It is one of California&#x27;s oldest newspapers still in print. The office of the Trinity Journal is housed in Weaverville&#x27;s Historic District, right downtown. The Trinity Journal publishes weekly on Wednesdays.

Also unique to Weaverville is its electrical grid. Weaverville created its own power company (Trinity PUD) so it could be independent of PG&amp;E and have the ability to create power from local hydro sources.

<doc id="108286" wikidata="Q742631" url="?curid=108286" title="Alpaugh, California">
<text>Alpaugh is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tulare County, California, United States. The population was 1,026 at the 2010 census, up from 761 at the 2000 census.

It is named for John Alpaugh, one of the officers of the Home Extension Colony which reclaimed (or land speculated on) the land the town is built on.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

The site is located on the historic shoreline of Tulare Lake, once the largest freshwater lake in the USA outside of the Great lakes. Other towns built on its historic shores include Lemoore and Kettleman City.

Despite being on the edge of the ancient Tulare lakebed, the town is without access to safe drinking water, as high levels of arsenic are found in the municipal water supply. Locals are forced to drink, cook and bathe using bottled water or expose themselves to this hazard.

==History==
Alpaugh&#x27;s location (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell&#x27;s Island) was once either on an island or a narrow peninsula near the south end of the huge and rich Tulare Lake. A.J. Atwell was a Visalia attorney (and newspaper owner) who raised hogs on the island. The lake at different times supported a very large Native American population, a commercial fishery, herds of tule elk, countless game birds, and much more. The island was a regular port of call for the lake&#x27;s commercial ferry service. The last time the lake was brim full and overflowed into the San Joaquin River to the sea was 1878. Water diversions of its source waters have since caused the lake to shrink into the tiny remnant of today. Local efforts have been undertaken to increase the lake&#x27;s size for water storage and wildlife.

Los Angeles real estate developers, the &quot;California Home Extension Association&quot;, promoted, developed or founded Alpaugh, nearby Wasco, and several other California towns. It has also been referred to as &quot;W.H. Wilber&#x27;s Second Home Extension Coloney that purchased eight-thousand acres of land surrounding Alpaugh.&quot; Los Angeles newspaper articles of the time explained that they were not the original landowners. &quot;The California Home Extension association does not represent land owners; it has no lands of its own for sale.&quot;

In 1920 and 1921 both oil and large gas fields were found near Alpaugh.

<text>Exeter is a city in Tulare County, California, United States. It is situated in the San Joaquin Valley near the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The population was 10,321 at the 2020 census, down from 10,334 at the 2010 census.

Exeter is located on State Highway 65, south of Highway 198 and east of Highway 99.

==History==
Before the arrival of European settlers, Yokuts settled around an area in an oak forest two miles north of Exeter. The current town site was a plain that possessed elk, antelope, frogs, and deer. Rocky Hill, to the east of the city, offered shelter to native tribes when the plain flooded. Several caves on the hill contain petroglyphs, though some of the most important of these were destroyed by local vandals/looters and poorly managed and unsupervised steer.

The town site traces its roots to the construction of a railroad line through the San Joaquin Valley, by 1888 a line passed through the area. A representative of the Southern Pacific Railroad, D.W. Parkhurst, purchased the land from an early settler, John Firebaugh, and formed the town which he named after his own hometown of Exeter, England.

The damming of the Kaweah valley during the 1930s provided a reliable source of water for agriculture. Cattle ranching grew at the beginning of the 20th century, led by the Gill Cattle Company, which opened in the late 1800s and was once the largest such business in the United States. The town incorporated in 1911. In October 1929, Exeter was the site of a large Anti-Filipino race riot. A mob stormed a Filipino work camp, bludgeoning 50 Filipino laborers and burning their camp to the ground. This race-riot sparked a wave of Anti-Filipino hatred.

Professional artists depicting the history of the area have painted huge murals on exterior walls throughout the downtown area. There are currently 31 murals in this outdoor art gallery.

<text>Farmersville is a city in Tulare County, California, United States. It is situated in the San Joaquin Valley near the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, just to the east of Visalia, California. The population was 10,397 at the 2020 census, down from 10,588 at the 2010 census. The unofficial estimate in 2024 is a population of 12,000.

The city helps support many events throughout the year, including the Memorial Day Parade in May, which is well attended and manages to draw around 4,000 visitors from the surrounding area. In October a Fall Festival is held on the downtown boulevard. In December a Christmas Tree Lighting event is held at the Old Methodist Church building.

==History==
The history of Farmersville began in the 1850s. This early community was called Deep Creek, located near the present Deep Creek Cemetery. There are headstones that date back to the 1850s.

Farmersville&#x27;s first school was built there to accommodate the farm children in the area. In the Fly family history, which is preserved in a book written about their travels to California, there is talk about attending the Deep Creek School in the 1860s. It was located East of the Cemetery.

Until 1863, other residents living on the east side of the county traveled through Farmersville on the Visalia Road. They rode their horse-drawn wagons to get their mail, purchase supplies and bring their goods to sell. The trip was long, so many would stop at the Wiley Hinds farm, just south of present-day Farmersville, to ask to sleep in his barn and continue their trip home the next day. Wiley Hinds was a former slave, and came from Arkansas with his brother, Archibald, in 1858. He settled in Farmersville, purchased other parcels for farming, and became very prosperous.
In 1866 two entrepreneurs, John Crowley and his Uncle Merrill Jasper opened a large general store in Farmersville. They wanted to capture the sales of residents from the east side of the county, on their way to Visalia to get their mail. Unfortunately, they were not successful. In 1868 their nephew and also store manager Thomas J. Brundage, purchased the business from them. During this time the application for a post office and the name of the town were finally approved by the US Government. The store now became much more successful and eastern residents began to stop and pick up their mail. Mr. Brundage also had a lumber yard across the street from the general store. Oxen would pull the lumber shipment from the Sierra hills. Just east of the Brundage General Store was the Brown Hotel. It was constructed in 1870 for Edward Balaam and was later purchased by Charles Brown. The hotel was two stories and served meals to passengers during the horse changeover for the Overland Stage. Brown also owned the livery stable. The location of the Brundage General Merchandise store and the Brown Hotel is near what is now Sam&#x27;s Foods Supermarket (old Nickel&#x27;s Payless store), commemorated by a historic granite marker in the parking lot.
There was a large fire in 1910 that hit the corner of Visalia Rd and Farmersville Blvd. The Brundage General store received fire damage. The fire also burned a couple of other businesses and buildings and scorched the Methodist Church. This old wooden store was torn down sometime in the 1920&#x27;s. It was replaced with a Trading Post, it burned down in 1951 and replaced with a Texaco Gas Station, which later became a Beacon Gas station. Today it is an empty lot.

In 1910 Thomas J. Brundage&#x27;s son, Oscar G. Brundage, who took over the general store decided to build an additional store, this time made of brick. It was completed in December 1910. He continued working in the stores at least until the late 1920s. Later it became Dixon&#x27;s Grocery Store, owned by Floyd Dixon. After that, it became Ryan&#x27;s Grocery Store. In the 1940s it became a bar called the Frontier Club. It was finally destroyed in a fire in the 1960s. It sat on the Southeast corner of Visalia Rd and Farmersville Blvd, where Rainbow&#x27;s Drive In sits today.

In 1945 the town had voted to pay for its own police department. The town had one Police Officer on duty during this time. Before 1960, the town was under the authority of the County. Residents and Chamber of Commerce Officials worked with the County for their needs.

Discussion to incorporate started as early as 1945. Don Freeman began the petition and application process that lead to the city&#x27;s incorporation on October 5, 1960. The first city council was composed of James Tornow, Mayor, Truman Qualls, Don Freeman, Willis Freeman, and Jim Steven. Carl Waddle was the first City Clerk. Early on the City struggled to get proper water delivery and wastewater treatment. In 1968 the Wastewater treatment plant loan was made for $480,000 to build the first plant and transmission infrastructure. The city residents in 1968 seriously discussed dis-incorporation led by store owner Tom Bray.

==Church building history==

The building formerly serving as Farmersville Methodist Church was originally built in the 1870s in Goshen, California. After little usage there, the Visalia Methodist congregation purchased the church with the help of Farmersville church members in 1899-1900. The chapel was rolled into Farmersville on logs (pulled by horses). It was established on South Farmersville Boulevard just south of Visalia Road, also known as the &quot;Four Corners&quot;. The Founders of the early Farmersville Methodist Church were Thomas J Brundage, a Mr. Sims and Rev. G. E. Foster. Sometime around 1947 with a need for more parking, a new location was found when Mrs. Avery donated a parcel of her land. That new site was Avery Ave and Ash Street. During the move, the steeple broke and was rebuilt using fishtail shingles. In later years it became the Farmersville United Methodist Church and continued until March 2004. The Boys and Girls Club took over the building for a couple of years. In 2009 it found a new location and was moved to N Farmersville Boulevard and W. Front Street.

<text>Route 57 is a state highway located in Warren County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs from an interchange with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Lopatcong Township to an intersection with Route 182 and County Route 517 (CR 517) in Hackettstown. The route passes through mostly rural areas of farmland and mountains in Warren County. It also passes through Washington, where Route 57 crosses Route 31. The route is designated a scenic byway, the Warren Heritage Scenic Byway, by the state of New Jersey due to the physical environments it passes through as well as from historical sites along the way such as the Morris Canal.

The current alignment of Route 57 was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917. In 1927, Route 24 was designated along this route between the Phillipsburg area and Penwell in Mansfield Township while a spur of Route 24 called Route S24 replaced pre-1927 Route 12 between Penwell and US 46 in Hackettstown. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, the portion of Route S24 between Penwell and CR 517 in Hackettstown became a part of Route 24 to complete a gap in that route while Route S24 north of there became Route 57. A never-built segment of Route 57 running from the intersection of Route 24 and Route 57 to US 46 east of Hackettstown was legislated in 1965. Around 1970, Route 57 was designated along Route 24 west of Hackettstown while the portion of Route 57 in Hackettstown became Route 182.

==Route description==

Route 57 begins at an interchange with US 22 in Lopatcong Township, where the only movements possible here between the two highways are westbound Route 57 to westbound US 22 and vice versa. The road heads to the east on the Morris and Essex Turnpike, a two-lane undivided road. The route heads through a mix of businesses and farm fields, with the Washington Secondary rail line that is owned by Norfolk Southern and operated by the Dover and Delaware River Railroad paralleling the road to the south. The railroad line eventually runs farther to the south of Route 57 before the route crosses County Route 519 (Uniontown Road).

Past this intersection, the road heads northeast through farmland within the Pohatcong Creek valley, situated between Pohatcong Mountain to the south and Scotts Mountain to the north. It enters Greenwich Township, where the route crosses County Route 637 (Liberty Road/North Main Street) before passing through residential areas. Route 57 heads into farmland with intermittent residences, crossing into Franklin Township. The route continues to New Village, where residences become more dense. A short distance after the intersection with County Route 633 (Edison Road), Route 57 heads back into farm fields. The road reaches the residential community of Broadway, where it comes to a junction with County Route 643 (Asbury Broadway Road). Route 57 continues through agricultural areas with more residences and businesses, crossing into Washington Township, where it intersects County Route 648 (Little Philadelphia Road) and County Route 623 (Brass Castle Road).

Past this intersection, Route 57 enters Washington Borough, where it becomes Washington Avenue. Here, the road passes residences and businesses before heading into the commercial downtown of Washington. It crosses Route 31 and heads under a Dover and Delaware River Railroad line, passing through a mix of residences, businesses, and industrial establishments. It crosses back into Washington Township, where Route 57 becomes the Morris and Essex Turnpike again, crossing over the Washington Secondary rail line before intersecting County Route 630 (Washburn Avenue) and County Route 651 (McCullough Road) in Port Colden. From here, the road heads east into a mix of agricultural and residential areas with some businesses, entering Mansfield Township. Here, the route is known as the Admiral John D. Bulkeley Memorial Highway, named after Vice Admiral John D. Bulkeley, a United States Navy officer who served in World War II.

In Mansfield Township, the road passes through the residential community of Anderson and intersects County Route 632 (Anderson Road) and County Route 629 (Port Murray Road). From here, Route 57 turns northeast and parallels the Musconetcong River, heading through wooded areas around Upper Pohatcong Mountain with some farmland. In Stephensburg, the road passes through a wooded residential region and intersects County Route 652 (Watters Road). Past this intersection, the road continues alongside the wooded Musconetcong River, with residential and commercial development increasing past the Hazen Road intersection. Route 57 enters Hackettstown, where it becomes the Morris and Essex Turnpike before coming to its terminus at an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 182 and County Route 517, which continues south from this intersection as well as north along Route 182.

From milepost 2.07 () to its eastern terminus, Route 57 is designated a scenic byway, the Warren Heritage Scenic Byway, by the state of New Jersey due to its mountain and valley scenery, historic districts, and the adjacent Morris Canal, which was built in 1831 and had the greatest elevation change among all canals across the world.

==History==

The present-day alignment of Route 57 west of Penwell was built as a part of the Washington Turnpike, chartered in 1806 to run from Morristown to Phillipsburg. This road was later signed as part of the William Penn Highway in 1916, running from New York City to Pittsburgh. The whole of what is now Route 57 was legislated as a part of pre-1927 Route 12, a route that was designated to run from Paterson west to Phillipsburg in 1917. A stretch of the road in Franklin Township was the first concrete road built in New Jersey, having been constructed in 1912. The concrete was supplied by Thomas Edison&#x27;s Portland cement company and some of the original concrete is still in use on the road today. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 12 west of Penwell in Mansfield Township was legislated as a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark, while the portion between Penwell and U.S. Route 46 in Hackettstown was designated as Route S24, a spur of Route 24.
The portion of Route S24 between Penwell and County Route 517 in the southern part of Hackettstown (Route 57’s current eastern terminus) became part of mainline Route 24 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering in order to complete the gap that existed in that route between Penwell and Long Valley. The portion of Route S24 from this point north to U.S. Route 46 was designated as Route 57. In 1965, a portion of Route 57 was designated to bypass Hackettstown, running from its intersection with Route 24 to U.S. Route 46 east of Hackettstown; this was never built. Around 1970, Route 24 west of Hackettstown became part of Route 57 while the portion of Route 57 that had existed between Route 24 and U.S. Route 46 was designated Route 182.

In the 2000s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation worked with communities along Route 57 to create a land use and transportation plan for the area surrounding the route, as part of their Future In Transportation plan.

By Joint Resolution No. 5, approved August 13, 1997, the New Jersey Legislature designated Route 57 as the Admiral John D. Bulkeley Memorial Highway. Vice Admiral John D. Bulkeley, a decorated naval hero of World War II and the Korean War, grew up in Mansfield Township and was a graduate of Hackettstown High School.

In 1859, with his wife and two small daughters, and driving a small herd of cattle, walked more than from the coast near Sacramento, to a homestead along the Tule River, southwest of Lindsay. In the 1880s, Julius Orton homesteaded another () piece of land bordering on the property of pioneers Lewis and John Keeley, brothers who had taken on a homestead just a few miles southwest of Lindsay in the mid-1870s.

In 1889, the founder of the City of Lindsay, Captain Arthur Hutchinson, moved to California because of his ill health. He moved to the Lindsay area and bought to found the Lindsay Land Company.

<text>Pixley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tulare County, California, United States. The population was 3,310 at the 2010 census, up from 2,586 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The town began as a real-estate-speculation in 1884. The investors Darwin C. Allen, and William B. Bradbury knew their project would succeed only if the town was connected to the mainline of the Southern Pacific. They contacted Frank M. Pixley; a man whom they knew was a friend of Leland Stanford. In 1886, Pixley joined with the original investors as a partner in the Pixley Townsite Company. The company purchased additional land in the vicinity. When The Southern Pacific extended its tracks to the Townsite, the town prospered. The terms of sale for the land was 25% down, the rest to be carried back for three years by the owners at 8 percent interest. The partners made a handsome profit.
Special railroad fares were offered to people in other areas of California and as far away as Boston in order to bring potential customers to see the new lands and the investment possibilities near Pixley. 
The first house built in Pixley was for Emma, William Pixley&#x27;s widow, the late brother of Frank Pixley. Her three sons and daughter lived in the home. Emma bought a quarter section of an adjoining piece of land where she farmed until they moved back to San Francisco.
Frank Pixley advertised the town named after him in his biweekly journal &quot;The Argonaut&quot;.

In the early 1890s, Chris Evans and John Sontag robbed a Southern Pacific Railroad train at Pixley.

In 1933, Pixley was one of the towns in California involved in the San Joaquin cotton strike, a labor action by agricultural workers seeking higher wages. A violent clash between strikers and growers left two workers dead and eight wounded. Five thousand workers gathered in Tulare for the dead strikers&#x27; funerals, one of the largest agricultural demonstrations in California&#x27;s history. Eight cotton growers were indicted in the violence against the workers, but were later acquitted. The strike features in Steinbeck&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, coinciding with the arrival of the Joad family from Oklahoma.
