<text>Royal Lakes is a village in Macoupin County, Illinois, United States. The population was 167 at the 2020 census, down from 197 in 2010.

==Geography==
Royal Lakes is located at (39.1116990, -89.9606600) in Hillyard Township in southern Macoupin County. Royal Lakes lies at the southwestern corner of two intersecting roads, Illinois Route 16 and Illinois Route 159. The nearest large cities are St. Louis, approximately to the southwest, and Springfield, around northeast of the village.

According to the 2010 census, Royal Lakes has a total area of , of which are land and (or 8.98%) are water.

===Lakes===

Three small lakes – Meshach, Shad, and Shadrach – are located within the village of Royal Lakes.
* Meshach Lake is located in the east central portion of Royal Lakes. With an average depth of between , it is the deepest of the three lakes.
* Shad Lake covers approximately with a maximum depth of .
* Shadrach Lake is located north of Magnolia Drive and west of North Dogwood Drive. Its depth ranges from .
Shad Lake is an impoundment on Coop Branch, a northwest-flowing tributary of Macoupin Creek, while Meshach and Shadrach Lakes are built on separate tributaries of Coop Branch. The entire community is within the Illinois River watershed.

==History==
The site that would eventually become Royal Lakes was purchased by a Chicago developer in 1956. The tract was to be developed as a resort-style community. Three small lakes – Meshach, Shad, and Shadrach – were constructed for recreational purposes and the remaining land was divided into 2,435 lots, each measuring . Royal Lakes was marketed as an affordable resort location in a rural setting. The community was heavily promoted in the predominantly African American neighborhoods of St. Louis and East St. Louis. In 1957, the first families moved into Royal Lakes. A community church was organized in 1961, and the congregation moved into a permanent building seven years later.

Due to Royal Lakes&#x27; status as a &quot;resort&quot; area, a lack of zoning regulations meant that there had been no provisions for the developer to provide basic infrastructure. With no road maintenance, water supply, or proper sewage disposal, the overall quality of life for residents of the community deteriorated. By the early 1970s, residents agreed that the only way to improve conditions in the community was through incorporation. An incorporation election was held in October 1972. Of the 98 votes cast, 89 were in favor of incorporation and 9 opposed. Royal Lakes officially became the Village of Royal Lakes.

The village&#x27;s first mayor, Thomas J. Stoddard, and other members of the municipal government took office in April 1973.

<text>Staunton is the second largest city in Macoupin County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,054.

==History==

===Name origins===
A settler named Stanton bought land in the area and donated the land to a nearby village. The village decided to name the town Stanton after the original settler. An application for the town&#x27;s incorporation was sent to Washington DC where it was approved but misspelled as Staunton due to the name being similar to Staunton, Virginia.

===Early history===
In 1817, John Wood became the first colonial settler to settle in what is now downtown Staunton. The town slowly grew and by the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1859, had a schoolhouse, general store, a doctor&#x27;s office and a mill. Staunton grew with the introduction of the railroad and a coal mine in the 1860s. New immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Italy moved to Staunton, and the community soon became one of the largest cities in southern Illinois. The &quot;Staunton Star-Times&quot; started publication in 1878. In 1891, Staunton applied for city status and elected its first mayor, F. E. Godfrey.

==== Coal mining ====
Coal mining characterized the city for nearly a century. Henry Voge opened the first coal mine in 1869 (&quot;The Gin Shaft&quot;). Two large mounds of slag that rise from prairie farmland on the outskirts of Staunton tell much about the history and the present status of the small city. The size of the piles indicates many years of deep shaft coal production, while the weeded erosions indicate the tipples have been idle for years. Mining started here shortly before the Civil War. It ended shortly before World War II. When the shafts were operating, they provided most of the employment in the town.

Staunton Local 755 became the largest coal miners&#x27; union in the state. The Labor Temple was built in 1914 by the local union. The front doors of this fine structure opened onto an attractive lobby with a wide stairway to the second floor on the right and a ticket office centered between two entrances to a large auditorium which had a sloping floor, aisles between three sections of comfortable seats and in front a large, well-arranged stage. This auditorium had the first air conditioning system to be found anywhere within thirty-five miles of Staunton. From Tuesday through Sunday it was a theatre showing first-run movies for many years. The musical film &quot; Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot; gave inspiration to local high school students in writing the Staunton High School fight song &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Fight.&quot; The first Monday of each month the Miners Union held their meeting there. The other Mondays could be booked for graduations, dramatic or musical productions by local groups, speakers, etc. Upstairs were toilet facilities, several small conference or committee meeting rooms, and a large hall where lodges met and dances and receptions could be held.

The last coal mine in Staunton closed in 1951.

===20th century===

In the 1920s, Staunton accomplished the building of several notable institutions such as Lake Staunton, Staunton Community High School and the Staunton Fire Department. Staunton&#x27;s population reached at all-time high during the 1920s. In 1941 the treasury department approved for a mural to be painted in the Staunton Post Office. The mural is &quot;Going to Work&quot; (Ralf Henrikson, completed 1941). It was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Silver Lining&quot;, about federal-sponsored art projects in Illinois during the Great Depression.

In the 1950s, the Illinois Traction system ran its last passenger train through Staunton, leading to a substantial decline in business in the area. Interstate 55 was built in 1956 and bypassed the historic Route 66 that passed through staunton cementing the continued decline of Staunton. In 1959, Staunton celebrated its 100th anniversary.

====1918 Staunton Riot====
Beginning on February 12, 1918, Staunton experienced two days of mob vigilantism and rioting that gained attention nationwide. Two men were tarred and feathered, with scores of others forced to kiss the American flag and sign loyalty pledges. The demonstration was initiated by members of the United Mine Workers, Local Union 755, who decided to &quot;Americanize&quot; the city through vigilante tactics.
The riot began at 9 p.m. at a meeting of Local Union 755 at Labor Temple, where a $100 donation was being ratified to help defend Severino Oberdan from a previous charge of seditious talk that violated the Espionage Act. Oberdan&#x27;s lawyer, John L. Metzen, had been summoned from Chicago by telegram to attend, but after being barred entrance went to his hotel. After Oberdan was accused of being an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World, a fight broke out, with twenty members of a newly deputized police force (the &quot;American Vigilantes&quot;) charging the hall and handcuffing Oberdan. Metzen was seized from the hotel lobby, and he was clubbed by police before being marched down a dark street where he was stripped and a bucket of tar poured over his head. Both men were driven to the outskirts of Staunton where they were pointed in opposite directions and told not to return.

Working under the direction of the American Protective League, the mob of men and women was reported to be as large as 400 persons, many of whom began storming homes of suspected pro-Germans and IWW supporters. They were dragged from their homes to a stand where, under threat of being tarred, they were forced to kiss the American flag and sign a pledge of loyalty. These actions were continued into the early morning and resumed the next day. More than 100 homes were visited, including that of former County Clerk William C. Seehausen, who was forced to kiss the flag next to a boiling pot of tar. Brothers Harry and John Mlekush were socialists who had flown the red flag from their home, but were forced to replace it with a U.S. flag and sing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

The police did nothing to stop the attacks, claiming citizens were exercising their patriotic duty during a special emergency. Chief of Police Benjamin G. Volentine stated, &quot;No official report of a disturbance has been made to me. The only report I have received is that there are a lot more Americans in Staunton today than there was yesterday.&quot; Nine alleged &quot;pro-Germans&quot; were arrested on February 13.

Metzen claimed he had walked naked for three hours before being helped by some farmers who gave him clothing. When he returned to Chicago the Chicago Bar Association moved that he be disbarred for unprofessional conduct. Oberdan made it to Worden, Illinois, where he was treated by a physician. Two months later U.S. Marshal Vincent Y. Dallman reported 82 &quot;German alien enemies&quot; living in Staunton. In May the Staunton Vigilance Corps of the State Council of Defense posted signs that demanded that only English be spoken in public. The German language was also dropped from the curriculum at Zion.

The area press gave enthusiastic support to the actions. The &quot;Staunton Star-Times&quot; announced that &quot;the members of Local Union 755 [were] to be heartily congratulated on what they accomplished.&quot; Other district papers not only supported them but implied that such actions were required elsewhere in the area. The &quot;Mt. Olive Herald&quot; congratulated the vigilantes and issued a warning: &quot;To Staunton belongs the honor of being first in the county in a real loyalty demonstration...In the future, anyone with pro-German tendencies will do well to keep their mouths shut.&quot; &quot;The Gillespie News&quot; commended the citizens and explained that while &quot;we are not believers in mob violence...under the existing circumstances we are for it, and every man who took part in the Staunton demonstration should be given a medal.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commended the crowd for its &quot;zealous Americanism&quot;. The governor of Illinois, Frank Orren Lowden, also supported what the local union did. &quot;The people in Staunton who took the ‘Pros to a cleaning are not mobs...They were the best citizens that can be found in the great state of ours.&quot;

===Population of Staunton and nearby cities and villages===

†No census data gathered for Livingston in 1900, since it was not yet incorporated.

As the above data shows, Staunton experienced quite robust growth in the early part of the 20th century. Compared to other cities/villages in the area, Staunton has held its own relatively speaking. While standouts such as Edwardsville have continued to experience robust growth even to this day, Staunton&#x27;s modest growth is favorable when compared to neighboring Livingston.

==Governance==
The city of Staunton is split into four wards in order to maximize efficiency in civic maintenance and representation. The city is divided into its east and west by Union Street and into its north and south by Main Street. The first, second, third, and fourth wards are in the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest corners respectively. Each ward is represented on the city council by two alderman, one serving a four-year term, and one serving a two-year term.

<doc id="111575" wikidata="Q578507" url="?curid=111575" title="Virden, Illinois">
<text>Virden is a city in Macoupin and Sangamon counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 3,231 at the 2020 census.

The Macoupin County portion of Virden is part of the St. Louis, Missouri–Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Sangamon County portion is part of the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Virden was the scene of an 1898 coal miners&#x27; strike, during which Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones played a major role.

==History==
Virden sits atop a large seam of coal. After the 1850s, when the Chicago and Alton Railroad was completed, it became possible to mine Virden coal and ship it long distances for a profit. Throughout the second half of the 1800s, Virden prospered and grew as a coal-mining town.

A bitter coal strike broke out in 1898. The Chicago-Virden Coal Company, fearing loss of key business in Chicago, refused to allow its Virden mines to be unionized, nor would it pay the nonunionized miners union-scale wages. Instead, the coal company built a timber stockade around its mine head, adjoining the railroad tracks, and hired African-Americans from Southern states as coal miners. The Chicago-Virden Company knew that African-Americans, who were attempting to escape Jim Crow labor conditions, would not request union-scale wages. Instead, the company promised to pay their new workers by the ton. The new miners were promised only 30 cents per ton of coal mined.

The appearance of the African-American miners infuriated the strikers. They were motivated by racism, by labor solidarity, and by the desire to create decent lives for their own families. Some of the striking coal miners were themselves African-American, and black coal miners who were union members in good standing were apparently accepted by their unionized white comrades. However, this acceptance did not extend to strikebreakers.

===Battle of Virden===
On October 12, 1898, a northbound train, loaded with potential strikebreaking miners, pulled into Virden and stopped on the tracks just outside the minehead stockade. The mine manager and train operator, knowing there would be trouble, had reinforced the train with a troop of security guards, armed with Winchester rifles. It soon became clear that the security guards had been either ordered, or allowed, to shoot to kill. As the strikers attempted to surround the train, the guards opened fire.

As a gun battle broke out in and around the strikebreakers&#x27; train, there were dead and wounded on both sides. Of the thirteen dead, six were security guards. Furthermore, had the strikers won the battle, their intentions toward the Alabama strikebreakers were not friendly. After twenty minutes of firing on both sides, the train&#x27;s engineer accepted defeat and the engine and part of the train pulled away from the minehead and continued northward to Springfield. 
A monument in the Virden town square commemorates the coal strike of 1898 and the battle of October 12 that was its bitter end. The monument contains a large bronze bas-relief that includes the names of those killed, and a copy of a mendacious recruiting handbill distributed by the Chicago-Virden Company in Birmingham, Alabama, to recruit the African-American miners. The body of the bas-relief is made of symbolic representations of the Chicago &amp; Alton tracks and the assault on the strikers. The guards are shown pointing their Winchesters at the strikers and their families. Atop the bas-relief is a bronze portrait of Mary Harris Jones (&quot;Mother Jones&quot;), who is buried in nearby Mount Olive.

==Geography==
Most of the city lies in the northeast corner of Macoupin County, with a small portion extending north into Sangamon County. In the 2000 census, 3,378 of the city&#x27;s 3,488 residents (96.8%) lived in Macoupin County and 110 (3.2%) lived in Sangamon County.

<doc id="111579" wikidata="Q443852" url="?curid=111579" title="Alton, Illinois">
<text>Alton ( ) is a city on the Mississippi River in Madison County, Illinois, United States, about north of St. Louis, Missouri. The population was 25,676 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the River Bend area in the Metro-East region of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area. 

It is well known for its limestone bluffs along the river north of the city. It&#x27;s the former location of an historical state penitentiary, and played a significant role preceding and during the American Civil War. It was the site of the last Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas debate in October 1858. The former state penitentiary in Alton was used during the Civil War to hold up to 12,000 Confederate prisoners of war.

==History==

Although Alton once was growing faster than the nearby city of St. Louis, a coalition of St. Louis businessmen planned to build a competing town to stop Alton&#x27;s expansion and bring business to St. Louis. The resulting town was Grafton, Illinois.

Many blocks of housing in Alton were built in the Victorian Queen Anne style. They represent a prosperous period in the river city&#x27;s history. At the top of the hill in the commercial area, several stone churches and a fine city hall also represent the city&#x27;s wealth during its good times based on river traffic, manufacturing, and shipping. It was a commercial center for a large agricultural area. Numerous residences on hills have sweeping views of the Mississippi River.

===Early history===
The Alton area was home to Native Americans for thousands of years before the 19th-century founding by European Americans of the modern city. Historic accounts indicate occupation of this area by the Illinois Confederation at the time of European contact. Earlier native settlement is demonstrated by archaeological artifacts and the famous prehistoric Piasa bird painted on a cliff face nearby. The image was described in 1673 by French missionary priest Father Jacques Marquette.

===19th century===
Alton was developed as a river town in January 1818 by Rufus Easton, who named it after his son. Easton ran a passenger ferry service across the Mississippi River to the Missouri shore. Alton is located amid the confluence of three navigable rivers: the Illinois, the Mississippi, and the Missouri. Alton grew into a river trading town with an industrial character. The city rises steeply from the waterfront, where massive concrete grain silos and railroad tracks were constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries to store and ship the area&#x27;s grains and produce. Brick commercial buildings are spread throughout downtown. Once the site of several brick factories, Alton has an unusually high number of streets still paved in brick. The lower levels of Alton are subject to floods, many of which have inundated the historic downtown area. The dates of different flood levels are marked on the large grain silos, part of the Ardent Mills, near the Argosy Casino at the waterfront. The flood of 1993 is considered the worst of the last century.

Alton became an important town for abolitionists, as Illinois was a free state, separated from the slave state of Missouri only by the Mississippi River. Pro-slavery activists also lived there and slave catchers often raided the city. Escaped slaves would cross the river to seek shelter in Alton, and proceed to safer places through stations of the Underground Railroad. During the years before the American Civil War, several homes were equipped with tunnels and hiding places for stations on the Underground Railroad to aid slaves escaping to the North. On November 7, 1837, the abolitionist printer Reverend Elijah P. Lovejoy was murdered by a pro-slavery mob while he tried to protect his Alton-based press from being destroyed for the third time. He had moved from St. Louis because of opposition there. He had printed many abolitionist tracts and distributed them throughout the area. When one of the mob made a move to set the old warehouse on fire, Lovejoy, armed with only a pistol, went outside to try to stop him. The pro-slavery man shot him dead (with a shotgun, five rounds through the midsection). The mob stormed the warehouse and threw Lovejoy&#x27;s printing press into the Mississippi. Lovejoy thus became the first martyr of the abolition movement.

Alton became the seat of a diocese of the Catholic Church in 1857. Its first bishop was French-born Henry Damian Juncker. The new diocese had 58 churches, 18 priests, and 50,000 Catholics. When he died, 11 years later, the churches were 125, the priests more than 100, and the Catholics 80,000. He was succeeded by Peter Joseph Baltes from Germany (1869–1886) and James Ryan (1888–1923). In 1923 the bishop&#x27;s seat was moved to Springfield, Illinois. The Diocese of Alton, no longer a residential bishopric, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. Titular bishops appointed to the see have been John Clayton Nienstedt, and Josu Iriondo.

On October 15, 1858, Alton was the site of the seventh Lincoln-Douglas debate. A memorial at the site in downtown Alton features oversized statues of Lincoln and Douglas, as they would have appeared during the debate. Congressional representatives came to Alton when they drafted the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, to permanently end slavery throughout the Union. Alton resident and US Senator Lyman Trumbull, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, co-wrote the Thirteenth Amendment. His Alton home, the Lyman Trumbull House, is a National Historic Monument.

Just two weeks into the American Civil War, Alton played a role in the infamous Camp Jackson Affair, which led to the eviction of Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson from office. The State of Missouri&#x27;s neutrality was tested in a conflict over the St. Louis Arsenal. The Federal Government reinforced the Arsenal&#x27;s tiny garrison with several detachments, including a force from the 2nd Infantry under Captain Nathaniel Lyon. Concerned by widespread reports that Governor Jackson intended to use the Missouri Volunteer Militia to attack the Arsenal and capture its 39,000 small arms, Secretary of War Simon Cameron ordered Lyon (by that time in acting command) to evacuate the majority of the arms to Illinois. 21,000 guns were secretly evacuated to Alton on the evening of April 29, 1861.

The first penitentiary in Illinois was built in Alton. While only a corner of it within a few blocks of the river remains, it once extended nearly to &quot;Church Hill&quot;. During the American Civil War, Union forces used it to hold prisoners of war, and some 12,000 Confederates were held there. During the smallpox epidemic of 1863–1864, an estimated 1500–2200 men died. A Confederate mass grave on the north side of Alton holds many of the dead from the epidemic and a memorial marks the site. Often when Confederate prisoners escaped, they tried to cross the Mississippi River back to the slave state of Missouri.

===20th century===
Alton native Robert Pershing Wadlow, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s tallest man at 8 feet 11.1 inches tall, 2.72 m, is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in the area known as Upper Alton. The earth over his grave was raised so visitors can compare its length to other graves. A memorial to him, including a life-sized statue and a replica of his chair, stands on College Avenue, across from the Southern Illinois University Dental School (formerly Shurtleff College).

The Sisters of St Francis of the Martyr St George have their American province motherhouse in Alton.

In 1937 two commercial fishermen from Alton caught a bull shark in the Mississippi River. Late that summer they had realized something was troubling their wood and mesh traps. Concluding that it was a fish, they built a strong wire trap and baited it with chicken guts. The next morning, they caught the 5-foot 84-pound shark, which they displayed in the Calhoun Fish Market, where it attracted crowds for days.

World War II saw a group of seven brothers join the military and variously became decorated veterans. Among these were Millard Glen Gray, who was decorated by Douglas MacArthur, and Neil Gray, who received the Silver Star.

In 1954, the city of Alton was named as one of three finalists for the location of the new United States Air Force Academy. Alton lost to the winning site of Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Because of Alton&#x27;s location at the Mississippi River, the Great Flood of 1993 with its high water levels caused severe damage to the city. Alton&#x27;s water supply was cut off due to flooding, and townspeople had to be supplied with bottled water for more than three weeks. Many local businesses, including Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, donated funds to help the people of Alton.

The original bridge connecting Alton with West Alton, Missouri, was a two-lane (one in each direction) bridge that had become a hazard for motorists and a hindrance for emergency vehicles. The northernmost bridge in the St. Louis metropolitan area, it was torn down in the 1990s. The current Clark Bridge, with two lanes of divided traffic in each direction, plus two bike lanes, opened in 1994. Work had proceeded during the Great Flood of 1993. The award-winning cable-stayed design was done by Hanson Engineers of Springfield, Illinois. Pieces of cables identical to those of the bridge were handed out in educational settings all over the city to allow the city&#x27;s children to &quot;take home a piece of the bridge&quot;. The complex work of construction of the bridge, in which engineers had to deal with the strong river current, barge traffic and the 1993 flood, was featured in the documentary &quot;Super Bridge&quot; on &quot;Nova&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2021, voters in the city elected David Goins as Alton&#x27;s first black mayor.

==Geography==
Alton is located on the Mississippi River above the mouth of the Missouri River. Most of Alton is located on bluffs overlooking the river valley. The Meeting of the Great Rivers National Scenic Byway runs along the Alton riverfront. A monument and observatory tower, Confluence Tower, located next to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers in neighboring Hartford, IL, has been constructed to provide an overview of the Great Rivers area. This point also marks the beginning of the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition. Also on the river at Alton is Lock and Dam 26, the newest and busiest lock and dam complex on the main channel of the Mississippi River. Adjacent to it on the Illinois side is the , which features tours of the dam itself several times per day. On the Missouri side is the Audubon Center at Riverlands, which is one of the best places in the world to view birds, as it lies near where the Mississippi Flyway merges the flight paths of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri rivers. Also adjacent to the Audubon Center is the Jones-Confluence Point State Park, where one can stand at the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.

According to the 2010 census, Alton has a total area of , of which (or 92.44%) is land and (or 7.56%) is water.

The National Great Rivers Museum is located at the new Lock and Dam No. 26, or Melvin Price Locks and Dam. The lock and dam are open for tours. The lock is a favorite spot to watch bald eagles, which feed on fish coming up in waters below the dam. A large bird sanctuary is located in an area of floodplain and wetlands on the west side of the river.

The River Road goes right next to the river north to Grafton. Above that, it is often routed inland of the floodplain. It provides views of the dramatic contrast between the high cliffs of the Illinois side to the broad, flat, green agricultural countryside of Portage des Sioux, Missouri. The Great River Road is a popular bicycle touring route. Hidden in a notch of the cliff is the tiny village of Elsah, once a down-and-dirty, liquor-soaked tugboaters&#x27; retreat, now with renovated properties and antique shops in historic houses.

==Economy==

In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Alton became a town of heavy industry and manufacturing. Laclede Steel established major steel manufacturing operations in the town. Local industry also includes Cope Plastics and Hanley Industries. Alton was home to once-thriving, now defunct, industries such as the Owens-Illinois Glass Bottle Works and Alton Box Board Company (a maker of all types of cardboard boxes for all types of uses).

Restructuring in the industry in the mid-20th century led Alton to create a new future. It has facilities for corporate and vacation retreats and it has transitioned into a popular tourist destination. Alton&#x27;s location and historical heritage make it a popular destination for antique shopping, touring historic areas, and gambling aboard the Argosy Casino. Other Greater Alton attractions include Alton Marina; nine golf courses, including Spencer T. Olin, the only Arnold Palmer-designed and -managed course in Illinois or the St. Louis Metropolitan area; fine dining and night life; and a large selection of bed-and-breakfasts and guest houses.

Some visitors come to explore the natural environment of the area. A designated bikeway extends for miles north of town along the Mississippi River and below the limestone bluffs; its relatively flat grade and passage through tree-shaded areas makes it an easy ride for families. During the migration seasons, Alton is a destination for birdwatchers along the Mississippi Flyway; winter visitors come to see the bald eagles that roost on the Illinois limestone bluffs and feed on fish in the river. It is the area of the Meeting of the Great Rivers National Scenic Byway. A few miles to the north is Père Marquette State Park, with a WPA-era lodge and attractions including trails for hikers and riders, and horses for hire.

On January 28, 2010, Illinois was selected for a $1.2 billion federal award to bring high-speed passenger rail service to Illinois by 2015–2017. Alton has been selected as a station stop on a line running from St. Louis to Chicago, and opened on September 13, 2017.

Alton won the Small Business Revolution: Main Street contest and got a $100,000 boost to its community.

<text>Bethalto is a village in Madison County, Illinois, United States. Bethalto, like the rest of Madison County, is part of the Illinois Metro East portion of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.

Early in its history, the village was a railway town along the Terre Haute and Alton Railroad. In the 19th century, industry in the town included milling of grain from local farms and coal mining. In the early 20th century, the railroad was rerouted to go through nearby Edwardsville. By the mid 20th century, the rail industry had pulled out entirely and the village became known as a bedroom town.

At the 2020 census, the population of Bethalto was 9,310.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
The name &quot;Bethalto&quot; is commonly believed to be derived from Bethel (the original name of the town) and nearby Alton. The name &quot;Bethel&quot; came from the first church located in the area, with the Post Office Department requiring it to change its name to avoid confusion with the Clay County village of Bethel.

=== Early history ===
Before pioneering American settlers arrived, there were numerous Native Americans in the area, and Kickapoo villages lined nearby Indian Creek. In 1804, a man named Thomas Rattan arrived in the area from Ohio and established the first pioneer settlement, often referred to in those days as &quot;Rattan&#x27;s Prairie&quot;. The town was laid out by Joel U. Starkey, with the town plat being recorded June 23, 1854.

=== Milling industry ===
In the late 1800s, the principal industry of Bethalto was milling. In 1859, the President Mill and Elevator Company was established by James Neimrich. The company was bought, sold and expanded various times over the years, eventually coming into the ownership of John W. Kaufman in 1881. In either 1895 or 1896, the flour mill was destroyed in a fire. Kauffman declined to rebuild the mill, instead opting to purchase the Eagle flour mill of St. Louis. The loss of the mill had a profound impact on the village. In 1890, the population of Bethalto was 879. By 1900, it had fallen to 477 and in 1910 the population of the village was just 447.

=== 1996 plane crash ===
On June 19, 1996, a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet crashed into a home, shortly after taking off from St. Louis Regional Airport. The plane originally belonged to the US Navy, but had been leased back to the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas. A spokesperson for McDonnell Douglass said the pilot had been practicing for an air show the next week in the Czech Republic. One eyewitness stated, &quot;He started doing an outside roll ... and when he got to the top of the roll something went wrong; he stalled or something. He started coming down, and I lost him behind some trees. Then I heard a thump―not an explosion, just a loud thump―and I knew what&#x27;d happened.&quot;

=== Red Barn ===
A longtime landmark just north of Bethalto was an old barn at the intersection of Culp Lane and Bethalto Road, known to residents as simply &quot;the red barn&quot;. On July 26, 2012, the owner of the barn was spraying insecticides inside the barn to kill wasps. After spraying for wasps, the owner left and at some point a fire broke out. Fosterburg, Bethalto and Brighton volunteer fire departments responded to the blaze, but it was too late to save the structure. It was believed the barn had been there for around a hundred years. Often, residents would give directions based on the red barn.

== Governance ==
Bethalto was incorporated in 1869 under a special charter, and later incorporated again in 1873 under Illinois general law. The village is governed by an elected village president and a board of village trustees, who are elected at-large.

The park consists of a walking path, band stand, lighted tennis courts, baseball fields, and a basketball court. The Bethalto Homecoming is held at the park every year.

=== Bethalto Arboretum ===
Adjacent to Central Park is the Bethalto Arboretum. This arboretum was developed in 1966 on former railroad property, much like Central Park. A directory of trees and bushes contained in the arboretum may be viewed in the mayor&#x27;s and clerk&#x27;s offices. There are also many plaques, in memory of Bethalto&#x27;s notable persons, placed next to many of the trees in the park. A set of rail wheels on top of a short slab of railroad track lie in the center of the park. The short piece of track remains in its original position as part of the old railroad tracks that existed to transport coal to and from the area. In April 2021, the arboretum was recognized with ArbNet accreditation. A time capsule was buried at the dedication ceremony, and a commemorative plaque sits at the entrance.

The Indians, the Bethalto Legion team, also calls the complex home.

=== Southside Park ===
Southside Park (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;) is located on the south side of town in the Chateaux residential area. The complex consists of four lighted diamonds with a concession stand in the center.

<doc id="111581" wikidata="Q577845" url="?curid=111581" title="Collinsville, Illinois">
<text>Collinsville is a city located mainly in Madison County and partially in St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 24,366. Collinsville is approximately east of St. Louis, Missouri, and is part of that city&#x27;s Metro East area.

Collinsville is the location of Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, a National Historic Landmark and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This prehistoric urban complex is estimated to have had a population of thousands at its peak, long before European exploration in the area. The city is also known for the Brooks Catsup Bottle Water Tower, the world&#x27;s largest ketchup bottle, and is billed as the world&#x27;s horseradish capital.

==History==

Cahokia, the largest Pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, was developed by the Mississippian culture and is located in what is now the westernmost part of Collinsville. At its peak about 1200 CE, Cahokia had a population of 20,000-30,000, more than any city in the present-day United States until after 1800. It includes Monks Mound, the largest prehistoric earthwork in the Americas, and more than 70 surviving smaller mounds. Monks Mound is larger at its base than the Great Pyramid of Giza.

During the French colonial era of its Illinois Country, a group of French Catholic monks had a settlement on Monks Mound, after whom it was later named. They cultivated agriculture on the terraces of the mound. They traded with bands of the historic Illini, who had migrated into the area after the peak of the Mississippian culture.

Collinsville was subsequently settled by the Cook family and by a group of German-American settlers who arrived by Conestoga wagon in 1812 from Pennsylvania. They founded Holy Cross Lutheran Church. They also had a hardware store, though they were mainly farmers. Within five or six years, a number of other settlers arrived and began to organize the legal work required to form a town on the site. These original settlers are all buried in the Cook Cemetery or the Old Lutheran Cemetery. Other early settlers are buried in the Old German Cemetery near Sugarloaf Road near Maryville.

During World War I, a Collinsville mob, composed mostly of local coal miners, lynched a German immigrant, the only such wartime murder in the country. On April 5, 1918, the mob numbering up to 300 men took Robert Prager from his home and paraded him through the streets barefoot and wrapped in an American flag, forcing him to sing patriotic songs. Collinsville police interceded and took Prager into protective custody. The mob was later mistakenly allowed to search city hall, and two men found Prager hiding in the basement. They took Prager outside and the mob marched him to the outskirts of town, along the St. Louis Road, where they lynched him. His final request was to be buried in the American flag. Eleven men stood trial for the murder, but all were acquitted on June 1, 1918.

Several historical buildings survive in Collinsville. Built in 1885, the City Hall is still used today. It was built on property originally owned by the Collins family. The building features Italianate architecture with window crowns. A short, half-block walk from City Hall is the former State Bank of Collinsville at the corner of Center and Main streets. Designed in 1916 by architect Robert G. Kirsch, this structure features a limestone exterior and marble interior walls. To the west on Main Street, the Collinsville Public Library is a colonial-style brick building with an inviting circular stone walkway; the first section was completed in 1937. Additional wings were added in 1967 and 1980.

<text>Wonder Woman is a superheroine created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter in 1941 for DC Comics. Marston&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character&#x27;s appearance. She is one of the first superheroes of DC comics and is one of the strongest superheroes of all time.

Wonder Woman appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 published October 21, 1941 with her first feature in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 in January 1942. The &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously ever since. In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity, Diana Prince.

Wonder Woman&#x27;s most enduring origin story dates from the Golden Age of Comic Books, which relays that she was sculpted from clay by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, and given a life as an Amazon along with superhuman powers as gifts from the Greek gods. Other retellings variously expand on this, making her a demigod the biological child of Zeus and Hippolyta. The character has -also changed in her depiction over the decades, including briefly losing her powers entirely in the late 1960s; by the 1980s, artist George Perez gave her an athletic look and emphasized her Amazonian heritage. She possesses an arsenal of magical items, including the Lasso of Truth, a pair of indestructible bracelets, a tiara which serves as a projectile, and, in older stories, a range of devices based on Amazon technology.

Wonder Woman&#x27;s character was created during World War II; the character in the story was initially depicted fighting Axis forces as well as an assortment of colorful supervillains, although over time her stories came to place greater emphasis on characters, deities, and monsters from Greek mythology. Many stories depicted Wonder Woman freeing herself from bondage, which counterpointed the &quot;damsels in distress&quot; trope that was common in comics during the 1940s. In the decades since her debut, Wonder Woman has gained a cast of enemies bent on destroying her, including classic villains such as Ares, Circe, Doctor Poison, Giganta, Blue Snowman, Doctor Cyber, along with more recent adversaries such as Veronica Cale and the First Born, and her archenemy Cheetah. Wonder Woman has also regularly appeared in comic books featuring the superhero teams Justice Society (1941) and Justice League (1960).
The character is an archetypical figure in popular culture recognized worldwide, partly due to being widely adapted into television, film, animation, merchandise, and toys. October 21 is Wonder Woman Day, commemorating the release of her first appearance in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #8 (except 2017, which held the day on June 3 to tie in with the release of the film of the same name).

Wonder Woman has been featured in various media, from radio to television and film, and appears in merchandise sold worldwide, such as apparel, toys, dolls, jewelry, and video games. Shannon Farnon, Susan Eisenberg, Maggie Q, Lucy Lawless, Keri Russell, Rosario Dawson, Cobie Smulders, Rachel Kimsey, and Stana Katic, among others, have provided the character&#x27;s voice for animated adaptations. Wonder Woman has been depicted in film and television by Linda Harrison, Cathy Lee Crosby, Lynda Carter, Megan Gale, Adrianne Palicki, and in the DC Extended Universe films by Gal Gadot.

==Publication history==
===Creation===

In an October 1940 interview with the &quot;Family Circle&quot; magazine, William Moulton Marston discussed the unfulfilled potential of the comic book medium. This article caught the attention of comics publisher Max Gaines, who hired Marston as an educational consultant for National Periodicals and All-American Publications, two of the companies that would merge to form DC Comics. At that time, Marston wanted to create his own new superhero; Marston&#x27;s wife and fellow psychologist Elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman:

Marston introduced the idea to Gaines. Given the go-ahead, Marston developed &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, whom he believed to be a model of that era&#x27;s unconventional, liberated woman. Marston also drew inspiration from the bracelets worn by Olive Byrne, who lived with the couple in a polyamorous relationship. Wonder Woman debuted in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (cover date Dec/Jan 1941/1942, released in October 1941), scripted by Marston. Marston was the creator of a systolic-blood-pressure-measuring apparatus, which was crucial to the development of the polygraph (lie detector). Marston&#x27;s experience with polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest than men in certain situations and could work more efficiently.

Marston designed Wonder Woman to be an allegory for the ideal love leader; the kind of woman who he believed should run society. &quot;Frankly, Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, I believe, should rule the world&quot;, Marston wrote.

In a 1943 issue of &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, Marston wrote:

Marston was an outspoken feminist, polyamorist, and firm believer in the superiority of women. He described bondage and submission as a &quot;respectable and noble practice&quot;. Marston wrote in a weakness for Wonder Woman, which was attached to a fictional stipulation that he dubbed &quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Law&quot;, that made the chaining of her &quot;Bracelets of Submission&quot; together by a man take away her Amazonian super strength.

Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return Steve Trevora United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons&#x27; isolated island homelandto &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot; and to fight crime and the evil of the Nazis.

During this period, Wonder Woman joined the Justice Society of America as the team&#x27;s secretary.

===Silver Age===

During the Silver Age of the 1960s, under writer Robert Kanigher, Wonder Woman&#x27;s origin was revamped, along with other characters&#x27;. The new origin story increased the character&#x27;s and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become as &quot;beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, strong as Hercules, and swift as Hermes.&quot;

At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of Mike Sekowsky, Wonder Woman surrendered her powers to remain in Man&#x27;s World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman was always Diana Prince and opens a mod boutique. She acquires a Chinese mentor named I Ching, who teaches Diana martial arts and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology. This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller &quot;The Avengers&quot; and Diana Rigg&#x27;s portrayal of Emma Peel.

===Bronze Age===

In the early 1970s the character returned to her superhero roots in the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; and to the World War II era in her own title. This, however, was ultimately due to the popularity of the TV series at the time also having Wonder Woman set in the WWII era, and was shifted back to the 1970s era once the TV show did the same.

With a new decade arriving, DC president Jenette Kahn ordered a revamp in Wonder Woman&#x27;s appearance. Artist Milton Glaser, who also designed the &quot;bullet&quot; logo adopted by DC in 1977, created a stylized &quot;WW&quot; emblem that evoked and replaced the eagle in her bodice and debuted in 1982. The emblem in turn was incorporated by studio letterer Todd Klein onto the monthly title&#x27;s logo, which lasted for a year and a half before being replaced by a version from Glaser&#x27;s studio. The series was canceled with issue #329 (February 1986) written by Gerry Conway, depicting Steve Trevor&#x27;s marriage to Wonder Woman.

===Modern Age===

Following the 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; series, George Pérez, Len Wein, and Greg Potter rewrote the character&#x27;s origin story, depicting Wonder Woman as an emissary and ambassador from Themyscira to Patriarch&#x27;s World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Pérez incorporated a variety of deities and concepts from Greek mythology in Wonder Woman&#x27;s stories and origin. His rendition of the character acted as the foundation for the modern Wonder Woman stories, as he expanded upon the widely accepted origin of Diana being birthed out of clay. The relaunch was a critical and commercial success.

===21st century===
====2010s====

In August 2010 (issue #600), J. Michael Straczynski took over the series&#x27; writing duties and introduced Wonder Woman to an alternate timeline created by the Gods in which Paradise Island had been destroyed and the Amazons scattered around the world. In this timeline, Diana is an orphan raised in New York. The entire world has forgotten Wonder Woman&#x27;s existence and the main story of this run was of Diana trying to restore reality even though she does not properly remember it herself. A trio of Death Goddesses called The Morrigan acted as the main enemy of Wonder Woman. In this run, Wonder Woman wears a new costume designed by Jim Lee. Straczynski determined the plot and continued writing duties until &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #605; writer Phil Hester then continued his run, which ultimately concluded in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #614.

In 2011&#x27;s The New 52, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of publications to attract a new generation of readers, and thus released volume 4 of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic book title. Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang were assigned writing and art duties respectively and revamped the character&#x27;s history considerably. In this new continuity, Wonder Woman wears a costume similar to her original Marston costume (except with a red-black-silver color scheme rather than the classic red-blue-gold), uses a sword and shield, and has a completely new origin. No longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, she is, instead, a demi-goddess and the natural-born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus. Azzarello and Chiang&#x27;s revamp of the character was critically acclaimed, but highly divisive among longtime fans of the character.

In 2016, DC Comics once again relaunched all of its publications as part of the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; continuity reboot, and the new fifth volume of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; was released semi-monthly with writer Greg Rucka. This fifth volume of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; is part of the &quot;DC Universe&quot;, the current continuity established after Rebirth. Initially, the new series does not use a regular storyline that exists between each issue; instead two separate storylines share the book, with an installment of one story published every other issue, and those of the other storyline published in between those. This practice began with the storyline &quot;The Lies&quot;, for the odd numbered issues, and &quot;Year One&quot;, for the even numbered issues. The new storyline as presented in these issues effectively retcons the events from the previous New 52 series. &quot;The Lies&quot; storyline reveals that numerous events from the previous &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series, in which Diana was made the Queen of the Amazons and the God of War, were in fact all an illusion created by a mysterious villain, and she had never once been back to Themyscira ever since she left, nor is she capable of returning there. The &quot;Year One&quot; story is presented as an all-new origin story for Diana, which reveals how she received her powers from the Olympian Gods, which was intended to bring her back to her classical DC roots. Wonder Woman appears in DC Rebirth with a revised look with an ancient Greek motif, including a red cape and light armor fittings, such as pteruges and shin guards. Along with her lasso and bracelets, she now regularly uses her sword and shield. &quot;Wonder Woman: Rebirth&quot; artist Liam Sharp described the new armor as a utilitarian piece which allows her to move more freely.

In 2018, DC Comics announced G. Willow Wilson as the new writer on the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; ongoing series. Wilson began her run in November, with the first story arc titled &quot;The Just War.&quot;

====2020s====

Steve Orlando took over from Wilson in 2020 with Mariko Tamaki taking over from him later in the year. 2020 also saw the &quot;Wonder Woman comics&quot; issues&#x27; numbering order restructured as DC&#x27;s Doomsday Clock event united the current series to the original Golden Age as one continuous run. This meant the next issue was &quot;#750&quot; despite the previous issue being numbered only &quot;#83&quot;. To celebrate, the issue was extra length and collected a variety of short stories celebrating the character of Wonder Woman with previous writers such as Phil Jimenez, Gail Simone and Greg Rucka returning. In early 2021, it was announced that Becky Cloonan and Michael Conrad would serve as the writers of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; starting with issue 770 as a part of &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, with Travis Moore serving as the initial artist. Their run would last up to issue 800 in June 2023, where it was then announced that the series would receive a new #1 as a part of the Dawn of DC relaunch. Tom King will serve as the writer and Daniel Sampere providing the art, with the first issue launching on September 6, 2023, and a short story in issue 800 that will set up the series by introducing Diana&#x27;s future daughter Elizabeth / Trinity.

Much of the events of King and Sampere&#x27;s run are relayed at some in the future to Diana&#x27;s daughter along with Batman&#x27;s son Damian Wayne and Superman&#x27;s son Jon Kent, both of whom have succeeded their parents in their respective mantles, by the imprisoned villain Sovereign, who Trinity seeks out to learn information about her father.

During the events of King&#x27;s run, Diana also takes part in the DC-wide &quot;Absolute Power&quot; event as she and other heroes face off against Amanda Waller after their powers are stolen from them by Waller. Diana teams up with Damian Wayne, whom she bonds with over the way that they feel that struggle to live up to the legacies of their parents, with Diana relating to how Damian views his father through the way she aspires to live up to her mother Hyppolyta. Damian and Diana also meet with Steve Trevor during their mission, who assists Diana and Damian on their mission and reconnects with Diana romantically. At the end of the event, Diana and the other heroes regain their powers.

This run notably retcons Zeus&#x27;s parentage of Diana and restores the origin of Diana&#x27;s birth from clay as her canon backstory. It is fully restored when the Sovereign reveals that he killed Steve Trevor and reveals that Steve is in fact Elizabeth&#x27;s father, though not in a traditional sense. After the Sovereign killed Steve Trevor to break Diana, he reveals that after Diana unsuccessfully attempted to bring Steve back from the dead, Diana went to Paradise Island and used her and Steve&#x27;s essences and formed a child from clay. Diana called upon Hyppolyta to bring life to the child, in the same way that Aphrodite had done for Hyppolyta when she brought Diana to life.

==Characterization==
===Diana Prince===

Diana Prince is the civilian identity of Wonder Woman, first appearing in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; #1 in January 1942. This cover identity allows Wonder Woman to operate in human society undetected. In the Golden Age of comics, Diana Prince was a U.S. Army nurse during World War II. Wonder Woman adopted this identity after meeting the real Diana Prince, who needed money to join her fiancé in South America. In exchange for the funds, Wonder Woman received her credentials. As Diana Prince, she initially worked as a secretary in the military, particularly for Major Steve Trevor, with whom she had a romantic interest. This role allowed her to be close to Trevor and aid him in his missions without revealing her true identity.

In the Silver and Bronze Ages of comics, the Diana Prince persona was redefined. The earlier story of acquiring the identity from a real Diana Prince was omitted, and instead, Diana Prince was portrayed as working in military intelligence. During this period, Wonder Woman experienced a phase where she lost her superpowers and functioned solely as Diana Prince, a skilled but non-superhuman character. Her career evolved over time, with roles ranging from military intelligence to astronaut and staff member at the United Nations. During this era, Diana Prince engaged in high adventure similar to characters like Modesty Blaise.

After the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline, the history of Wonder Woman and Diana Prince was rebooted. The Diana Prince identity was initially not revived, and Wonder Woman was known simply as Diana of Themyscira. However, for undercover operations, she occasionally used the alias Diane Prince. Following a period of exile due to controversial actions, Wonder Woman fully adopted the Diana Prince identity again, working as an agent for the Department of Metahuman Affairs. This role helped her reconnect with humanity and provided a cover for her superhero activities.

====Personality====
Many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities and tone; between both of her diametric extremes; that of a worldly warrior, a highly compassionate and calm ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person, depending on the writer. What has remained in constant existence, and is a mainstay of the character, is the dichotomy of her dominant force aspect and her nurturing humanity: her overwhelming belief in love, empathy, compassion, and having a strong conscience. The latter aspect had been the reason for her induction into the Star Sapphires.

Writer Gail Simone was applauded for her portrayal of Wonder Woman during her run on the series, with comic book reviewer Dan Phillips of IGN noting that &quot;she&#x27;s molded Diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character.&quot;

In the Golden Age, Wonder Woman adhered to an Amazon code of helping any in need, even misogynistic people, and never accepting a reward for saving someone; while conversely, the modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other alternative, exemplified in the killing of Maxwell Lord to save Superman&#x27;s life.

Brian Azzarello stated in an interview that the New 52 version of the character was being written as a very &quot;confident&quot;, &quot;impulsive&quot; and &quot;good-hearted&quot; character in her. He referred to her trait of feeling compassion as both her strength and weakness.

A distinctive trait of her characterization is a group of signature mythological exclamations, beginning with &quot;Great Aphrodite!&quot;, followed by &quot;Great Hera!&quot;, &quot;Merciful Minerva!&quot;, and &quot;Suffering Sappho!&#x27;, some of which were contributed by Elizabeth Holloway Marston.

===Others===

Diana, after her death, was granted divinity as the Goddess of Truth by her gods for such faithful devotion. During her brief time as a god of Olympus, Diana was replaced in the role of Wonder Woman by her mother, Queen Hippolyta. Unlike Diana receiving the title of Wonder Woman in honor, Hippolyta&#x27;s role as Wonder Woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in Artemis&#x27; death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter.

John Byrne, the writer that introduced the concept of Hippolyta as the first Wonder Woman, has explained his intentions in a post in his message board:

I thought George&#x27;s one &quot;mistake&quot; in rebooting Wonder Woman was making her only 25 years old when she left Paradise Island. I preferred the idea of a Diana who was thousands of years old (as, if I recall correctly, she was in the TV series). From that angle, I would have liked to have seen Diana having been Wonder Woman in WW2, and be returning to our world in the reboot.

Not having that option, I took the next best course, and had Hippolyta fill that role.

As Wonder Woman, Queen Hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with Jay Garrick. After this mission, she elected to join the Justice Society of America and remained in that era for eight years, where her teammates nicknamed her &quot;Polly&quot;. During that time she had a relationship with Ted Grant. Hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild Lyta, daughter of Hippolyta&#x27;s protege Helena, the Golden Age Fury. These visits happened yearly from young Lyta&#x27;s perspective and also accounted for Hippolyta&#x27;s participation in the JSA/JLA team ups. When she returned from the past, Hippolyta took Diana&#x27;s place in the JLA as well.

Following Wonder Woman&#x27;s ascension to heaven and return to the living in &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, she officially gives her blessing for her mother Hippolyta and her Amazon sister Nubia to share the title of Wonder Woman, meaning there are now three Wonder Women in current continuity.

==Fictional character biography==
===20th century===
====Origin====
In her debut in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8, Diana was a member of a tribe of women called the Amazons, native to Paradise Islanda secluded island set in the middle of a vast ocean. Captain Steve Trevor&#x27;s plane crashes on the island and he is found alive but unconscious by Diana and fellow Amazon, and friend, Mala. Diana has him nursed back to health and falls in love with him. A competition is held among all the Amazons by Diana&#x27;s mother, the Queen of the Amazons Hippolyta, to determine who is the most worthy of all the women; Hippolyta charges the winner with the responsibility of delivering Captain Steve Trevor back to Man&#x27;s World and to fight for justice. Hippolyta forbids Diana from entering the competition, but she takes part nonetheless, wearing a mask to conceal her identity. She wins the competition and reveals herself, surprising Hippolyta, who ultimately accepts, and must give in to, Diana&#x27;s wish to go to Man&#x27;s World. She then is awarded a special uniform made by her mother for her new role as Wonder Woman and safely returns Steve Trevor to his home country.

====Golden Age====

Coming to America for the first time, Wonder Woman comes upon a wailing army nurse who happens to look identical to her. Inquiring about her state, she finds that the nurse wanted to leave for South America with her fiancé but was unable due to shortage of money. As Wonder Woman needed a job and a valid identity to look after Steve (who was admitted in the same army hospital), she gives her the money she had earned earlier to help her go to her fiancé in exchange for her credentials. The nurse reveals her name as Diana Prince, and thus, Wonder Woman&#x27;s secret identity was created, and she began working as a nurse in the army.

Wonder Woman then took part in a variety of adventures, mostly side by side with Trevor. Her most common foes during this period would be Nazi forces led by a German baroness named Paula von Gunther, occasionally evil deities/demigods such as Mars and the Duke of Deception, and then colorful villains like Hypnota, Doctor Psycho, and Cheetah.

====Silver Age====

In the Silver Age, Wonder Woman&#x27;s history received several changes. Her earlier origin, which had significant ties to World War II, was changed and her powers were shown to be the product of the gods&#x27; blessings, corresponding to her epithet, &quot;beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, stronger than Hercules, and swifter than Hermes&quot;. The concepts of Wonder Girl and Wonder Tot were also introduced during this period.

&quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #179 (November 1969) showed Wonder Woman giving up her powers and returning her costume and title to her mother, to continue staying in Man&#x27;s World. The reason behind this was that all the Amazons were shifting to another dimension, but Diana was unable to accompany them as she needed to stay behind to help Steve, who had been wrongly convicted. Thus, she no longer held the title of Wonder Woman and after meeting and training under a blind martial arts mentor I-Ching, Diana resumed crime fighting as the powerless Diana Prince. She ran a mod-boutique as a business and dressed in a series of jumpsuits while fighting crime.

====Bronze Age====

In &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #204, Diana&#x27;s magical powers and costume were returned to her and she is once again reinstated as Wonder Woman. I-Ching is killed by a crazy sniper in the same issue. Later, Diana meets her sister Nubia, who is Hippolyta&#x27;s daughter fashioned out of dark clay (hence Nubia&#x27;s dark complexion). Nubia claimed to be the &quot;Wonder Woman of The Floating Island&quot;, and she challenges Diana to a duel which ends in a draw. Returning to her home, Nubia would have further adventures involving Diana.

The last issue of Volume 1 showed Diana and Steve Trevor announce their love for each other and their subsequent marriage.

====Modern Age====

=====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;=====
The events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; greatly changed and altered the history of the DC Universe. Wonder Woman&#x27;s history and origin were considerably revamped by the event. Wonder Woman was now an emissary and ambassador from Themyscira (the new name for Paradise Island) to Patriarch&#x27;s World, charged with the mission of bringing peace to the outside world. Various deities and concepts from Greek mythology were blended and incorporated into Wonder Woman&#x27;s stories and origin. Diana was formed out of clay of the shores of Themyscira by Hippolyta, who wished for a child; the clay figure was then brought to life by the Greek deities. The gods then blessed and granted her unique powers and abilitiesbeauty from Aphrodite, strength from Demeter, wisdom from Athena, speed and flight from Hermes, Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts from Artemis and sisterhood with fire and the ability to discern the truth from Hestia. Due to the reboot, Diana&#x27;s operating methods were made distinctive from Superman and Batman&#x27;s with her willingness to use deadly force when she judges it necessary. In addition, her previous history and her marriage to Steve Trevor were erased. Trevor was introduced as a man much older than Diana who would later on marry Etta Candy.

=====War of the Gods=====

Starting in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #51, the Amazons, who had revealed their presence to the world in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #50, are blamed for a series of murders and for the theft of various artifacts. The Amazons are then taken into custody, Queen Hippolyta is nowhere to be found and Steve Trevor is forced by General Yedziniak to attack Themyscira. These events lead to the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; occurring. The culprit of the murders, thefts and the framing of the Amazons is revealed to be the witch Circe, who &quot;kills&quot; Diana by reverting her form back into the clay she was born from. Later, Wonder Woman is brought back to life and together with Donna Troy, battles Circe and ultimately defeats her.

When Hippolyta and the other Amazons were trapped in a demonic dimension, she started receiving visions about the death of Wonder Woman. Fearing her daughter&#x27;s death, Hippolyta created a false claim that Diana was not worthy of continuing her role as Wonder Woman, and arranged for a contest to determine who would be the new Wonder Woman, thus protecting Diana from her supposed fate. The participants of the final round were Diana and Artemis, and with the help of some mystic manipulation by Hippolyta, Artemis won the contest. Thus, Diana was forced to hand over her title and costume to Artemis, who became the new Wonder Woman and Diana started fighting crime in an alternate costume. Artemis later died in battle with the White Magicianthus, Hippolyta&#x27;s vision of a dying Wonder Woman did come true, albeit not of Diana as Wonder Woman.

The demon Neron engaged Diana in battle and managed to kill her. The Olympian Gods granted Diana divinity and the role of the Goddess of Truth who started to reside in Olympus; her mother Hippolyta then assumed the role of Wonder Woman and wore her own different incarnation of the costume. In &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #136, Diana was banished from Olympus due to interfering in earthly matters (as Diana was unable to simply watch over people&#x27;s misery on Earth). She immediately returned to her duties as Wonder Woman, but ran into conflicts with her mother over her true place and role as Hippolyta seemed accustomed to her life in America. Their fight remained unsolved, as Hippolyta died during an intergalactic war. Themyscira was destroyed during the war, but was restored and reformed as a collection of floating islands. Circe later resurrected Hippolyta in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 3) #8.

=====&quot;The OMAC Project&quot;=====

One of the events that led to the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline was Wonder Woman killing the villain Maxwell Lord in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #219. Maxwell Lord was mind-controlling Superman, who as a result was near to killing Batman. Wonder Woman tried to stop Superman, Lord (who was unable to mind control her) made Superman see her as his enemy Doomsday trying to kill Lois Lane. Superman then attacked Wonder Woman, and a vicious battle ensued. Buying herself time by slicing Superman&#x27;s throat with her tiara, Wonder Woman caught Lord in her Lasso of Truth and demanded to know how to stop his control over Superman. As the lasso forced the wearer to speak only the truth, Lord told her that the only way to stop him was to kill him. Left with no choice, Wonder Woman snapped Lord&#x27;s neck and ended his control over Superman. Unknown to her, the entire scene was broadcast live around every channel in the world by Brother Eye. The viewers were not aware of the entire situation, and saw only Wonder Woman murdering a Justice League associate. Wonder Woman&#x27;s actions put her at odds with Batman and Superman, as they saw Wonder Woman as a cold-blooded killer, despite the fact that she saved their lives.

=====One Year Later=====

At the end of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Wonder Woman temporarily retires from her costumed identity. Diana, once again using the alias Diana Prince, joins the Department of Metahuman Affairs. Donna Troy becomes the new Wonder Woman and is captured by Diana&#x27;s enemies. Diana then goes on a mission to rescue her sister, battling Circe and Hercules. Diana defeats the villains, freeing Donna and takes up the role of Wonder Woman again. Circe places a spell on Diana, which renders Diana into a normal, powerless human being when in the role of Diana Prince; her powers come to her only when she is in the role of Wonder Woman.

====The Circle====

The storyline &quot;The Circle&quot; was focused on the revelation of a failed assassination attempt on Diana when she was a baby, by four rogue Amazons. These AmazonsMyrto, Charis, Philomela and Alkyone, collectively referred to as The Circlewere Hippolyta&#x27;s personal guards and were extremely loyal and devoted to her. However, when Hippolyta decided to raise a daughter, The Circle was horrified and considered the baby ill-fate, one who would ruin their entire race. Thus, after Diana was sculpted out of clay and brought to life, The Circle decided to assassinate the baby. Their attempt was foiled however, and the four Amazons were imprisoned. After years, the Circle escaped their prisons with the help of Captain Nazi, and decided to accomplish their previously failed mission and kill Diana. Diana defeated Myrto, Charis, and Philomela, then approached Alkyone, who runs off and succumbs to her death by falling into the ocean. The other three Amazons return to their prisons.

Issue #600 introduced Wonder Woman to an alternate timeline created by the Gods in which Themyscira had been destroyed and the Amazons scattered around the world. In this timeline, Diana is an orphan raised in New York who is learning to cope with her powers. The entire world has forgotten Wonder Woman&#x27;s existence and the main story of this run was of Diana trying to restore reality even though she does not properly remember it herself. Diana has no memories of her prior adventures as Wonder Woman, recollecting her memories in bits and pieces and receiving different abilities and resources (such as the power of flight and her lasso) during the progression of her adventure. A trio of Death Goddesses called The Morrigan acted as Wonder Woman&#x27;s main enemies. Diana ultimately defeats the evil goddesses and returns everything back to normal.

===21st century===
====The New 52====

In this new timeline, Wonder Woman is the demigoddess daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus. Her original origin is revealed as a cover story to explain Diana&#x27;s birth as a means to protect her from Hera&#x27;s wrath. Currently, Diana has taken on the role and title as the new &quot;God of War&quot;.

The Greek messenger god, Hermes, entrusts Wonder Woman with the protection of Zola, a young woman, who is pregnant with Zeus&#x27;s child, from Hera, seething with jealousy and determined to kill the child. The story focuses on Wonder Woman&#x27;s quest to rescue Zola from Hades, who had abducted her and taken her to Hell at the end of the sixth issue of the series. The male children of the Amazons are introduced and Diana learns about the birth of her &quot;brothers.&quot;

After saving Zola from Hades, Wonder Woman tries to protect her further from Apollo, as it is prophesied that one of Zeus&#x27; children will be his downfall whom Apollo considers to be Zola&#x27;s child. Wonder Woman receives the power of flight by one of Hermes&#x27; feathers piercing her thigh and Zola&#x27;s baby is stolen by Hermes at the end and given to Demeter.

A stand-alone #0 issue was released in September which explored Diana&#x27;s childhood and her tutelage under Ares, the God of War, now known most often as simply &#x27;War&#x27;. The main plot of the issue was Diana training under War as he thought of her being an extraordinary girl with immense potential.

Wonder Woman appears as one of the lead characters in the &quot;Justice League&quot; title written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee that was launched in 2011 as part of The New 52. In August 2012, she and Superman shared a kiss in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #12, which developed into a romantic relationship. DC launched a &quot;Superman/Wonder Woman&quot; series that debuted in late 2013, which focuses both the threats they face together, and on their romance as a &quot;Power Couple&quot;.

====Earth 2====
The New 52 version of Earth 2 was introduced in &quot;Earth 2&quot; #1 (2012). In that issue, the Earth 2 Wonder Woman is introduced via flashback. She, along with Superman and Batman, are depicted dying in battle with forces from Apokolips five years in the past. This Wonder Woman worshiped the deities of Roman mythology as opposed to the Greek; the Roman gods perish as a result of the conflict. An earlier version of the Earth-2 Wonder Woman, prior to the Apokoliptian invasion, is seen in the comic book &quot;Batman/Superman&quot;, where she is seen riding a pegasus.

In &quot;Earth 2&quot; #8 (2013), Wonder Woman&#x27;s adult daughter, Fury, is introduced. She is loyal to the Apokoliptian Steppenwolf.

====DC Rebirth====

In 2016, DC Comics implemented DC Rebirth, the second relaunch since 2011&#x27;s The New 52, which reset some of the continuity changes effected by The New 52.

Following the events of the Darkseid War, Wonder Woman is told by the dying Myrina Black that on the night of Diana&#x27;s birth, Hippolyta gave birth to a twin brother who was born after her. This child was revealed to be male, known as Jason of Themyscira, and is said to be incredibly powerful. Wonder Woman makes it her mission to find him.

The &quot;Lies&quot; story arc runs parallel with and explores Diana&#x27;s search. No longer able to get into Mount Olympus, Diana tracks down Barbara Ann Minerva, the Cheetah, to get help.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock,&quot; Doctor Poison attended the meeting established by the Riddler and mentioned a rumor that Wonder Woman was forcefully dragged back to Themyscira by her fellow Amazons. Wonder Woman comes out of hiding to address the United Nations, hoping to defuse the metahuman arms race. However, the summit is interrupted by Black Adam, the Creeper, and Giganta, who take advantage of the absence of most of Earth&#x27;s superheroes to attack the UN at the time when the superheroes were confronting Doctor Manhattan on Mars.

====Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons====
Despite being an Amazon, Diana herself is only a supporting character in &quot;Wonder Woman Historia: the Amazons&quot;. Inspired by George Pérez&#x27;s 1980s reworking, Kelly Sue DeConnick wrote the three issue-limited series in celebration of the 80th anniversary of the DC Comics superheroine and was illustrated by Phil Jimenez, Gene Ha, and Nicola Scott.

&quot;Wonder Woman Historia: the Amazons&quot; begins with seven Greek goddesses-Hestia, Artemis, Demeter, Hecate, Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera-demanding that all mortal men be punished for abusing women, only for their request to be turned down by the womanizing Zeus. Despite the Amazons being her own idea, Hera does not join the other goddesses as they regroup at the Well of Souls (called the Well of the Lost in this retelling), each of them creating a quintet of female warriors from murdered women&#x27;s souls. Composed of six tribes each with its own queen and patron goddess, the thirty Amazons travel the ancient world to rescue women from male traffickers whom they kill in acts of vigilantism; however, the Amazons only go on their missions at night when Artemis can watch over them, and hide themselves during the day to keep their existence a secret from the male gods, especially Zeus. In this version, Hippolyta starts out as a midwife&#x27;s widowed assistant rather than a founding Amazon member. After being ordered to abandon an unwanted newborn girl, Hippolyta changes her mind, racing against the elements to save the baby and encounters the Amazons when they rescue her from traffickers.

As Hera turns the abandoned baby&#x27;s soul into a bird to spy on the Amazons, Hippolyta makes a deal with Artemis to become one of them. Hippolyta then becomes a queen of her own Amazon tribe, which is made up of the women the female warriors rescue and bring back to their secret hideout to train in their way of life and have all six creator goddesses as their patrons. But one day when the sun is up, one young Amazon kills a murdered trafficker&#x27;s son praying to Apollo, exposing the female warriors&#x27; existence to the male gods, who then send an all-male army to annihilate the Amazons.

As the Amazons battle against the gods and their soldiers, Hippolyta leads them all as their sole queen. But when the Amazons suffer many losses, Hippolyta travels to Olympus and makes a bargain with Zeus: her sisters&#x27; lives in exchange for their freedom. Except for the one who had killed the boy in Apollo&#x27;s temple, all the Amazons, dead and living, are given long lives yet are forever imprisoned on Themyscira, where are they allowed to do as they please while under the sun god&#x27;s watch; once a month, Artemis is allowed temporary guardianship of the warriors she had helped create.
Grieving over depriving her sisters their freedom, Hippolyta makes a clay baby girl, whom the seven goddesses bless with gifts and reincarnate from the soul of the very child the Queen of the Amazons was ordered to abandon. Named after the moon goddess, Diana will grow up to become Wonder Woman and continue her mother and their sister Amazons&#x27; fight for women&#x27;s justice.

==Other versions==

===Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)===

Princess Diana of Paradise Island—the Wonder Woman of Earth-Two—was a member of the All-Star Squadron and secretary (and later a member) for the Justice Society of America. As Diana Prince, she worked in the U.S. War Department as an assistant to intelligence officer Steve Trevor. Decades later she and Trevor married and had a daughter, Lyta (also known as Fury). Although Diana was retconned out of existence in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #60, she was later restored to the present.

====Early history====
Diana, Princess of the Amazons of Earth-Two, was born on the mystical Paradise Island several hundred years before becoming known as Wonder Woman. Isolated from the cruelty and corruption of men, the Amazons lived and worked in peace and obeyed the will of Aphrodite and Athena. Longing for a child of her own, Hippolyta (Queen of the Amazons) begged the gods to grant her request and turn her clay statue into a real girl. In sympathy, Aphrodite relented and animated the statue; the girl leaped off the pedestal into her mother&#x27;s arms. Hippolyta named her for the moon goddess, Diana (who became her godmother).

Hippolyta raised her daughter as an Amazon, with the privileges of royalty. Diana aged slowly, stopping aging when reaching adulthood (as did all Amazons). She surpassed most of her Amazon sisters in skills and intelligence, running faster than a deer at age five and easily uprooting a tree at three.

Diana was a contented Amazon until Captain Steve Trevor crash-landed on Paradise Island. Although she had never seen a man before, Diana was attracted to him (despite his injuries). Violating the island rule against taking in outsiders, Diana brought the unconscious Trevor back to the Amazons in an attempt to save his life. In response to her pleas, Hippolyta used the healing Purple Ray on Trevor and saved his life.

Discovering that the outside world was at war, Diana wanted to help stop it. Hippolyta refused, saying that they should not involve themselves in the ways of outsiders. However, the goddesses Aphrodite and Athena appeared to Hippolyta; they said it was time for an Amazon to travel to &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot; and fight the Nazis. Ares felt that he ruled the world; Aphrodite wanted to help America win, claiming it was the last citadel of democracy. A tournament was held to determine the Amazon champion; although forbidden by Hippolyta to participate, Princess Diana concealed her identity with a mask. After winning all the contests Diana revealed her identity to her mother, who feared she would never see her daughter again.

However, Hippolyta allowed her daughter to dress as Wonder Woman and travel to the outside world. Diana returned Steve Trevor to the United States, adopting the identity of a U.S. Army nurse (Diana Prince) so she could stay with Trevor as he recovered; she helped him against a Japanese agent.

Diana began to appear publicly as Wonder Woman. As Earth-Two Diana Prince, she joined the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant and became Col. Darnell&#x27;s secretary. In actual Golden Age comics, the character joins the U.S. Army and in one occasion returned to nursing. The real Diana Prince later returned and tried to assume Diana&#x27;s role, since her inventor husband was having financial trouble selling his weapon to the army. Wonder Woman saved Diana when she is kidnapped by a Japanese agent trying to steal the weapon; when it is successful Diana Prince began using her married name, leaving Wonder Woman in her identity.

Diana continued fighting crime with the Justice Society of America (on Earth-Two) as their first female member, although she was relegated to secretarial work for the Justice Society (despite her super powers). She was shown taking dictation and typing the team&#x27;s minutes as Wonder Woman. Diana rejoined the team when it reformed and expanded (as the All-Star Squadron). She continued fighting crime after the war and resisted being recalled to Paradise Island, preferring to surrender her immortality rather than her independence.

====Marriage====
The 1985 miniseries &quot;America vs. the Justice Society&quot; depicts Diana continuing to fight crime in the 1950s. Unlike many other masked heroes, who the federal government forces to reveal their identity, she admits no secret identity but admits she is an Amazon. However, she continues to use the alias Diana Prince.

During this period, Diana explores her romantic interest in her longtime crime-fighting partner, Steve Trevor. Diana reveals herself as Wonder Woman to him; although initially taken aback, Trevor marries her. Diana later retires from active duty in the Navy and becomes a housewife, raising their daughter Hippolyta &quot;Lyta&quot; Trevor (named after Diana&#x27;s mother).

====Later adventures====
Diana rejoined the (reformed) Justice Society of America during the 1960s; she was one of the JSA members placed in suspended animation by JSA villain Vandal Savage, and was freed by Barry Allen. However, she preferred to spend her time at home raising her daughter. During this time, Earth-Two Diana met her younger Earth-One counterpart. She was later summoned by the god Mercury (with other heroes of Earth-2, Earth-1 and Earth-S) when beast-man Kull of Atlantis wanted to destroy humanity on all three earths after capturing the elders (who empowered the Marvel Family). She helped stop Queen Clea, one of his henchmen, from taking over the Earth-Two Atlantis in a story involving the Squadron of Justice. The Wonder Women became good friends.

Diana was one of the Justice Society members ambushed by her earth&#x27;s Superman (under the control of the Ultra Humanite) and drowned in Koehaha, the river of evil. She, Superman, Hawkman, Green Lantern, Robin and the Atom committed a number of crimes as they sought to act on their deepest desires, and fought their children/proteges (the newly formed Infinity Inc) in the process. Diana fought her daughter to a standstill and nearly killed Hawkman&#x27;s son, the Silver Scarab, as she sought to rob a museum. Her goal was to obtain a rare herb said to confer eternal life and give it to her husband so that she would not have to face decades alone when Steve inevitably died before she did. She accidentally injured Steve in the battle and took him to Paradise Island for healing. Eventually, Diana and her teammates were freed from the water&#x27;s influence and she went back to her retirement with a recovering Steve

====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;====
Diana continued in her role as an elder stateswoman in the superhero community until the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; came to Earth-Two and erased its existence. She fought well and was protected from erasure at the end of the crisis by ascending to Mount Olympus with her husband. Both were forgotten by the history of the new Primary Earth, except for their daughter (who was reformatted into the new universe as the daughter of Helena Kosmatos: Fury of World War II).

====&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;====

When the new, post-crisis Wonder Woman broke up a riot in Boston, she was interrupted by a woman she thought was her mother (Queen Hippolyta); Hippolyta was the golden-age Wonder Woman via time travel in her continuity. The intruder identified herself as Earth-Two Wonder Woman Diana Prince, who left Mount Olympus to guide Diana. She advised her post-&quot;Crisis&quot; counterpart to be &quot;the one thing you haven&#x27;t been for a very long time...human&quot;. She urged Diana to intervene in a fight between Superman and his counterpart, Kal-L. Having left Mount Olympus, with her gods&#x27; blessings gone, Diana Prince faded away.

===Wonder Woman (Earth-One)===
====Volume One====
The demigod Hercules has captured Queen Hippolyta and several other Amazons, degrading the queen in front of her subjects. Hippolyta begs for aid from Aphrodite, who reveals that Hippolyta must reclaim her girdle to protect from harm against Hercules. She does so, and seduces Hercules long enough to break his neck with her own chains. She then frees her fellow Amazons and defeat Hercules&#x27;s band of soldiers. The queen once again prays to Aphrodite to retire the Amazons from the world of man.

3,000 years later, Wonder Woman returns to Paradise Island where she is placed under arrest for consorting in &quot;man&#x27;s world&quot;. The trial is witnessed by the Fates, as well as a crowd of Amazons including Nubia. Diana begins her story by recalling a moment with Althea, keeper of the Purple Ray. Diana uses the ray to heal Dindra, an injured deer. Althea asks if Diana will participate in the games to honor the goddess Diana, but she replies that her mother Hippolyta does not wish her to as she would have an unfair advantage with her powers. During the festival, Diana appears wearing the lion headdress of Hercules, then runs off while the others chase after her. Diana travels to the shore, where she finds a man who falls to the ground.

In the present time, Hippolyta calls Althea forward to testify. Althea explains that she went to identify a noise in her laboratory, but when she returned, the Purple Ray had disappeared, suggesting Diana took it. Diana reveals she took the ray to heal the man, Steve Trevor. She later challenged the champion Mala to a battle. Diana wins, and claims Mala&#x27;s swan plane. Later, Hippolyta scolds Diana for her actions. She smells a familiar fragrance on Diana, then realizes it must be a man. After Diana leaves, she orders the Amazons to search out Paradise Island and find him.

Elsewhere, Diana leads Steve to the swan plane, but is ambushed by Mala and several others. Mala is then called to testify in the present time. She angrily states that Diana broke tradition. Mala chases after Diana&#x27;s plane but Diana manages to escape. Mala returns to Hippolyta, who plans to recruit Medusa from the Underworld.

Diana flies Steve back to the United States and brings him to a hospital. While in the hospital, Diana finds many elderly women who are dying and begins to panic. She attempts to flee, but she is confronted by several soldiers. She fights them off, then decides to leave. In the present, Etta Candy, called Beth, is summoned to testify. She recalls her first meeting with Diana: the bus carrying her and the Holliday Girls crashes and falls off a cliff, but Diana saves them. Beth scolds Hippolyta for her treatment of her daughter.

Later, Steve is questioned by authorities until Diana and the Holliday Girls appear. Steve then coins the name &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; for the Amazon. Beth then remembers how she created Wonder Woman&#x27;s costume for her. Soon after, Medusa attacks the hotel they were staying in and turns Steve into stone. The Amazons confront Diana and order her to come with them. She does so, under the promise of a trial.

In present time, Steve&#x27;s stone body is brought forth. Diana reveals she worked on the Purple Ray for it to affect men, and heals Steve from his petrification. Diana calls Hippolyta forward to testify, and discovers that she was born from Hercules&#x27;s seed. Diana forgives Hippolyta&#x27;s lies and embraces her, then travels back to the United States to complete her journey as Wonder Woman.

===Kingdom Come===
Kingdom Come Wonder Woman: In the Kingdom Come storyline by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, Wonder Woman is depicted as a hardened warrior who has become more aggressive in her methods of justice. She wears a black variation of her classic costume and carries a sword, reflecting a darker and more uncompromising version of the character.

===Flashpoint===
Flashpoint Wonder Woman: In the Flashpoint universe, Wonder Woman&#x27;s origins are drastically altered. She is portrayed as the fierce queen of the Amazons, leading them into a war with Aquaman&#x27;s Atlanteans. This version of Diana is more ruthless and willing to resort to extreme measures in order to achieve her goals.

===Red Son===
Red Son Wonder Woman: In the DC Elseworlds story Superman: Red Son, Wonder Woman is reimagined as a Soviet Union ally and participant in the Cold War. Her character embodies Soviet ideologies, fighting against the American superhero, Superman.

===Earth 11===
Earth-11 Wonder Woman: On Earth-11, also known as the &quot;Gender Reversed Earth,&quot; most of the DC superheroes are of the opposite gender. Wonder Woman is portrayed as Wonder Man, an Amazon warrior and member of the Justice Guild.

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers and training===

Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, including exclusive Amazonian martial arts. With her godlike abilities of incalculable superhuman strength, nigh-invulnerability, speed, flight, fast healing and semi-immortality, Diana&#x27;s fighting prowess is enhanced. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso. Batman once called her the &quot;best melee fighter in the world&quot;. The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary. In the New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are the result of her Amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood. The Golden Age Wonder Woman also had education in advanced arts and sciences as well as psychology, emotions, and emotional intelligence, as did her Amazon sisters.

====Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;====
The Golden Age Wonder Woman had strength that was comparable to the Golden Age Superman. Wonder Woman was capable of bench pressing 15,000 pounds even before she had received her bracelets, and later hoisted a 50,000-pound boulder above her head to inspire Amazons facing the test. Even when her super strength was temporarily nullified, she still had enough mortal strength of an Amazon to break down a prison door to save Steve Trevor. In one of her earliest appearances, she is shown running easily at , and later jumps from a building and lands on the balls of her feet.

Her strength would be removed in accordance with &quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Law&quot; if she allowed her bracelets to be bound or chained by a male.

She also had an array of mental and psychic abilities, as corresponding to Marston&#x27;s interest in parapsychology and metaphysics. Such an array included ESP, astral projection, telepathy (with or without the Mental Radio), mental control over the electricity in her body, the Amazonian ability to turn brain energy into muscle power, etc. Wonder Woman first became immune to electric shocks after having her spirit stripped from her atoms by Dr. Psycho&#x27;s Electro Atomizer; it was also discovered that she was unable to send a mental radio message without her body.

&quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #105 revealed that Diana was formed from clay by the Queen of the Amazons, given life and power by four of the Greek and Roman gods (otherwise known as the Olympian deities) as gifts, corresponding to her renowned epithet: &quot;Beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, swifter than Hermes, and stronger than Hercules&quot;, making her the strongest of the Amazons. Wonder Woman&#x27;s Amazon training gave her limited telepathy, profound scientific knowledge, and the ability to speak every languageeven caveman and Martian languages.

Between 1966 and 1967, new powers were added, such as super breath.

In the Silver and Bronze Ages of comics, Wonder Woman was able to further increase her strength. In times of great need, removing her bracelets would temporarily augment her power tenfold, but cause her to go berserk in the process.

====Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;====
In the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; universe, Wonder Woman receives her super powers as a blessing from Olympian deities just like the Silver Age version before, but with changes to some of her powers: She is considered one of the mightiest beings in the DC multiverse.
* Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility, blessed Diana with strength drawn from the Earth spirit Gaea... Stronger than Hercules... making her one of the physically strongest heroes in the DC Universe and the strongest female hero in the DC Universe. This strength has allowed her to even battle Superman and Supergirl. She has also held her own against Darkseid. However, now Diana is the daughter of Zeus, king of the Greek Gods, so it is unclear as to how much of her power and strength is a direct result of her divine heritage. Her connection to the earth allows her to heal at an accelerated rate so long as she is in contact with the planet. In rare cases where she has been gravely injured, Diana showed the ability to physically merge with the earth, causing whatever injuries or poisons to be expelled from her body; such an act is considered sacred, and can only be used in extreme cases.
* Pallas Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, granted Diana great wisdom, intelligence, and military prowess. Athena&#x27;s gift has enabled Diana to master over a dozen languages (including those of alien origin), multiple complex crafts, sciences and philosophies, as well as leadership, military strategy, and armed and unarmed combat. More recently, Athena bound her own eyesight to Diana&#x27;s, granting her increased empathy.
* Artemis, goddess of the hunt, animals, and the Moon, graced Diana with the Eyes of the Hunter and unity with beasts, meaning Diana can communicate with all animals, including dinosaurs. The Eyes of the Hunter ability gives Diana a full range of enhanced senses, including telescopic vision and super hearing.
* Hestia, goddess of hearth and home, granted Diana sisterhood with fire. This power has been shown to control the &quot;Fires of Truth&quot;, which Diana wields through her lasso, making anyone bound by it unable to lie. This ability also grants her resistance to both normal and supernatural fire.
* Hermes, the messenger god of speed, granted Diana superhuman speed and the ability to fly. She is capable of flying at speeds approaching half the speed of light. She can react quickly enough to deflect bullets, lasers, and other projectiles with her virtually impenetrable bracelets. After the 2011 relaunch of the character, Wonder Woman does not naturally possess the power of flight. She gains it once she is hit by a feather thrown by Hermes.
* Aphrodite, goddess of love, bestowed Diana with stunning beauty, as well as a kind heart.

While not completely invulnerable, she is highly resistant to great amounts of concussive force and extreme temperatures. However, edged weapons or projectiles applied with sufficient force are able to pierce her skin.

She is able to astrally project herself into various lands of myth. Her physical body reacts to whatever happens to her on the mythical astral plane, leaving her body cut, bruised, or sometimes strengthened once her mind and body are reunited. She can apparently leave the planet through meditation and did this once to rescue Artemis while she was in Hell.

====The New 52====
After the 2011 New 52 relaunch, Diana gained new powers. These new abilities, which included already superhuman strength, superhuman speed, durability, immortality, accelerated healing, and even flight came in addition to her previous attributed Olympian and Amazon combined strength. In addition, Diana&#x27;s bracelets can now create a thunderous explosion or expel lightning when she clashes them together, however the bracelets are not the source of her power rather it is Diana&#x27;s. For any other Amazon user, the gauntlets would not have an offensive ability. Diana can also manipulate lightning and create weapons out of lightning bolts. These new abilities are attributed to being the daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus. Her powers are now considered nearly unmeasurable if she goes without her Bracelets of Submission, which keep her demigod powers in check. She uses these powers in battle against the goddess Artemis and quickly renders her unconscious with ease with a series of carefully positioned counterattacks. While using her godly powers, her outfit and accoutrements lit up and her eyes glowed like her father&#x27;s.

After becoming the God of War in the pages of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, Diana inherits Ares&#x27;s divine abilities. Diana has not exhibited her full powers as War, but is seen in &quot;Superman/Wonder Woman&quot; #8 slipping easily into telepathic rapport with a soldier, explaining &quot;I am War. I know all soldiers, and they know me.&quot;

====DC Universe====

DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017, opting to include everything under a larger DC Universe brand. The continuity established by Rebirth continues across DC&#x27;s comic book titles, including volume five of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

===Weapons and other abilities===
====Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; outfits====
At the time of her debut, Wonder Woman sported a red top with a golden eagle emblem, a white belt, blue star-spangled subligaculum, and red and golden go-go boots. She originally wore a skirt; however according to Elizabeth Marston, &quot;It was too hard to draw and would have been over her head most of the time.&quot; This outfit was entirely based on the American flag, because Wonder Woman was purely an American icon as she debuted during World War II. Later in 1942, Wonder Woman&#x27;s outfit received a slight changethe culottes were converted entirely into skin-tight shorts and she wore sandals. While earlier most of her back was exposed, during the imposition of the Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Wonder Woman&#x27;s outfit was rectified to make her back substantially covered, to comply with the Authority&#x27;s rule of minimum exposure. During Mike Sekowsky&#x27;s run in the late 1960s, Diana surrendered her powers and started using her own skills to fight crime. She wore a series of jumpsuits as her attire; the most popular of these was a white one.

After Sekowsky&#x27;s run ended in the early 1970s, Diana&#x27;s roots were reverted to her old mythological ones and she wore a more modernized version of her original outfit, a predecessor to her &quot;bathing suit&quot; outfit. Later, in 1976, her glowing white belt was turned into a yellow one. For Series 3, artist Terry Dodson redrew her outfit as a strapless swimsuit.

A retrospective of Wonder Woman&#x27;s costume changes was offered in Issue #211, cover-dated April–May 1974, on page 52 which details the changes in her costume from her 1) initial very briefly-lasting one with culottes, or perhaps more specifically, a skort, to 2) the &quot;hot-pants&quot; style costume which would last through the rest of the golden-age years and through much of the 1950s, to 3) the sandaled-look of the late 1950s to mid 1960s, to 4) her plain-clothes civilian look the character adopted during the timeframe of late 1968 to the end of 1972 when the character was without her superpowers, to 5) the slightly-modified-from-the-golden-age costume she returned to when her superpowers were restored in 1973.

====Bronze Age outfit====

It was late in the Bronze Age, however, when what is possibly the single-most-significant change in the iconography of Wonder Woman&#x27;s costume occurred. Various sources explain &quot;[u]nder the leadership of Jenette Kahn, DC Comics&#x27; first female publisher&quot;, &quot;something very special happened to the character. This super heroine was bestowed with her own logo…[that] became a distinguishing factor. The logo was easily identifiable&quot; and was &quot;an iconic chest emblem [that put her] on par with her crusading colleagues Batman and Superman.&quot; The logo was a &quot;stylized eagle that had been in place since 1941, replaced with a stacked double W&quot; and &quot;variations on the stacked &#x27;WW&#x27; logo have been central to every costume since.&quot;

In &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #41, (January 1982), on page 7 of the special Wonder Woman insert, a character identified as &quot;Liz&quot; on the previous page, who states that she is a representative of an organization called the Wonder Woman Foundation, explains &quot;We&#x27;ve been promised full financial backing to promote equality for women everywhere, if we can use your name...and if you&#x27;ll just wear this charming top from now on, instead of your old one!&quot;

Liz then gives Wonder Woman the new breastplate on which a &#x27;double-W&#x27; design replaces the eagle design on the previous breastplate, the first time the breastplate&#x27;s design had changed in the 40 years of the character&#x27;s existence. Later on page 14, Queen Hippolyta advises her to &quot;Wear the new halter for a time, at least, for the good it will do.&quot; Wonder Woman agrees by saying, &quot;Wait! I just realized...you&#x27;re right! The cause will make the &#x27;W&#x27; stand not just for &#x27;Wonder Woman&#x27;...but for women everywhere&quot;.

====Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; outfit====
After &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, George Pérez rebooted the character in 1987. She wore an outfit similar to her 1970s one, but now with a larger glowing golden belt. This outfit continued until William Messner-Loebs&#x27; run, which had Diana pass on the role of Wonder Woman to Artemis. No longer Wonder Woman, Diana sported a new black biker-girl outfit designed by artist Mike Deodato Jr. After John Byrne took over writing and art duties, he redesigned the Wonder Woman outfit (Diana was reinstated as Wonder Woman at the end of Loebs&#x27; run) and joined the emblem and belt together.

Her outfit was not given any prominent change until after the 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline. Similar to her chestplate, her glowing belt was also shaped into a &quot;W&quot;. This outfit continued until issue #600J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s run of Wonder Woman&#x27;s altered timeline changed her outfit drastically. Her outfit was redesigned by Jim Lee and included a redesigned emblem, a golden and red top, black pants, and a later discontinued blue-black jacket.

====&quot;The New 52&quot; outfit====
Another major outfit change for Wonder Woman came about as part of DC Comics&#x27; 2011 relaunch of its entire line of publications, The New 52. The character&#x27;s original one-piece outfit was restored, although the color combination of red and blue was changed to dark red and blue-black. Her chest-plate, belt and tiara were also changed from gold to a platinum or sterling silver color. Along with her sword, she now also uses a shield. She wears many accessories such as arm and neck jewelry styled as the &quot;WW&quot; motif. Her outfit is no longer made of fabric, as it now resembles a type of light, flexible body armor. Her boots are now a very dark blue rather than red. The design previously included black trousers, but they were removed and the one-piece look was restored during the time of publication.

====&quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017 film) outfit====

Her tiara&#x27;s signature star symbol is now an eight-pointed starburst. According to designer Lindy Hemming and director Patty Jenkins, every design decision made for Themyscira came down to the same question: &quot;How would I want to live that&#x27;s badass?&quot; &quot;To me, they shouldn&#x27;t be dressed in armor like men. It should be different. It should be authentic and real ... and &quot;appealing&quot; to women.&quot; When asked about the decision to give the Amazons heeled sandals, Jenkins explained that they also have flats for fighting, adding &quot;It&#x27;s total wish-fulfillment ... I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be sexy, hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same time ... the same way men want Superman to have ridiculously huge pecs and an impractically big body. That makes them feel like the hero they want to be. And my hero, in my head, has really long legs.&quot;

====Invisible Plane====

The Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age portrayals of Wonder Woman showed her using a silent and invisible plane that could be controlled by mental command and fly at speeds up to . Its appearance has varied over time; originally it had a propeller, while later it was drawn as a jet aircraft resembling a stealth aircraft.

Shortly thereafter, Wonder Woman is shown being able to summon it with her tiara, have it hover by the War Department, and extend from it a rope ladder with which she could board it. She uses the plane to fly into outer space, and frequently transports Etta Candy and the Holliday Girls, Steve Trevor, and others. During the 1950s, the plane becomes a jet, and is often shown swooping over Lt. Prince&#x27;s office; she strips out of her uniform at super speed and bounds to the plane. Though the plane was depicted as semi-transparent for the reader&#x27;s convenience, in-story dialogue indicated that it actually was completely invisible, or at least able to become so as the need arose. Wonder Woman continued to use the Invisible Plane for super speed, outer space, and multi-dimensional transport up until the unpowered era of Diana Prince. When Wonder Woman resumed superpowered, costumed operations in 1973, she continued to use the jet as before, but did glide on air currents for short distances. At one point, Aphrodite granted the plane the power to fly faster than the speed of light for any interstellar voyages her champion might undertake.

In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, the Invisible Plane is tinkered by gremlins and is reimagined as a sentient alien crystal named Dome that can transform into several vehicles, including an invisible plane. In &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #201, Dome sacrifices itself to stop a tsunami and is rendered inanimate.

====Lasso of Truth====

The &quot;Lasso of Truth&quot;, or &quot;Lasso of Hestia&quot;, was forged by Hephaestus from the golden girdle of Gaea. The original form of the Lasso in the Golden Age was called the Magic Lasso of Aphrodite. It compels all beings who come into contact with it to tell the absolute truth and is virtually indestructible; in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, Green Arrow mistakenly describes it as &quot;the only lie detector designed by Zeus.&quot; The only times it has been broken were when Wonder Woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso, such as when she confronted Rama Khan of Jarhanpur, and by Bizarro in Matt Wagner&#x27;s non-canonical &quot;Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity&quot;. During the Golden Age, the original form of the Lasso had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them, even overriding the mind control of others; this was effective enough to defeat strong-willed beings like Captain Marvel.

====Bracelets of Submission====

Diana&#x27;s bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of Athena&#x27;s legendary shield, the Aegis, to be awarded to her champion. The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she-goat, Amalthea, who suckled Zeus as an infant. These forearm guards have thus far proven nigh-indestructible (the Omega Beams of Grail have proven able to shatter them), and are able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks, allowing Wonder Woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts. Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman&#x27;s ears bleed. Recently, she gained the ability to channel Zeus&#x27;s lightning through her bracelets as well. Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation, because they were once part of the Aegis, and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use. After the 2011 relaunch of the character, it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check. In addition, Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet. Each sword, marked with a red star, takes shape from a flash of lightning, and when Wonder Woman is done with them, the swords disappear, supposedly, back into her bracelets. As such, she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows, spears and energy bolts among others.

The inspiration to give Diana bracelets came from the pair of bracelets worn by Olive Byrne, creator William Moulton Marston&#x27;s research assistant and lover. &quot;Wonder Woman and her sister Amazons have to wear heavy bracelets to remind them of what happens to a girl when she lets a man conquer her,&quot; quoted Marston in a 1942 interview. &quot;The Amazons once surrendered to the charm of some handsom Greeks and what a mess they got themselves into. The Greeks put them in chains of the Hitler type, beat them, and made them work like horses in the fields. Aphrodite, goddess of love, finally freed these unhappy girls. But she laid down the rule (&quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Law&quot;) that they must never surrender to a man for any reason. I know of no better advice to give modern day women than this rule that Aphrodite gave the Amazon girls.&quot;

====Other items====

During the Golden Age, Wonder Woman possessed a Purple Ray capable of healing even a fatal gunshot wound to the brain. She invented the ray herself to heal Steve Trevor from injuries he sustained when his plane was shot down and he was left adrift in the sea for days.

Diana occasionally uses additional weaponry in formal battle, such as ceremonial golden armour with golden wings, pteruges, chestplate, and golden helmet in the shape of an eagle&#x27;s head. She possesses a magical sword forged by Hephaestus that is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom. As early as the 1950s, Wonder Woman&#x27;s tiara has also been used as a razor-edged throwing weapon, returning to her like a boomerang. The tiara allows Wonder Woman to be invulnerable from telepathic attacks, as well as allowing her to telepathically contact people such as the Amazons back on Themyscira using the power of the red star ruby in its center. As a temporary inductee into the Star Sapphires, Wonder Woman gained access to the violet power ring of love. This ring allowed her to alter her costume at will, create solid-light energy constructs, and reveal a person&#x27;s true love to them. She was able to combine the energy with her lasso to enhance its ability. She also possessed a Mental Radio that could let her receive messages from those in need.

==Cultural impact==

===Critical reception===

Although created to be a positive role-model and a strong female character for girls and boys, in the controversial &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, psychiatrist Fredric Wertham claimed, as a point of criticism, that Wonder Woman&#x27;s strength and independence made her a lesbian.

Wonder Woman was named the 20th greatest comic book character by &quot;Empire&quot; film magazine. She was ranked sixth in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list. In May 2011, Wonder Woman placed fifth on &quot;IGN&quot;″s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.

Under current US copyright law, Wonder Woman is due to enter the public domain in between 2036 and 2037. However, this will only apply (at first) to the character as she is depicted in All Star Comics #8, which was published in 1941. Versions of her with later developments and some related characters, may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain themselves.

====Feminist icon====

Feminist icon Gloria Steinem, founder of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, was responsible for the return of Wonder Woman&#x27;s original abilities. Offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered into a boyfriend-obsessed damsel in distress, Steinem placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; (1972) – Warner Communications, DC Comics&#x27; owner, was an investor – which also contained an appreciative essay about the character. Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers and traditional costume were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973).

In 1972, just months before the groundbreaking US Supreme Court decision &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, science fiction author Samuel R. Delany had planned a story for &quot;Ms.&quot; that culminated in a plainclothes Wonder Woman protecting an abortion clinic. However, Steinem disapproved of Wonder Woman being out of costume, and the controversial story line never happened.

The original significance of Wonder Woman had the intentions of influencing many women of all ages, displaying the physical and mental strengths, values, and ethical attributes that not only men acquire. &quot;Wonder Woman symbolizes many of the values of the women&#x27;s culture that feminists are now trying to introduce into the mainstream: strength and self-reliance for women; sisterhood and mutual support among women; peacefulness and esteem for human life; a diminishment both of &#x27;masculine&#x27; aggression and of the belief that violence is the only way of solving conflicts,&quot; Steinem wrote at the time.

Carolyn Cocca has stated that Wonder Woman possesses a &quot;duality of character&quot; due to the character possessing both feminine and masculine qualities in her physical abilities and attitude, which Cocca felt made her more appealing to a wide audience. Wonder Woman&#x27;s first female editor, Karen Berger, claimed that, &quot;Wonder Woman [is] a great role model to young women, but also contains many elements that appeal to males as well. Wonder Woman crosses the gender line.&quot;. Berger worked with George Pérez on the new issues of Wonder Woman starting in 1987, and the new Diana &quot;works with friends and allies to teach lessons of peace and equality.&quot;

The origin of Wonder Woman and the psychological reasoning behind why William Morton Marston created her in the way he did illustrated Marston&#x27;s educational, ethical, and moral values.

Marc DiPaolo introduces us to Wonder Woman&#x27;s creator and history and he demonstrates how she is a &quot;WWII veteran, a feminist icon, and a sex symbol&quot; all throughout her &quot;career&quot;. Wonder Woman stars in multiple films and is most commonly known for her red, white and blue one piece, and her tall, sexy assertiveness. What many people do not know is that she is a big part of history in the comic and superhero world because of how her character influences real life people of all ages, sexes, ethnicities, and races. &quot;Marston created the comic book character Wonder Woman to be both strong and sexy, as a means of encouraging woman to emulate her unapologetic assertiveness.&quot; Charlotte Howell notes in her essay titled &quot;&#x27;Tricky&#x27; Connotations: Wonder Woman as DC&#x27;s Brand Disruptor&quot; that Wonder Woman is &quot;inherently disruptive to masculine superhero franchise branding because, according to her creator William Moulton Marston, she was intended to be &#x27;psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, [he] believe[d], should rule the world.&#x27;&quot;

In 2015, Wonder Woman became the first superhero to officiate a same-sex wedding in a comic series.

On October 21, 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of the character, the United Nations named Wonder Woman a UN Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls in a ceremony attended by &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; actresses Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter, DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; feature film director Patty Jenkins, and U.N. Under-Secretary General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations, to mark the character&#x27;s designation by the United Nations as its &quot;Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls&quot;. The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal #5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030. The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the character is &quot;not culturally encompassing or sensitive&quot; and served to objectify women. The petition also stated that it was &quot;alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualized image&quot;. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended on December 16.

After the release of the 2017 film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, critics examined the character&#x27;s status as a feminist figure in the film. Zoe Williams for &quot;The Guardian&quot; said, &quot;Yes, she is sort of naked a lot of the time, but this isn&#x27;t objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act. The whole Diana myth, women safeguarding the world from male violence not with nurture but with better violence, is a feminist act. Casting Robin Wright as Wonder Woman&#x27;s aunt, re-imagining the battle-axe as a battler with an axe, is a feminist act. A female German chemist trying to destroy humans (in the shape of Dr Poison, a proto-Mengele before Nazism existed) might be the most feminist act of all.&quot; Alyssa Rosenberg for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;...None of these experiences crushed me, of course, but I do wonder what it might have been like if they hadn&#x27;t happened. The power of Wonder Woman, and one of the things that gives Jenkins&#x27;s adaptation of the character such a lift, is in the answer to that question. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) doesn&#x27;t have any idea what women and men are – or aren&#x27;t – supposed to do. Even when she does encounter other people&#x27;s ideas about gender roles, she doesn&#x27;t automatically accept them, and she never lets anyone stop her. And the movie goes a step further and argues that it&#x27;s not merely little girls all over the world who stand to gain if they can grow up free of the distorting influence of misogyny: a world like that would be liberating and wonderful for men in lots of ways, too.&quot; Emma Gray for &quot;HuffPost&quot; said, &quot;When it comes to pop culture, we speak often about representation; the simple yet often unfulfilled idea that it matters to see someone like you fill a variety of imagined roles on screen. After awhile, these conversations almost begin to feel obvious. We know that it&#x27;s good to see women and people of color and disabled people and trans people and queer people in the same numbers and variety of roles that white, cisgender, straight men have long been afforded. But what these discussions often lose is the emotional impact of finally seeing something you may have never even realized you were missing. For many women viewers, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; filled a hole they didn&#x27;t know they had.&quot;

====Pacifist icon====

Gloria Steinem, editor for &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine and a major supporter of Wonder Woman, stated &quot;...[Marston] had invented Wonder Woman as a heroine for little girls, and also as a conscious alternative to the violence of comic books for boys.&quot; Badower described a near-international incident (involving an unnamed Russian general rolling dozens of tanks and munitions through a shady mountain pass) as an outstanding example for standing up to bullies. &quot;She ends up deflecting a bullet back and disarming the general,&quot; he says, adding that &quot;she doesn&#x27;t actually do anything violent in the story. I just think that Wonder Woman is smarter than that.&quot;

Nick Pumphrey stated that Wonder Woman stands as a non-violent beacon of hope and inspiration for women and men. Grant Morrison stated &quot;I sat down and I thought, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to do this warrior woman thing.&#x27; I can understand why they&#x27;re doing it, I get all that, but that&#x27;s not what [Wonder Woman creator] William Marston wanted, that&#x27;s not what he wanted at all! His original concept for Wonder Woman was an answer to comics that he thought were filled with images of blood-curdling masculinity, and you see the latest shots of Gal Gadot in the costume, and it&#x27;s all sword and shield and her snarling at the camera. Marston&#x27;s Diana was a doctor, a healer, a scientist.&quot; The 2018 journal article &quot;Casting a Wider Lasso: An Analysis of the Cultural Dismissal of Wonder Woman Through Her 1975–1979 Television Series&quot; argued that the Lynda Carter show strongly adapted Wonder Woman&#x27;s ideals but &quot;was suppressed, undone, and discredited&quot; by American culture as part of a larger legacy suppressing the character.

Paquette detailed the changes he made to Wonder Woman&#x27;s costume, stating that he removed the iconic American flag theme and instead incorporated a Greek influence: &quot;The animal associated to Aphrodite is a dove so instead of an eagle on [Wonder Woman&#x27;s] breastplate, it will be more of a dove. It&#x27;s not the American eagle, it&#x27;s the Aphrodite dove. Stuff that creates [the letter] W is by accident, so it&#x27;s not like she already has a letter of the alphabet on her [costume]. In the end I&#x27;ve created a structure so it feels inevitable for Wonder Woman to look the way she does.&quot;

====LGBT icon====

William Marston&#x27;s earliest works were notorious for containing subversive &quot;bondage and sapphic-undertones&quot; subtext. Among Wonder Woman&#x27;s famous catchphrases, &quot;Suffering Sappho&quot;, was a direct reference to lesbianism. Fredric Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; referred to her as the &quot;lesbian counterpart to Batman&quot; (whom he also identified as a homosexual). After Marston&#x27;s death in 1947, DC Comics downplayed her sexuality and feminist origin. Wonder Woman, without Marston&#x27;s creative direction, become more &quot;traditional&quot; superhero fare; the lesbian relationships and sexual imagery disappeared from the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic, along with Wonder Woman&#x27;s super powers. During the Comics Code Authority-decades since, Wonder Woman&#x27;s subversiveness had been gradually stripped away; subsequent comic book writers and artists either did not know what do with her or barely hinted at Wonder Woman&#x27;s erotic legacy.

But under the new 1987 re-boot of the title, under the editorship of Karen Berger, and with the writing and art of George Perez at the helm of the book, the same-sex appreciation by Wonder Woman and the Amazons was more than hinted-at and this was established quickly in the new run of the title. Upon her first sight of supporting character Vanessa Kapatelis (in issue #3), she is shown smiling upwards at Kapatelis, thinking to herself &quot;I&#x27;ve never &quot;seen&quot; another woman quite &quot;like&quot; her...she&#x27;s so &quot;young&quot;...so &quot;vulnerable&quot;...so &quot;beautiful&quot;...&quot; Three years later, in the first issue (#38) of a new decade, there is a story-line presenting a cultural exchange between appointed leaders from &#x27;Man&#x27;s World&#x27;, who are the first mortals to visit Themyscira in this continuity, and the Amazons of Themyscira, in Themyscira, itself. The guest Unitarian minister, Reverend Cantwell, asks the Amazon Mnemosyne &quot;...&quot;Don&#x27;t you &quot;miss&quot; the &quot;sharing&quot; God intended for the sexes?&quot; to which Mnemosyne replied &quot;&quot;Some&quot; do. They have sworn themselves to Artemis, the virgin hunter, and Athena, the chaste warrior. &quot;Others&quot; choose the way of Narcissus. But &quot;most&quot; of us find satisfaction in each &quot;other&quot; – three thousand years &quot;can&quot; be a long time, reverend.&quot;. Probably more than at any other time in the then nearly fifty-year history of the character, the Amazons were explicitly and unequivocally defined, in general, as lesbian. Additionally, Kevin Mayer, brother of the major supporting character Myndi Mayer, was openly gay and this was treated sympathetically. By this time, DC Comics was a Warner Brothers-owned company, and had been for over 20 years.

Wonder Woman is suggested as being queer or bisexual, as she and another Amazon, Io, had reciprocal feelings for each other. Grant Morrison&#x27;s 2016 comic &quot;Wonder Woman: Earth One&quot;, which exists parallel to the current DC comics &quot;Rebirth&quot; canon, Diana is depicted being kissed on her right cheek by a blonde woman who has put her left arm around Diana.

In 2016, &quot;Issue #48&quot; of &quot;Sensation Comics&quot;, featured Wonder Woman officiating a same-sex wedding, drawn by Australian illustrator Jason Badower. &quot;My country is all women. To us, it&#x27;s not &#x27;gay&#x27; marriage. It&#x27;s just marriage&quot;, she states to Superman. Inspired by the 2015 June Supreme Court ruling that established same-sex marriage in all 50 United States, Badower says DC Comics was &quot;fantastic&quot; about his idea for the issue. In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, he said his editor &quot;Was like &#x27;great, I love it! Let&#x27;s do it.&#x27; It was almost anticlimactic.&quot; &quot;Diana&#x27;s mother, the queen, at the very least authorized or in some cases officiated these weddings,&quot; Badower says. &quot;It just seems more like a royal duty Diana would take on, that she would do for people that would appreciate it.&quot;

Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot reacted positively to Diana&#x27;s rebooted orientation, and agreed her sexuality was impacted by growing up in the women-only Themyscira. Gadot stated that Wonder Woman feels she need not be &quot;labelled sexually&quot;, and is &quot;just herself&quot;.
&quot;She&#x27;s a woman who loves people for who they are. She can be bisexual. She loves people for their hearts.&quot; Coming from a society that was only populated by women, &quot;&#x27;lesbian&#x27; in [the world&#x27;s] eyes may have been &#x27;straight&#x27; for them.&quot; &quot;Her culture is completely free from the shackles of heteronormativity in the first place so she wouldn&#x27;t even have any &#x27;concept&#x27; of gender roles in sex.&quot;

Wonder Woman&#x27;s advocacy for women rights and gay rights was taken a step further in September 2016, when comic book writer Greg Rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual, according to her rebooted &quot;Rebirth&quot; origin. Rucka stated, &quot;...nobody at DC Comics has ever said, &quot;[Wonder Woman] gotta be straight.&quot; Nobody. Ever. They&#x27;ve never blinked at this.&quot; Rucka stated that in his opinion, she &quot;has to be&quot; queer and has &quot;obviously&quot; had same-sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women. This follows the way Wonder Woman was written in the alternate continuity or non-canon &quot;Earth One&quot; by Grant Morrison, and fellow Wonder Woman writer Gail Simone staunchly supported Rucka&#x27;s statement. Surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase, Rucka responded to &quot;haters&quot; that consensual sex with women is just as important to Wonder Woman as the Truth is to Superman.

====Sexual empowerment icon====

Wonder Woman&#x27;s signature weapon is her Lasso of Truth; consequently, much of her crime-fighting powers came from bondage, and her only exploitable weakness was, essentially, bondage. Grant Morrison and Yanick Paquette had teamed up to work on &quot;Wonder Woman: Earth One&quot;.

Wonder Woman&#x27;s sexual and bondage themes in her earliest days were not without purpose, however. Her creator, William Moulton Marston, theorized that human relationships could be broken down into dominance, submission, inducement and compliance roles which were embedded into our psyche. Because males were, more often than not, dominant in societies, Marston believed that &quot;Women as a sex, are many times better equipped to assume emotional leadership than are males.&quot; Marston wanted to convey his progressive ideals, through his use of bondage imagery, that women are not only capable of leadership roles, but should be in charge of society. Although Marston had good intentions with these themes, in Wonder Woman&#x27;s early appearances, the bondage elements were controversial, as they were often seen to overly fetishize women in power rather than promote such women. Noah Berlatsky criticized this imagery in Wonder Woman&#x27;s earliest days noting that &quot;the comics take sensual pleasure in women&#x27;s disempowerment.&quot; Despite having the mixed messages of this imagery, Marston fiercely believed that women would soon rule the earth and meant to showcase his predictions through sexual themes in his stories. He was an open feminist while studying at Harvard where he once said &quot;Girls are also human beings, a point often overlooked!&quot;

==In other media==
Since her comic book debut in October 1941, Wonder Woman has appeared in a number of adaptations. These formats include films, television shows, and video games.

In the fine arts, and starting with the Pop art period and on a continuing basis since the 1960s, the character has been &quot;appropriated&quot; by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, most notably by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Dulce Pinzon, Houben R.T. and others.

===Television===

Wonder Woman has made various television appearances since the character&#x27;s introduction. Live-action television appearances include the 1974 television film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; starring Cathy Lee Crosby and the 1975–1979 television series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; starring Lynda Carter as the character. A series pilot starring Adrianne Palicki was filmed in 2011 but ultimately went unaired. In the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) &quot;Peacemaker&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s Cow or Never&quot;, the series&#x27;s first-season finale, Wonder Woman appears alongside other Justice League members as a silhouette, and was portrayed by a stand-in.

Wonder Woman also appeared in several animated television properties, such as in the Hanna-Barbera series &quot;Super Friends&quot; (1973–1986) alongside the Justice League members as well as the 2001–2004 &quot;Justice League&quot; series and its 2004–2006 follow-up, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. In the series &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; (2019–2021), Wonder Woman is depicted as a teenage student at Metropolis High School, where she befriends several other characters.

===Film===

Wonder Woman has been featured in an abundance of direct-to-video animated films that are a part of DC&#x27;s animated film universe (DCAMU) some of which include &quot;Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox &quot;(2013), &quot;Justice League: Throne of Atlantis&quot; (2015) and &quot;Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&quot; (2020). There are also other direct-to-video films the character appears in that are not a part of the DCAMU including &quot;Injustice&quot; (2021), &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot; (2015), and &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot; (2008), along with a few CGI theatrical releases such as &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017).

Within the live-action DC Extended Universe (DCEU) films, Wonder Woman debuted in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), portrayed by Gal Gadot, and reappeared in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017) and its sequel &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; (2020), as well as &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017) and its director&#x27;s cut (2021), and had cameo appearances in &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; and &quot;The Flash&quot; (both 2023).

The 2017 film &quot;Professor Marston and the Wonder Women&quot; tells the story of the polyamorous relationship between William Moulton Marston, his wife and fellow psychologist Elizabeth Holloway Marston, and their lover Olive Byrne, the invention of the lie detector test, and how they inspired the creation of the Wonder Woman comic.

<text>East Alton is a village in Madison County, Illinois, United States. The population was 5,786 at the 2020 census, down from 6,301 in 2010.

==History==
East Alton was incorporated as a village in 1893 (some say 1894).

William Cobb, namesake of Cobb Street, was one of the first mayors, from 1895 to 1896, and again in 1902–1905.

Like many River Bend communities, the town dates back to when European settlers came to the area in the early 19th century. And it wasn&#x27;t always East Alton — the community was known as Emerald, Milton Settlement and Alton Junction. Alton Junction was also known as Wann Junction, famous locally for being the site of a horrific rail disaster.

==Geography==
East Alton is located in northwestern Madison County at (38.883397, -90.106113). It is bordered to the northwest by the city of Alton, to the east by unincorporated Rosewood Heights, to the southeast by the city of Wood River, and to the southwest by the Mississippi River, with West Alton, Missouri, on the opposite shore.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, East Alton has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.87%, are water. The Wood River flows through the northern and western parts of the village and forms the village&#x27;s western border (with Alton) for some of its distance. The river joins the Mississippi in the southern part of the village.

Illinois Route 3 (Lewis and Clark Boulevard) passes through the southwest part of the village, leading northwest into Alton and south to East St. Louis. Illinois Route 143 (Berm Highway) follows the Mississippi along the village&#x27;s southern edge, leading northwest to the center of Alton and east to the center of Wood River. Illinois Routes 111 and 140 run together along the northern border of the village, leading west into Alton and east into Bethalto.

==Demographics==

==Industry==
East Alton is home to the Olin Corporation, a manufacturer of ammunition. Olin has a major impact on East Alton and its surrounding communities. A part of town called the Defense Area was built during the 1940s and until recently was used for low income housing. Replacing the Defense Area is Emerald Ridge, which consists of 46 new single-family homes. The impact of Olin had spread into town sports: East Alton Middle School&#x27;s athletic teams were originally named the Bullets.

The EPA was overseeing the cleanup of a Olin Corp. facility in East Alton by 2021, taking public comments on Olin&#x27;s proposed cleanup plan to contaminated soil and groundwater in July 2021.

The East Alton History Museum officially opened on March 4, 2017, and is located in the Fred H. Bright Jr. Vital Services Building, 119 N. Main Street. The building, which houses the East Alton Police department, was renamed the same day in honor of the former Mayor.

<text>Edwardsville is a city in and the county seat of Madison County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 26,808. The city was named in honor of Ninian Edwards, former Governor of the Illinois Territory. Edwardsville is a part of Southern Illinois and the Metro East region within Greater St. Louis, located northeast of downtown St. Louis. 

Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, the Edwardsville Arts Center, the &quot;Edwardsville Journal&quot;, the &quot;Madison County Record&quot;, and the &quot;Edwardsville Intelligencer&quot; are based in Edwardsville. Edwardsville High School and Metro-East Lutheran High School serve students in the area. Edwardsville also serves as the headquarters for Prairie Farms Dairy, one of the largest dairy cooperatives in the United States and ranked in the top 10 of the largest privately-held companies in the St. Louis region. The city is part of the Edwardsville School District, which also includes the villages of Glen Carbon, Hamel and Moro, as well as the township areas around them.

==History==

Edwardsville was incorporated in 1818. The first European-American settler was Thomas Kirkpatrick, who came in 1805, laid out a community, and served as the Justice of the Peace. He named the community after his friend Ninian Edwards, then territorial governor of Illinois. (Illinois did not become a state until 1818.) The Edwards Trace, a key trail in the settlement of Central Illinois, used Edwardsville as a northward launching point.

In 1868 The Bank of Edwardsville was founded. It was purchased by Champaign, Illinois-based Busey Bank in 2019.

In 1890, St. Louis industrialist N.O. Nelson chose a tract of land just south of Edwardsville to build plumbing factories. He also built a model workers&#x27; cooperative village called Leclaire. He offered workers fair wages with reasonable working hours and a share of the profits. He named the village in honor of the French economist Edme-Jean Leclaire. The village also provided educational and recreational opportunities and made it financially possible for anyone to own a home. Unlike company towns such as Pullman near Chicago, the welfare and quality of life for the workers and their families was a major concern.

In 1934, the Village of Leclaire was incorporated into the City of Edwardsville. The area has a lake and park, baseball field, and the Edwardsville Children&#x27;s Museum in the former Rudolph D. Specht memorial schoolhouse. Several Nelson factory buildings were renovated and adapted for use as the historic N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College. The recognized Historic District has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Each year on the third Sunday in October, the Friends of Leclaire host the annual Leclaire Parkfest with food, live heritage music, historic displays &amp; tours, artisans, children&#x27;s activities, a book sale, and more.

In 1983, Edwardsville&#x27;s historic Saint Louis Street was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dating back to 1809, this Historic District has a mile-long visual landscape. More than 50 historic homes date from the middle 19th century to early 20th century. The protection and preservation of Saint Louis Street is overseen by the Historic Saint Louis Street Association.

Five Illinois governors came from Edwardsville: namesake Ninian Edwards, who became a territorial governor in 1809 and later served as governor from 1826 to 1830; Edward Coles, elected in 1822 and a strong opponent of slavery; John Reynolds, governor from 1830 to 1834; Thomas Ford, governor from 1842 to 1846; and Charles Deneen, governor from 1909 to 1913.

Former president Abraham Lincoln was in Edwardsville twice, as an attorney in the 1814 courthouse and a speaker outside the 1857 courthouse on Sept. 11, 1858. The present county courthouse, a square, four-story neoclassical structure of white marble that rises to six stories at the back section, was constructed from 1913 to 1915.

A 2010 issue of &quot;Family Circle&quot; magazine named Edwardsville third of their &quot;Top 10 Best Towns for Families&quot;.

Edwardsville was heavily affected by the tornado outbreak of December 10–11, 2021. An Amazon warehouse collapsed after being hit by an EF3 tornado and six workers were killed and many others injured.

<text>Glen Carbon is a village in Madison County, Illinois, United States, northeast of St. Louis. The population was 13,842 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1801, Colonel Samuel Judy received a military grant for of land near the base of the bluffs just north of Judys Branch, and became one of the first permanent settlers of Madison County. The land was called Goshen Settlement, after the biblical land of Goshen. It was renamed &quot;Glen Carbon&quot; to reflect its coal mining heritage.

Glen Carbon was incorporated as a village in 1892. It operated many coal mines until the last one shut down in 1934. Another industry was the St. Louis brick company, which burned down in the 1930s; then, right after being rebuilt, it burned down and was never rebuilt again.

Glen Carbon residents served during World War I. The city&#x27;s Doughboy statue, which honors the sacrifice made by two of its residents, has been selected as part of a national competition for restoration as part of the nation&#x27;s World War I centennial activities.

Three railroads once served Glen Carbon. The Illinois Central Railroad, now the Ronald J. Foster Sr. Heritage Bike Trail, became one of the first rails to trails projects in the US, in 1992. The other two lines were the Norfolk Southern line and the Chicago and North Western line, which ran parallel with each other the entire way through Glen Carbon, and stopped operating in Glen Carbon in March 2000. The Nickel Plate Bike Trail follows both of those right-of-ways, switching back and forth between the NS and CNW lines the whole way through Glen Carbon.

===Heritage Museum===
Originally built in 1914, this building began as School Street in what is considered &quot;Old Town&quot; Glen Carbon.

Exhibits include:
*Artifacts that stress the importance of the railroads and coal mines
*Military memorabilia from Glen Carbon&#x27;s veterans
*Historical photograph collection
*Baseball memorabilia

===Yanda Log Cabin===
The Yanda Log Cabin is a satellite addition to the Heritage Museum. In February 2017, the cabin received a historical recognition plaque from the National Society Colonial Dames XVII Century organization. The Yanda Log Cabin was built around 1853 by William and Anna Zrala Yanda. They immigrated from Bohemia, Austria and plied their blacksmithing trade on this offshoot of the Goshen Road. The family handed the home down through the generations before selling it in the 1940s.

In 1989, the home was scheduled to serve as a practice burn for the local fire department. The Historical and Museum Commission found out about this and worked to save the building. The Village of Glen Carbon purchased the cabin so that it could be restored by volunteers and used as a gathering place for residents.

==History==
The village is named for Captain Benjamin Godfrey, a native New Englander, who arrived in the area in 1832. 1838 saw the establishment of the Monticello Female Seminary, later renamed Monticello College. Captain Godfrey, the father of eight daughters, was an advocate of higher education for women and made a large donation of funds and land for the college. Monticello operated as a two-year college for women until the campus was sold in 1970 to establish Lewis and Clark Community College. Monticello&#x27;s final class graduated in 1971.

The nearby mouth of the Missouri River was the starting point for the expedition of Lewis and Clark.

<text>Granite City is a city in Madison County, Illinois, United States, within the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area. The population was 27,549 at the 2020 census, making it the third-largest city in the Metro East and Southern Illinois regions, behind Belleville and O&#x27;Fallon. Officially founded in 1896, Granite City was named by the Niedringhaus brothers, William and Frederick, who established it as a steel making company town for the manufacture of graniteware kitchen utensils.&lt;ref name=&quot;madison-historical/nesco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early settlement===
The area was settled much earlier than Granite City&#x27;s official founding. In the early 19th century, settlers began to farm the rich fertile grounds to the east of St. Louis. Around 1801, the area saw the establishment of Six Mile Settlement, a farming area that occupied the area of present-day Granite City, six miles (10 km) from St. Louis. Soon after, around 1806, the National Road was to be constructed through the area, but it was never completed. By 1817, the area became known as Six Mile Prairie, to distinguish it from Six Mile Township. By 1854, the first railroad was built. In 1856, the area known as Six Mile would be changed to Kinder.

===Granite ware===
Granite City was founded in 1896 to be a planned company city similar to Pullman, Illinois, by German immigrant brothers Frederick G. Niedringhaus and William Niedringhaus for their Granite ware kitchen supplies factory.

Since 1866, the Niedringhaus brothers had been operating the St. Louis Stamping Company, an iron works company, that made kitchen utensils in St. Louis, Missouri. In the 1870s, William discovered an enamelware process in Europe whereby metal utensils could be coated with enamel to make them lighter and more resistant to oxidation. At the time, most enamelware was usually just one color as the additions of any colors to the process was inefficient. On June 1, 1878, William applied for Patent 207543 to improve the efficiency whereby a pattern could be applied to enamelware while the enamel was still wet simply by placing a thin piece of paper with an oxidized pattern on top of it. The paper would fall off in the drying process and the pattern would be embedded. The brothers&#x27; pattern made the utensils resemble granite. The resulting product was enormously popular.

The brothers opened the Granite Iron Rolling Mills in St. Louis to provide tin (imported from Wales) to its prospering kitchen supplies manufacturer. The imported tin had a $22 per ton tariff.

Frederick ran for Congress in Missouri in 1888. During his one term in the 51st Congress, he successfully urged the passage of a new tariff of 50 percent of value on imported iron and tin. With the increased tariff, the U.S. steel industry (including their iron plant) took off.

As they planned expansion of their Bessemer process steel works, they were blocked by the city of St. Louis which did not want the expansion. As well, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis planned to tax coal crossing the Mississippi River into Missouri.

Another large factory in the city was owned by the Commonwealth Steel Company, a business founded on philanthropic principles in 1901 and acquired by the General Steel Castings Corporation in 1929.

===Company town===
In 1891, the brothers bought from business tycoon Lars Kovala. This land extended from the Mississippi River across the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad tracks for their new Granite City.

With the help of the St. Louis City Engineer, a street grid was laid out with streets listed in alphabetic order plus numbered streets, and the only exception being Niedringhaus Avenue.

The Niedringhaus family required that its employees live in the town. Houses were purchased with Niedringhaus mortgages. Unlike Pullman, however, they did not exert major control over the day-to-day lives of their employees and left the government of the city up to the residents.

African-Americans were not allowed in the community and instead congregated in Brooklyn, Illinois.

The plant would later grow to occupy and employ more than 4,000 people. The plant prospered until the 1950s when aluminum, stainless steel, and pyrex replaced iron-based utensils.

The granite pattern in kitchen utensils, particularly in roasting pans, remains very popular.

===Early history===
In 1896, Granite City was officially incorporated as a City within Madison County, Illinois. The first seven years went as planned with rapid growth. Henry Fossiek was hired as the first policeman, a School Board of Directors was appointed by the Mayor, four schools opened, the 1st Church of the Concordian Lutheran Church was built, Stamping Company changed its name to National Enameling &amp; Stamping Company (NESCO), and lots were sold for a new subdivision to be named &#x27;Granite Park&#x27; (More commonly known as West Granite, today). Then in 1903, a massive flood covered all of West Granite while the rest of the town stayed relatively dry.

In 1906, ten thousand persons emigrated to Granite City from Macedonia, Bulgaria, Hungary and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, during a two-year period. The majority of these immigrants, primarily those from the country of Hungary, moved to present-day Lincoln Place. At the time, this area was called &#x27;Hungary Hollow&#x27;. During the Panic of 1907, the neighborhood of Hungary Hollow was nicknamed &#x27;Hungry Hollow&#x27;, as many immigrants starved during this period. The following year, one of the founding fathers of the city and of NESCO, William Niedringhaus, would die, leading to the beginning of a new era in both the company and the city&#x27;s future.

It was also during this period that St. Joseph Catholic Church was organized and a canal and levee system were built. Methody Bulgarian Church in America was built in Hungary Hollow for the large number of Bulgarians (incl. many Macedonian Bulgarians) living there. At the time, Granite City had the largest concentration of Bulgarians in the country and boasted the only American newspaper printed in the Bulgarian language.

After the 1915 Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, thousands of Armenians fled Armenia and migrated to the United States. The promise of jobs at steel mills in Granite City created a thriving Armenian community in the town, with many Armenians settling in Lincoln Place. Since then, they have kept a church and community center, along with the Granite City &quot;Antranig&quot; Chapter of the Armenian Youth Federation.

Around 1903, Granite City expelled its African American residents. In 1967, the Congress of Racial Equality alleged that Granite City was a sundown town. Mayor Donald Partney acknowledged that the city was commonly understood to have a sundown ordinance but denied that it was official.

===2000s history===
, several large manufacturing corporations operate in the city, including U.S. Steel, Precoat Metals, Capri-Sun, Kraft Foods, Heidtman Steel, Prairie Farms, and American Steel. The clothing retailer Glik&#x27;s is also headquartered in Granite City. In July 2018, President Donald Trump visited the city to deliver a speech about industry growth at the U.S Steel plant.

A 2024 investigation into 17 coke burning facilities in the US estimated that the SunCoke Energy plant in Granite City could be responsible for 6-11 premature deaths, increased asthma symptoms, and other health impacts for residents every year.

==Geography==
Granite City is located at (38.717849, -90.129529), adjacent to the Chain of Rocks Canal on the Upper Mississippi River, bordering Horseshoe Lake on its southeastern side. The city sits in the American Bottom, a wide, flat and fertile plain. Although at risk during the Great Flood of 1993, the city never flooded and is protected by a series of levees along both the Mississippi River and Chain of Rocks Canal.

Granite City is located within a few miles of five interstate highways. Interstate 270 passes through the northern edge of the city and Interstates 255, 70, 55, and 64 all pass just to the south and east of the city.

Route 3 is a major thoroughfare along the western edge of the city and provides access to downtown St. Louis across the recently renovated McKinley Bridge.

According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 93.19%) is land and (or 6.81%) is water.

==Cityscape==

Granite City can be divided into seven areas: Downtown, East Granite, West Granite, North Granite, Nameoki Strip, Bellemore Area and the Wilson Park Area. Most retailers and dining facilities are located on the Nameoki Strip, surrounding Nameoki Road.

The Wilson park area is home to the recently renovated Coolidge Middle School, former Niedringhaus Elementary School, and Granite City High School as well as the city&#x27;s crown jewel, Wilson Park. Wilson Park is sometimes called the &quot;heart&quot; of Granite City and is known for its nicely kept &quot;turn of the [20th] century&quot; homes.

East Granite is less defined, but is mostly modern residential subdivisions as well as both St. Elizabeth and Holy Family Catholic Schools. East Granite is north of the blast furnace at US Steel. US Steel&#x27;s complex was formerly known as the Granite City Steel Co.

Downtown is at the southwestern part of the city and is home to much of the city&#x27;s industry, including the Granite City Steel Works. Downtown Granite suffered a downturn in the 1970s, which vacated much of its commercial buildings and in turn, urban decay began. More recently, there have been revitalization efforts to revive the downtown area, although they are still in their early stages. These efforts are modeled on nearby cities such as Belleville, IL, Edwardsville, IL, and St. Charles, MO. Revitalization efforts include installing tree-filled medians on Niedringhaus Avenue, adding recreational businesses such as the three-screen &quot;Granite City Theater&quot;, repaving streets, granting tax incentives, and adding new zoning restrictions. The original design of what is currently downtown Granite City is based on the City of Washington D.C.

West Granite is located west of downtown across the railroad lines. West Granite contains both industrial and lower income residential areas and has been struggling to fight its above average crime rate. While Wilson Park may be the Heart of Granite City, West Granite is the History. Attracted by the promise of plentiful jobs, many immigrants from Central-Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, Ottoman Macedonia and Hungary, migrated to the City in search of good jobs with decent wages. The vast majority of these immigrants settled into housing to the west of the downtown area in a place that would come to be known as &#x27;Hungary Hollow.&#x27; By 1916 the multi-national residents of Hungary Hollow applied for and were granted an official name change to Lincoln Place.

<text>Roxana is a village in Madison County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,454 at the 2020 census. The ZIP Code is 62084.

A majority of the land in Roxana is taken up by the Wood River Refinery, an oil refinery operated by Phillips 66. The refinery was originally built and owned by Shell Oil. As of 2016, the refinery is capable of refining of oil per day to produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, asphalt, propane, and other products, and supplies part of the St. Louis, Chicago, Indiana, and Ohio regions.

Roxana is considered to be part of the River Bend portion of the St. Louis Metro East area. It is well known for its bright Christmas lights lining Illinois Route 111, its main street, throughout the holiday season each year.

==History==

In 1918, Shell Oil Company opened its Wood River Refinery in what was then called &quot;Wood River Field&quot;, an area south of the city of Wood River. As houses began being built close to the refinery, the population there grew to the point that, in 1921, this unincorporated area became the incorporated village of Roxana.

The origin of the village&#x27;s name is unknown. Local lore is that the name &quot;Roxana&quot; was chosen to honor a &quot;Queen Roxanne&quot; of the Netherlands, inasmuch as the village owed its very existence to Netherlands-state-owned Royal Dutch Shell. But there had never been a Queen Roxanne of the Netherlands. The Dutch monarch at the time was Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. However, Royal Dutch/Shell Group also founded Roxana Petroleum Company in 1912 in Oklahoma to explore for and produce crude oil.

Subsequently Shell built refineries near New Orleans in 1916, at Wood River in 1918, and parallel with US Route 20 across Hammond and East Chicago in Lake County, Indiana, in 1926. The Hammond-East Chicago refinery was linked directly by pipeline to Wood River and resulted in the residential neighborhood of Roxana (East Chicago) adjacent to it.

Originally constructed on , the Wood River Refinery now covers approximately . Phillips 66 acquired it, the largest in its system, in the early 2000s.

A Baptist church was organized in September 1921, and the land where the current First Baptist Church of Roxana now stands, at the corner of Tydeman Street and Central Avenue, was purchased in early 1922. The first services were held there on December 3, 1922. J.A. Wilson served as the church&#x27;s first pastor.

A formal village hall, called for by a vote for a &quot;Municipal Building&quot;, was built on $36,000 worth of bonds in 1938. It currently houses Roxana&#x27;s Village President, Treasurer, Water Department, and Clerk&#x27;s offices, the fire and police departments, the village board room, and a municipal gymnasium.

In the early 1940s, a large Art Deco-style theater was built at the northwest corner of Thomas Street and Central Avenue, at 400 N. Central Avenue. To the south across Thomas Street used to sit Burbank School, built in 1936 (torn down in 2009), and at the southeast corner of the intersection lay Roxana Drug Store. Seating approximately 580 people, the theater was originally designed for vaudeville acts as well as movie showings. In 1949, a tornado tore the roof off, but after repairs were made, the theater reopened. In the late 1960s, it was closed for nearly two years before being sold in June 1968 from the estate of Albert Critchlow to Bloomer Amusement Co. of Belleville. It was thereafter operated as &quot;BAC Cine&quot; for many years. In 1992, the Cine was purchased by Kerasotes Theatres, Inc., of Springfield, Illinois, which operated it until its closing in February 2002.

In 2000, the theater was purchased from Kerasotes and was donated to the Roxana Church of the Nazarene, which is located just to the north. The church now operates the building as the Nazarene Community Center, where it is available for rental and group events.

== Roxana Park ==

In May 1934, a village ordinance was passed creating a Recreation Board that would develop a plan for activities and playground sites, establish a budget and employ a Supervisor to manage the operation. In 1938, Village Hall was constructed which included a gymnasium for recreational activities. The first meeting of the Village Board in the newly constructed Village Hall was held on Wednesday, February 1, 1939. Village Hall, consisting of the gym, fire department, police department and other village offices, is located at the intersection of Central Avenue and West Third Street.

In 1947, land was purchased for the purpose of park and recreation facilities, and a softball diamond was constructed. The park is located in the northeastern part of the village, to the north and east of Roxana High School.

In 1952, the Park District was incorporated, followed by the addition of a public swimming pool in 1957. Adjacent to the pool was a recreation area which included trampolines, miniature golf and donkey cart rides.

In 1959, additional land was purchased, and a house was acquired from Shell Oil Company and moved to the property. This was the original meeting place of many community groups. When the house became too small to accommodate the needs of the people, the Rox-Arena was constructed in 1969. For many years, Roxana Park Director Lyle Dona lived in this house within the park.

In the years following, picnic shelters were added along with additional ball fields, concession stand, soccer field, playgrounds and bike/walking paths. The main park now is home to four baseball diamonds—the High School Diamond, the Lighted Diamond, the South Diamond and the Picnic Diamond.

In 1993, Burbank Park was purchased from the school district. It now contains a baseball diamond, playground, picnic shelter, soccer field, and basketball court. It is the site of the annual Roxana Homecoming Festival held each May.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Park District, a new pool house was constructed in 2002.

==Transportation==
Roxana is served by Amtrak in Alton, St. Louis Regional Airport (formerly known as Civic Memorial Airport) in Bethalto, and Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.

Illinois Route 111 (Central Avenue) is the main route through Roxana. It is a four-lane, non-divided highway through the village, and boasts the only two stoplights in town (located at its intersections with Thomas Street and Tydeman Street).

Illinois Route 255 was completed in 1998 and runs through the eastern portion of the village limits, east of the Wood River refinery. Although the village has plans to develop the area near Route 255, this has not yet occurred.

==Points of interest==
There is a limestone outcropping due southeast of Iuka that is one of the purported locations of Burrows Cave. In 1982, Russell E. Burrow claimed to have found numerous archeological artifacts in this cave inscribed in Ancient Egyptian and Greek. Today, Burrows Cave is considered a hoax by most mainstream archeologists.

Along U.S. Route 50, east of the village limits, lies the Halfway Tavern, a replica structure of the original that lies halfway between Vincennes and St. Louis. The building is now a State Historic Site. It is claimed that Abraham Lincoln stayed at the inn, though there is no proof of his presence at the tavern. It is also believed that a group of Native Americans robbed gold from a passing stagecoach in the early 1800s, and that the gold is buried in a wooded area to the north of the tavern, but cited evidence questions the legitimacy of this claim.

Further east along U.S. Route 50 lies the Hebron School, a wooden one-room schoolhouse that operated between 1908 and 1952.

<text>Kinmundy is a city in Marion County, Illinois, United States. The population was 733 at the 2020 census.

The town is believed to have been named after a place in Scotland, the birthplace of William Ferguson, a London agent for the Illinois Central Railroad during Kinmundy&#x27;s construction. He visited the area in 1856.

==Geography==
Kinmundy is located in northeastern Marion County. Illinois Route 37 passes through the village center as 1st Street, leading southwest to Salem, the county seat, and northeast to Farina. Interstate 57 passes northwest of the city, with access from Exit 127. I-57 leads northeast to Effingham and southwest to Mount Vernon.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Kinmundy has a total area of , of which are land and , or 17.44%, are water. The water area consists of Kinmundy Lake, a reservoir west of the city proper. The city drains to the northwest, toward the East Fork of the Kaskaskia River. 
== History ==
The origins of the town of Kinmundy are rooted in the expansion of the railroads in southern Illinois, with the first significant economic influence being construction work on the Chicago branch of the Illinois Central Railroad. In April 1857, the town was initially laid out east of the railroad, in 15 blocks of varying sizes, and later, incorporated as a city in 1867.

In 1903 Kinmundy was struck by a fire in the evening that burnt down most of the downtown area, causing the sharpest drop in population in the town&#x27;s history. One of the buildings that burnt was the opera house, which was rebuilt before burning again for the second, and final time in 1916, not being rebuilt afterward.

In January 1912, Illinois Central Railroad train No. 3, traveling at , collided with passenger train No. 25, which was standing at the station in Kinmundy taking water. The devastating train wreck demolished the private car at the rear of train No. 25, killing five passengers, among them James T. Harahan, the recently-retired president of the Illinois Central Railroad.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Landmarks ===
The stately Italianate Calendar Rohrbough House, located on so-called &quot;Quality Hill&quot;, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Illinois Central Railroad Water Tower and Pump House was added to the National Register of Historic places in 1998.

The Kinmundy Log Cabin Village is a collection of twelve original pioneer homes rescued in the 1960s from the surrounding local region and reassembled in a wooded area on the edge of the town. All of the cabins pre-date the American Civil War, with the oldest originally constructed in 1818. The log cabin village plays host to an annual fall craft fair, during which the village is populated by local volunteers and crafts people in period dress and the authentically furnished homes are open to the public. Some of the volunteers are descendants of the original residents of the historic cabins.

Stephen A. Forbes State Recreation Area lies about southeast of the town and offers trails, camping, hunting, and fishing. The park features a man-made lake which was completed in 1968 and boasts of shoreline.

<text>Odin is a village in Marion County, Illinois, United States. The population was 935 at the 2020 census, down from 1,076 in 2010.

==History==

Odin originally was settled chiefly by Scandinavians. The village was named after Odin, a god in Germanic mythology.

The Territory of Illinois was separated from that of Indiana in 1809. The newly appointed governor for this territory was Ninian Edwards, and the seat of government established at Kaskaskia. By an act of Congress in April 1818, Illinois was admitted to the Union as the twenty-second state, with Shadrach Bond the first governor.

Marion County was organized on January 24, 1823, and named for General Francis Marion, a hero of the Revolutionary War.
Odin Township originally had the villages of Odin and Sandoval within its boundaries. However, in 1896 it was divided into Odin and Sandoval townships.

The hundredth anniversary of the village dates from the time the Illinois Central Railroad secured land grants in order to build the railroad from Chicago to Cairo. The land not needed for the railroad bed was later sold to interested farmers for eight to twelve dollars per acre. Payments could be made over a period of several years.

Thomas Deadmond, a Virginian, was Odin Township&#x27;s first settler. He arrived in the timber in the southern part in 1827. The season was well advanced. He erected a shed-home with the roof slanted toward the north and the south wall left open. A log fire afforded warmth and a cooking area. Mr. Deadmond entered eighty acres in section 28 in January 1837.

Silas Barr came to the township in 1829. Two years later he entered the first tract of land in section 27. Soon his brother James N. Barr came from Tennessee. This was the father of Oliver Barr and grandfather of Hobart Barr. Samuel McClelland settled in 1830 near Silas Barr. Three brothers by the name of Wilburn settled here at an early date. James Adams, Thomas Pigg and John Hill were early settlers and were respected for their honesty.

All the farms in this locality were for many years confined to the timber but Bluford Deadmond ventured out into the prairie and selected a farm site near the center of the township.

Early settlers in the northern part of the township were G. L. Chitwood, John Davidson, John Puleston, John Vaugh and Silas Hurd.

The village is sixty-five miles from St. Louis, 244 miles from Chicago and situated at the crossing of the two railroads; Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad and Illinois Central Railroad. It was incorporated as a town in 1865 and was placed under village organization in 1874. Its liveliest times were during the civil war when it possessed a record for robbers, gamblers, blacklegs and people of which could not be excelled. Since the civil war these people faded away and the town filled with a better class of people.

In 1960, Odin had 1,000 inhabitants, five churches and one or more soon to be built. A well graded public school, a public library association. She had a brick and tile factory and was democratic by a small majority as is also Marion County. Several clubs were in town; Odin Lodge no 503, Odin Women&#x27;s Relief Corps, American Legion Auxiliary, Old Maids Convention, Odin Fancy Work Club, Odin Dramatic Club, Odin Junior Women&#x27;s Club, Odin PTA, Odin Woman&#x27;s Garden Club, The Odin Fire Department.

Early business establishments included A. M Woodward General Store; J. M. Dace Confectionery; S. D. Phillips Drug Store; Hurd and Harroun Implement Shop; E. E. Hudson Paint Store; Eccles Brothers Bakery, E. A. Parks Jewelry Story; C. F. Krodell General Store; Scott Davidson Livery and Grains; C. O. Stanford Clothier; Wilson Dace Jeweler; Lewis Print Shop and Odin Newspaper; Barber Shops of Walter Turner and Charles Arrowsmith; Odin Bank with W. H. Farthing cashier; Tot&#x27;s Hat Shop; T. H.

Holsapple opened a blacksmith shop in 1909; C E Sloan open the lumber yard. Post office was established in 1861.

Odin School was held in the Smith Hall at one time for extra room, another time in the Schumaker Building, then later about 1898 or 1899 extra rooms were in the Presbyterian Church which stood a block west of the main school, still later in the wooden frame building across the street to the west. The average wage paid to teachers was $12.00 per month. In 1880 the average wage paid to male teachers was $37.15 and female teachers was $26.32 per month.

=== Odin Coal Company ===

A mass convention of the citizens was called for the purpose of considering the propriety and manner of organizing a coal and mining company. The capital stock was placed at $25,000 and after four months of steady work and united efforts the entire amount of stock was taken without the assistance of outside capital. The mine commission consisted of W. H. Phillips, J. G. Vaughn, L. Somerville, F. D. Secor, W. H. Cole, W. E. Smith, N. B. Morrison, A. M. Woodard and E. Sharp; all prominent and influential citizens.

The company was incorporated under the laws of the state, and the contract for sinking the shaft was awarded to Messrs. Earls &amp; Paul, mine contractors of Sandoval, Illinois. N. B. Morrison was president. Officially recorded as ISGS Index #87, Odin Coal Company, 1 Shaft, Method = Modified Room and Pillar (MRP), 1887–1939, Seam Mined = Herrin Twp 2N, Rge 1E, Sec 13.

Coal was expected at a depth of 600 feet and was not found until 669 feet in 1886. At that time the whistle at the shaft announced that coal had been found, bringing excitement to the town. A grand barbecue and picnic in honor of the event was held with Hon. William D. Farthing the committee chairman. 5000 people attended the celebration and had speeches from Gov. Oglesby, US Attorney G. Van Hoorbeke and others.

Odin Coal Co. pays machine men $2.00 per day, shooters the same, loaders 10 cents per day; 50 cents for screened coal and 35 cents for gross-weight coal. One of the customers of Odin CC was University of Illinois. In 1899, UofI board took the following action though.

The action of the committee was confirmed. Mr. Bullard offered the following resolution, which was adopted : WHEREAS, The Board through its Committee on Buildings and Grounds did invite proposals for coal for the university for the year beginning with September 1899; and WHEREAS, On the 16th day of August last bids were opened and the contract for furnishing fuel for the year was awarded to the Odin Coal Company on their proposal of $1.00 per ton for pea coal delivered f. o. b. cars in Champaign or Urbana—the lowest bid which was received—and WHEREAS, The said Odin Coal Company has failed repeatedly to furnish coal of the quantity and quality as stipulated; and WHEREAS, There is no forfeiture or penalty attached for failure to furnish coal by the said Odin Coal Company; therefore, be it Resolved, That the Committee on Buildings and Grounds is hereby instructed to make an additional contract for furnishing coal to the university for said year in such quantity and at such rates as it best can for the interests of the university, so that the university may not be compelled at any time to go into the market and buy coal at local market prices. Mr. Bullard read a proposition from the Sangamon Coal Company offering to furnish the university pea coal, two or three cars a week until April 1, at $1.20 per ton, f. o. b . cars Urbana or Champaign, and on his motion the proposition was accepted. The Secretary was instructed to notify the company of the acceptance of its proposition.

* In 1897, Fred F&#x27;elax, a loader in the Odin coal mine, was seriously injured by falling coal and died from the effects of it that same evening. He leaves a widow and four children. He was 48 years of age. 
* In 1898 Charles Denman rode a cage with no guard protection to the top. The cage stopped a little high off the ground landing, it was dark and the lights were very poor. He stepped off and fell back in the shaft 700 feet to his death. His wife Ellie sued Odin CC and was awarded $2000 in 1899.

From 1907 to 1936 the mine had a national safety record working without a fatal accident. James Bradley was killed in 1936 with a fall of coal and rock. The mine had two bad mule barn fires. The first killing 18 of the 21 mules in 1906. The 1910 mule barn fire did not have any mules die.

The Odin Mine was fully developed by 1902 with a tonnage of 1000 tons per eight hour day employing 200 men. The mine worked above average until 1924 when the old tipple burned. A modern tipple was built in 1925 but the tonnage dropped to 800 tons. By 1930 the depression was on. The coal business was so bad the company could not compete with the mines who had larger shafts and the mine went into receivership in 1936. The mine officially shut down in 1938.

The Patoka Oil Terminal is located between Patoka and Vernon. It is an oil hub that connects many oil pipelines, similar to the much larger oil tank farm near Cushing, Oklahoma. Some of the pipelines that connect to this oil tank farm are the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Enbridge Pipeline System, and the Trunkline Pipeline.

==Notable people==
* Drew Baldridge (born 1991), country music singer. He was a childhood resident of Patoka before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career.

<text>Sandoval is a town in Marion County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,157 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the early days, this area was the crossroads of well traveled Indian trails. A man with the name of Sandoval was the first to establish a trading post. In 1859 the town of Sandoval was incorporated.

Many civil war soldiers passed through Sandoval, which was also a point for enlistment. The 40th Illinois Infantry was accepted May 25, 1861, and went into camp here August 5. With 700 strong, orders were given to proceed to Illinois Town (East St. Louis), then across the river to Jefferson Barracks. Joined with other troops they went on to Savannah, Tennessee and a permanent camp at Pittsburg Landing. More than ½ the regiment was killed or wounded. This regiment, after other engagements, was with Sherman on his march to the Sea and took part in the Grand Review at Washington D.C.. General Ambrose E. Burnside and his troops were also camped here while on their way to aid General Grant.

Sandoval had two major railroads that crossed through the town. The B &amp; O, running east–west, and the Illinois Central running north–south.

Sandoval is located at the junction of US Highways 50 and 51. At the time the US Highways were numbered, this was the meeting point of the central north–south route with the central east–west route, an equal number of highways being numbered to the north, south, east and west.

US Highway 50 is an extension of the Mason-Dixon line that divided the North from &quot;Dixie&quot;.

Sandoval was the population center of the United States for a considerable portion of the 20th century.

Sandoval&#x27;s central location in the United States was recognized early on. The town was originally platted as a replacement for Washington, D.C., with space reserved for the White House and other branches of government.

In the 1890s, Sandoval was a sundown town, prohibiting African Americans from entering or living in the town.

==Geography==

Sandoval is located in western Marion County. U.S. Route 50 passes through the village center as Missouri Avenue, leading east to Salem, the county seat, and west to Carlyle. U.S. Route 51 runs through the east side of the village on Mine Street, leading north to Vandalia and south to Centralia.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Sandoval has a total area of , all land. Prairie Creek, a southwest-flowing tributary Lost Creek, crosses the southeast corner of the village.

<doc id="111618" wikidata="Q596315" url="?curid=111618" title="Walnut Hill, Illinois">
<text>Walnut Hill is a village in Marion County, Illinois, United States. The population was 95 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Walnut Hill was once the intersection of two of the main roads in Illinois: the George Rogers Clark Trace and the Yadda Road.

The original capital of Illinois was at Kaskaskia, southwest of present-day Walnut Hill. The overland route from Kaskaskia to the interior of the state followed the Kaskaskia/Big Muddy 
River divide, which went through Walnut Hill. George Rogers Clark marched through Walnut Hill in February 1779 on his march from Fort Kaskaskia to Fort Vincennes, which resulted in the conquest of Illinois by the army of Virginia.

Traces of the Kaskaskia/Vincennes road can be seen in several short stretches in northwestern Jefferson County, which point toward Walnut Hill, ignoring the surveyed Section boundaries. Northeast of Walnut Hill, the Kell Road is a winding, pioneer road up to its intersection with Interstate 57, from which it follows the modern Section lines to Kell.

Walnut Hill was also on the Goshen Road, an early road across Illinois, from Shawneetown to the Goshen Settlement near Glen Carbon. Remnants of the Goshen Road can be seen in short segments of Pioneer Road between Dix and Walnut Hill. The construction of the railroad tracks from Dix to Walnut Hill possibly obliterated much of the original Goshen road.

In 1823, Thomas D. Minor built a road from Mount Vernon to Walnut Hill. This was called the &quot;Vandalia Road&quot;, in that it connected with roads to the new state capital in Vandalia. The new road joined the Goshen Road just south of Walnut Hill. Today, it is called the &quot;Old Centralia Road&quot;. The new road eventually captured much of the traffic on the Goshen Road since it provided a shorter route across Jefferson County.

The modern road (Walnut Hill Road) running northwest out of Walnut Hill toward Centralia is the same as the Goshen Road as shown on the original survey maps of Illinois.

===William Goings Gang===
In the early 19th century, William Goings (also spelled Goins) kept a tavern that was presumably on land homesteaded by Goings about two miles south of Walnut Hill in Jefferson County. Goings led a band of robbers known as the &quot;Goings Gang&quot; that preyed on frontier travelers on the Vincennes-St. Louis Trace, a dirt road that was originally an old bison path that extended through southern Illinois. The gang operated a series of connected frontier taverns along this road, passing information on to gang members whenever a traveler worth robbing stopped at one of their taverns. When the unfortunate traveler reached a remote spot, the gang members would assemble and relieve them of their property.

As in other frontier areas, neighboring settlers overlooked this activity until the Goings Gang escalated to murder in 1818–1819. In response, the settlers organized a group of vigilantes or &quot;rangers&quot; who surprised the Goings Gang at Walnut Hill. The gang members were tied to trees, flogged, and ordered to leave the county, an order which all but one obeyed. The following year, the vigilantes returned and cropped the ears of this obstinate gang member, who may have been criminal gang leader William Goings, possibly because they believed he had no use for his ears as he would not listen and cease in his criminal activities. The tavern site of one of the reported gang members, Samuel Young of Marion County, was excavated by archaeologists working for the Illinois Department of Transportation in 1988 prior to its destruction by a highway project

==Geography==
Walnut Hill is located in southwestern Marion County. Its southern border is the Jefferson County line. The county boundary is the baseline of the Third Principal Meridian, also called the Centralia Baseline. The survey of this area was begun as early as 1804.

Centralia is to the northwest of Walnut Hill, and Salem, the Marion county seat, is to the northeast. Mount Vernon, the Jefferson County seat, is 14 miles to the southeast.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Walnut Hill has a total area of , all land. To the north of Walnut Hill is Raccoon Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the Kaskaskia River. To the south is the Big Muddy River, a small creek at the northernmost limit of its watershed. Walnut Hill is thus on the Kaskaskia/Big Muddy divide. That divide is a ridge that formed a natural, pioneer highway from Sparta to Kell, perhaps properly called the &quot;Highway to Kell&quot;.

<text>Henry is a city in Marshall County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,320 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Peoria Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Henry is named after General James D. Henry and was initially surveyed in 1834. The topography of the land on the west side of the Illinois River, with relatively steep banks rising well above river level, assured early settlers that their homes would not flood.

Its slogan, &quot;Best Town in Illinois by a Dam Site&quot;, is derived from the city&#x27;s distinction of having the first lock and dam built on the Illinois River. It was completed in 1870 at a cost of $400,000.

The retreat house of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria (Nazareth Retreat House, formerly King&#x27;s House) is located here.

==Geography==
Henry is located in northern Marshall County at (41.113152, -89.360218). It is bordered to the east by the Illinois River, which forms the boundary with Putnam County. Illinois Route 18 passes through the center of Henry as Third Street and School Street, leading southwest across the Illinois River on the Henry Bridge, then east to Streator. Illinois Route 29 passes through the west side of the city, leading north and east to Spring Valley and southwest to Peoria.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Henry has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.85%, are water, consisting of the Illinois River and its inlets.

==Geomorphology and geology==
Henry lies on a segment of a river terrace that is about long and just over wide. This fluvial terrace is underlain by stratified; yellowish brown to grayish brown; calcareous; and usually clean and moderately well sorted sand and gravel with cobbles and boulders. These sands and gravels contain occasional beds of silt and clay and unconformably overlie older sand and gravel deposits, glacial till]], or bedrock. The sands and gravels underlying the terrace on which Henry lies were deposited by the Kankakee Torrent about 19,000 BP calibrated years ago.

Within the Illinois River valley, these sediments typically range from thick. These and other Wisconsinan coarse-grained, fluvial sands and gravel within Illinois have been named after the city of Henry and are currently known as the Henry Formation, a geological formation. The parts of the Henry Formation which are of fluvial or glaciofluvial origin are designated as the Mackinaw facies of the Henry Formation. The original exposure from which the Henry Formation was named was a former sand and gravel pit that was located along Illinois Highway 29, north of Henry.

<text>Toluca is a city in Marshall County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,340 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Peoria, Illinois, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Toluca is located in eastern Marshall County at (41.003368, -89.133244).

==History==
Toluca was established in 1887 as a stop on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway, on land owned by Marshall County native William Twist. In that year, local farmers led by Twist requested that the railroad make Toluca a regular stop. Their request was granted. With the backing of a Chicago firm, a grain elevator was built and maintained by Thomas Colehower of Long Point, Illinois. Colehower built the first house in the area of Toluca now called Old Town. In 1892, the Devlin Coal Company began mining coal at Toluca.

The population of Toluca increased, and by 1894 it was incorporated as a city. Its growth continued, fueled by immigrants from Poland, Italy, and Lithuania who came to work in the coal mines. In 1900, it had approximately 2,629 inhabitants. But by 1924, the coal mines were unprofitable and they closed down. The population shrank drastically as a result.

Miners from Toluca led a mob for the lynching of F. W. Stewart at Lacon on November 7, 1898.

<text>David Alfred Andrade (30 April 1859 – 23 May 1928) was an Australian individualist and free market anarchist.

==Biography==
His parents were Abraham Da Costa Andrade and Maria Giles, both from Middlesex, England. His brother William Charles Andrade was an anarchist too. They were active in Joseph Symes&#x27;s Australasian Secular Association.

On 14 May 1886, David Andrade, his brother Will and half a dozen others formed the Melbourne Anarchist Club, the first anarchist organisation in Australia. Andrade became the club secretary and one of its main propagandists.

The Melbourne Anarchist Club produced the journal &quot;Honesty&quot;, an Australian organ of anarchism which had substantially the same principles as those championed by Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Liberty&quot;. In a news agency at Brunswick, now an inner suburb of Melbourne, and later in Liberty Hall, Russell St. Melbourne the brothers operated the first anarchist book shops in Australia. Andrade was a vegetarian and with his brother operated the first vegetarian restaurant in Melbourne.

Andrade&#x27;s main works include &quot;Money: A Study of the Currency Question&quot; (1887), &quot;Our Social System&quot; (n.d.), &quot;An Anarchist Plan of Campaign&quot; (1888), and &quot;The Melbourne Riots and how Harry Holdfast and his Friends Emancipated the Workers&quot; (1892).

In the early 1890s, Andrade was the secretary of the Unemployed Workers Association.

He became a settler with his family at Fern Tree Gully. However, bush fires destroyed everything around 1898. He was admitted to the Yarra Bend Asylum, with his wife and four children left without support. On 1 December 1903, he was admitted to the Ballarat Hospital for the Insane. According to hospital records, at the time he was &quot;in good bodily health and suffered from delusional insanity.&quot; He became gradually weaker from old age in his final years, and died at the hospital on 23 May 1928. The cause of death was found to be senility and heart failure. He was buried on 25 May at St Kilda Cemetery.

<text>Wenona is a city in Marshall and LaSalle counties in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 974 at the 2020 census.

The Marshall County portion of Wenona is part of the Peoria Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion that lies in LaSalle County is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Around 1852, the first buildings had been erected within the town, including living quarters for the rail-men, the freight depot, and passenger station. This same year, the house for Gr. W. Goodwell, Wenona&#x27;s station agent and first postmaster, was completed. Along with the post office, in June 1854, the Presbyterian Church was set up. During the winter months of 1854, W.M Brown arrived in Wenona with a large stock of goods; a building was constructed to accommodate his sales. Wenona was laid off by the Illinois Central Railroad Company on May 15, 1855. At the time, the town had around nine buildings and fifty permanent citizens. By 1858 it had grown rapidly, and was now a thrifty village of several hundred inhabitants, with two hotels, a number of stores, and other branches of business in proportion.

A great amount of grain was annually shipped at this point, and a considerable amount of trade was carried on with the surrounding country. The largest single industry contributing to the growth and prosperity of Wenona was its coal mine, located in the northeast quarter of the town, east of the Illinois Central tracks. The mine was opened under the Hamilton-Hodge-Monser partnership and was incorporated November 9, 1882, as the Wenona Coal Company. The partnership was soon dissolved, and ownership passed on to E. L. Monser, with George S. Monser production manager and W. E. Monser sales manager. The vein of coal varied from to . Peak employment numbered 550 miners and the average payroll approximated $30,000 per month, paid to employees in gold coin for a number of years, later cash at the mine and finally by checks at the bank. The mine operated from 1882 to 1924, at which time it was closed never to reopen. A new union scale was said to have made it unprofitable for the company to continue mining such a thin vein.

It was during the operation of the mine and World War I that the population of Wenona reached an all-time high of 1892 inhabitants. It was said by old timers that on the day after pay-day at the mines, the Chicago &amp; Alton depot was so crowded with people that the railroad could not accommodate its out-of-town passengers.

At the height of the Cold War, the highest spot in town played a role in US defense. Beginning in April 1958, atop the slag pile from the old Wenona coal mine, a radar station was developed which was equipped to detect incoming missiles and enemy airplanes potentially headed to Chicago or Milwaukee. The radar station was manned by approximately 20 troops from the 45th AAA Brigade and the 105th Signal Corps Detachment. It could detect aircraft as far up as in any direction, and as far away as . The Wenona station was one of ten stations set up in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin within of Chicago in the Chicago Air Defense System. The radar station included two metal buildings and the radar antenna. The base of the slag pile was surrounded by a six-strand barbed-wire fence. Prior to constructing the buildings on top of the slag pile, were graded off the top and a circular roadway was built around the slag pile from bottom to top. At least three men who served at the Wenona Radar Station settled in Wenona after completion. The Army left Wenona in 1959, but before leaving town, planted the seeds on the mound which gave way to the beautiful forestry seen today.

The Wenona Coal Mine Historical Site was dedicated by members of the Wenona Historical Society on August 10, 2018, during the Wenona Days celebration.

==Geography==
Most of the city lies in Marshall County, although two small areas of about a block each extend east into southern LaSalle County. In the 2000 census, all of Wenona&#x27;s 1,065 residents lived in Marshall County. As of 2022, Wenona has a total area of , all land.

Illinois Route 17 passes through Wenona as Chestnut Street. The highway leads east to Dwight and west to Lacon, the Marshall county seat. Illinois Route 251 joins Route 17 on Chestnut Street through the center of Wenona but leads north to Lostant and south to Rutland. Interstate 39 passes just west of Wenona, with access from Exit 35 south of the city; I-39 leads north to La Salle and south to Normal.

Wenona is drained to the north by tributaries of Sandy Creek, which flows west to the Illinois River at Henry.

<text>Havana is a city and the county seat of Mason County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,963 at the 2020 census, a decline from the figure of 3,301 tabulated in 2010.

==History==
Havana was a major ancient American settlement two thousand years ago, when the largest verified mound of the Western Hopewell Culture was built. Local landmarks were mentioned in the journals of French explorers in the late 1600s. A religious medal dating from the early 1700s suggests that there was missionary activity in what is now Havana. When permanent English-speaking residents arrived in 1822, there was a Pottawatomie village on the site. A ferry was established to the western bank of the Illinois River to a road that followed the Spoon River. There were War of 1812 bounty lands in western Illinois.

Abraham Lincoln was a frequent visitor to Havana between his days as a soldier in the Black Hawk Wars until at least his three-hour speech on the Rockwell Mound while he was running for the US Senate in 1858. Stephen Douglas had spoken there the day before. When he was younger, Lincoln rode a mail route from New Salem to Havana. Later, he was a local surveyor, and then an itinerant attorney. Mason County was the only place where Lincoln owned farmland. The English-speaking settlement was originally called &quot;Ross&#x27;s Ferry&quot; and was later named after Havana, the capital of Cuba. Havana was notorious as a gambling river town, and it is reported that names such as Al Capone would hunt, fish, and gamble in the local clubs.

==Geography==

<text>Metropolis is a city and the county seat in Massac County, Illinois, United States. It is located by the Ohio River. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 5,969, down from 6,537 in 2010. Metropolis is part of the Paducah metropolitan area in Southern Illinois.

==History==

Located on the Ohio River, the Metropolis area has been settled by many different peoples throughout history. For thousands of years, varying cultures of Native Americans populated the area. The most complex society was the Mississippian culture, which reached its peak around AD 1100 and built a large city at Cahokia, near the Mississippi River and present-day Collinsville, Illinois, to the north opposite St. Louis, Missouri. Its people built large earthworks and related structures, many of which have been preserved and protected at the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Mississippian culture regional centers arose throughout the Ohio and lower Mississippian valleys, where the rivers were part of widespread trading routes used for exchange with other cultures.

In 1757, Massac County was settled by a French expedition, which built Fort de L&#x27;Ascension for use during the French and Indian War against the British (the war is also known as the Seven Years&#x27; War, which took place largely in Europe). The garrison at the fort was able to resist a Cherokee attack during the war. Afterward the defeated French abandoned the fort, and many moved west of the Mississippi River to escape British rule. When the victorious British colonists arrived to take control of territory ceded by the French, the Chickasaw had already destroyed the fort.

During the American Revolutionary War, the mostly ethnic French residents of the town were sympathetic to the rebels. Afterward in 1794, President George Washington ordered Fort Massac reconstructed, at a strategic site high above the Ohio River. The fort was severely damaged by the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. Rather than rebuild, the US military abandoned the facility in 1814, as its forces were needed further west. Local settlers scavenged the timbers and left little behind of the original construction materials.

This section of the state was largely settled by migrants from the Upper South, and many brought slaves with them. It was years after Illinois was admitted as a free state that all such slaves gained their freedom.

The city of Metropolis was founded in 1839 near the site of Fort Massac by a merchant from Pittsburgh and a local land owner; the two envisioned that the location on the Ohio River would become a transport hub and chose a befittingly grand name. In 1843, the Illinois Legislature formed Massac County. The McCartney family became leaders in building the town of Metropolis.

During the early years of the American Civil War, soldiers were encamped in the vicinity. Although Illinois was established as a free state, this section had many southern sympathizers. Despite this background, the state stayed with the Union during the war.

Prior to the American Civil War, some groups worked to establish a Western District of Columbia, to include present-day Metropolis and the nearby area of Kentucky. An 1850 map illustrates this proposal.

During the twentieth century, agriculture has continued to be the economic driver of the region. The state&#x27;s authorization of riverboat gambling led to Metropolis&#x27;s becoming the site of the Harrah&#x27;s Metropolis casino/hotel, a riverboat casino frequented by visitors from around the region. Tourism is one of the city&#x27;s largest industries.

Metropolis is also the site of the Honeywell Uranium Hexafluoride Processing Facility, which converts milled uranium into uranium hexafluoride for nuclear reactors.

==Geography==
Metropolis is located in southern Massac County at (37.153332, -88.725374), on the north shore of the Ohio River. It is bordered to the south, across the river, by McCracken County, Kentucky. Paducah, Kentucky, is to the southeast.

==Superman&#x27;s &quot;hometown&quot;==
In his various portrayals, Superman resides in a fictional American city named Metropolis, and on April 25, 1972, the Illinois State Legislature passed Resolution 572, commending Metropolis for its &quot;Project Superman&quot; community program.

The city has a painted bronze statue of Superman which sits in front of the county courthouse, and a statue of Noel Neill&#x27;s Lois Lane from &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; stands just a few blocks away.

Each year on the second weekend of June, Superman fans from all over the world gather in Metropolis for their annual Superman Celebration, which features celebrity guests from movies, television, and the comic book industry.

Since June 1979, the Metropolis Chamber of Commerce had organized 44 editions of the Superman Celebration.

The four-day annual celebration also boasts vendors selling food, comics, homemade crafts, and other merchandise, as well as discussion panels, auctions, a costume contest, and a variety of other events throughout the weekend. The first such celebration was organized by local civic clubs and took place in June 1979.

The local newspaper is named &quot;The Metropolis Planet&quot;, inspired by &quot;The Daily Planet&quot;, the fictional paper in the Superman comics and other Superman media.

The real town of Metropolis is portrayed in one Superman comic-book story, &quot;Superman #92&quot;, in a story titled &quot;Massacre in Metropolis!&quot; (which is continued into &quot;Adventures of Superman #515&quot;), as a town whose citizens idolize what is to them the real-life Man of Steel. A villain named Massacre arrives in the town, having gotten lost and thinking he was in the &quot;other&quot; Metropolis, the large city where Superman actually lives. He attacks a security guard and threatens many citizens in order to get proper directions to Superman&#x27;s Metropolis.

Bushnell was also served by the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway, now the Keokuk Junction Railway. Amtrak trains pass through the city but do not stop.

The Nagel Brothers of Bushnell were the first to invent a process of making rolled oats without having to steam the oats. Up until this time, the oats were first steamed to separate the groat from the hull. The patent for this new process was later sold to the Quaker Oats Company.

Coal was discovered near Colchester in the 1850s.

According to the North American Stratigraphic Code, rock units were given names that included the geographic name of a location where the rock unit was first described.

In this case, when coal was first discovered and described in Colchester, Illinois, the rock unit was named &quot;Colchester Coal&quot;. When this particular coal unit was encountered in a different location, the coal was correctly identified as Colchester Coal.

The mines in Colchester attracted immigrants from Pennsylvania. At first these included the descendants of Irish Protestant refugees from the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Later they were joined by Irish Catholic refugees from the Great Famine.

During the 1920s, Colchester was the home of Henry &quot;Kelly&quot; Wagle, a bootlegger associated with Al Capone. Wagle was involved in the production of alcohol and its transportation between Chicago and Kansas City.

<text>Macomb is a city in and the county seat of McDonough County, Illinois, United States. It is situated in western Illinois, about southwest of Peoria. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 15,051, down 22% from 19,288 in 2010. Macomb is the home of Western Illinois University.

==History==

===Origin===

First settled in 1829 on a site tentatively named &quot;Washington&quot;, the town was officially founded in 1830 as the county seat of McDonough County and given the name &quot;Macomb&quot; after Alexander Macomb, a general in the War of 1812. War veterans were given land grants in the Macomb area, which was part of the &quot;Military Tract&quot; set aside by Congress. In 1855 the Northern Cross Railroad, a predecessor to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, was constructed through Macomb, leading to a rise in the town&#x27;s population. On April 24, 1899, the Western Illinois State Normal School, currently Western Illinois University, was founded in Macomb. Representative Lawrence Sherman was instrumental in locating the school in Macomb. In 1903 the Macomb and Western Illinois Railway was built from Macomb to nearby Industry and Littleton by local financier Charles V. Chandler, though this railroad was abandoned in 1930. In 1918, construction on Illinois Route 3 was begun as a state financed highway from Cairo to Rock Island through Macomb; in the late 1920s U.S. Route 67 was extended along this route to Dubuque, Iowa.

===Presidential visits===
Macomb has been visited by several US Presidents over the years. Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Johnson, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt have all made short addresses in Macomb. On two occasions, Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama addressed large audiences prior to their election as president. Obama was stumping for the U.S. Senate at the time, meaning a president or presidential nominee has not visited Macomb in 109 years and counting.

===St. Louis Rams summer camp===
The WIU campus and its Hanson Field Stadium were home to the St. Louis Rams&#x27; football summer training camp from 1996 to 2004. In 2005, the Rams decided to move summer training to their own facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, ending the nine-year relationship.

=== Colts Drum and Bugle Corp Summer Camp ===
WIU&#x27;s Hanson Field was home to the Colts&#x27; summer training camp in 2023. The nine-time Drum Corps International (DCI) World Class Finalist, from Dubuque, IA are a group of 160 high school- and college-aged musicians, plus 40 staff members and support team members. They train, work, and live on the WIU campus for three weeks. Members live in the residence halls and practice at Hanson Field.

===Minor league baseball===
Macomb was home to the Macomb Potters, who played as members of the Class D level Illinois-Missouri League in 1909 and 1910. The team also hosted two exhibition games against the Chicago Cubs. The Potters began play after local fans raised funds to start the team.

On Friday, June 18, 1909, the Macomb Potters hosted an exhibition game against the defending World Series Champion Chicago Cubs. The game was scheduled with the agreement that the Cubs would feature their regular lineup. The selected date allowed the Cubs to play in between the Cubs&#x27; series with the Brooklyn Superbas. The game was advertised as “the greatest day in the baseball history of McDonough County,” in a large advertisement placed in the June 17, 1909 Macomb Daily Journal. The teams took infield at 2:30 p.m., with the game starting at 3:00 p.m. In front of 2,964 fans, the Cubs beat the Potters 6–0. Admission was $1.00 per ticket. After the game, each team split the gate money minus expenses and each club received $971.50.

During the 1910 season, the Macomb Potters and the Chicago Cubs played a second exhibition game in Macomb. The 1910 game was won by the Cubs 5–0.

==The Decker Press==
From 1937 to 1950, Prairie City was home to the Decker Press, which in the mid-1940s was the largest publishing house in America devoted exclusively to putting out poetry. The business was not financially successful, and its founder, Prairie City native James A. Decker, sold it to a local lumber dealer, Harry M. Denman, who in turn sold it several months later to Ervin Tax, a poet from Chicago. Decker left town, but his sister, Dorothy, remained.

Tax tried to make the business more efficient and profitable—buying new presses and binding equipment and hiring an artist, sales promoter and other employees. But the Decker Press came to a tragic end in May 1950 when Dorothy, who had fallen in love with Tax in a one-side relationship, shot Tax in the head with a rifle and then killed herself.

<text>Sciota is a village in McDonough County, Illinois, United States. The population was 38 at the 2020 census, down from 61 in 2010.

==History==
Sciota was laid out in September 1867 by William B. Clarke and was called &quot;Clarkesville&quot; in his honor. Another town in Illinois already had been named Clarksville (without the &quot;e&quot;), so when the new town&#x27;s post office was established on February 7, 1868, it was called &quot;Amicus&quot;. This discrepancy between town name and post office name led the residents to change both names to &quot;Sciota&quot;, after the township in which the town lies. (Sciota Township was named after the Scioto River in Ohio.) The Illinois General Assembly approved the name change on March 29, 1869.

A Christian church was erected in 1869, a Baptist church in 1871, and a school building in 1872.

In 1878, Sciota was the largest grain market in McDonough County. At that time, the primary crops were corn and oats; now, the village is surrounded by fields of corn and soybeans.

A newspaper, &quot;The Sciota Sentinel&quot;, was published by H. C. Harl around 1895, but only one issue seems to have survived (October 17, 1895, no. 49).

==Geography==
Sciota is located in northern McDonough County at (40.5608731, -90.7517996) at an elevation of . It is north of Illinois Route 9 and northwest of Macomb, the county seat.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Sciota has a total area of , all land. It is situated east of the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of Spring Creek, itself a tributary of the East Fork of the La Moine River, part of the Illinois River watershed.

The village of Sciota lies in an area of prime farmland with soil classified as Mollisols.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were 61 people, 26 households, and 12 families residing in the village. The racial makeup of the village was 100.00% White.

==Transportation and infrastructure==
Sciota is accessible by public roads from the south via McDonough County road East 800th Street (County Highway 13) which intersects with Illinois Route 9 1/2 mile south of the village. East 800th Street is called Buel Street within the village proper and extends north to the county line.

Sciota is served by the Keokuk Junction Railway. As of January 2010, there were two rail sidings. There is one grade crossing protected by a pair of crossbucks with flashing lights and a mechanical warning bell (no gates).

The village received a state grant of $400,000 in 2001 to connect to the Good Hope water supply system and to build a water tower. While Sciota has a water supply system, it does not have a sanitary sewer system; residents rely on septic systems for sewage disposal.

==Education==
It is home to West Prairie Community Unit School District 103. Students attend elementary school at North Elementary in Good Hope. West Prairie High School was located in Sciota and is now located in Colchester, IL.

<doc id="111650" wikidata="Q2032266" url="?curid=111650" title="Bull Valley, Illinois">
<text>Bull Valley is a village in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,128 at the 2020 census. Surrounded by larger, exurb towns of Crystal Lake, Woodstock, and McHenry, the village prides itself in its rural, low-density character. The village is in the outer most ring of the Chicago suburbs.

==History==

In 1942, a group of neighbors organized the Countryside Improvement Association. It gradually became involved in questions of land use, and in 1955, in an unprecedented action, owners of about 3,000 acres, half of the Bull Valley area at the time, voluntarily put their land into 3-acre zoning, the highest residential classification then offered by the County. This single decision would establish the future character of the community.

In 1960, money was raised from residents by subscription, to pay for a land use study and professional planning advice. The Eastern McHenry County Plan Association (EMCPA) was then formed to address the common problems of four townships. That Association’s recommendation in a report of July 25, 1961, was that a large part of the Bull Valley area be zoned for a residential/estate use of a minimum of 5-acre tracts. Unlike the traditional concept of a community where the most intense use is at the center of the area and becomes more open as the distance from the center increases, the EMCPA area has at its center, a very attractive rolling, wooded area currently developed in low density, open estate type residential and farm development (and) included in this center portion are two very broad, scenic valleys which should be retained for non-intensive development.” When McHenry County established a Planning Commission in 1963, the EMCPA dissolved and turned its studies over to the County Planning Commission.

As the County began to consider land use policy, Bull Valley residents continued to oppose development that threatened the farms, forested hills, and wetlands. Through their association, they bore the costs of legal representation at numerous zoning hearings, until it became obvious that private efforts could not win the fight to save the rural character of the land.

In 1977, the Countryside Improvement Association was reorganized as the Bull Valley Association, which initiated and campaigned for a referendum on incorporation. The referendum passed at an election held on July 23, 1977, giving residents for the first time, the authority to implement their long-standing purposes. Because state law required that a new municipality could have no fewer than 200 voters in an area of two square miles, the Village had to reach out for scattered households, hence its peculiar shape and boundaries.

In the early years of the village, there was nearly no government infrastructure. Later, a small tax was assessed to provide for simple road repairs. By the 1980s, the village had hired a police officer part-time who shared time with the neighboring village of Prairie Grove.

===The village today===

Today the Village government occupies Stickney House, one of the oldest brick buildings in the area. This house was originally built without any corners due to the belief of the Stickneys that evil spirits could live in corners. While the village has grown, and even includes some subdivisions now, it remains rural, with areas of woods, farms, and low-density housing between larger, exurb towns of Crystal Lake, Woodstock, and McHenry.

==Geography==
Bull Valley is located at (42.316132, -88.366815).

<text>Cary is a village located in Algonquin Township, McHenry County, Illinois, and Cuba Township, Lake County, Illinois, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 17,826.

==Founding==
In 1841, William Dennison Cary purchased for $1.25 an acre at the location of the current town and built a farm. In 1856, Cary included a train station for the Illinois &amp; Wisconsin Railway which connected Cary to Chicago and Janesville. The site was approved and a post office was added with the designation &quot;Cary Station.&quot; The community around Cary Station was incorporated in 1893 as Cary, Illinois.

Early farmers saw this new railway as an opportunity. The economy relied heavily on selling produce, mainly pickles, and the farmers utilized the railway to conduct business with more industrialized cities such as St. Louis and Chicago. The success of this transportation enterprise helped transform Cary into the suburban community it is today. People traveled by rail and most commerce became dependent on the railroad.

In the 1950s, highway transportation overtook rail as the primary means of moving people and goods. Northwest Highway (U.S. 14) parallels the railroad right-of-way, which has been the Union Pacific Northwest Metra line since the Union Pacific merged with the Chicago &amp; North Western in 1995.

<text>Crystal Lake is a city in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. Named after a lake southwest of the city&#x27;s downtown, Crystal Lake is northwest of Chicago. The population was 40,269 as of the 2020 census. Crystal Lake is the most populous city in McHenry County, part of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==History==

===Founding===
The City of Crystal Lake traces its origin to two communities which were established in the 1800s. Those communities were generally known as Nunda and Crystal Lake. In 1835, Ziba S. Beardsley had come to the shores of the lake and commented that the &quot;waters were as clear as crystal&quot;, thereby giving the lake its name. Ziba Beardsley continued south to Naperville. In February 1836, the first white settlers, Beman and Polly Crandall and six of their ten children, came from New York State traveling to Crystal Lake in a covered wagon. Their original cabin was built in the vicinity of today&#x27;s intersection of Virginia Street and Van Buren Street. Four of the Crandall children were born there. Najah Beardsley&#x27;s family was the second to settle in the area; his grandson, William Beardsley, was the first white child born on the Crystal Lake prairie, on May 7, 1837.

The town was first known as Crystal Ville. It was changed to Crystal Lake sometime before 1840. The area known today as downtown Crystal Lake was first called Dearborn and later, Nunda (pronounced locally as &quot;Nun-day&quot;), from an area in New York where many settlers originated. The village of Dearborn was founded in the 1850s after an extension of railroads through the area. The first train station was built in 1856, although it was pre-fabricated and shipped from Chicago on a flatcar. At that time, the main business district for the village of Crystal Lake was located on Virginia Street, about one mile (1.6 km) southwest of the railroad station. The railroad served to connect both the people and industries of Crystal Lake and Dearborn to Chicago and the rest of the country.

On October 7, 1868, Dearborn&#x27;s name was changed to Nunda. The village was platted in 1868 by local surveyor, John Brink, after whom a downtown street is now named. The village included the area now generally bounded by Illinois Route 176 on the north, Crystal Lake Avenue on the south, Main Street on the east, and Walkup Avenue on the west. Much of the land was originally owned by two early settlers, Daniel Ellsworth and Simon S. Gates. The villages of Crystal Lake and Nunda were both incorporated in 1874. In 1908, the name of the village of Nunda changed its name to North Crystal Lake. Several attempts were made to consolidate the two villages, and finally, after much disagreement, the village of North Crystal Lake was annexed to the Village of Crystal Lake in 1914, and a consolidated city government was established.

===Dole family===


Back in the 1860s, when the town of Crystal Lake was about 25 years old, Charles S. Dole purchased over of land overlooking the lake. It was his dream to construct an elaborate estate that would reflect his position as a successful businessman. He was an early member of the Chicago Board of Trade, being associated with Armour, Dole &amp; Co. in Chicago. To carry out his plan, he built a three-story mansion with adjoining gardens and stables. European craftsmen were imported to lay parquet floors, fashion archways and carve interior wood work from black walnut trees grown on the property. As a final touch, he brought in Italian artisans to build several marble fireplaces. According to Mr. Dole&#x27;s obituary, construction costs exceeded $100,000, an enormous amount of money in those days.

The estate was known as Lakeland Farm. Mr. Dole lived there with his wife Julia, his mother-in-law, Mrs. Harriet Coffin, his two daughters, Mary Florence, Harriet (Hattie), and son, Sydney. Dole maintained the estate for over 30 years, entertaining lavishly. As an example, for his daughter&#x27;s wedding in 1883 he built a spur line from the Chicago and Northwestern railway tracks almost to his doorstep. A canopied and carpeted walkway extended from the front door to the train enabling the guests to walk to the mansion for the ceremony and return to the train without concern for the weather. Notable wedding guests included Julian Rumsey (mayor of Chicago and Dole&#x27;s first cousin) and Levi Leiter (first partner with Marshall Field).

Mr. Dole&#x27;s interests changed throughout the years. He laid out a half-mile racetrack on his property and purchased the finest horses that money could buy, soon accumulating a string of horses that was the envy of northern Illinois. It is said that Dole loved to go up in his tower (currently closed off) and watch his horses run. When tired of the fad of his stable, he disposed of his horses by holding an elaborate sale. The Doles lived in the mansion until the late 1890s when the property was sold to his son-in-law for $1.00.

During the early 1900s, the property was owned and operated by several ice companies. Ice was harvested from Crystal Lake and shipped by rail to nearby Chicago. The advent of refrigeration brought about the decline of the ice business. After laying vacant for several years, the property was sold in 1922 to the Lake Development Company. The building was purchased by the First Congregational Church of Crystal Lake in 1977. The annex portion of the structure was renovated by thousands of hours of volunteer work. The Church named the facility &quot;Lakeside Center&quot; and operated it as a community activities center, hosting Friendship House Day Care Center for children, church offices, meeting rooms, reception hall, and retreat facilities. Today the Dole Mansion is owned by the Lakeside Legacy, along with Lakeside center, which is the building connected to the Dole Mansion. Dole Mansion is located along the lake, and there is a festival held on the grounds every year.

===Eliza Ringling===
Ringling Road is an east-west road which curves from Country Club Road back up to Lake Avenue. There are less than one dozen houses that claim a Ringling Road address; but those houses range from a small, stone cottage to large, imposing mansions. Ringling Road provides the northern boundary for the Dole Mansion property. The road was named after Eliza &quot;Lou&quot; Ringling who, as founder of the Lake Development Company, purchased the Dole Mansion in 1922 and converted it into the Crystal Lake Country Club. The transaction involved nearly a half million dollars and was one of the largest real estate deals handled in the area. The original Crystal Lake Country Club faltered in the stock market crash of 1929, and Mrs. Ringling, with her group of investors (the Lake Development Company) subdivided much of the large Dole estate into what is known as the Country Club Additions subdivision parts of which are in the neighboring village Lakewood, Illinois.

Eliza &quot;Lou&quot; Ringling was the widow of the oldest Ringling brother, Albert, of circus fame.

===Teco pottery===
The American Terra Cotta Tile and Ceramic Company was founded in 1881 just north of Crystal Lake, Illinois. Most of the workers at the tile and ceramic works factory lived in Crystal Lake, The production consisted of drain tile, brick and architectural items. In 1886 the Gates Pottery was established as a subsidiary with William D. Gates, a Crystal Lake area native as its president. The company fabricated architectural glazed terra cotta that was used on buildings designed by architects Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright in the style of the Prairie School. American Terra Cotta&#x27;s company records show that architectural glazed terra cotta was used on many local buildings including Oak Manufacturing Company, Teckler Building, Cohn Store, Telephone Exchange and Commercial Building, El Tovar Theatre, Crystal Lake Community High School (now Crystal Lake Central High School) and additions, Central School and additions, Pure Oil Research Lab and additions, Sinclair Refining Company Service Station, Warner Building, Citizens State Bank, Garbe Garage, Home State Bank, various Williams Street stores and bakeries, and Martinetti&#x27;s Restaurant and Motel.

Gates used the facilities to experiment with clays and glazes in an effort to design a line of art pottery which led to the introduction of Teco pottery (from TErra COtta, but pronounced locally as &quot;Tea-co&quot;) in 1902. Many of the pottery pieces were designed by architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright. Produced for only a few years, this pottery exemplifies the Arts and Crafts Movement and today is highly sought after by art collectors. Teco pottery is in the collection of many museums.

===Recent history===

On April 11, 1965, during the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, a large and devastating tornado damaged or destroyed large portions of the city. Six people were killed by the tornado, and a further 75 wounded. Damages in the city totaled over $1.5 million, as 80 homes, mostly in the Coventry and Colby’s Home Estates neighborhoods, and a shopping center were completely destroyed. Disaster shelters were set up to house the homeless, and then-governor of Illinois, Otto Kerner, Jr., personally visited the city to view the damage.

Crystal Lake is the city where the tradition of giving gold coins to the Salvation Army anonymously began in 1982.

During the 1970s, the Academy Awards Oscar statues were cast in Crystal Lake.

In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the history of Crystal Lake consisted mainly of the growth of suburban subdivisions, as the population increased to 38,000 in the 2000 Census from 21,823 in the 1990 Census. In order to deal with the growth, Crystal Lake South High School was opened in 1978. Previously, Crystal Lake Community High School (now Crystal Lake Central High School) had served the entire city of Crystal Lake since 1924. A third high school, Prairie Ridge High School, opened in 1997 north of the city to accommodate the spread moving into the area between Crystal Lake and the two communities directly to its north, Prairie Grove and Bull Valley.

In 2015, Crystal Lake was ranked tenth best city among 1,268 U.S. cities with populations between 25,000 and 100,000 by WalletHub.

In 2016, it was reported that there were zero retail vacancies in the downtown district of Crystal Lake. This was the case until 2017.

Aaron T. Shepley was the mayor of Crystal Lake from 1999 to his death in 2020, making him the longest-serving mayor in the city&#x27;s history.

On July 7, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden visited McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, becoming the first sitting president to visit the city. Then-Vice President George H. W. Bush had twice visited Crystal Lake in 1988 while campaigning for president.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Crystal Lake has a total area of , of which (or 96.8%) is land and (or 3.2%) is water.

In 2023, census data reported that Crystal Lake has a total area of 18.985 square miles (49.10 km²), of which 18.35 square miles (47.53 km²) (or 96.8%) is land and 0.613 square miles (1.59 km²) (or 3.2%) is water.

===Neighborhoods===
As the largest city in McHenry County, Crystal Lake contains three high schools and has many separate neighborhoods.

Starting from the north of the city, the ten largest neighborhoods are easy to trace out. The first has no de facto name like the others, but is referred to as &quot;by Prairie Ridge,&quot; referring to the nearby high school of the same name. Houses in this neighborhood are large and widely spaced. The entire area lies just to the north of the city, from the downtown area to the adjacent community of Bull Valley. Some of the communities include Deer Wood, Covered Bridge Trails and Walk-up Woods. Next is downtown Crystal Lake, which rings Crystal Lake Central High School. Houses here range greatly in size and age, and it is the most diverse neighborhood in the city. Directly south of downtown Crystal Lake is the Coventry neighborhood, named for the major through street Coventry Lane. Students in the Coventry neighborhood attend either Central High School of Crystal Lake or Crystal Lake South High School. Oral tradition holds that Coventry was originally populated by pilots who fly out of O&#x27;Hare Airport. The neighborhood Burtons Bridge is located at the north-eastern side of Crystal Lake.
To the southwest of downtown Crystal Lake is the sprawling Four Colonies neighborhood, which covers nearly . Students from Four Colonies attend both Central and South High School. South of Four Colonies is The Villages neighborhood, which is named for its major thoroughfare, Village Road. An important feature of The Villages is Indian Prairie Elementary School, which is built on a large and steep series of hills that is a favorite sledding location during the snowy months. The residents attend South High School. A neighborhood Northeast of Four Colonies is Wedgewood. Wedgewood includes five ponds, and a forest that backs up to Huntley Road, with a paved walking path. Wedgewood has five brick entrance signs saying &quot;Wedgewood&quot;, and 3 prominent entrances; the front entrance on Huntley Road&#x27;s intersection with Lakeview Drive, the back entrance on Huntley Road&#x27;s intersection with Boneset Drive, and the side entrance on Country Club Road. Wedgewood consists of single family homes and multi-family dwellings such as townhouses. Wedgewood Drive circles the whole neighborhood, and is a -mile circle.

Other neighborhoods in Crystal Lake ring the town&#x27;s namesake lake, and are called West End, North Shore, and the Vista. These neighborhoods consist of many older homes built on the lake shore, and vary greatly in size and style. Effectively a neighborhood and occupying the entire south shore of the lake is the independent Village of Lakewood, historically a restricted community connected strongly to the Crystal Lake Country Club alongside it.

===Climate===
The city&#x27;s climate is much like that of its large neighboring city, Chicago. The city experiences hot summers and cold winters, with temperatures slightly more extreme than those of closer suburbs, because rural land still surrounds the city. Due to the lack of the urban heat island effect, Crystal Lake experiences colder nights and lower precipitation than recorded at Chicago. High temperatures are usually comparable to those in Chicago, with only a few degrees difference on most days.

The hottest month of the year is July, when the average high temperature is approximately . Temperatures in July, and in summer in general, can frequently exceed , and occasionally exceed , although this does not happen each year. The coldest month of the year is January, where the average high temperature is . Overnight low temperatures are usually around . In winter, the low temperatures fall below on many (often as many as fifteen or twenty) occasions per year. Extremely cold nights may record temperatures as low as or lower, but this is rare and does not happen each year.

The wettest month of the year is August, when thunderstorms contribute brief, heavy downpours of rain. July is the second-wettest month of the year, also mainly due to thunderstorms. However, long dry spells can also occur at this time of year, sometimes lasting weeks. The two driest months of the year are January and February, where almost all of the precipitation falls as snow. In a typical year, total precipitation is with a winter snowfall total of . Large snowstorms, although rare, do occur and can accumulate large amounts of snow. In many years, at least one storm will deliver of snow in one day. Most snow-bearing systems are Alberta clippers, while the more infrequent heavy snows are caused by Panhandle hooks.

==Arts and culture==

Crystal Lake, as a city, is large enough to entertain its cultural institutions. However, it also shares many cultural opportunities with the city of Chicago, and the other large communities which surround it, as they are easily accessible from Crystal Lake, and vice versa. The city is home to the &quot;Northwest Herald&quot;, the only daily newspaper published in McHenry County. The newspaper deals mainly with local issues, but also carries national and world news. Churches are also a large influence within the city, hosting many annual events. Crystal Lake is also home to WZSR Star 105.5, owned by Alpha Media, which broadcasts throughout the northwest suburbs and Fox Valley.

Another large presence in the city is the Crystal Lake Park District, which runs all of the city&#x27;s numerous parks and the yearly events which take place within them. Two major parks run by the park district are Veterans Acres, along Walkup Road, and Main Beach, along with the namesake Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake is open whenever the weather is accommodating. However, boating is often restricted due to disputes with both the homeowners on the lake and the village of Lakewood, in which approximately 30% of the lake lies. The Crystal Lake Rowing Club has a boathouse in Kamijima Park, on the west end of Crystal Lake, and rows on the lake during the no-wake hours (usually early mornings and early evenings). In Crystal Lake lies the famed Dole mansion, where visitors can take tours for a small donation.

Among the city&#x27;s sites of interest is the historic downtown district. The downtown district, which recently has undergone a revitalization, is home to many small specialty shops and businesses, and is a local shopping district. Also located in the downtown district is the Raue Center for the Arts, which seats 750 and performs plays and hosts concerts throughout the year. Raue Center has recently transformed itself into a regional destination spot by providing an in house professional theater company, Williams Street Repertory, Jazz Festival launched by Ramsey Lewis and hosting several recent Tony, Grammy, and Academy award winners. The Raue Center has received four MacArthur Grants and regularly receives National Endowment for the Arts support. The city is also home to the Crystal Lake Strikers Drumline, Crystal Lake Community Band, and Encore Music Academy, home of Encore Youth Choir, McHenry County Youth Orchestra and Voices in Harmony (formerly known as the Crystal Lake Community Choir).

The Col. Gustavus A. Palmer House is a historic residence in Crystal Lake, being constructed in 1858.

==Economy==
The economy of Crystal Lake is fairly decentralized, as there is no central industry within the city. There are several large companies, but none of them is a majority employer. The main economic activities in the city are retail, dining, and light industry. This includes small, specialized, local-owned shops and restaurants as well as broader-ranged national chains. There are several industrial parks in Crystal Lake, which are full of small, independently-owned businesses which engage in various industries, such as landscaping or automotive repair.

The shopping center for most of Crystal Lake centers on &quot;the strip&quot;, a long stretch of road that runs along what once used to be Crystal Pointe Mall but is now a series of strip malls. The strip is located on Route 14 between Route 31 and Dole Avenue. As the name suggests, this area has mostly national chains. Another shopping area is the downtown district, which is where some, small independent stores are located. Because of parking challenges in the downtown area, many thriving independent businesses can be found in convenient areas throughout the city where access for their customers is more centralized and parking is more abundant.

The south side of the city features several gravel quarries. A majority of these quarries are already exhausted, and have been allowed to fill with water, forming an area known as the Vulcan Lakes, also stretching into Lake in the Hills and Algonquin. The two northernmost lakes are now known as Three Oaks Recreation Area. Recreational operations at this site started in Autumn, 2010, and it has since become one of the most popular destinations in Crystal Lake.

==Parks and recreation==
The Crystal Lake Park District, a separate elected governing body not associated with the city, offers more than 40 parks and recreation areas. Notable parks maintained by the Park District include the 140-acre Veteran Acres Park and Lippold Park, the largest single park in the district at 305 acres.

==Government==
===Mayor===
The Mayor presides at all meetings of the city council and is otherwise the head of the city government for all ceremonial purposes, and any other purposes determined by the city council, or in emergencies, by the governor. The mayor has no regular administrative duties, as the city operates under a council-manager form of government.


The current mayor is Haig Haleblian. The city council consists of Ellen Brady, Brett Hopkins, Cameron Hubbard, Mandy Montford, Ian Philpot, and Denise Smith. Nick Kachiroubas is the City Clerk in Crystal Lake.

==Education==

There are five high schools which serve the city of Crystal Lake. The oldest, Crystal Lake Central High School, graduated its first class in 1924. In response to pressures from the increasing population, Crystal Lake South High School was opened in 1978. Prairie Ridge High School opened in the fall of 1997. Small portions of Crystal Lake are served by Cary-Grove High School and Woodstock High School.

<text>Harvard is a city located in McHenry County, Illinois. The population was 9,469 at the 2020 census. The city is 63 miles from the Chicago Loop and it is the last stop on the Union Pacific Northwest Line.

== History ==

The original owners of the land which came to be Harvard, Illinois, were Abram Carmack and Jacob Davis, who obtained it from the government in 1845 and sold it to Gilbert Brainard shortly afterward. Upon Gilbert Brainard&#x27;s death, the land was purchased by Amos Page, Otis Eastman, and Elbridge Gerry Ayer. These three men planned the layout of the town and named it &quot;Harvard&quot; in honor of Harvard, Massachusetts. The plat was signed by Judge J. M. Strode in Woodstock, Illinois, on November 25, 1856. Shortly afterward Amos Page and Otis Eastman sold their shares of the property to Elbridge Gerry Ayer. Mr.Ayer&#x27;s involvement came out of his business interest in the extension of the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company railroad west from Cary, toward Janesville, Wisconsin. The newly platted town of Harvard was located directly on the route of the extension, and in April 1856 the railroad accepted Ayer&#x27;s offer of land to build a station in the town.

In 1856 Mr. Wesley Diggins built a hotel for Mr. H. C. Blackman, who sold it to Mr. Elbridge Gerry Ayer in 1859. Mr. Ayer built additional floors to raise it to a height of three stories and added a wing and a veranda. During the Civil War, sick and wounded soldiers passing through Harvard were lodged at the hotel with no charge for their meals. In 1925 the Ayer Hotel was purchased by Mr. S. J. Noble and renamed the Noble Hotel. When he could not maintain mortgage payments it was purchased in 1937 by Mr. P. G. Allen and renamed the Hub Hotel. The building was destroyed in a fire on December 22, 1960.

As railroad employment expanded, Harvard&#x27;s population grew. On April 18, 1869, voters incorporated the community and elected Elbridge Gerry Ayer as the first village president. The first ordinance adopted required every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 18 and 60 to perform one day of labor for the town.

Harvard was turned from a town into a city when citizens voted to do so (with a vote of 550 to 5) on April 6, 1891. With this change, Harvard was no longer a town administered by a village president. It became a city administered by a mayor.

Motorola opened a mobile telephone manufacturing and distribution facility on Harvard&#x27;s north side in 1997. The plant employed more than 5,000 at its peak. However, a combination of factors, including a significant decline in Motorola&#x27;s business in the early 2000s, compelled the company to shutter the facility in 2003. On August 13, 2008, the 1.5 million square foot facility was sold to Optima International&#x27;s Optima Ventures, LLC a Miami-based real estate investment firm led by Chaim Schochet and 2/3rd owned by the Ihor Kolomoyskyi associated Privat Group, one of Ukraine&#x27;s largest business and banking groups holding 33% of the individual deposits and accounting for 25% of Ukraine&#x27;s banking sector from 2003 to 2016. In 2016, Xiao Hua &quot;Edward&quot; Gong, who was born in China but resides in Toronto, purchased the former Motorola plant but, in December 2017, prosecutors in Canada and New Zealand alleged that the plant was part of a money laundering scheme and fraud involving Chinese citizens purchasing securities valued at hundreds of millions of dollars and supported by firms in New Zealand.

In 2006, Harvard held a year-long Sesquicentennial Celebration. The Greater Harvard Area Historical Society is located on Hart Street. The society identifies and marks historical sites in the area. It also works to obtain histories of Harvard families, businesses, and farms that have been in operation for more than 100 years.

Harvard is the self-proclaimed Milk Capital of the World and hosts one of the longest-running festivals in Illinois, Harvard Milk Days, the first weekend of June to commemorate their contributions to milk production during WWII.

A symbol of the Milk Days Festival, the statue of a cow, Harmilda, &quot;stands 5 feet tall, 8 feet long, and weighs about 125 pounds.&quot;

*Harvard Junior High School: grades 6-8
*Jefferson Elementary School: grades 4 and 5
*Richard B. Crosby Elementary School: grades K-3

== Harvard Diggins Library ==

Harvard Diggins Library began serving the Harvard community in 1909. Delos F. Diggins, who spent his childhood in Harvard, provided a generous bequest to the City of Harvard to build a library. That building, named the Delos F. Diggins Library, became the first free-standing public library in McHenry County. The library served the community successfully from that building until a new library was built in 2001. In deference to the lasting legacy of Delos Diggins, the library was renamed the Harvard Diggins Library. Currently, Harvard Diggins Library is a member of the Northern Illinois Cooperative consortium and the Reaching Across Illinois Library System.

The Harvard Diggins Library building encompasses 19,000 square feet of space. The core of the facility houses the collection, but designated space is available for children, teens, quiet study, and meeting space. Public events are hosted at the library on a regular basis, including lectures, performers, crafts, storytimes, and more. As a municipal library, library cards are free to city residents, and it allows borrowing of materials from most public libraries in Illinois. Non-residents may purchase a card for an annual fee.

== Post office ==

The U.S. Post Office is located on Harvard&#x27;s North Eastman Street. The current building was constructed during the Kennedy Administration in 1962 when J. Edward Day was the Postmaster General.

== Law enforcement ==
The Harvard Police Department is located in the lower level of the old City Hall building at 201 W. Front Street. It consists of 17 full-time police officers, led by Chief of Police Tyson Bauman, a full-time record clerk and one full-time community services officer (CSO). Dispatch services are provided by the North East Regional Communications Center, also known as NERCOM, of which the department is a founding and partner member and is located in McHenry Illinois. The department has a full-time detective, a school resource officer, bicycles for officers to patrol the city streets, parks and downtown area.

== Fire protection ==
Harvard&#x27;s Fire Protection District consists of 47 trained firefighters, of which 22 are Emergency medical technicians and 14 are paramedics. The district traces its history to 1865 when five men got together to purchase a fire engine for the village of Harvard. In 1871, the engine was sent to Chicago via the railroad to assist in the Great Chicago Fire. In 1892, it was again placed on a train to assist with a fire in the community of Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1899, the first constitution and by-laws were drawn up for the Harvard Fire Department. The Harvard Rescue Squad was founded in 1956 with a $7000 donation from the Harvard Jaycees. In 1971, the City and Rural Fire Department merged to form the Harvard Fire Protection District.

Currently, the Harvard Fire Protection District is governed by a five-member board of trustees appointed by the McHenry County Board. While the Fire District works very closely with the city of Harvard, it is a separate government agency. The district provides fire and emergency medical service for and is funded by ambulance user fees and property taxes. It is part of the Mercy Health EMS System, which operates out of Mercy Health Javon Bea Hospital in Rockford, IL, a Level I trauma hospital. The district also has a SCUBA dive team, trained for water rescue. This team is part of the McHenry County MABAS 5 Dive Team.

== Transportation ==
U.S. Route 14, locally known as the Northwest Highway and Division Street, runs north–south through Harvard. Illinois Route 23 begins in southern Harvard and connects the city with other locations to the south. Illinois Route 173 also runs east–west through Harvard, and it connects many other towns along the Wisconsin border to Harvard. The nearest Interstate Highway to Harvard is Interstate 90 in Belvidere; Interstate 39 in Machesney Park is also nearby, as is Interstate 43 in Wisconsin.

Harvard is also served by multiple forms of public transportation. Pace operates Route 808 in Harvard. This route links the city to the communities of Woodstock and Crystal Lake. Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific Northwest Line has a station in Harvard and operates daily service to Chicago&#x27;s Ogilvie Transportation Center. The Harvard station is the most remote point in the Metra system at from downtown Chicago.

== Media ==
Harvard is served by WHIW-LP 101.3 FM, Harvard Community Radio. A low-power FM station, WHIW-LP began broadcasting on the FM frequency on May 18, 2015. Prior to May 2015, the station was heard at AM 1610. WHIW-LP also streams online.

WHIW-LP provides local programming including news, sports, school, music, arts and more. WHIW is an all-volunteer community radio station that depends on the support of it listeners and station underwriters. The station received its 501(c)(3) exempt status in 2013.

Harvard once had a daily newspaper, the &quot;Harvard Herald&quot;, which was published from 1887 until 1986. In September 2009, a new monthly publication, the &quot;Harvard Main Line&quot;, was launched. The city is also served by the &quot;Northwest Herald&quot;, which covers all of McHenry County.

<doc id="111657" wikidata="Q1819972" url="?curid=111657" title="Johnsburg, Illinois">
<text>Johnsburg is a village in McHenry County, Illinois, with a population of 6,355 as of the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==
The area that came to be known as Johnsburg was first settled in 1841, five years after the founding of McHenry County, by immigrant families escaping religious persecution and oppressive social conditions in the Eifel region of Germany, predominantly the Mayen-Koblenz.&quot; (The congregation is known today as St. John the Baptist.) They built their first church in 1842, a simple log cabin that also functioned as a school and meeting hall. The first priest to serve this new congregation was delivered there by friendly Native Americans who found him lost in the woods of Wisconsin. The church served the community until 1850, when a larger frame church was built to replace it. Construction on a third church, built in the Gothic style, began in 1867. This church took thirteen years to complete and was the pride of the Johnsburg community until it was destroyed by a fire on February 19, 1900. Many of the early settlers&#x27; grave markers were also destroyed by the fire. The present St. John the Baptist church was dedicated in 1902.

By 1990, a group of citizens living in this unincorporated area of McHenry County had come to fear that their community, known for over 100 years as Johnsburg, would be swallowed or divided by surrounding municipalities. They turned to their neighbors in Sunnyside, an adjacent village with which they shared a library, schools, and other services, for solutions. (Sunnyside had been incorporated in 1956.) Sunnyside and Johnsburg leaders struck an informal agreement that allowed Sunnyside to annex the surrounding area, thereby tripling its size, but required it to rename itself Johnsburg. After Sunnyside completed the annexation in 1992, the Sunnyside Village Board legally renamed its municipality to Johnsburg.

==Geography==
Johnsburg is located at (42.385796, -88.235942).

<text>Lake in the Hills (often abbreviated L.I.T.H. or LITH) is a village in McHenry County, Illinois, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 28,982.

The village is most known for its very high residential growth which occurred most heavily in the 1990s. Once a sleepy lakeside village of cottages and small ranches, its population skyrocketed as developers flocked to the area in the 1990s. Its population increased by 17,000 people (a nearly 400% increase) over this period, making it one of the most rapidly growing suburbs of Chicago and in the United States at that time. At the height of its building boom, the village issued over 1,000 residential building permits in 1995.

In the late 1990s, the village faced the challenge of providing adequate services and infrastructure as well as establishing an identity and community unity, since many community services (libraries, schools, fire districts) were pre-delegated to neighboring communities such as Huntley, Algonquin and Crystal Lake. However, the village continues to expand its resources and community offerings and is also endeavoring to diversify its tax base and provide more commercial and industrial businesses.

== History ==

Lake in the Hills was started in 1923 by Federal Judge Walter J. La Buy around Woods Creek Lake, which is the main lake in Lake in the Hills. By the year 1926, La Buy bought of land which is currently Indian Trail. On this land, he built five stucco homes; only one stands in its original state, which is currently owned by the Village of Lake in the Hills. The other four original stucco homes have been altered in some way, but all still stand in the original spot by Woods Creek Lake.

The early days of Lake in the Hills saw vacationers from the Chicago area, who wanted to spend some time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. By 1950, some of the vacationers became year-round residents of Lake in the Hills. On November 29, 1952, the Village of Lake in the Hills was formed.

The village of Lake in the Hills remained a small, close-knit lakeside residential community for much of the 20th Century, relying on nearby towns like Algonquin and Crystal Lake for services. In 1987, the Village&#x27;s first shopping center was constructed; it was built at the intersection of Algonquin Road and Oakleaf Road±. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Village made a series of large annexations extending west of Randall Road, all the way west to Illinois Route 47. Numerous subdivisions were constructed in this area throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade) and retail development blossomed along Randall Road during this time period as well. By the mid 2000s (decade), development had slowed down and as the Village became landlocked by other municipalities, it worked to appropriately develop its remaining parcels.

==Geography==

== Neighborhoods ==

The heart and soul of Lake in the Hills is considered by many to be the collection of older neighborhoods colloquially dubbed the &quot;Old Section&quot;. For many L.I.T.H. natives, the Old Section is considered the &quot;true&quot; Lake in the Hills, as it contains the lake and the hills from which the town derives its name. The Old Section is unique for its eclectic appearance, as opposed to the newer neighborhoods more homogeneous tract style. Within the Old Section there are four main neighborhoods. These four neighborhoods are as follows: the Original section, the Indian section, the Tree section, and the Presidents section. All, besides the Original section, derive their names from the street names of the area. So the Presidents section contains streets named after presidents, the Indian section of Indian tribes, and the Tree section of different species of trees. The Original section is dubbed so because it is where most of the early settlement took place.
Aside from the village&#x27;s older section, the village has developed several neighborhoods, especially due to the rise of subdivisions in the village over the past 15 years.

*Prairie Point, located along Cunat Court is a neighborhood on the village&#x27;s eastern side, just west of Pyott Road. It included 3-story condominium buildings and a neighborhood recreational center and pool.
*Boulder Ridge is a gated community in the central section of town, north of Algonquin Road, south of Miller Road and east of Frank Road. It features homes worth between $400,000 and $1,000,000. It also includes the village&#x27;s only 18 hole golf course, and an immaculate country club which is a popular spot for banquets. On the west side of Frank Road, is the child development &quot;The Lakes of Boulder Ridge&quot;, which offers a 9-hole golf course, scenic setting, and expensive duplex homes.
*Big Sky and Harvest Gate are neighborhoods just west of Randall Road and south of Miller Road, just east of Boulder Ridge. They are some of the village&#x27;s first subdivisions and were built by the same developer, Town and Country Homes. Woods Creek divides them. The new Lake in the Hills Village Hall, and Lincoln Prairie Elementary School are all located within these neighborhoods.
*Spring Lake Farm (north) is a subdivision south of Miller Road, west of Frank Road. It was also among the village&#x27;s first subdivisions, built c. early 1990s, by Sundance Homes and Americana Homes. It includes both single-family and multi-family homes.
*Spring Lake Farm (south) is a single-family home subdivision built by Sundance Homes on Algonquin Road, west of Lakewood and immediately east of Tom&#x27;s Farm Market in Huntley. It was the village&#x27;s first subdivision west of Lakewood Road. Homes in this neighborhood are valued generally in the $200K range.
*Bellchase is a neighborhood built by Sundance Homes on the village&#x27;s only parcel south of Algonquin Road. This neighborhood features Bellchase Commons, LeRoy Guy Park, and a full range of homes, from 2- and 3-bedroom duplexes and smaller 2-story &quot;freedom&quot; homes to large 4- and 5-bedroom homes. Duplexes in this neighborhood are valued from the high $100s, single-family homes are priced from the mid $200s to the mid $300s.
*Sumner Glen and Provence are neighborhoods built by Town and Country Homes. They are located along the western side of Lakewood Road from Algonquin Road to Miller Road. Normandy Park and Exner Marsh Nature Preserve along Reed Road serve as this area&#x27;s centerpiece. Provence features slightly smaller homes, including both ranches and two-stories, valued generally in the $200K range. Sumner Glen features more expensive homes, some with 5-6 bedrooms, valued generally in the $300K range.
*Heron Bay is a small neighborhood featuring slightly upscale homes starting in the low $300s. It backs up to the Exner Marsh and features a very large pond with multiple fountains.

*Fox Ridge Farm, a planned subdivision of potentially 200-300 homes located on the village&#x27;s western fringe along Illinois Route 47, is currently under development review. Once constructed, it will likely be the last &quot;major&quot; subdivision developed in the village, as Lake in the Hills has become landlocked by other municipalities.
* The old neighborhoods are primarily in the original section of the town. This consists of all homes residing in the original development of the town. This is usually considered, by locals, to include all homes built within an area of close to the actual lake.
