<text>Compton is a city located in the Gateway Cities region of southern Los Angeles County, California, United States, situated south of downtown Los Angeles. Compton is one of the oldest cities in the county, and on May 11, 1888, was the eighth city in Los Angeles County to incorporate. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 95,740. It is known as the &quot;Hub City&quot; due to its geographic centrality in Los Angeles County. Neighborhoods in Compton include Sunny Cove, Leland, downtown Compton, and Richland Farms.

==History==


The Tongva inhabited the Los Angeles Basin.

The Spanish Empire had expanded into this area when the Viceroy of New Spain commissioned Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to explore the Pacific Ocean in 1542–1543. In 1767, the area became part of the Province of the Californias (), and the area was explored by the Portolá expedition in 1769–1770. In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro, a tract of over , to soldier Juan José Domínguez. Domínguez&#x27;s descendants partitioned the land amongst family members, sold parcels to newly arriving settlers, and relinquished some when validating their legal claim with the Mexican government at in 1828, and with the United States government through a patent validating in 1858. The Domínguez family name is still applied throughout the area, including the Dominguez Rancho Adobe historical landmark, in the unincorporated community of Rancho Dominguez, located between the cities of Compton, Long Beach and Carson. The tree that marked the original northern boundary of the rancho still stands at the corner of Poppy and Short streets.

In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a group of 30 pioneers to the area. These families had traveled by wagon train south from Stockton, California, in search of ways to earn a living other than the rapid exhaustion of gold fields. Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville. However, to avoid confusion with the Camptonville located in Yuba County, the name was shortened to Compton. Compton&#x27;s earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather to get by with just the barest subsistence. The weather continued to be harsh, rainy and cold, and fuel was difficult to find. To gather firewood it was necessary to travel to mountains close to Pasadena. The round trip took almost a week. Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to a friendlier climate and settle down, but as there were two general stores within traveling distance—one in the pueblo of Los Angeles, the other in Wilmington—they eventually decided to stay put.

By 1887, the settlers realized it was time to make improvements to the local government. A series of town meetings were held to discuss incorporation of their little town. Griffith D. Compton donated his land to incorporate and create the city of Compton in 1889, but he did stipulate that a certain acreage be zoned solely for agriculture and named Richland Farms. In January 1888, a petition supporting the incorporation of Compton was forwarded to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who in turn forwarded the petition to the State Legislature. On May 11, 1888, the city of Compton was incorporated with a population of 5000 people. The first City Council meeting was held on May 14, 1888.

In 1890, a series of votes were held by the residents of Compton, with the aim of shedding significant portions of the city. By the end of the year, Compton was down to only eighty acres of land, with five remaining voters residing within that territory. Due to the limited number of people able to fill positions within the city government, Compton effectively ceased to exist as a functioning city. By 1906, lawyers Emmett Wilson and E.T. Sherer filed suits to nullify the 1890 elections, which in turn restored Compton to a size of 600 acres. Compton was reborn, with elections held to fill open positions.

The ample residential lots of Richland Farms gave residents enough space to raise a family, and food to feed them, along with building a barn, and caring for livestock. The farms attracted the black families who had begun migrating from the rural South in the 1950s, and there they found their &#x27;home away from home&#x27;. Compton could not support large-scale agricultural business, but it did give the residents the opportunity to work the land for their families.

The 1920s saw the opening of the Compton Airport. Compton Junior College was founded and city officials moved to a new City Hall on Alameda Street. On March 10, 1933, a destructive earthquake caused many casualties: schools were destroyed and there was major damage to the central business district. While it would eventually be home to a large black population, in 1930 there was only one black resident.

From the 1920s through the early 1940s, the Compton area was home to a sizable Japanese American population, a large proportion of whom were farmers. Shortly after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, Compton residents of Japanese descent were forcibly removed from their homes and interned for the duration of World War II. Most were initially detained at the Santa Anita Assembly Center; they were later transferred to and incarcerated at Manzanar and other internment centers, called &quot;Relocation Centers.&quot;

In the 1950s, middle-class black families began moving into the area, mostly on the west side. Compton grew quickly throughout the decade. This is partially due to its proximity to Watts, where there was an established black population. The eastern side of the city was predominantly white until the 1970s. Despite being located in the middle of a major metropolitan area, thanks to the legacy of Griffith D. Compton, there still remains one small pocket of agriculture from its earliest years.

During the 1950s and 1960s, after the Supreme Court declared all racially exclusive housing covenants (title deeds) unconstitutional in the case &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, the first black families moved to the area. Compton&#x27;s growing black population was still largely ignored and neglected by the city&#x27;s elected officials. Centennial High School was finally built to accommodate a burgeoning student population. A black man first ran for City Council in 1958, and the first black councilman was elected in 1961.
In 1969, Douglas Dollarhide became the mayor, the first black man elected mayor of any metropolitan city in California. Two African Americans and one Mexican-American were also elected to the local school board. Four years later, in 1973, Doris A. Davis defeated Dollarhide&#x27;s bid for re-election to become the first female black mayor of a metropolitan American city. By the early 1970s, the city had one of the largest concentrations of African Americans in the country, at over sixty five percent. In 2013, Aja Brown, age 31, became the city&#x27;s youngest mayor to date; she was re-elected in 2017.

For many years, Compton was a much sought-after suburb for the black middle class of Los Angeles. This past affluence is reflected in the area&#x27;s appearance: Compton&#x27;s streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton&#x27;s gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class whites who fled to the newly incorporated cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Paramount and Norwalk in the late 1950s. These nearby cities remained largely white early on, despite integration. This white middle class flight accelerated following the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

By the late 1960s, middle-class and upper-middle-class African Americans found other areas to be more attractive to them. Some were unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County such as Ladera Heights, View Park and Windsor Hills, and others were cities such as Inglewood and Carson. Carson was particularly significant, because it had successfully thwarted attempts at annexation by neighboring Compton. The city opted instead for incorporation in 1968; notably, its black population was actually more affluent than its white population. As a newer city, it also offered more favorable tax rates and lower crime.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s 2020 data, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (1.03%) is water.

Compton is bordered by the unincorporated Willowbrook on the north and northwest, the unincorporated West Compton on the west, the city of Carson on the southwest, the unincorporated Rancho Dominguez on the south, the city of Long Beach on the southeast, the city of Paramount and the unincorporated East Compton on the east, and by the city of Lynwood on the northeast.

===East Compton===
East Compton, also known as East Rancho Dominguez, is a mostly industrial unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP). The population was 15,135 according to the 2010 Census. East Rancho Dominguez is an accepted city name according to the USPS, and shares the 90221 ZIP Code with Compton. Its sphere of influence is the city of Compton, which has tried to annex East Rancho Dominguez, but business and property owners in the area have opposed the annexation.

During 2009–2013, Compton has a median household income of $42,953, with 26.3% of the population living below the federal poverty line.

===Crime===
Following the Watts riots in 1965, crime in Compton rose sharply. Although the city was largely exempt from the destruction of the 1965 riot, it prompted middle-class residents to flee over the next few years. By 1969, it had the highest crime rate in the state of California.

In &quot;Black, Brown, and White: Stories Straight Outta Compton&quot;, Lynne Isbell and two friends from other ethnic backgrounds have written about their lives growing up in Compton during the 1960s and early 1970s. They tell how Compton changed from a mostly white town to a mostly black one and became known as &quot;the Murder Capital of the United States&quot;.

Compton&#x27;s violent reputation reached the national spotlight in the late 1980s with the rise of local gangsta rap groups Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted and N.W.A, the latter of whom released the album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; in 1989. The city became notorious for gang violence, primarily caused by the Bloods and Crips. After years of decline in crime, Compton&#x27;s murder rate skyrocketed in 2004 with racial conflicts between Blacks and Latinos.

2005 was the city&#x27;s deadliest year on record when the city murder rate reached 72 killings with a total population of 90,000 residents. The spike was the highest since 1991, when the city had more than 100,000 residents. The rise in homicides frightened residents who had long lived with high levels of gang violence but had seen a downturn in violent crime in recent years.

In 2013, the homicide rate was 36.8 per 100,000 residents, a decrease from the mid-2000s peak. Guns are used in the vast majority of homicides in Compton. Between 2000 and 2016, 91.5% were killed with guns compared to the national average of 67.7%. In 2015, there was a record low of 15 homicides while the homicide rate in the rest of the US increased. In recent years, homicides have increased while remaining well below the 1980s and 90s, with 32 in 2021.

The neighborhood lost residents with the worsening safety problems and, after the 1992 riots in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, many African Americans left the city.

Although &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; did not list Compton in the 2011 &quot;11 Most Dangerous Cities&quot; for overall crime rates in the United States, the &quot;CQ Press&quot;, using data from the FBI&#x27;s annual report of crime statistics &quot;Crime in the United States 2010,&quot; which ranked Compton as having the eighth highest crime rate in the country.

Compton experienced a drop in homicide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Crime has stabilized overall since the 2010s. The decrease in homicides has been attributed to various factors, including changing demographics, faster response times by police (reducing shots fired) and better medical care (increasing survival rates). Aja Brown, mayor elected in 2013, helped to settle turf wars between the gangs, which has further reduced the homicide rate.

Mexican and Central American immigrants have increasingly replaced African Americans who moved to safer cities.
====&quot;Gifts for Guns&quot;====
The Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department began the annual &quot;Gifts for Guns&quot; program within that same year where the citizens of Compton were given the option to turn in firearms and receive a $50–$100 check for various goods in an effort to combat gun violence. People have turned in about 7,000 guns over the last few years, KABC-TV reported. The program&#x27;s success has prompted the LASD to expand the program countywide.

===Homelessness===

In 2022, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority&#x27;s Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count counted 644 homeless individuals in Compton.

===Mapping L.A.===

Mexican was the most common ancestry according to the 2000 census. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common foreign places of birth in 2000.

==Economy==

In 1994, Compton was designated as an &quot;Entrepreneurial Hot Spot&quot; by Cognetics, Inc., an independent economic research firm. Compton made the national list for best places to start and grow a business, and ranked #2 in Los Angeles County out of a field of 88 cities. The city&#x27;s Planning and Economic Development department provides a business assistance program consisting of a comprehensive mix of resources to small business owners and entrepreneurs. The grocery chains Ralphs and Food 4 Less, subsidiaries of Kroger, are headquartered in Compton. Gelson&#x27;s Market, a subsidiary of Arden Group, Inc., a holding company, is also based there.
Compton is surrounded by multiple freeways that provide access to destinations throughout the region. The Long Beach and Los Angeles Ports are less than 20 minutes from downtown Compton, providing access to international destinations for customers and suppliers. The Alameda Corridor, a passageway for 25% of all U.S. waterborne international trade, runs directly through Compton from north to south.

The City of Compton&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department operates and maintains a total of 16 playgrounds for a combined of active park space. Facilities include six community centers, seven neighborhood parks, two walking parks, two competition-size swimming pools, three regulation size gymnasiums, a skate park, Jackie Robinson Baseball Stadium, Nine-Hole Par 3 Golf Course, and the two-story Douglas F. Dollarhide Community Center.

==Arts and culture==
Some episodes of the sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; took place in Compton because Will Smith&#x27;s friend, DJ Jazzy Jeff, lived there. Many rap artists&#x27; careers started in Compton, including N.W.A (Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella), Coolio, DJ Quik, 2nd II None, Hi-C, Tweedy Bird Loc, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, YG, Vince Staples, Roddy Ricch, and Compton&#x27;s Most Wanted. In their lyrics, they rap about the streets and their lives in Compton and the areas nearby. Steve Lacy and Blues musician Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; are also from Compton.

Compton has been referred to on numerous occasions in gang affiliation, gangsta rap and g-funk songs, especially in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, and so has attained an association not only with gang violence and crime, but with hip hop music as well. The city is known as the home of many famous rappers. The Compton Swap Meet is featured prominently in the remix version of the 1995 #1 song California Love.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Championed by the Compton Entertainment Chamber of Commerce, the city of Compton honored Musical Entertainer rapper Eazy-E, with a symbolic street in his stage name. On November 22, 2023, the 100 block of Auto Drive South, which runs off Alameda Street and into the Gateway Towne Center shopping plaza was renamed to Eazy Street. It is also a reference to a song of the same name.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Eazy-E grew into the music industry as part the N.W.A group that spawned hip hop icons, such as Easy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Mc Ren, DJ Yella and many others. In 1989, N.W.A released the colossal hit song Straight Outta Compton, which is the incontestable communicable global catchphrase for the City of Compton. [Eric Lynn Wright, was born September 7, 1964, in Compton, and passed away March 26, 1995.]

Many NBA players attended high school in the city as well. Arron Afflalo attended Centennial High School; DeMar DeRozan attended Compton High School; and Tayshaun Prince, Tyson Chandler, Brandon Jennings, Cedric Ceballos and the late Dennis Johnson attended Dominguez High. Actor/comedian Paul Rodriguez Sr. also attended Dominguez High.

Although an inner suburb of Los Angeles, Compton has seen an increase of middle-class residents in the last few years, due to its affordable housing. With the influx of immigrants and the demographic shift in ethnic population, it was after the 2000 U.S. Census that Latinos were recognized as the majority.

Compton has evolved into a younger population; the median age of people living in Compton was 25 at the time of the census survey in 2010; the United States average at the time was 35.3.

Compton is home to the Compton Cricket Club, the only all American-born exhibition cricket team. Its founder, Ted Hayes, said, &quot;The aim of playing cricket is to teach people how to respect themselves and respect authority so they stop killing each other.&quot; Tam&#x27;s Burgers has been seen as a symbol of the city.

===Historical landmarks===
Angeles Abbey Memorial Park contains examples of Byzantine, Moorish and Spanish architectural styles. The cemetery was built in 1923 and survived the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.

Compton Airport opened on May 10, 1924. Located on Alondra Boulevard, the airport offers flight training, has accommodations for more than 200 planes, and is home to several aviation clubs.

The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial sits in a plaza surrounded by the Civic Center, Compton Court House, Compton City Hall, and Compton Public Library.

The Eagle Tree is a natural boundary marker of Rancho San Pedro dating to 1858. It contains a historic marker and plaque placed by the Daughters of the Golden West in 1947.

The &#x27;Heritage House&#x27; was built in 1869 and is a California Historical Landmark, and a Los Angeles County Historic Landmark. The oldest house in Compton, it was restored as a tribute to early settlers. It is an important landmark of Compton&#x27;s rich history. At the corner of Myrrh and Willowbrook near the Civic Center Plaza, the Heritage House is a rustic-looking home that will eventually have a museum detailing early life in Compton. For now it shows the stark difference between the simple life of the 19th century and the fast-paced urban environment of the 21st. The oldest tree in Compton was the Eagle Tree, which marked the boundary of Rancho San Pedro. It fell in 2022.

Woodlawn Memorial Park contains the graves of 17 American Civil War veterans.

==Government==

===Municipal government===
After Lionel Cade, an accountant, assumed the mayor&#x27;s office in 1977, one of the first orders of business was to conduct an audit of the city&#x27;s finances. It was discovered that the city was $2 million in debt. The administration was able to eliminate the huge deficit in one year by making cuts in every department. It also aggressively sought federal funding to help pay for essential services, which was at least partially effective. However, with the passage of the property tax cutting initiative Proposition 13 by California voters, Compton was one of the cities hardest hit, since it had already eliminated most of the excess from its budget.

====Corruption====
Civic corruption has also been a widespread problem in Compton. 

In 2000, the Compton Police Department was disbanded amidst controversy and charges of corruption. The police department claims it was disbanded after investigations of gang activity led to then-Compton Mayor Omar Bradley. Once this became public, the mayor charged it was the police who were themselves corrupt, and he disbanded the police department. Omar Bradley has since faced serious corruption charges. 

Eric J. Perrodin, the city&#x27;s former mayor, was investigated in 2007 by the California State Bar for threatening to violate a local newspaper&#x27;s First Amendment rights after the paper printed an investigative report relative to a contract granted to one of Perrodin&#x27;s associates. Following the report, Perrodin threatened to yank the city&#x27;s advertising contract with the paper. A Times review of city records shows Perrodin was absent from city board and commission meetings nearly two-thirds of the time between July 2009 and July 2010.

Current recall efforts are a direct response from residents of the accusations of corruption of the city&#x27;s mayor and council. Some of the accusations involve the issuing of city contracts to personal donors and friends. One particular accusation involved the trash and recycling contract of the city to Pacific Coast Waste and Recycling LLC in 2007.

Notices of intent to circulate recall petitions against four Compton city officials are expected to be filed in August 2010, by a group of citizens who claim corruption in Compton is being ignored by the same authorities who were shocked by the recent salary controversy in the city of Bell.

Compton had discharged its city manager, in 2010, the second time in three years. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; says the City Council voted in a closed meeting, September 9, 2010, to fire Charles Evans. &quot;The Times&quot; says council members refused to discuss the reasons for their decision. Evans took office in 2007, after the dismissal of previous City Manager Barbara Kilroy. City Controller Willie Norfleet will take over until a permanent manager can be named.

In July 2021, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called for a Department of Justice inquiry into whether a deputy gang called the Executioners was operating out of the Compton station of the LASD.

<text>Covina () is a city in the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County, California, United States, about east of downtown Los Angeles
The population was 51,268 according to the 2020 census, up from 47,796 at the 2010 census. The city&#x27;s slogan, &quot;One Mile Square and All There&quot;, was coined when the incorporated area of the city was only .

Covina is bordered by West Covina, to its south and west side. Irwindale lies to the west, as well as the unincorporated area of Vincent, and the city of Baldwin Park. Azusa and Glendora are to the north, the unincorporated community of Charter Oak to the northeast, San Dimas to the east, the unincorporated area of Ramona and city of Pomona to the southeast.

==History==

Present-day Covina was originally within the homelands of the indigenous Tongva people for 5,000 to 8,000 years. In the 18th century it became part of Rancho La Puente in Alta California, a 1770s Spanish colonial and 1842 Mexican land grant.

The city of Covina was founded in 1882 by Joseph Swift Phillips, on a tract that was purchased from the holdings of John Edward Hollenbeck, one of the 1842 grantees of Rancho La Puente. In 1875 Hollenbeck had purchased a failed coffee plantation from three Costa Rican brothers, Pedro Maria Badilla, Julian Badilla, and Pedro Antonio Badilla; the latter purchased it from the heirs of Hollenbeck&#x27;s 1842 co-grantee John A. Rowland. Four streets of Covina were named after these people, as well as Rancho La Puente, which include Badillo Street, Puente Street, Rowland Street, and Hollenbeck Avenue.

The City of Covina was named by a young engineer, Frederick Eaton, who was hired by Phillips to survey the area. Impressed by the way that the valleys of the adjacent San Gabriel Mountains formed a natural cove around the vineyards that had been planted by the region&#x27;s earlier pioneers, Eaton merged the words &quot;cove&quot; and &quot;vine&quot;, and in 1885, created the name Covina for the new township.

The city was incorporated in 1901, the townsite bounded by Puente Street on the south, 1st Avenue on the east, the alley north of College Street on the north, and 4th Avenue on the west. The city&#x27;s slogan, &quot;One Mile Square and All There&quot;, was coined by Mrs F. E. Wolfarth, the winner of a 1922 slogan contest sponsored by the chamber of commerce.

It was not vineyards but orange and grapefruit groves that blanketed the city. By 1909, the city was the third-largest orange producer in the world, and it still claimed to have &quot;the best oranges in the world&quot; as late as the 1950s. Since World War II, however, the orange groves have been largely replaced by single-family (houses) and multiple-family (apartments) dwellings.

The Covina Valley Historical Society maintains an archive illustrating the city&#x27;s history in the 1911-built Firehouse Jail Museum, Covina&#x27;s first municipal building, located immediately behind City Hall in Covina&#x27;s Old Town.

Opened in 1997, the Covina AMC 30 located at Arrow Highway and Azusa Avenue is one of the busiest theatres in the United States. The movie theater was built on the site of a former Sears building and claims to have the largest movie multiplex in Los Angeles County.

It has been a sister city of Xalapa, Mexico, since 1964. A replica of a giant stone Olmec head, located in a place of honor in Parque Xalapa, was given to the city in 1989 by the state of Veracruz. According to the placard placed below the head, it was originally excavated from San Lorenzo de Tenochtitlan. The statue was later moved from its location in front of the police department to Jalapa Park in the southeast portion of the city.

2008 marked both the opening and the charter season of the Covina Center for the Performing Arts, a newly remodeled multimillion-dollar theatrical venue in downtown Covina.

===2008 massacre===

On December 24, 2008, a shooting and arson occurred. Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, dressed in a Santa Claus costume, entered a Christmas party at his ex-wife&#x27;s residence and opened fire. After the shootings, Pardo unwrapped a Christmas package containing a homemade flamethrower and used it to set the home ablaze. When he left, nine family members were dead and the house was engulfed in flames. After the massacre, Pardo drove his rental car to his brother&#x27;s house in Sylmar, approximately away from the attack. He was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The slayings left 15 children without one or both parents.

<doc id="107617" wikidata="Q953506" url="?curid=107617" title="Cudahy, California">
<text>Cudahy ( ) is a city located in southeastern Los Angeles County, California, United States. Cudahy has one of the highest population densities of any incorporated city in the United States. It is part of the Gateway Cities region and had a population of 23,805 as of the 2010 U.S. Census.

==History==

Cudahy is named for its founder, meat-packing baron Michael Cudahy, who purchased the original of Rancho San Antonio in 1908 to resell as lots. These &quot;Cudahy lots&quot; were notable for their size—in most cases, in width and in depth, at least equivalent to a city block in most American towns. Such parcels, often referred to as &quot;railroad lots&quot;, were intended to allow the new town&#x27;s residents to keep a large vegetable garden, a grove of fruit trees (usually citrus), and a chicken coop or horse stable. This arrangement, popular in the towns along the lower Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers, proved particularly attractive to the Southerners and Midwesterners who were leaving their struggling farms in droves in the 1910s and 1920s to start new lives in Southern California.

As late as the 1950s, some Cudahy residents were still riding into the city&#x27;s downtown areas on horseback. After World War II the city was a White American blue collar town with steel and automobile plants in the area.

By the late 1970s, the factories closed down and the white residents of Cudahy left for jobs and housing in the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys. Stucco apartment complexes were built on former tracts of land. The population density increased; in 2007 the city was the second-densest in California, after Maywood.

The city was subjected to a major political corruption incident when the former mayor and the one-time city manager were indicted on bribery and extortion charges for supporting the opening of a medical marijuana dispensary. As a result of these charges, on July 12, 2012, ex-mayor David Silva, councilman Osvaldo Conde, and former City Manager Angel Perales, 43, each pleaded guilty to one count of bribery and extortion; according to plea agreements they each face up to 30 years in prison.

On January 14, 2020, Delta Air Lines Flight 89 dumped jet fuel onto Cudahy, while making an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport. Park Avenue Elementary School suffered the brunt of this dumping. This incident sparked outrage because of the city&#x27;s previous history of environmental damage, including the construction of the same school on top of an old dump site that contained contaminated soil with toxic sludge, and pollution from the Exide battery plant. The mayor, Elizabeth Alcantar, pushed for better compensation from Delta for the impact on residents and the city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 95% of it land.

Cudahy is bordered by Bell on the north, Bell Gardens on the east, South Gate on the south and southwest, and Huntington Park on the west.

<doc id="107618" wikidata="Q493378" url="?curid=107618" title="Culver City, California">
<text>Culver City is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,779. It is mostly surrounded by Los Angeles, but also shares a border with the unincorporated area of Ladera Heights to the east. The city was named after its founder, Harry Culver, who first attempted to establish it in 1913.

In the 1920s, Culver City became a center for film and later television production. It was best known as the home of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios from 1924 to 1986. From 1932 to 1986, it was the headquarters for the Hughes Aircraft Company. National Public Radio West and Sony Pictures Entertainment have headquarters in the city.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Archaeological evidence suggests a human presence in the area of present-day Culver City since at least 8000 BCE. The region was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieliño Native Americans. For centuries, native people lived in areas currently part of and surrounding Culver City. California&#x27;s native people were massacred by waves of Spanish, Mexican and Euro-American invaders through a combination of slavery, disease, relocation, forced labor, imprisonment, broken treaties and a genocidal war of extermination, including paid bounties for dead &quot;Indians&quot;.
The Spanish and Mexican governments offered concessions and land grants from 1785 to 1846 forming the Ranchos of California. Culver City was founded on the lands of the former Rancho La Ballona and Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes. When Culver City was founded, native, Hispanic or Latino people were not allowed to buy property.

During the American Civil War, a U.S. Army post called Camp Latham was established from 1861 to 1862 on the south bank of Ballona Creek.
=== Culver City ===

Harry Culver first attempted to establish Culver City in 1913. It was officially incorporated on September 20, 1917, and named after its founder. The area benefited from pre-existing transportation links; Culver&#x27;s first ads read &quot;All roads lead to Culver City&quot;. The city was explicitly founded as a whites-only sundown town, as were most of the suburbs and towns outside the downtown and Central Avenue districts of Los Angeles. Culver ran ads promoting &quot;this model little white city&quot;, while his close associate, Guy M. Rush, promoted lot sales &quot;restricted to Caucasian race&quot;. The city also at times excluded people of non-Christian religious faiths.

The weekly &quot;Culver City Call&quot; was the first newspaper in the community. The paper was founded in 1915.

The first film studio in Culver City was built by Thomas Ince in 1918 for The Triangle Motion Picture Company. Silent film comedy producer Hal Roach built his studios there in 1919, and Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) took over the Triangle studio complex in 1924. During Prohibition, speakeasies and nightclubs such as the Cotton Club lined Washington Boulevard.

Culver Center, one of Southern California&#x27;s first shopping malls, was completed in 1950 on Venice Boulevard near the Overland Avenue intersection.

=== Hughes Aircraft Company ===
Hughes Aircraft opened its Culver City plant in July 1941. There the company built the H-4 Hercules transport (commonly called the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;). Hughes was also an active subcontractor during World War II. It developed and patented a flexible feed chute for faster loading of machine guns on B-17 bombers, and manufactured electric booster drives for machine guns. Hughes produced more ammunition belts than any other American manufacturer, and built 5,576 wings and 6,370 rear fuselage sections for Vultee BT-13 trainers.

Hughes grew after the war, and in 1953 Howard Hughes donated all his stock in the company to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. After he died in 1976, the institute sold the company, which made it the second-best-endowed medical research foundation in the world.

=== The studios (1960s, 1970s and 1980s) ===
The Hal Roach Studios were demolished in 1963. In the late 1960s, much of the MGM backlot acreage (lot 3 and other property on Jefferson Boulevard), and the nearby known as RKO Forty Acres, once owned by RKO Pictures and later Desilu Productions, were sold by their owners. In 1976 the sets were razed to make way for redevelopment. Today, the RKO site is the southern expansion of the Hayden Industrial Tract, while the MGM property has been converted into a subdivision and a shopping center known as Raintree Plaza.

In October of 1975, Fox Hills Mall opened in the place of a golf course.

=== Rebirth of downtown (1990s and 2000s) ===
In the early 1990s, Culver City launched a successful revitalization program in which it renovated its downtown as well as several shopping centers in the Sepulveda Boulevard corridor near Westfield Culver City. Around the same time, Sony&#x27;s motion picture subsidiaries, Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, moved into the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot which was renamed Columbia Studios in 1990 and took on its current name, Sony Pictures Studios, a year later.

There was an influx of art galleries and restaurants on the eastern part of the city, which was formally designated the Culver City Art District.

== Geography ==

=== Architecture ===
The architecture of Culver City reflects its history as an early location for film studios and, more recently, as a site for architectural experimentation, particularly for the projects of Eric Owen Moss at the Hayden Tract. The architecture office of Morphosis headquartered here. Styles represented include Mission Revival and Colonial Revival from the city&#x27;s early days, to the PWA Moderne of the 1930s, to modern, postmodern, and deconstructivist styles from the past few decades. Notable architectural landmarks include:
* Ivy Substation (1907), a Mission Revival building that houses The Actors&#x27; Gang
* Culver Studios (1918–1920), offices in the style of a Colonial Revival mansion
* Culver Hotel (Curlett and Beelman, 1924), a six-story brick flatiron 

* Helms Bakery (1930), in PWA Moderne style
* Kirk Douglas Theatre (1946)
* St. Augustine Catholic Church (1957), a Gothic Revival church
* Robert Frost Auditorium, at Culver City High School, 4401 Elenda St. Constructed in 1963-64, its unique scallop shell design became an instant modern architectural landmark for the city. Its original 1,250-seat design was the inspiration of then 26-year-old Andrew Nasser, a consulting structural engineer with Johnson &amp; Nielsen. Credit was claimed, however, by Ralph Flewelling of Flewelling &amp; Moody, the project architects. The record was set straight 54 years later at the unveiling of a $16.3M renovation in 2018. Capacity was increased to 1,300 seats, acoustics improved, and a new 40-foot high steel proscenium arch supports catwalks, lighting, and air conditioning (Hodgetts + Fung architects).

<text>Del Aire (; Spanish for &quot;Of the Air&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) in the inland South Bay, Los Angeles County, California, United States, between El Segundo and Hawthorne. The population was 10,338 at the 2020 census, up from 10,001 at the 2010 census.

Del Aire is a small unincorporated residential neighborhood next to the Interstate 405/Interstate 105 interchange. It consists of two roughly rectangular shaped parts:
* one to the northwest bounded by I-105 and the City of Los Angeles on the north, El Segundo on the west, Hawthorne on the east, and El Segundo Blvd. on the south, and 
* one to the southeast bounded by El Segundo Blvd. on the north and surrounded by Hawthorne on the east, south and west. 
The two parts are connected by a sliver of land across El Segundo Blvd.

The Los Angeles Airport Courthouse is in the Del Aire CDP. Aviation/LAX station on the Metro C Line light rail line is in Los Angeles proper, adjacent to the CDP, and the Los Angeles Air Force Base is in El Segundo, adjacent to Del Aire CDP.

==Geography==
Del Aire is located at (33.916138, -118.369282).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The precise boundaries of Del Aire are complex, but can be roughly described as the area south of Imperial Highway between Aviation Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway(I-405) to El Segundo Boulevard. The CDP also includes the area east of the freeway and west of Inglewood Avenue, roughly between El Segundo Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue, designated &quot;Wiseburn&quot; by L.A. County.

==Education==
All of Del Aire is part of the Wiseburn Unified School District. Schools that are part of the Wiseburn School District that are in Del Aire are Juan De Anza Elementary (K–5th Grade) and Da Vinci Design Charter School (9–12).

Juan Cabrillo Elementary (K–2), 138th Street Elementary (3–5), Richard Henry Dana Middle School and Da Vinci Science Charter School are south of Del Aire in the Hawthorne community known as Holly Glen.

Previously portions of Del Aire to the south were covered by the Lawndale Elementary School District and the Centinela Valley Union High School District. Additionally, when Wiseburn was only an elementary school district, Centinela Valley UHSD served as the high school district for that area. Wiseburn USD became a unified district, and therefore left Centinela Valley UHSD, in 2014. In 2021 a block of unincorporated areas that was in the Lawndale School District and Centinela Valley USD voted on a proposal on whether it should move to Wiseburn USD; previously students living in the block living in Wiseburn would have had to get permission from their zoned school districts to attend Wiseburn. According to Hunter Lee the &quot;Daily Breeze&quot;, &quot;few&quot; people voted in the election. The vote to transfer the area to Wiseburn was approved.

<doc id="107621" wikidata="Q768449" url="?curid=107621" title="Diamond Bar, California">
<text>Diamond Bar is a city in eastern Los Angeles County, California, United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.diamondbarcountry.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2020 census listed a population of 55,072. It is one of a few cities in California with a majority Asian population (59.24% as of 2020). It is named after the &quot;diamond over a bar&quot; branding iron registered in 1918 by ranch owner Frederic E. Lewis (1884–1963). The city features a public Los Angeles County golf course.

Located at the junction of the Pomona and Orange freeways, Diamond Bar is primarily residential with shopping centers interspersed throughout the city. It is surrounded by the cities of Brea, Walnut, Chino Hills, Pomona, City of Industry, and the unincorporated areas of Rowland Heights and 
South Diamond Bar.

Northern Diamond Bar is a part of the Pomona Unified School District. Southern Diamond Bar is a part of the Walnut Valley Unified School District. The city is also served by International Polytechnic High School. It also has the first hydrogen fueling station to be built in Southern California, near the South Coast Air Quality Management District building.

==History==

In 1840, José de la Luz Linares received the Mexican land grant Rancho Los Nogales (Ranch of the Walnut Trees) from Governor Juan Alvarado. The land grant included Brea Canyon and the eastern Walnut Valley. Linares died in 1847, and his widow sold a part of the ranch to Ricardo Vejar for $100 in merchandise, 100 calves, and the assumption of her late husband&#x27;s debts. Vejar also owned the Rancho San Jose to the east, and acquired the rest of Rancho Nogales over the next 10 years.

However, Vejar&#x27;s luck did not last that long. As time wore on – and particularly as the United States government took over California – Rancho Los Nogales was divided and sold into multiple land ranches, the largest of which was the Diamond Bar Ranch. At the time, it was one of the largest working cattle ranches in the western U.S. The entire Diamond Bar Ranch was acquired by the Transamerica Corporation in the 1950s for the purpose of developing one of the nation&#x27;s first master-planned communities. Transamerica gave the Diamond Bar name to its new community and incorporated the ranch&#x27;s familiar diamond and bar cattle brand into various logos (many of which are still in use today).

The first houses in this development were built in 1959, adjacent to the future location of the Pomona Freeway, which was built through the area ten years later. The town&#x27;s development and population grew extremely quickly after that.

Transamerica oversaw all development of the community through the 1960s. The Transamerica Corporation divested itself of all its real estate ventures in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Diamond Bar project was sold to multiple developers and much of its initial master plan was not implemented during the latter half of its development in the 1980s.

The City of Diamond Bar was incorporated on April 18, 1989.

==Geography==
Diamond Bar&#x27;s main road, Diamond Bar Boulevard, runs along the bottom of the valley that eventually becomes Brea Canyon, and housing developments overlook the boulevard on both sides from surrounding hills. The city lies roughly between the ends of the Chino Fault and the Whittier Fault, both part of the Elsinore Fault Zone.

Positioned in the southeastern corner of the San Gabriel Valley in eastern Los Angeles County, Diamond Bar is approximately east of Downtown Los Angeles. Neighboring communities include Walnut, Rowland Heights, and Pomona. Diamond Bar is also adjacent to the Inland Empire region, with Chino Hills directly to the east, and to the south of Diamond Bar lie the cities of Brea and La Habra in Orange County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with no significant bodies of water.

Both the CA-60 Freeway and the CA-57 Freeway run through Diamond Bar. the I-10 Freeway is just north of the city and CA-71 is just east of the city. Major thoroughfares include Grand Avenue, Diamond Bar Boulevard, Pathfinder Road, Golden Springs Drive, and Brea Canyon Road.

<text>Downey is a city located in Southeast Los Angeles County, California, United States, southeast of Downtown Los Angeles. It is considered part of the Gateway Cities. The city is the birthplace of the Apollo space program and Taco Bell. It is also the home of the oldest operating McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in the world. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 114,355.

==History==

===18th century to World War II===

Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was initially founded on September 8, 1771, near settlements of the Tongva people. It was located in the Whittier Narrows on a bluff overlooking the Rio Hondo, near the modern intersection of San Gabriel Blvd and Lincoln Avenue. After five years, flooding forced the relocation of the mission to its present site in San Gabriel.

In 1784, Governor Pedro Fages granted to former soldier Manuel Nieto (1734–1804) the largest of the land concessions made in what was then Alta California, a province of New Spain. Its stretched from the Santa Ana River on the east to the Old San Gabriel River (now the Rio Hondo and Los Angeles River) on the west, and from the mission highway (approximately Whittier Boulevard) on the north to the ocean on the south. Its acreage was slightly reduced later at the insistence of Mission San Gabriel on whose lands it infringed. The Spanish concessions, of which 25 were made in California, were unlike the later Mexican land grants in that title was not transferred but were similar to grazing permits with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.

The Rancho Los Nietos passed to Manuel Nieto&#x27;s four children upon his death and remained intact until 1833 when his heirs petitioned Mexican Governor José Figueroa to partition the property. The northwestern portion of the original rancho, comprising the Downey-Norwalk area, was granted as Rancho Santa Gertrudes to Josefa Cota, the widow of Manuel Nieto&#x27;s son, Antonio Nieto. At approximately , Santa Gertrudes was itself a sizable rancho and contained the old Nietos homestead, which was a center of social life east of the pueblo of Los Angeles.
Dairy was a major industry in Downey. The Central Milk Agency marketed the milk for &quot;seven hundred dairymen whose dairy herds range from thirty to two thousand head&quot; with the value of the products marketed in excess of $1,000,000 per month. 
Some of Downey&#x27;s settlers came from Ireland. Downey was founded by and named for the former and youngest ever governor of California, John Gately Downey, who was born in Ireland. Although he was an Irish Democrat, he supported the Republican Lincoln in his efforts to keep the Union intact during the American Civil War. He pioneered the modern subdivision with land he acquired between the Rio Hondo and the San Gabriel River, in about 1865. Downey was convinced that oranges would flourish in Southern California, so he imported several varieties, and therefore set in motion what became one of the state&#x27;s biggest cash crops.

===Gallatin===
Two small settlements were established along the Rio Hondo River - College Settlement and Gallatin, near where the modern Paramount Boulevard and Florence Avenue cross. In the late 1860s, the Gallatin residents built a small school known as the &quot;Little Red Gallatin School House&quot;. By 1871, it was not large enough and a two-story school was built. Gallatin School moved in 1893 to its present site. Later, Alameda School and Downey School were built. By 1883, College Settlement, Gallatin and Downey joined and with the help of Governor Downey convinced the Southern Pacific Railroad to route through and stop in Downey. The new center of activity migrated to the depot area and this became the center of a new larger Downey, uniting the three previous settlements.

===After World War II===

Farmers in the area grew grain, corn, castor beans, and fruit, and by 1935 Downey was characterized as an &quot;orange-grove town&quot;. 
Downey was incorporated in 1956 and instituted a charter form of government in 1964. Suburban homes and factories replaced the farms after World War II.

====Aerospace====
Vultee Aircraft was Downey&#x27;s largest employer during World War II producing 15% of all of America&#x27;s military aircraft by 1941. The company was a pioneer in the use of women in manufacturing positions and was the first aircraft company to build airplanes on a powered assembly line. Vultee became a part of North American Aviation (later North American Rockwell, then Rockwell International which was then bought by the Boeing company) whose facilities were the birthplace of the systems for the Apollo Space Program as well as the Space Shuttle. For over 70 years, Downey&#x27;s Rockwell NASA plant produced and tested many of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest aviation, missile, and space endeavors.

The seventy-year history of airplane and space vehicle manufacturing in Downey came to an end when the Rockwell plant closed in 1999. The plant was demolished and replaced by the Columbia Memorial Space Center, Downey Landing shopping center, Promenade at Downey shopping center (the former movie studio site of Downey Studios), a Kaiser Permanente hospital, and a city recreation fields park.

====Other landmarks====
Near the center of the city lies what was in the 1960s one of the busiest intersections in California, the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Firestone Boulevard (former State Route 42). Route 19 was a major thoroughfare between Pasadena and the port at Long Beach and Route 42 was along part of the old Spanish El Camino Real trail that connected the Pueblo de Los Angeles to San Diego.

In the 1960s, the town&#x27;s Downey Records achieved some notoriety with recordings such as The Chantays&#x27; surfing instrumental &quot;Pipeline&quot;; nearly two decades later, Downey&#x27;s local music scene led to the founding of The Blasters and Dark Angel.

Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, the main public rehabilitation hospital for Los Angeles County, is located in Downey. Rancho Los Amigos is renowned worldwide for its innovative contributions to the care of spinal cord injuries and post-polio syndrome.

Downey was featured in the 2008 American action-comedy film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;. Many of the buildings along Florence Avenue are seen in a driving sequence early in the film.

Downey is home to the world&#x27;s oldest existing McDonald&#x27;s Restaurant, the so-called Speedee McDonald&#x27;s Store, which opened in 1953 at the southwest corner of Florence Avenue and Lakewood Boulevard. Damaged in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, the store reopened in 1996 along with a museum and gift shop.

==Culture==
The author Tom Wolfe wrote about Downey. His article &quot;The Hair Boys&quot; was about Harvey&#x27;s Drive-in and the fashions that the hair boys wore. He claimed that Harvey&#x27;s was one of the great unacknowledged centers of fashion in the world. The essay appears in his 1968 book &quot;The Pump House Gang.&quot; His drawing of one of the hair boys appears in his book &quot;In Our Time.&quot;

In 1955, Downey was featured in newspapers worldwide when truck driver George Di Peso lived at 7739 Alderdale Street and had a gopher problem. He tried to solve it by putting a hose down a gopher hole and turning on the water to drown it, but could not get the hose out afterwards. He then noticed that the hose was slowly being pulled down the hole. Wire services found out about this, and the mysterious phenomenon was reported in newspapers worldwide. According to a July 3, 1955, front-page article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (&quot;Tokyo Awaits Arrival of Downey Hose&quot;), &quot;A message received from Tokyo at the United Press office here read &#x27;Tell Di Peso in Downey the other end of his hose has not turned up here, but we&#x27;re all still looking.&#x27;&quot; There was a great deal of speculation about the cause of the disappearing hose. Eventually the hose vanished completely. The most likely explanation was that there was an underground river that pulled at the hose.

In the early 1960s, it was widely reported that the Downey City Library had banned Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Tarzan&quot; books because Tarzan was not married to Jane when they conceived Boy. Evidence for the rumor&#x27;s staying power is in articles in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that were published in the 1970s (for example, &quot;Downey Sends L.A. Back to the Bush League,&quot; Jack Smith, May 8, 1970). The rumor about Tarzan was, however, an exaggeration. According to &quot;Zane Grey Also Safe: Tarzan’s Marital Status No Issue as Downey School Ban Is Denied&quot; (&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; December 28, 1961), a rumor spread that one of Downey&#x27;s elementary schools had removed Edgar Rice Burroughs and Zane Grey books from its library because &quot;1—There was no indication that Tarzan and his mate, Jane, were ever married before they took up housekeeping in the treetops,&quot; and &quot;2—Grey was known to put such expletives as &#x27;damn!’ and &#x27;hell&#x27; in the mouths of his western cowhands.&quot; It turns out that there was no &quot;ban.&quot; What happened was that in one elementary school, a parent had put two Zane Grey books &quot;out of site in a desk drawer.&quot; No Tarzan books were involved. The Zane Grey books were put back on the shelves.

===Public libraries===
The Downey City Library serves the city. The first library in Downey was established in 1901 by a women&#x27;s social club that was founded in 1898. The County of Los Angeles Public Library opened a branch in Downey in September 1915. The county branch moved several times; its final location was in the County Civic Center. In 1958 the Downey City Council voted to establish its own library and withdraw from the county system. The city library services were originally provided out of the back of a bookstore. The city library opened in the former cafeteria of the former Downey Elementary School, then being used as the city hall and police station, on July 1, 1958. A permanent library building was built on December 7, 1959. It had almost and it was built for $186,200, costing $11.97 per square foot. It was dedicated on December 17 and opened on December 18. In February 1984 an addition of almost was completed and dedicated.

In March 2019, the city announced that it would be using Measure S funds to begin remodeling on the city library. The remodeling was initially supposed to last 15 months, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in the project. The remodeled city library opened on May 3, 2021, with notable updates including mobile app support for checkouts and a multi-use community space.

In addition, the headquarters of the County of Los Angeles Public Library are located in Downey.

<doc id="107623" wikidata="Q927189" url="?curid=107623" title="Duarte, California">
<text>Duarte () is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 21,727. It is bounded to the north by the San Gabriel Mountains, to the north and west by the cities of Bradbury and Monrovia, to the south by the city of Irwindale, and to the east by the cities of Irwindale and Azusa. Duarte is located on historic U.S. Route 66, which today follows Huntington Drive through the middle of the city. The town is named after Andrés Avelino Duarte, a California &quot;ranchero&quot; (rancher) who founded the community on his land grant, Rancho Azusa de Duarte.

== History ==
Around 500 B.C., a band of Shoshonean-speaking Indians established settlements in what is now the San Gabriel Valley. These Native Americans were dubbed the Gabrieliño Indians (after San Gabriel, the local mission) by early Spanish colonial explorers, but now generally prefer to be called the Tongva. Since the San Gabriel Valley area was home to large numbers of oak trees such as coast live oak and interior live oak, a staple of the Tongva diet was an acorn meal made by boiling acorn flour.

===Spanish era===
Duarte&#x27;s history with Europeans dates back to 1769, when all land in California was claimed by the king of Spain. The first Europeans visited the San Gabriel Valley during a 1769 expedition from San Diego to Monterey Bay commanded by Don Gaspar de Portolà. Accompanying Portolà was a Franciscan priest from Junípero Serra&#x27;s order in Mexico, Juan Crespí, who served as the diarist of the expedition. Much of what is known of early California is known only from the detailed descriptions recorded by Crespi.

On September 8, 1771, the Franciscans established the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel in the San Gabriel Valley. The mission was a resting point for early California travelers and gathered most of the native Tongva into an agricultural lifestyle. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the mission lands were nationalized.

===Mexican era===
On May 10, 1841, the governor of Alta California, Juan Bautista Alvarado, granted to former Mexican corporal Andrés Avelino Duarte and his wife nearly of prime land in the central-northern San Gabriel Valley. Duarte named his new holdings &quot;Rancho Azusa de Duarte&quot;. The name &quot;Azusa&quot; was derived from &quot;Asuksa-gna&quot;, meaning &quot;skunk place,&quot; the name of the Tongva settlement on the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley, on the western side of the alluvial fan where the San Gabriel River exits the San Gabriel Mountains; a portion of this area forms the northeastern-most corner of Duarte. That land grant now comprises portions of Arcadia, portions of Monrovia, all of Bradbury, all of Duarte, portions of Irwindale, portions of Azusa and a portion of Baldwin Park. Corporal Duarte had the local Indians build a small hut for his family and help him plant a kitchen garden and orchards near &quot;the Indian Springs of the Asuksas&quot; (in what is now Fish Canyon).

===Post-Conquest era===
Following the American Conquest of California, the territory was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican–American War. In 1851, Congress passed a bill that established a Board of Land Commissioners whose duty was to determine the validity of all grants of Alta California land by Spanish and Mexican authorities.

Corporal Duarte began incurring legal expenses and other debts, which he defrayed by selling portions of his Rancho. This first sale was a parcel at the southern end of the Rancho to Michael Whistler and two unidentified colleagues. Whistler later bought out his colleagues and sold the entire parcel to Dr. Nehemiah Beardslee, who started the first school in Duarte (which now bears his surname) and laid out the first section of Duarte&#x27;s water lines. Corporal Duarte divided much of the Rancho&#x27;s remainder into plots and sold them individually. Corporal Duarte finally won a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court for his land grant case in 1878, but by then he had sold the entire Rancho.

Many of Duarte&#x27;s earliest pioneer families came to Duarte in the mid-19th century for their health, the pleasant climate, and the fertile soil. English settlers, Americans from the Midwest and Deep South, Latinos who remained from the Rancho days, and Japanese immigrants enabled Duarte to grow into a thriving agricultural community specializing in citrus production. The first recorded avocado tree grown in California was planted in Duarte by William Chappelow, Sr. grown from one of four seeds sent to him by the Division of Pomology of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1893.

===Modern era===
Two medical institutions were started in Duarte in the early part of the 20th century. In 1913, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Association started a tuberculosis sanitarium in the form of a small tent city on of land south of Duarte Road. This later evolved into the world-renowned City of Hope National Medical Center, a recognized leader in fighting cancer and other catastrophic diseases. In 1930, a group of Carmelite nuns known as the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles established what is now the Santa Teresita Rest Home, known until recently as Santa Teresita Medical Center. After decades as a full-service hospital, Santa Teresita was downgraded to &quot;medical center&quot; in the early 21st century, after financial problems, caused both by administrative missteps as well as the costs of providing medical coverage to the uninsured, forced the hospital to close its emergency room. Santa Teresita now operates as an &quot;outpatient services only&quot; facility.

In 1957, a dedicated group of community members, fearing annexation by neighboring cities, led a fight for incorporation. Indeed, parts of the original Rancho had already been annexed by neighboring Monrovia, Azusa, Irwindale, and Baldwin Park. At the same time, a rival group representing an affluent enclave in the foothills started a competing drive for incorporation and broke off to form the separate city of Bradbury. A 2001 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article stated that their petition for incorporation arrived in Sacramento on August 22, 1957, &quot;mere moments&quot; before the petition that would have included what is now Bradbury in the city of Duarte. Still, many ties between the two communities remain in that they both form the Duarte Unified School District; they both share the same post office and the 91008 ZIP code; and they both share combined public services such as the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and Los Angeles County Fire Department, and garbage pickup (provided by Burrtec Waste Services).

The original city logo was created by Bill Botts Sr. in 1957. It consisted of a double-circular seal, with the inner circle containing an adobe arch featuring the Rancho Azusa de Duarte &quot;d&quot; brand (inside the arch is the original date of the Rancho&#x27;s establishment, 1841) while the outer circle features the year of Duarte&#x27;s incorporation (1957). The current city logo was created in early 1982 to mark Duarte&#x27;s 25th anniversary of cityhood.

Like many of its neighbors, modern Duarte is a bedroom community. The city of Duarte is geographically isolated from population centers to the east and south due to the San Gabriel River and rock quarry operations in Irwindale and Azusa. These factors have proven to be an ongoing economic challenge for local businesses as the city attracts little outside spending, and most residents spend their money elsewhere. Due to air quality and noise concerns, the city of Duarte has sought repeatedly to halt the expansion of neighboring quarry operations but has had no success against the monied interests behind the quarries and the neighboring city governments beholden to them. Still, over the past few decades, the city leadership has succeeded in bringing retail development to the western portion of Duarte.

In September 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine placed the ZIP code of 91008 at #1 on its annual list of America&#x27;s most expensive ZIP codes, containing the parts of Duarte immediately north of neighboring Bradbury.

<text>East Los Angeles (), or East L.A., is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) situated within Los Angeles County, California, United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, East Los Angeles is designated as a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. The most recent data from the 2020 census reports a population of 118,786, reflecting a 6.1% decrease compared to the 2010 population of 126,496.

The concentration of Hispanic/Latino Americans is 95.16 percent, the highest of any large city or census-designated place in the United States outside of Puerto Rico.

==History==
===Original East Los Angeles===
Historically, when it was founded in 1873, the neighborhood northeast of downtown known today as Lincoln Heights was originally named East Los Angeles, but in 1917, residents voted to change the name to its present name. Today, it is considered part of Eastside Los Angeles, the geographic region east of the Los Angeles River that includes three neighborhoods within the city of Los Angeles (Boyle Heights, El Sereno, and Lincoln Heights) and the unincorporated community in Los Angeles County known today as &quot;East Los Angeles&quot;. Lincoln Heights is northwest of present-day East Los Angeles. When Lincoln Heights, the first Eastside subdivision created in 1873, changed its name in 1917, Belvedere (Belvedere Gardens and Belvedere Heights) and surrounding unincorporated county areas were given the moniker of East Los Angeles. By the 1930s, most maps had started to label the Belvedere area as &quot;East Los Angeles&quot;.

===Belvedere===

The cornerstone of the first building of Occidental College was laid in September 1887 on Rowan Street. In 1896, the building was destroyed by fire.

On April 2, 1905, it was reported that the Janss Investment Company would be developing an area &quot;on Boyle Heights&quot; (later, Boyle Heights would refer only to a smaller area to the west, i.e. the neighborhood now called Boyle Heights within the Los Angeles city limits). The tract was located at the eastern terminus of the Los Angeles Railway&#x27;s &quot;R&quot; streetcar line. 
Originally known as &quot;Hazard&#x27;s Eastside Extension&quot;, was to be named Highland Villa, but would later be rechristened Belvedere Heights. Belvedere Heights, at its launch in 1905, extended from the L.A. city limits (Indiana Av.) on the west to Rowan Av. on the east, from Aliso St. on the south to Wabash Av. on the north, the northwestern portion of today&#x27;s East Los Angeles, thus including the lower portions of what today is called City Terrace.

By the early 1920s, workers in the sprouting industrial district to the south were seeking nearby housing. At the time, the unincorporated region was undeveloped and or preserved for agriculture and oil extraction. Belvedere township included the territory that in 1902 became the city of Montebello.

By 1922 Janss advertised that it had sold 6000 lots there and that 35,000 people lived in Belvedere Heights. Buildings that were described as being in Belvedere Heights included the junior high school on Record between Brooklyn and Michigan, now called Belvedere Middle School.

In February 1921 Janss announced that it had purchased adjacent to the end of the streetcar line on Stephenson Avenue, now Whittier Boulevard, south of Belvedere Heights, and divided the empty land into housing lots of square-mile grid cells. Janss called the new tract Belvedere Gardens, an area still found today on maps for the area east of the Long Beach Freeway.

The area was able to avoid being annexed into the City of Los Angeles because of a private groundwater utility formed in 1926 now known as the California Water Service, which would later become a customer of the Metropolitan Water District. Prior to the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, governing bodies would set property taxes independently, which led to a cumulative overlapping rate including bond taxes for large infrastructure projects such as the building of the Port of Los Angeles. However, unincorporated areas were often forced to incorporate or be annexed into these taxing entities in order to obtain critical municipal services such as water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct. For decades, the lack of a city property tax and bond taxes made East Los Angeles a tax haven for the working class.

===New name: East Los Angeles===
In 1932 local business leaders gave the name East Los Angeles to Belvedere and adjacent areas (that had been known as Belvedere Gardens, Belvedere Heights, Laguna, etc.) However, in 1937 the Automobile Club of Southern California put up three large signs, &quot;Belvedere Gardens&quot;. This led to the business leaders uprooting the signs, with a &quot;burial ceremony&quot; for the signs with 150 state, county, and city officials attending, and they rechristeed the area East Los Angeles. Several county buildings were renamed in line with the new appellation. At that time the area had 75,000 residents and was &quot;declared to be the largest unincorporated locality in the world.&quot;

East Los Angeles was a significant site during the Chicano Movement, which included the East L.A. Walkouts in 1968 and the National Chicano Moratorium, in which Ruben Salazar was killed.

Multiple campaigns by residents have been made for cityhood for East Los Angeles, such as in 2010.

===Our Lady of Solitude===
Our Lady of Solitude, known as Soledad Church, opened its doors on Christmas Day in 1925. Located in the neighborhood now known as Old Town Maravilla. The church was constructed in Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. In December 1931, the Church held its first outdoor procession in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a ritual that continues today. The Guadalupe Procession is the oldest religious procession in Los Angeles.

Starting in the 1960s, labor leader Cesar Chavez and members of the United Farm Workers met with the Claretian priests, who also became activists, in the church&#x27;s basement. The street in front of the church is known as Cesar Chavez Avenue. In October 1993, the Los Angeles City Council and the County Board of Supervisors approved the renaming of the stretch of roadway, but agreed to delay the change until 1994 and to put up historic plaques along Brooklyn Avenue to accommodate the opposition, many of whom believed that the new name would cause people to forget the Jewish history of the area. In 1979, the tile-clad cupola and bell tower were removed due to termite damage, and the bells were reinstalled near the church entrance.

===The Golden Gate Theater===

The former Golden Gate Theater movie palace a Spanish Baroque Revival Churrigueresque-style building built in 1927, is one of fewer than two dozen buildings in Los Angeles in the Spanish Churrigueresque style and one of a few remaining in southern California.

The Latino Walk of Fame was inaugurated on April 30, 1997, to honor outstanding leaders who have made historical and social contributions with a Sun Plaque on Whittier Boulevard the heart of East L.A. Spaces have been created for over 280 plaques. Permanent granite plaques have been put in place for the first 20 honorees. The merchants’ association of East Los Angeles sponsors a comprehensive clean-up campaign that cleans the sidewalks and gutters daily and removes litter and trash. Though the Latino Walk of Fame is there, it seems to go unnoticed, &quot;The Latino Walk of Fame had a good run once it started...&quot;.

===El Pino===
El Pino (The Pine Tree) is a large bunya pine located on the southeastern corner of Folsom Street and N. Indiana Street overlooking the Wellington Heights neighborhood of East Los Angeles and the Boyle Heights from atop a small hill. The people of East Los Angeles consider the tree a living monument of the area&#x27;s multifaceted ethnic background. The tree has become a symbol of community resistance to the gentrification of their neighborhood.

==Parks and recreation==
Los Angeles County operates parks and recreation in East Los Angeles.

Built in 1942 and originally known as Soledad Park, the Belvedere Community Regional Park has a baseball diamond and picnic area that was upgrade in the 1980s, basketball courts, a playground, community center, fitness zone, gymnasium, skate park, soccer field, splash pad, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and tennis courts. The park was renamed in 1949 and has a Vernacular architecture style. The LA county constructed a courthouse and sheriff&#x27;s station on the south end of Belvedere Park in the mid-1950s. Then more buildings were added in time, in conjunction with the East Los Angeles Library, turning the southern end of the park into in effect a civic center. The construction of the Pomona Freeway (I-60) in the 1960s cut through the park, dividing it into two connected by a bridge. In the late 1960s the county also constructed a pond (Belvedere Lake) in the southern area of the park, known to locals as &quot;El Parque de los Patos&quot; (The duck park). The park is a popular place for festivals and host musicians, artisans, fishing and other events in its lakeside amphitheater. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife supplies the lake with rainbow trout during the Winter through early Spring and catfish during the Summer. There are also some largemouth bass, carp and bluegill in the lake. On August 29, 1970, Belvedere Park was the starting point of the Chicano Moratorium. An estimated 30,000 people marched from Belvedere Park to Laguna Park (now Salazar Park). In the 1990s the northern region of the part was revitalized.

Atlantic Avenue Park has a children&#x27;s play area, picnic, and barbecue areas, a men&#x27;s locker room, a women&#x27;s locker room, and a 50-meter, six-lane swimming pool. In addition, the park has a rose garden maintained by volunteers.

Eugene A. Obregon Park is named after Eugene A. Obregon, a veteran and Medal of Honor recipient. The park&#x27;s official opening was on May 26, 1966. The park includes basketball courts, ceramic rooms, a community room, a computer center, a fitness zone, a gymnasium, a multi-purpose field, a swimming pool, and a walking path.

The Salazar Park is within East Los Angeles and has a moderne architecture. The county purchased the original of park property from Cedars of Lebanon Hospital on March 8, 1938. The land was officially designated as the &quot;East Los Angeles Playground&quot; two months later. On June 25, 1940, the property was renamed the &quot;Laguna Park and Playground.&quot; On September 17, 1970, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors gave the park its current name. The park includes a baseball diamond, basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, a community room, a computer center, a gymnasium, picnic shelters, a senior center, a swimming pool, and tennis courts. On August 29, 2014, the County dedicated a plaque at the site in honor of Ruben Salazar.

The Saybrook Park is also in East Los Angeles. The County Board of Supervisors approved final plans for developing the park on May 1, 1973. The park includes two outdoor basketball courts, a ball diamond, children&#x27;s play areas, a community building with a community room, a computer technology building with a computer room, picnic and barbecue areas, and a tennis court.
City Terrace County Park was developed in 1933 by Works Progress Administration crews; the park occupied a piece of terrace that was formed after crews hacked a rugged and barren hill. In 1957 of soil that had been removed from the construction of the Los Angeles Civic Center was transported to the City Terrace County Park. The soil filled a ravine, tripling the park&#x27;s original acreage. The park has a basketball court, a children&#x27;s playground, a community room, a computer center, a gymnasium, a multi-purpose field, a swimming pool, and tennis courts.

The Eastside Eddie Heredia Boxing Club, operated by the county, is inside a former fire station. The club was named after Eddie Heredia, the first club champion, who died of leukemia at age 17. One of the members of the Heredia club became a member of the United States Olympic Boxing Team and entered the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

<text>El Monte is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city lies in the San Gabriel Valley, east of the city of Los Angeles.

El Monte&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Welcome to Friendly El Monte&quot; and is historically known as &quot;The End of the Santa Fe Trail&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 109,450, down from 113,475 at the 2010 census. As of 2020, El Monte was the 66th-most populous city in California.

==Origin of name==
El Monte is situated between the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo Rivers; a marshy area roughly where the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area is now located. Residents claimed that anything could be grown in the area. Between 1770 and 1830, Spanish soldiers and missionaries often stopped here for respite. They called the area &#x27;El Monte,&#x27; which in Spanish means &#x27;the mountain&#x27; or &#x27;the mount&#x27;. Most people assume the name refers to a mountain, but there were no mountains in the valley. The word is an archaic Spanish translation of that era, meaning &quot;the wood&quot;. The first explorers had found this a rich, low-altitude land blanketed with thick growths of wispy willows, alders, and cattails, located between the two rivers. Wild grapevines and watercress also abounded. El Monte is approximately 7 miles long and 4 miles wide. When the State Legislature organized California into more manageable designated townships in the 1850s, they called it the El Monte Township. In a short time the name returned to the original El Monte.

==History==
===Pre-1800s===

The area, beside the San Gabriel River, is part of the homeland of the Tongva people as it has been for thousands of years. The Spanish Portolá expedition of missionaries and soldiers passed through the area in 1769–1770. Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was the center of colonial activities in the area. The site was within the Mexican land grant Rancho La Puente.

===1800s===
The Old Spanish Trail trade route was first established by Antonio Armijo in 1829. It passed through El Monte to its terminus at the Mission San Gabriel via what is now Valley Boulevard. The trade was woolen and other products from New Mexico for California horses and mules.

Using the Old Spanish Trail route at the end of 1841, a group of travelers and settlers, now referred to as the Workman-Rowland Party, arrived in the Pueblo of Los Angeles and this area in Alta California from Santa Fe de Nuevo México. Rowland and Workman became grantees of the Rancho La Puente in 1845.

The Old Spanish Trail from Santa Fe was continued east via the Santa Fe Trail trade route, established in 1821 as a trail and wagon road connecting Kansas City in Missouri Territory to Santa Fe, still within México.

From 1847, the Santa Fe Trail was also connected westward through the Southern Emigrant Trail, and in 1848 by the Mormon Road from Utah, passing by the El Monte area, to the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Immigrant settlement began in 1848, El Monte was a stopping place for the American immigrants going to the gold fields during the California Gold Rush. The first permanent residents arrived in El Monte around 1849-1850 mostly from Texas, Arkansas and Missouri, during a time when thousands migrated to California in search of gold. The first settlers with families were Nicholas Schmidt, Ira W. Thompson, G. and F. Cuddeback, J. Corbin, and J. Sheldon.

These migrants ventured upon the bounty of fruitful, rich land along the San Gabriel River and began to build homesteads there. The farmers were very pleased at the increasing success of El Monte&#x27;s agricultural community, and it steadily grew over the years.

In the 1850s the settlement was briefly named Lexington by American settlers, but soon returned to being called El Monte or Monte. It was at the crossroad of routes between Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and the natural harbor at San Pedro. In the early days, it had a reputation as a rough town where men often settled disputes with knives and guns in its gambling saloons. Defense against Indian raids and the crimes of bandit gangs, such as that of Joaquin Murrieta, led to the formation of a local militia company called the Monte Rangers in February 1854. After the Monte Rangers disbanded, justice for Los Angeles County, in the form of volunteer s, as in the 1857 hunt for the bandit gang of Juan Flores and Pancho Daniel, or a lynching, was often provided by the local vigilantes called the &quot;El Monte Boys&quot;.

In 1858 the adobe Monte Station was established, a stagecoach stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail Section 2 route.

By 1861 El Monte had become a sizeable settlement, and during the American Civil War was considered a Confederate stronghold sympathetic to the secession of Southern California from California to support the Confederate States of America. A. J. King an Undersheriff of Los Angeles County (and former member of the earlier &quot;Monte Rangers&quot; or &quot;Monte Boys&quot;) with other influential men in El Monte, formed a secessionist militia company, like the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, called the Monte Mounted Rifles on March 23, 1861. However, the attempt failed when following the battle of Fort Sumter, A. J. King marched through the streets with a portrait of the Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard and was arrested by a U.S. Marshal. State arms sent from Governor John G. Downey for the unit were held up by Union officers at the port of San Pedro. Union troops established New Camp Carleton near the town in March 1862 to suppress any rebellion, it was shut down three years later at the end of the war.

El Monte was listed as a township in the 1860 and 1870 Censuses, with a population of 1,004 in 1860 and 1,254 in 1870. The 1860 township comprised several of the old ranchos in the El Monte area, including Rancho Potrero Grande, Rancho La Puente and Rancho La Merced. (This area presently includes the cities of El Monte, Monterey Park and La Puente, among others). The 1870 census added in the former Azusa township.

Southern Pacific built a railroad depot in town in 1873, stimulating the growth of local agriculture.

===1900s===
El Monte was incorporated as a municipality in 1912. During the 1930s, the city became a vital site for the New Deal&#x27;s federal Subsistence Homestead project, a Resettlement Administration program that helped grant single-family ranch houses to qualifying applicants. It became home to many 1930s white Americans from the Dust Bowl Migration.

Photographer Dorothea Lange took over a dozen photographs of the newly built Homestead homes for her work for the Farm Security Administration in Feb. 1936. Lange stopped in El Monte a month before she took her most well-known photograph from the period, the Migrant Mother. &quot;In contrast to the apparently positive scene in El Monte... in San Luis Obispo County, Lange captured a far gloomier scene of a Native-American mother with her children.&quot; San Gabriel Valley in Time observed.

The area also experienced social and labor conflict during this period, such as the El Monte Berry Strike of 1933, which shed light upon institutional racism experienced by Japanese tenant farmers and Latino farm laborers.

The city has evolved into a majority Hispanic community. Representing the historical significance of the Santa Fe Trail, El Monte built the Santa Fe Trail Historical Park in 1989, at Valley Blvd and Santa Anita Ave. The trail remained America&#x27;s greatest route for several decades thereafter. The El Monte Historical Museum at 3150 Tyler Avenue is considered to be one of the best community museums in the state of California.

===Modern===
The Asian population of El Monte grew significantly between 1980 and 2008, and continued to grow. According to a former El Monte resident, this may have been because of overpopulation in Alhambra, Monterey Park, and other nearby heavily Asian municipalities; causing people to move to less densely populated areas like El Monte, where the cities are still accessible by freeway.

==In popular culture==
El Monte is credited with being the birthplace of TV variety shows. &quot;Hometown Jamboree&quot;, a KTLA-TV Los Angeles-based show, was produced at El Monte Legion Stadium in the 1950s. The Saturday night stage show was hosted and produced by Cliffie Stone, who helped popularize country music in California.

In the 1950s, as the unstable racial climate and the hostility toward rock &amp; roll started to emerge, rock &amp; roll shows were forced from the City of Los Angeles by police pressure. The El Monte Legion Stadium, outside the city limits, became the site of a series for rock and roll concerts by Johnny Otis and other performers. (Johnny Otis along with Alan Freed and Dick Clark were the major powers in the growing rock and roll industry.) During the fifties, teenagers from all over Southern California flocked to El Monte Legion Stadium every Friday and Saturday night to see their favorite performers. Famous singers who performed there include: Ritchie Valens, Rosie &amp; the Originals, Brenton Wood, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, The Grateful Dead, Dick Dale and his Del-Tones and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Disc jockeys Art Laboe and Huggy Boy enhanced the stadium&#x27;s popularity with their highly publicized Friday Night Dances with many popular record artists of the late 1950s and 1960s. &quot;El Monte Legion Stadium&quot;, as it was often called, was the &quot;Happening&quot; place to be for the teenagers of that era. In a closed-circuit telecast, a recorded performance of The Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Lesly Gore aired in the El Monte Legion Stadium from Mar 14–15, 1964.

El Monte is known for the long-time rock &amp; roll hit &quot;Memories of El Monte&quot;, written by Frank Zappa and originally recorded by The Penguins, one of the local Doo-wop groups from the 1950s that became famous nationwide. The song is in remembrance of The El Monte Legion Stadium and can be heard on many albums including &quot;Art Laboe&#x27;s Memories of El Monte&quot;. Although the stadium closed their doors nearly 50 years ago, the music continues to live on.
El Monte was the birthplace of singer–guitarist Mary Ford, of Les Paul and Mary Ford fame. John Larkin, known as (Scatman John), is also a native. El Monte was home to musicians Gregg Myers and Joe McDonald, who performed in the 1960s with Country Joe and the Fish. 

A popular attraction from 1925 to 1942 was Gay&#x27;s Lion Farm. Two European retired circus stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gay, operated this tourist attraction, which has been called &quot;the Disneyland of the 1920s and 1930s&quot; by historian Jack Barton, and many others of that era. The Gays raised wild animals for use in the motion picture industry and housed over 200 African lions. Many of the lions starred in films during the 1920s and 1930s, including the Tarzan films starring Elmo Lincoln and Johnny Weissmuller. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion logo was made with two lions from the farm, &quot;Slats&quot; (1924–1927), and his lookalike successor &quot;Jackie&quot; (1928-1956). Another one of the farm&#x27;s famous lions was Numa, who appeared in several films throughout the 1920s, including Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Circus.&quot; In 1925, El Monte Union High School adopted &quot;The Lions&quot; name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games. The famous live lion farm was closed temporarily due to wartime meat shortages. It never reopened, but a life-sized memorial statue can be seen next to I-10 on the SE corner of Valley Boulevard and Peck Road. The original lion statue, commissioned for the Farm, stands in front of nearby El Monte High School.

Horse racing&#x27;s most famous jockey, Willie Shoemaker, was a resident and attended El Monte High School, until he dropped out to work in the nearby stables.
El Monte was also briefly the home to author James Ellroy until his mother Geneva was murdered there in 1958.
Former baseball player Fred Lynn was a resident of El Monte. Actor-filmmaker Timothy Carey filmed much of his underground feature &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Sinner&quot; (1962) in El Monte. Modern authors Salvador Plascencia, 33, and Michael Jaime-Becerra, 36, both grew up in El Monte and each references El Monte in his novels. Mister Ed, the palomino of the classic 1960s television show, was foaled in 1949 in El Monte and named &quot;Bamboo Harvester&quot;.

<text>El Segundo ( , ; ) is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Located on Santa Monica Bay, it was incorporated on January 18, 1917, and is part of the South Bay Cities Council of Governments. The population was 17,272 as of the 2020 census, a 3.7% increase from 16,654 in the 2010 census. A significant center of the oil and aerospace industries in Southern California, roughly three quarters of the city&#x27;s land is dedicated exclusively to industrial and commercial uses, including a Chevron oil refinery which alone takes up more than a quarter of the entire city.

==History==
The El Segundo and Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva (or Gabrieleños) Native American tribes. The area was once a part of &quot;Rancho Sausal Redondo&quot; (&quot;Round Willow Patch Ranch&quot;). Rancho Sausal Redondo extended from Playa Del Rey in the north to Redondo Beach in the south. Originally a Mexican land grant owned by Antonio Ygnacio Avila, the rancho was later purchased by a Scottish baronet named Sir Robert Burnett in 1860. After his return to Scotland in 1873, the property was purchased by then-manager of the rancho, Daniel Freeman. Daniel Freeman sold portions of the rancho to several persons. George H. Peck owned the of land where the Chevron Refinery now sits. The city acquired its name (&quot;the second&quot; in Spanish) due to being the second Standard Oil refinery on the West Coast when Standard Oil of California purchased the 840 acres of in 1911. Peck also developed land in neighboring El Porto, where a street still bears his name.

The city was incorporated in 1917. The Standard Oil Company was renamed Chevron in 1984. The El Segundo refinery entered its second century of operation in 2011.

The Douglas Aircraft Company plant in El Segundo was one of the major aircraft manufacturing facilities in California during World War II. It was one of the major producers of SBD Dauntless dive bombers, which achieved fame in the Battle of Midway. The facility, now operated by Northrop Grumman, is still an aircraft plant.
In 2009, a pair of local artists discovered the Smoky Hollow area, which mainly consisted of commercial properties. Other artists started to migrate as they had been priced out of Venice Beach and Culver City. Not long after the Tech Industry discovered Smoky Hollow.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 99% of which is land.

The beachfront area neighboring the refinery was once dominated by industrial wharves servicing oil tanker ships, and heavily polluted by sewage and stormwater runoff. The major expansion of the Hyperion wastewater treatment plant in the 1980s was the impetus for rehabilitation of the beach. The old piers were demolished, an underwater oil terminal was constructed a few miles offshore, and an enormous amount of dredged sand was used to restore and dramatically enlarge the once narrow and polluted beach. The Marvin Braude Bike Trail runs along this new artificial beach, as the refinery wharves were one of the last remaining industrial facilities directly obstructing the shoreline of the Santa Monica Bay.

<text>Gardena is a city located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, California, United States. The population was 61,027 at the 2020 census, up from 58,829 at the 2010 census. Until 2014, the U.S. census cited the City of Gardena as the place with the highest percentage of Japanese Americans in California. Gardena&#x27;s Japanese American population contributes to the South Bay region of Los Angeles being home to the highest density of Japanese companies within the mainland United States.

==History==

Based on archaeological findings, the Tongva people hunted and fished in the area of today&#x27;s Gardena. The Tongva Indians — also known as Gabrielino Indians — are probably descendants of those who crossed from Asia to North America around 10,000 years ago.

In 1784, three years after the foundation of Los Angeles, Juan Jose Dominguez (1736–1809), a Spanish soldier who arrived in San Diego, California in 1769 with Fernando Rivera y Moncada, in recognition of his military service, received the roughly Spanish land grant, the Rancho San Pedro. Part of this land contained what became known as Gardena Valley. After the American Civil War veterans bought parts of the land, and soon ranchers and farmers followed suit. Union Army Major General William Starke Rosecrans in 1869 bought . The &quot;Rosecrans Rancho&quot; was bordered by what later was Florence Avenue on the north, Redondo Beach Boulevard on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and Arlington Avenue on the west. The Rosecrans property was subdivided and sold in the early 1870s. One of those became the Amestoy Ranch. Gardena proper began in 1887 when the Pomeroy &amp; Harrison real estate developers subdivided the ranch, anticipating the coming of the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway. Civil War veteran Spencer Roane Thorpe is credited with starting the first settlement in Gardena in 1887. Railroads put Gardena on the map following a 1880s Southern California real estate boom.

Some believe the city was named for its reputation for being the only &quot;green spot&quot; in the dry season between Los Angeles and the sea. Because of its acres of berries, the city was dubbed &quot;Berryland&quot;. The Strawberry Day Festival and Parade was held each May. The berry industry suffered at the time of World War I as other crops were supported by the war economy.

Japanese Americans settled in Gardena throughout its history. The only way Gardena could protect itself from a heavy county tax imposed on a planned project at a park site was to incorporate. The City of Gardena became incorporated on September 11, 1930.

From 1936 to 1980, Gardena held a local monopoly on legal cardrooms, the taxes from which accounted for nearly a third of its annual budget. As this Los Angeles suburb grew, many Japanese American families moved into the new tract homes being built.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 99% of which is land. A wetland preserve, the Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve, is located at the southeast corner of Gardena. This is a naturally occurring marshland where water seeps above-ground all year round. It hosts several species of trees and other vegetation.

Gardena is bordered by the unincorporated community of Athens on the north, the Los Angeles neighborhood of Harbor Gateway on the east and south, Torrance on the southwest, Alondra Park on the west, and Hawthorne on the northwest.

Neighborhoods in Gardena include:
*Hermosillo
*Moneta

<text>Glendora is a city in the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County, California, east of Los Angeles. As of the 2020 census, the population of Glendora was 52,558.

Known as the &quot;Pride of the Foothills&quot;, Glendora is nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Its downtown area, locally known as the Glendora Village, hosts dozens of restaurants, cafes, shops, and boutiques along Glendora Avenue with many community events scheduled throughout the year.

Neighborhoods and residences in Glendora reflect the city&#x27;s history and range from Queen Annes, to Folk Victorians, early 20th-century bungalows, to ranch style homes, to mid-rise multi-family residential complexes, to modern mansions. Glendora&#x27;s most expensive neighborhoods contain many very large, secluded, estate homes with views across the San Gabriel Valley to Downtown Los Angeles.

Glendora is bordered by Azusa and the unincorporated community of Citrus to the west, San Dimas to the east and south, Covina and the unincorporated community of Charter Oak to the south, and the San Gabriel Mountains, including protected areas within the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, to the north.

==History==
The first archaeological evidence of human settlement in Glendora dates from , Around 3500 BCE, the Takic people moved into the area. By the time the first Europeans arrived in present-day Los Angeles County in 1542, the Tongva were the most influential people in the region.


During the Spanish Colonial (1769-1821) and the Mexican (1821-1848) eras, the land of present-day Glendora was divided and developed as Rancho El Susa (later Rancho Azusa de Dalton) in the west and Rancho San Jose in the south and southeast. What is now central and northern Glendora was used as public lands for cattle grazing.

Like many cities in the San Gabriel Valley, Glendora was established on previously remote agricultural land when the area became connected to the outside world upon the completion of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad in May 1887, later purchased by the Santa Fe Railway, connecting Los Angeles to Chicago. Located at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, Glendora was started on approximately that were subdivided and sold by George D. Whitcomb in late March 1887. On the first day of sale, April 1, 1887, 300 lots were sold. Later that month, the Suydam family built the first building erected after Glendora officially became a town – a barn at 645 N Vista Bonita Avenue, which served as their home until their house was completed in October.

Whitcomb was the founder of the Whitcomb Locomotive Works in Chicago and Rochelle, Illinois and had moved to California in the early 1880s. He devised the name &quot;Glendora&quot; by combining the name of his wife, Leadora Bennett Whitcomb (1839-1929), with the location of his home in a glen of the San Gabriel Mountains. In December 1907, the development of Glendora got a boost when passenger service opened on a new extension of the Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s Monrovia–Glendora Line which provided hourly, direct service from downtown Glendora to the Pacific Electric Building at Sixth and Main in Downtown Los Angeles. Prior to its 1911 incorporation, Glendora&#x27;s administrator officially occupied the office of President of Glendora.

The downtown area as it appears now is the product of years of renovation and maintenance by the city. The former opera house, movie theatre, Pacific Electric station, banks, hotels, grocery and department stores were converted into more modern commercial buildings. The original layout can be read about on the Downtown Glendora Historical Walk, by reading placards placed along Glendora Avenue (previously called Michigan Avenue). The original townsite was bounded by Sierra Madre Avenue on the north, Minnesota Avenue on the east, Ada Avenue and the railroad on the south, and Pennsylvania Avenue on the west.

Glendora used to be home to several military academies, which have since been converted into either churches or private school facilities. These academies included Brown Military Academy, now St. Lucy&#x27;s Priory High School and Church of the Open Door on Sierra Madre, and Harding Military Academy, whose property is now home to North Glendora Private, a prestigious private community adjacent to Easley Canyon atop Glendora Avenue.

From 1960 to 1978, Glendora was home to Clokey Productions which produced 85 episodes of Gumby and 65 episodes of Davey and Goliath in town. In celebration of this history, Glendora hosted the first Gumby Fest in 2014 which brought thousands of people from around the country and Canada. In 2015 the 2nd GumbyFest was held at Citrus College over an entire weekend.

Several wildfires have affected the city in recent years, the most notable being the campfire triggered Colby Fire, which displaced hundreds of Glendora residents. A relief concert titled &quot;Glendora Band Aid&quot; was held shortly after the fire to help raise funds to assist the homeowners who lost their homes in the fire.

Glendora has an active Chamber of Commerce, established in 1903. The mission of the Glendora Chamber is to provide tools and resources to assist the business community in prospering and adapting to the economic climate, while growing membership and promoting local purchasing.

Founded as a community in 1887, Glendora was formally incorporated as a city on Nov. 13, 1911 making it the 25th oldest city in Los Angeles County out of a total of 88. It is a general-law city with a council–manager government, meaning the administrative head of the city is a City Manager who is appointed and overseen by a city council of five members. The current City Manager is Adam Raymond.

As of 2020, the members are elected by district and serve four-year (staggered) terms of office. Following each election, the council selects from its membership a mayor and mayor pro tem. The current Mayor is David Fredendall.

In order to avoid the kinds of costly lawsuits other cities had faced under the California Voting Rights Act of 2001, the City of Glendora reluctantly changed how council members are elected by transitioning from an at-large election system to a district-based election system. This included switching the election cycle from odd years to even years. The first phase began in March 2020, when representatives from Council Districts 2, 3 and 5 were elected. The second phase took place in 2022 when representatives from Districts 1 and 4 were on the ballot.

Public safety services are provided by the Glendora Police Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

Glendora City News is a local news outlet focused on issues and events that are relevant to residents of the city of Glendora, California. Founded in November 2014, the newspaper has covered local crime, real estate, social events, and political issues, including some high-profile, highly controversial actions taken by city managers which have resulted in contentious public meetings and citywide calls for the removal of city politicians. The news outlet provides detailed information about scheduled events, public meetings, and incidents of note that occur within the City of Glendora.

Of particular note for Glendora residents, the news outlet contains detailed information about ballot initiatives every time the city holds a vote, listing the ballot propositions without a discernible political bias, a stance that has earned the news outlet a moderately-large on-line subscriber base as well as 18 thousand “like” subscribers on Facebook out of a city population of 50 thousand. Consistently detailing measures on the ballot at every election has made the news source a secondary source of information, with the primary source being the City of Glendora&#x27;s official web sites.

The news outlet also occasionally carries information about local employment openings that have social benefit (such as environmental jobs), and routinely carries updated information about the many foothill fires and mud slides that effect residents in the northern parts of the city during the year&#x27;s fire and rain seasons. Lost and found dogs and cats also get covered fairly routinely at the news outlet, with residents contacting the newspaper asking for help locating either a found pet&#x27;s guardians or their missing pets.

The news outlet also offers a Community Calendar series which covers up-coming events which include city meetings as well as local events created by local shops, fast food franchises, and volunteer organizations.

The news outlet asks local residents to provide news tips and commentary about anything that happens in the city, including information about what city planners and managers are up to. In the past such tips have led to volunteer efforts by residents who have organized clean-up efforts of public property, such as the South Hills Dog Park where the drinking water facilities had been left in disrepair and needed cleaning.

<doc id="107634" wikidata="Q985355" url="?curid=107634" title="Hawaiian Gardens, California">
<text>Hawaiian Gardens is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is the smallest city in the county in area (approximately 1.0 mi2) and was incorporated on April 9, 1964. The population was 14,149 at the 2020 census, down slightly from 14,254 at the 2010 census.

The city&#x27;s unusual name originated with a 1920s refreshment stand that was decorated with palm fronds and bamboo. It was the then-rural area&#x27;s main landmark for many years, and its name stuck as the small town grew up around it. As one of seven Los Angeles County cities that allow casino gambling, more than $9.2 million (65%) of the city&#x27;s revenue comes from the Gardens Casino.

==Geography==
Hawaiian Gardens is bounded by the Los Angeles County cities of Long Beach and Lakewood and by the Orange County city of Cypress.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (1.09%) is water. Hawaiian Gardens is the smallest city in area in Los Angeles County.

==History==
After a nineteenth-century property bubble crashed, Los Angeles began growing again, and by the turn of the century had reached 100,000 inhabitants. But the area that would become Hawaiian Gardens (then known as &quot;The Delta&quot;) remained largely a rural area with dairy and truck farms and some oil development. In 1927, a fruit stand with palms was opened on the corner of two dirt roads of Carson Street and Norwalk Boulevard called Hawaiian Gardens. Thus, the name was born. During the Great Depression, the area became a refuge for people to buy or build a home due to low land costs, despite poor roads, frequent flooding, and limited access to electricity.

In the late 1920s, only Norwalk Blvd was a paved road. For the next 35 years, except for Pioneer Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard, and Carson Street, the little town would be all dirt roads. When the city was incorporated in 1964, the paving of roads began immediately. By 1966, all streets south of Carson between Pioneer and Norwalk were paved. By 1968, all streets were paved, and the three major thoroughfares of Norwalk, Pioneer, and Carson were widened to current traffic standards.

==Government and infrastructure==

===City government===
The City of Hawaiian Gardens is a general law city and governs itself as a council-manager form of government. The city council is elected at-large. The city council appoints the city manager. The council establishes policies and ordinances and the city manager, assisted by the department heads, implements them. It is a contract city, meaning its main municipal services (fire, police, library) are contracted to other regional agencies. Prior to the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, this, along with the city&#x27;s gambling revenue, allowed it to keep property taxes very low. Incorporation in 1964 was primarily intended to prevent annexation to Long Beach, a full-service city with higher property taxes. As a small municipal enclave centered around gambling near many transit arteries, it has been called the &quot;Money Laundering Capital&quot; of Southern California.

The city council members must be Hawaiian Gardens residents and registered voters. As specified by the Constitution of California, city elections are non-partisan. One council member is also selected as a member of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments.

<doc id="107636" wikidata="Q828712" url="?curid=107636" title="Hermosa Beach, California">
<text>Hermosa Beach (, Spanish for &quot;Beautiful&quot;) is a beachfront city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Its population was 19,728 at the 2020 U.S. Census. The city is located in the South Bay region of the Greater Los Angeles area; it is one of the three Beach Cities. Hermosa Beach is bordered by the other two, Manhattan Beach to the north and Redondo Beach to the south and east.

The city&#x27;s beach is popular for sunbathing, beach volleyball, surfing, paddleboarding, bars, cycling and running. The city itself extends only about 15 blocks from east to west and 40 blocks from north to south, with Pacific Coast Highway running down the middle. Situated on the Pacific Ocean, Hermosa&#x27;s average temperature is in the summer and in the winter. Westerly sea breezes lessen what can be high summertime temperatures in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the county and help keep the smog away 360 days of the year.

A paved path, called The Strand, runs along Hermosa&#x27;s beach from Torrance Beach in the south approximately twenty miles north to Santa Monica. The Hermosa Beach Pier is at the end of Pier Avenue, which is one of the beach community&#x27;s main shopping, dining and entertainment areas.

== History ==
Hermosa Beach was originally part of the 1784 Rancho San Pedro Spanish land grant that later became the ten-mile (16 km) ocean frontage of Rancho Sausal Redondo. In 1900, a tract of was purchased for $35 per acre from A. E. Pomroy, then owner of the greater part of Rancho Sausal Redondo. Messrs. Burbank and Baker, agents, bought this land for Sherman and Clark who organized and retained the controlling interest in the Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company.

In early days, Hermosa Beach — like so many of its neighboring cities (Inglewood, Lawndale, Torrance) — was one vast sweep of rolling hills covered with fields of grain, mostly barley. During certain seasons of the year large herds of sheep were grazed over this land, and corrals and large barns for storing the grain, as well as providing shelter for horses and farm implements, were located on the ranch between Hermosa and Inglewood. The Spanish words &quot;Rancho Sausal Redondo&quot; mean a large circular ranch of pasture of grazing land, with a grove of willow on it.

The first official survey was made in the year 1901 for the board walk on the Strand, Hermosa Avenue and Santa Fe Avenue; work on these projects commenced soon after. In 1904 the first pier was built. It was constructed entirely of wood even to the pilings and it extended five hundred feet out into the ocean. The pier was constructed by the Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company. In 1913 this old pier was partly washed away and later torn down and a new one built to replace it. This pier was built of concrete long, and paved with asphalt its entire length. Small tiled pavilions were erected at intervals along the sides to afford shade for fishermen and picnic parties. A bait stand was built eventually out on the end. Soon after, about 1914, an auditorium building was constructed; it has housed various enterprises and at present the public rest rooms, the Los Angeles Life Guard Service, and the local branch of the Los Angeles County Public Library occupy rooms in the building.

The Los Angeles Pacific Railway, a trolley system, was the first trolley service in Hermosa Beach, running the entire length of Hermosa Ave. on its way from L.A. to Redondo Beach. A few years later it was merged with most other trolley companies in the region to form the new Pacific Electric Railway Company, informally called the Red Cars.

The Santa Fe Railway was the first railroad to run through Hermosa Beach. It was seven blocks from the beach. The street that led to the tracks was called Santa Fe Avenue, but was later renamed Pier Avenue. There was no Santa Fe railway station for Hermosa, but Burbank and Baker built a railway platform on the west side of the tracks near Santa Fe Avenue, and later the railroad company donated an old boxcar to be used as a storage place for freight. In 1926, the Santa Fe built a modern stucco depot and installed Western Union telegraph service in it.

The first city election for city officers was held December 24, 1906. On January 14, 1907, Hermosa Beach became the nineteenth incorporated city of Los Angeles County.

Locals have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the &quot;May Gray&quot; and the &quot;June Gloom&quot;. Overcast skies are common for June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon. Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area will enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures.

== Parks and recreation ==
The wide flat beach makes Hermosa Beach one of the most popular places to play beach volleyball, from professional to amateur. Hermosa Beach is home to the AVP Hermosa Beach Open tournament, and several amateur CBVA tournaments during the year. The Strand stretches north to Santa Monica and south to Redondo Beach, and is a popular place for walkers, joggers and biking. Of the three Beach Cities, only Hermosa Beach owns its own beach. The other two cities&#x27; beaches are owned by the county of Los Angeles.

Running parallel to The Strand is a lovely linear trail known today as the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt. Once part of a railroad easement, this narrow strip had long been the subject of heated controversy and pressure from various commercial interests. After years of litigation and wrangling, the city was poised to permit intensive retail and condominium development in the mid-1980s when a grassroots group spearheaded by activist Rosamond Fogg forced the matter to a vote. The City Council at the time was divided over whether the matter was of much importance but after an energetic and passionate campaign, the citizens found that the greenbelt was a vital recreational resource and mandated its preservation for the use and enjoyment of residents and visitors. This ballot initiative passed by almost 87%, the highest in California history. On the same Ballot, the public approved a referendum added a utility user&#x27;s tax by 2% to help pay for the purchase, to be sunset after the property was acquired. As a result, the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt has the quality of a rural country lane, home to the monarch butterfly and many bird and animal species. At any time of day or night joggers and walkers enjoy its soft woodchip trails and graceful landscaping. The Greenbelt is also now part of the federal rails to trails network. The AIA R/UDAT (Regional/Urban Design Assistance Team) found that Hermosa Beach, thanks in large part to the existence of the Greenbelt, was a &quot;world class pedestrian city&quot;.

<text>Huntington Park is a city located in the South Central region of Los Angeles County, California, United States. The area includes the separate communities of Florence, Firestone Park, Graham, and Walnut Park, California. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 54,883, of whom 97% are Hispanic/Latino and about half were born outside the U.S.

Huntington Park and its Pacific Boulevard area is a mostly Hispanic, working-class inner Southeast L.A. area.

== History ==
The first European to arrive to the area was Francisco Salvatore Lugo.

Named for prominent industrialist Henry E. Huntington, Huntington Park was incorporated in 1906 as a streetcar suburb on the Los Angeles Railway for workers in the rapidly expanding industries to the southeast of downtown Los Angeles. To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby Vernon and Commerce. The stretch of Pacific Boulevard in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city&#x27;s largely working-class residents as well as being the retail hub of Southeast Los Angeles County. As with most of the other cities along the corridor stretching along the Los Angeles River to the south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Huntington Park was an almost exclusively white community during most of its history; Alameda Street and Slauson Avenue, which were fiercely defended segregation lines in the 1950s, separated it from black areas.

The changes that shaped Los Angeles from the late 1970s onward—the decline of American manufacturing that began in the 1970s; the rapid growth of newer suburbs in Orange County, the eastern San Gabriel, western San Fernando and Conejo valleys; the collapse of the aerospace and defense industry at the end of the Cold War; and the implosion of the Southern California real estate boom in the early 1990s—resulted in the wholesale departure of virtually all of the white population of Huntington Park by the mid-1990s. The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of Latinos: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of East Los Angeles, and recent Mexican immigrants. Today, Pacific Boulevard is once again a thriving commercial strip, serving as a major retail center for working-class residents of southeastern Los Angeles County—only now targeting a Hispanic public with many signs in Spanish.

<text>The City of Industry is a city in the San Gabriel Valley, in eastern Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city is almost entirely industrial, containing over 3,000 businesses employing 67,000 people, with only 264 residents as of the 2020 census, making it the third least populous city in the state. It was incorporated on June 18, 1957, and has become the economic hub for the San Gabriel Valley.

==History==

In 1841, William and Nicolasa Workman, who emigrated from Mexico with John Rowland and others, received a land grant for Rancho La Puente from the governor of Alta California, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The ranch eventually grew to almost 49,000 acres. The Workmans quickly established themselves as cattle ranchers and did well financially during the Gold Rush, supplying fresh beef to the gold fields. Following the discovery of oil by their son on land they owned in the Montebello hills, the Workmans&#x27; grandson, Walter P. Temple, and his wife, Laura, bought the Workman House and surrounding land in 1917. This property is now known as the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum and is a museum and heritage site in present-day City of Industry that is free and open to the public. In the 1910s, Tract 1343 was created and shows a large portion of 2017&#x27;s City boundaries.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, both the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad were built through the San Jose Creek valley in what is now Industry. The Union Pacific would establish a major railyard at the Marne siding in what is now Industry. Valley Boulevard, a major artery connecting Los Angeles with points east, was also laid through what would become the City of Industry. The presence of the railroads and Valley Boulevard would lead to the development of warehouses that became a large part of Industry&#x27;s economy. 

The City of Industry was incorporated as a charter city on June 18, 1957. A little under fifteen years from its incorporation, the City of Industry created a general plan to guide its future development. The 1971 document remains in effect as of 2020, nearly a half century later. The plan was overseen by planning consultants Gruen Associates, a firm established in 1950 by Austrian-born Victor Gruen, a visionary architect and urban planner.

The City&#x27;s first mayor, John Ferrero (1912–1996), was elected to the City Council at Industry&#x27;s incorporation, and served in such capacity for 39 years, becoming the longest serving mayor in California.

The City of Industry was named for the goals and objectives section of the general plan which identified the primary goal of the city as &quot;creating and maintaining an ideal setting for manufacturing, distribution and industrial facilities.&quot;

In 1962, the City of Industry Chamber of Commerce formed and in 1974, the Workman House became a historical landmark. 
In 1979/1980 a former landfill near Azusa Avenue was converted into the Industry Hills Golf Club, including a hotel and the Eisenhower golf course. 
In 1981, the Industry Hills Expo Center opened as a community multi-purpose event facility.

In 1985, the inaugural Charity Pro Rodeo took place, to raise funds for youth in the San Gabriel Valley. The Rodeo still takes place annually. In 1991, in partnership with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the Youth Activities League was formed to offer sports to at-risk children as an alternative to gang activity.

In recognition of the importance of mass transit, the city invested heavily in the development of a Metrolink transit station near the confluence of the 60 and 57 freeways and in 1993, the City of Industry Metrolink Station opened. In 2004, the Environmental Impact Report and Design for the 57/60 Confluence Project was completed. The three-phased program of improvements consists of ramp and interchange reconfigurations as well as the addition of bypass lanes to reduce weaving, resulting in less congestion for the sixth-worst congested and dangerous freeway interchange in the nation.

<text>Inglewood is a city in southwestern Los Angeles County, California, United States, in the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the city had a population of 107,762. It is in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, near Los Angeles International Airport. The Inglewood area was developed following the opening of the Venice–Inglewood railway in 1887 and incorporated as a city on February 14, 1908. The Inglewood Oil Field is the largest urban oil field in the US.

The city is a major hub for professional sports with several teams that have played in Inglewood&#x27;s venues. The Kia Forum, an indoor arena, opened in 1967 and hosted the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League, and the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, until the opening of Staples Center in 1999. Two National Football League teams—the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers—have played at SoFi Stadium since it opened in 2020; the stadium will also host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2028 Summer Olympics. The Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association began play at Intuit Dome in 2024.

==History==

The earliest residents of what is now Inglewood were Native Americans who used the Aguaje de Centinela natural springs in today&#x27;s Edward Vincent Sr. Park (known for most of its history as Centinela Park). Local historian Gladys Waddingham wrote that these springs took the name Centinela from the hills that rose gradually around them, and which allowed ranchers to watch over their herds,&quot; (thus the name &quot;centinelas &quot;or sentinels).

===Spanish era===

Among the original settlers of Los Angeles in 1781 was the Spanish soldier Jose Manuel Orchado Machado, &quot;a 23-year-old muleteer from Los Alamos in Sinaloa&quot;. These settlers were ordered by the officials of the San Gabriel Mission &quot;to graze their animals on the ocean side of Los Angeles in order not to infringe on mission lands.&quot; As a result, the settlers, or &quot;pobladores&quot;, drove some of their cattle to the &quot;lush pasture lands near Centinela Springs&quot;, and the first construction there was done by Bruno Ygnacio Ávila, who received a permit in 1822 to build a &quot;corral and hut for his herders.&quot; The area that is now Inglewood was divided into two &quot;rancho&quot; grants: Rancho Sausal Redondo and Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela.

===Mexican era===

Later, Avila constructed a three-room adobe house on a slight rise overlooking the creek that ran from Centinela Springs all the way to the ocean. According to the LAOkay web site, this adobe was built where the present baseball field is in the park. It no longer exists.

In 1834, Ygnacio Machado, one of the sons of Jose Machado, built the Centinela Adobe, which sits on a rise above the present Interstate 405 (San Diego Freeway) and is used as the headquarters of the Centinela Valley Historical Society. Two years later, Ygnacio was granted the Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela, though this land had already been claimed by Avila.

===American era===

 Daniel Freeman acquired the rancho and was a founder of the Centinela-Inglewood Land Company in 1887, which developed the city. That year it was reported that:

The Centinela-Inglewood Company has put on a four-horse coach between their office and Inglewood, leaving at 9:30 am and returning at 2 pm to carry passengers desiring to see the property. It is understood that arrangements will soon be completed for frequent fast trains between Los Angeles and Inglewood over the California Southern.
Inglewood Park Cemetery, a widely used cemetery for the entire region, was founded in 1905. The city has been home to the Hollywood Park Racetrack from 1938 to 2013, one of the premier horse racing venues in the United States. Fosters Freeze, the first soft serve ice cream chain in California, was founded by George Foster in 1946 in Inglewood. Inglewood was named an All-America City by the National Civic League in 1989 and yet again in 2009 for its visible progress.

The Ku Klux Klan had a presence in Inglewood in the 1920s, with the most notable event being the 1922 raid, the Klan had a chapter in Inglewood as late as October 1931.

====Labor unions====

Labor troubles became a serious issue during the early years of World War II as local industries supplied the Allies, against the wishes of Communist local union officials. In 1941, the United Auto Workers (UAW) won the election over the International Association of Machinists and represented all the employees at the North American Aviation factory in Inglewood. UAW negotiators demanded a starting pay of 75 cents an hour, plus a 10-cent raise for the 11,000 current employees. The UAW had made a no-strike pledge, but suddenly a wildcat strike on June 4 closed the plant that produced a fourth of the nation&#x27;s fighter planes. The UAW was unable to get the workers to return, when Washington intervened. With the approval of national CIO leadership, President Franklin Roosevelt sent in the California national guard to reopen the plant. When Germany suddenly invaded the USSR in late June 1941, though, the Communist activists suddenly became the strongest supporters of war production; they crushed wildcat strikes.

====African-American influence====
&quot;No blacks had ever lived in Inglewood&quot;, Gladys Waddingham wrote, but by 1960, &quot;they lived in great numbers along its eastern borders. This came to the great displeasure of the predominantly white residents already residing in Inglewood. In 1960, the census counted only 29 &quot;Negroes&quot; among Inglewood&#x27;s 63,390 residents. Not a single black child attended the city&#x27;s schools. Real-estate agents refused to show homes to blacks. A rumored curfew kept blacks off the streets at night. Inglewood was a prime target because of its previous history of restrictions.&quot; &quot;Fair housing and school busing were the main problems of 1964. The schools were not prepared to handle racial incidents, even though any that occurred were very minor. Adults held many heated community meetings, since the blacks objected to busing as much as did the whites.&quot; In 1969, an organization called &quot;Morningside Neighbors&quot; changed its name to &quot;Inglewood Neighbors&quot; &quot;in the hope of promoting more integration.&quot;

On July 22, 1970, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Max F. Deutz ordered Inglewood schools to desegregate in response to a suit filed by 19 parents. At least since 1965, said Deutz, the Inglewood school board had been aware of a growing influx of black families into its eastern areas, but had done nothing about the polarization of its pupils into an eastern black area and a western white one. On August 31, he rejected an appeal by four parents who said the school board was not responsible for the segregation, but that the blacks &quot;selected their places of residence by voluntary choice.&quot;

The first black principal among the 18 Inglewood schools was Peter Butler at La Tijera Elementary, and in 1971, the &quot;Stormy racial meetings in 1971&quot; included a charge by &quot;some real estate men in the overflowing Crozier Auditorium&quot; that the Human Relations Commission was acting like &quot;the Gestapo&quot;. In that year, Loyd Sterling Webb, president of Inglewood Neighbors, became the first black officeholder when voters elected him to the school board.

In 1972, Curtis Tucker Sr., was appointed as the first black city council member. That year, composer LeRoy Hurte, an African-American, took the baton of the Inglewood Symphony Orchestra and continued to work with it for 20 years. Edward Vincent Jr. became Inglewood&#x27;s first black mayor in 1983. In that decade, whites left the city in increasing numbers, and Inglewood became the first city in California to declare the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. a holiday. Since the term of Edward Vincent Jr. (1983–1997), Inglewood has consecutively elected African-American mayors: Roosevelt F. Dorn (1997–2010), Danny Tabor (2010–2011), and James T. Butts Jr. (2011–present).

====Rise of Latino population====
The 1990 census showed that Latinos in Inglewood had increased by 134% since 1980, the largest jump in the South Bay. Economic factors apparently played a role in where new arrivals settled, said David Heer, a USC professor of sociology and associate director of the university&#x27;s Population Research Laboratory. &quot;Housing is generally less expensive here than elsewhere . . . and I would say that they receive a warmer welcome here&quot;, said Norm Cravens, assistant city manager in Inglewood, where the white population dropped from nearly 21% in 1980 to 8.5% in 1990.

In the 2000 census, blacks made up 47% of the city&#x27;s residents (53,060 people), and Latinos comprised 46% (51,829), but the Census Bureau estimated that in 2007, the percentage of blacks had declined to 41% (48,252) and that Latinos were at 52.5% (61,847). The white population declined from 19 (21,505) to 17.7% (20,853).

That year, though, only one of the city&#x27;s five city council members was Latino: Jose Fernandez. No Latinos were on the five-member board of education.

===Religious history===
In 2007, the area served by the Inglewood post office (including Lennox) had 98 churches, temples, mosques, chapels and other houses of worship, according to the AreaConnect.com website.

The first church service was held on April 22, 1888, in the Inglewood House hotel on Commercial Street (today&#x27;s La Brea Avenue), popularly called Mrs. Belden&#x27;s Boarding House, when Inglewood had only 300 residents and 112 registered voters. Later, services were in Bucephalus Hall, but eventually the congregation moved to Hyde Park, which left Inglewood with no church. On January 19, 1890, Inglewood&#x27;s first permanent church – Presbyterian – was established on Market Street. A bit later, the [United] Brethren constructed a building on South Market Street.

In 1907, a group of Episcopalians began services in a private home, and a few years later, the first Catholic services were held in Bank Hall. In 1910, the Presbyterians moved their two buildings, a sanctuary and a manse, to the corner of Grevillea and Nutwood &quot;because the streetcars [on Market Street] were so noisy and threw so much dust and sand fleas in the windows.&quot;

===Trash-hauling pact===
In 2018, an investigation began into a 2012 trash-hauling contract valued at $100 million; it went to a bidder with connections to current mayor James T. Butts. The bidder, Consolidated Disposal Services, secured the contract soon after hiring Michael Butts, brother of Mayor Butts, as an operations manager. Consolidated continues to provide garbage collection services as of 2023.

==Arts and culture==
===Landmarks===
The Forum was built in 1967 and designed by architect Charles Luckman, who also designed Madison Square Garden. The Forum was intended to evoke the Roman Forum in Rome. For decades, the Forum was one of LA&#x27;s biggest concert venues; Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin and the Jackson 5 were among the superstars to headline the arena. The Forum also achieved its greatest fame as the home of the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings. In 1999, both teams moved to the Staples Center and the Forum was sold to the Faithful Central Bible Church, which used it for Sunday services and rented it out for concerts or sporting events. In 2012, the Forum was purchased by The Madison Square Garden Company, owners of New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, for $23.5 million; MSG announced plans to spend $50 million to refurbish and renovate the arena for use as a &quot;world-class&quot; concert venue. The &quot;Fabulous&quot; Forum presented by Chase reopened on January 15, 2014, with the first of six historic performances by the Eagles. The reinvention of the Forum has created the largest indoor performance venue in the country designed with a focus on music and entertainment. On April 4, 2022, &quot;The Forum&quot; was renamed &quot;Kia Forum&quot; due to a naming rights deal between Steve Ballmer, the owner of The Forum, and car manufacturer Kia.

On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved plans for the construction of an NFL-capacity stadium, later named SoFi Stadium, with a 5–0 unanimous vote to combine the plot of land with the larger Hollywood Park development and rezone the area to include Sports/Entertainment capabilities. of Hollywood Park were devoted to Lake Park, a naturally-replenishing water feature which is claimed to recycle 26 million gallons of water annually. This cleared the way for developers to begin construction on the venue as planned in December 2015.

===Schools history===
In 1888, a school district was organized, trustees were elected and a building was chosen. The school opened on May 21 that year on the second floor of a livery stable on Grevillea Avenue between Regent Street and Orchard (today&#x27;s Florence Avenue), with 17 boys and 16 girls. The first teacher was Minnie Walker, a graduate of Los Angeles State Normal School. The schoolroom, named Bucephalus Hall, after a horse belonging to town founder Daniel Freeman, was also used for community meetings.

Meanwhile, a permanent school building was erected on Grevillea Avenue a block to the south, between Regent and Queen. It remained Inglewood&#x27;s only school until 1911. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1920.

The Centinela Valley Union High School District was organized in 1904 to bring secondary education to the town. Inglewood High opened in two rooms of the school building with 15 students taught by Nina Martin, principal, and Anna McClelland. Four years later, a new building rose on of land, and the first graduation of one boy and four girls took place in 1908.
Until 1912 there was a new principal every year at the grammar school, but on May 8 of that year George W. Crozier was named principal, and he held the post for 20 years. The school was renamed in his honor in 1932. In 1913, George M. Green was appointed principal of Inglewood Union High School; he retired from that position in 1939.

In 1914, voters approved bonds for high school improvement. Four more buildings and a power plant were erected, &quot;joined by walks and arcades.&quot; The improvement included a &quot;five-room model flat in the Home Economics Building.&quot; Nine acres of land were bought at Kelso Avenue and Damask (now Inglewood Avenue) for an experimental agricultural statement, thenceforth known as &quot;The Farm.&quot; There were gardens, an orchard and an alfalfa field. In 1915 Inglewood High won a first-place Los Angeles County prize for its beautiful ivy-covered brick buildings. These buildings were destroyed in 1953 to make room for new ones.

In the mid-1920s, the high school district stretched all the way south to El Segundo, so two women teachers were asked to live in El Segundo and ride the school buses with the students every day to and from that city – for an extra dollar a day in pay. In 1923 girls adopted a school uniform, &quot;a dark blue skirt with a white middy.&quot;

In 1925 a new fine arts building for the high school was erected on the southwest corner of Grevillea and Manchester, replacing the Truax Candy Kitchen, but it was severely damaged by the Long Beach earthquake of 1933. It was &quot;later rebuilt with WPA help but lost its magnificent stairway and all its fireplaces.&quot; Temporary classrooms were built on Olive Street, &quot;all too cold in winter and too hot most of the time.&quot;

The athletic field on the west side of the campus, later called Badenoch Field, was used for physical education and sporting events. In 1937, agricultural classes were ended at the Farm and Sentinel Field was dedicated there for sports activities. By 1938 there were more than 3,000 students and 141 teachers at the high school.

The &quot;startling news&quot; of 1948 was the dismissal &quot;of the entire administrative staff at Inglewood High School, beginning with Principal James R. Haines.&quot; He was replaced by Forrest Murdoch of Everett, Washington, as superintendent and Fred Heisner as principal.

In 1952, another secondary school campus in Inglewood was opened in the east side neighborhood of Lockhaven as Morningside High School. Center Park School of Los Angeles became part of the Inglewood School District in 1961 when its area (Crenshaw-Imperial) was annexed to the city. In the 1970s, its name was changed to Worthington School to honor Frances and William Worthington.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Streets and highways====
A &quot;grand avenue at least 150 feet wide&quot; was being built in late 1887 from the end of Figueroa Street in Los Angeles &quot;to the new town of Inglewood on the Centinela ranch&quot;, to be &quot;planted with a border of tropical trees, making it one of the handsomest five-mile drives&quot; on the coast.&quot;

Major streets that run through Inglewood are La Cienega Boulevard, Crenshaw Boulevard, Hawthorne Boulevard (California), La Brea Avenue, Century Boulevard, Imperial Highway, Manchester Avenue, (Manchester Boulevard in Inglewood), Florence Avenue, and Prairie Avenue.

There are 2 freeways that serve the city, Interstate 405 and Interstate 105 (California). Interstate 110 is located nearby South Los Angeles.

====Public transportation====
The city is served by the K Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. There are 3 stations located in the city, Fairview Heights, Downtown Inglewood, and Westchester/Veterans station. The south side of the city is served by the nearby C Line, which the Crenshaw and Hawthorne/Lennox stations are located nearby. The city is planning the Inglewood Transit Connector, an automated people mover that will connect the city&#x27;s sports and entertainment venues to the forthcoming downtown rail station.

A $3,000 train station, described as a &quot;natty and attractive building&quot;, was constructed in 1887 at the temporary end of the Ballona railroad line outward bound from Los Angeles. The tracks were to continue west through the Centinela ranch to the ocean.

The was opened for business on September 7, 1887, with stops (from northeast to southwest) at Ballona Junction, Nadeau Park, Baldwin, Slauson, Wildeson, Hyde Park, Inglewood, Danville, Mesmer, and Port Ballona. A train left Los Angeles at 9:15 a.m. on the one-hour journey and returned from Port Ballona at 4 p.m.

In that year the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; noted that Inglewood was &quot;at the junction of two railroads, one branch going to Ballona Harbor and the other to the beautiful seaside resort, Redondo Beach. . . . Two trains a day now pass Inglewood station.&quot;

The Centinela-Inglewood Company used a four-horse coach to bring prospective buyers from Los Angeles, leaving at 9:30 a.m. and returning at 2 p.m. Being planned were &quot;frequent fast trains between Los Angeles and Inglewood over the California Southern Railroad.

===Fire===
Fire protection is provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department stations 18, 170, 171, 172, and 173.

===Health===
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Curtis Tucker Health Center in Inglewood. The city was served by the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital for more than five decades, from 1954 until its closure in 2007. Inglewood is still served and the home to Centinela Hospital Medical Center.

<text>Irwindale is a city in the San Gabriel Valley, in Los Angeles County, California. The population was 1,472 at the 2020 census, 1,422 at the 2010 census. The ZIP Codes serving the area are 91010, which is shared with Duarte, 91702, which is shared with Azusa, and 91706, which is shared with Baldwin Park.

The city became the new permanent site for the annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California in 2005, after it moved from its previous home at the Glen Helen Regional Park in Devore. The majority of the housing is found on the southeastern portion of the city, near Arrow Highway and north of Cypress Street near Irwindale Avenue. There is also a tract of housing on the southeastern corner of Meridian St in the northwestern portion of the city, being distant from the rest of the housing.

==History==
Irwindale was part of the Mexican land grants by Alta California Governor Juan Alvarado of Rancho La Puente, Rancho Azusa de Dalton, Rancho Azusa de Duarte, and Rancho San Francisquito. The families of Gregorio Fraijo and Facundo Ayon settled here in the 1850s. Significant economic growth did not arrive until the advent of the automobile, which drove up demand for the area&#x27;s rocks and sand for the paving of roads. The city was incorporated on August 6, 1957.

Irwindale took advantage of urban redevelopment laws starting in 1976, and prospered in the following decade; it attracted a Miller Brewing Company plant, the corporate headquarters of Home Savings of America, and other companies.

In the summer of 1987, city councilman Joe Breceda approached Al Davis, owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Los Angeles Raiders, about building a new stadium on the site of one of the disused pits. Davis agreed to a $115 million deal. He would take ownership of the new stadium provided the Raiders would play there for 19 years. The deal included a $10 million nonrefundable signing bonus paid directly to Davis regardless of whether the plan would be executed. In the event, both parties were served multiple lawsuits, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers demanded strict environmental impact assessments, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors demurred, and the project was canceled. Davis pocketed the $10 million, and eventually moved the Raiders back to Oakland.

Protesting groups included the California League of Conservation Voters, California Latino Environmental Advocacy Network, Communities for a Better Environment, and East Yard Communities.

In an interview, CleanTech owner Bob Brown affirms that the facility will not pose an environmental concern. The building of the facility was planned to prevent storm runoff, and all waste management occurs inside the facility, not outside. He also cites the fact that recycling oil reduces California&#x27;s carbon footprint and allows the waste to be turned into other products.

In December 1933 and January 1934, the La Cañada Valley was severely flooded in the Crescenta Valley flood (1933 and 1934).

=== Flintridge ===
Flintridge was named after its developer, United States senator Frank P. Flint.

Flintridge comprises the southern part of the city, covering the northern flank of the San Rafael Hills, but more generally including most areas south of Foothill Blvd. The eastern part, even north of Foothill Blvd, was also originally considered Flintridge and is still home to the Flintridge Riding Club and Flintridge Preparatory School.

=== Incorporation ===
On November 30, 1976, the cities of Flintridge and La Cañada were merged into a single incorporated city named &quot;La Cañada Flintridge&quot;.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, La Cañada Flintridge ranked as the 98th most expensive zip code in America in 2023.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the Crescenta Valley and far western end of the San Gabriel Valley, between the San Gabriel Mountains and Angeles National Forest to the north, and the San Rafael Hills to the south. Most of the city drains southeastward toward the Arroyo Seco area in Pasadena, but the western part of the city (generally west of Alta Canyada Road) drains southward toward Glendale via Verdugo Canyon. Both drainages join the Los Angeles River north of downtown Los Angeles.

La Cañada Flintridge varies in elevation from about just below Devil&#x27;s Gate Dam in the Arroyo Seco to about at the highest neighborhood, along the mountain front east of Pickens Canyon, at the upper end of Ocean View Blvd. The city limits extend into the San Gabriel Mountains and reach along Mount Lukens Road, which follows the crest line well above the developed city.

In August 2009, the city came under threat by the Station Fire. The city is considered a &quot;very high fire hazard severity zone&quot; because of the local topography at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains and abundance of California Live Oak, despite an aggressive fire safety program.&#x27; In January 2025, virtually the entire city was evacuated in response to the Eaton Fire, which destroyed many homes in the neighboring community of Altadena.

===Climate===

The climate of La Cañada Flintridge is typical of a Southern California inland valley, with mild winters and hot summers. Spring often has hazy days, in contrast to the more persistently clear weather of fall. On average, the warmest month is August with high temperatures in the low to mid 90s and lows in the low 70s. December and January are the coolest months with typical highs in the low to mid 60s and lows in the low 40s. Rainfall occurs mostly during winter, averaging about 21 inches annually. Rainfall is rare in summer. The moderating influence of the ocean (22 miles, 35 km, away) is limited due to the city&#x27;s location inland from the intervening Santa Monica Mountains, the Verdugo Mountains, and the San Rafael Hills. Consequently, summers are generally hotter and winters often cooler than in coastal parts of metropolitan Los Angeles, if winds are calm or blowing gently offshore. Occasional strong offshore winds, known as the Santa Ana winds, can bring particularly hot air in summer and fall as air from the desert plateaus crosses the mountains and descends, thus warming further by adiabatic heating. Summer and early fall temperatures are substantially cooler if the prevailing wind is persistently onshore. Occasionally during a winter storm, the upper elevations of the city may see trace amounts of snow. Several ski resorts, Mountain High, Mount Baldy, and Mount Waterman, are located about to the northeast.

===Municipal government===
La Cañada Flintridge is governed by its city council, which has five members, each elected to overlapping four-year terms. Each year, the council selects one of its members to serve as mayor and another to serve as mayor pro-tem for terms of one year. The elections were held on March of odd-numbered years until 2017. Beginning in 2020, the elections are held during the California Primary elections. The council is aided by five commissions and two committees, each with its own area of responsibility. In addition, the council appoints the city manager, city attorney, city treasurer, and all members of its advisory bodies. It also serves as the governing board for the public improvement corporation, the redevelopment agency, the LCF Local Financing Authority, and Sanitation Districts No. 28 and No. 34.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

====Public schools====
The La Cañada Unified School District (LCUSD) serves most of the city, and is ranked as one of the top school districts in the state. On September 13, 2010, the California Department of Education announced that 2010 California Standards Tests (CSTs) results indicate that the La Cañada Unified School District earned the second highest Academic Performance Index (API) score in the state. The API reflects a district&#x27;s performance level, based on the results of statewide testing. The district has three public elementary schools that serve grades K-6: La Cañada Elementary, Palm Crest Elementary, and Paradise Canyon Elementary School. The public high school, La Cañada High School, which also serves as a middle school (grades 7–8), is a 1993 and 2004 Blue Ribbon School.

A small western portion of the city is served by the Glendale Unified School District, with La Cañada Flintridge students attending Mountain Avenue Elementary School, Rosemont Middle School, Anderson W. Clark Magnet High School and Crescenta Valley High School.

====Private schools====
Several private schools that are not part of the LCUSD are located within La Cañada. The private high schools within the city limits are St. Francis High School, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy, and Flintridge Preparatory School.

The private elementary schools within the city limits are Crestview Preparatory (K-6), The Learning Castle (K-3), La Cañada Preparatory (grades 4–8), and St. Bede (K-8).

Delphi Academy of Los Angeles, a Delphi Academy school, opened in La Cañada Flintridge in 1984. The school left the city when its current campus in Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles opened in 2003.

==Media==
The city was originally serviced by two newspapers: the &quot;La Cañada Valley Sun&quot;, a community division of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;La Cañada Outlook&quot;. However, in April 2020, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; announced it would be shutting down some of its local papers, including the &quot;La Cañada Valley Sun&quot; due to continuing financial issues that were worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after, Outlook Newspapers Group announced they were buying the &quot;Valley Sun&quot; and were rebranding their newspaper as the &quot;La Cañada Outlook Valley Sun&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
===Water and utilities===
The city is served by the Foothill Municipal Water District, formed in 1952 as a union of La Cañada Irrigation District and the water districts of neighboring communities. Previously, most of the area&#x27;s water came from local springs, but as the population grew, the Foothill MWD arranged to purchase Colorado River and California State Water Project water sourced from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, with local sources still providing around 20% of the area&#x27;s needs.

Sewage is handled by LA County Sanitation District. Sewage is transported to several regional plants, including La Cañada Water Reclamation Plant, a small plant adjacent to La Cañada Country Club. After decades using septic systems for sewage treatment, proposals to install a formal centralized sewage system were put forward in the early 1990s. Installation proceeded in multiple phases over the following decades, with a major expansion to over 1000 residential units beginning in 2004. By 2018, a small remnant minority of property holders with septic systems were being negotiated with to connect to the sewage system.
===Emergency services===
The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) provides law enforcement services to La Cañada Flintridge under contract and operates the Crescenta Valley Station in La Crescenta.

The Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) operates fire stations 19 and 82 in the city. Also an additional one at JPL NASA. Fire stations 11 and 12 in Altadena, and station 63 in La Crescenta-Montrose also serve the city regularly. Emergency transportation is done by Care Ambulance Service. Annual landscaping inspections and &quot;stringent fire-safe building codes&quot; were put in place to mitigate the risk of wildfires, like the 2009 Station Fire.

==Transportation==
===Foothill Boulevard===
Foothill Boulevard is the main artery of La Cañada Flintridge, running through the center of the city. The strip of land north and south of Foothill represents the major commercial zone of the city. The road precedes the founding of the city itself, and was originally called Michigan Avenue.

===210 Freeway===
The 210 Freeway opened in 1972, after over ten years of intense local opposition. The building of the freeway required the acquisition and demolition of over 400 homes, and the relocation of La Canada Elementary, the post office, and some businesses. 

There are three exits from the 210 Freeway into La Cañada Flintridge, making it a major entry point into the city along with the older 2 Freeway. A soundwall constructed and expanded over decades helps to reduce noise pollution, but the Freeway remains a source of particulate, ozone and other types of air pollution, as is experienced by other cities along the 210 corridor. The local experience with the 210 Freeway led La Cañada Flintridge to also be a source of resistance to the extension of the nearby 710 Freeway, which would have connected to the 210 through Pasadena, likely bringing increased truck traffic if it were built.

===Angeles Crest Highway===
La Cañada Flintridge is the southern terminus of the Angeles Crest Highway. It begins at the intersection with Foothill Boulevard and follows a two-mile, 5% grade before entering the San Gabriel Mountains.

On September 5, 2008, a big rig carrying 78,000 pounds of onions lost its brakes on the Angeles Crest Highway. To avoid a collision with the Hill Street Café at the intersection with Foothill Boulevard, the rig turned towards a small driveway, sideswiped the Café, crashed into a wall, a garbage bin, a tree and six vehicles before coming to rest in the parking lot. James Bines, 43, of Florida, and his passenger, Willy Robinson, had been hauling a full load of onions through the high desert area in the 18-wheeler. They traveled over the Angeles Crest Highway because, Bines said, he had received directions from his global positioning system that the highway, State Route 2, was the most direct route from there to Los Angeles.

On April 1, 2009, a similar incident occurred at roughly the same location. A car carrier transporting six cars southbound on the Angeles Crest Highway lost its brakes and, despite three runaway vehicle escape medians in the center islands, caused multiple vehicle accidents that resulted in two fatalities and 12 injuries, three of them critical. Angel Jorge Posca, 58, and his 12-year-old daughter Angelina, both of Palmdale, had just exited the eastbound Foothill Freeway at the Angeles Crest Highway in their red Ford Escort and were starting to turn north on the highway to return to Palmdale when the semi-truck struck their vehicle.

A bill that bans heavy trucks with three or more axles from driving on the Angeles Crest Highway was signed into law by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on August 6, 2009.

In 2021, two crashes occurred over the same weekend at the intersection, with one damaging Hill Street Cafe and the other largely destroying a boutique, resulting in its permanent closure. On October 9, 2024, a Toyota Prius traveling southbound on Angeles Crest Highway crashed into six cars parked at the side entrance of the restaurant.

==History==
La Habra Heights is located on the 1839 Rancho La Habra Mexican land grant made to Mariano Reyes Roldan. Roldan sold the rancho to Andres Pico, who sold it to Abel Stearns. In 1900, Willits J. Hole acquired , which he sold in 1919 to Edwin G. Hart, who developed La Habra Heights.

=== Rudolph Hass &amp; the Discovery of the Hass Avocado ===

All commercial, fruit-bearing Hass avocado trees have been grown from grafted seedlings propagated from a single tree from a seed bought by Rudolph Hass in 1926 from A. R. Rideout of Whittier, California. At the time, Rideout was getting seeds from any source, even restaurant food scraps. The cultivar this seed came from is not known. In 2019, the National Academy of Sciences published a genetic study concluding that the Hass avocado is a cross between Mexican (61%) and Guatemalan (39%) avocado varieties.

In 1926, at his 1.5-acre grove at 430 West Road, La Habra Heights, California, Hass planted three seeds he had bought from Rideout, which yielded one strong seedling. After trying and failing at least twice to graft the seedling with branches from Fuerte avocado trees (the leading commercial cultivar at the time), Hass thought of cutting it down. Still, a professional grafter named Caulkins told him the young tree was sound and robust, so he let it be. When the tree began bearing odd, bumpy fruit, his children liked the taste. As the tree&#x27;s yields grew, Hass quickly sold what his family did not eat to co-workers at the post office.[1] The Hass avocado had one of its first commercial successes at the Model Grocery Store on Colorado Street in Pasadena, California, where chefs working for some of the town&#x27;s wealthy residents bought the new cultivar&#x27;s big, nutty-tasting fruit for $1 each, a very high price at the time (equivalent to $17 in 2023).

Hass patented the tree in 1935 and contracted with Whittier nurseryman Harold Brokaw to grow and sell grafted seedlings propagated from its cuttings,[1] with Brokaw getting 75% of the proceeds. Brokaw then specialized in the Hass and often sold out of grafted seedlings since, unlike the Fuerte, Hass yields are year-round and plentiful, with giant fruit, a longer shelf life, and richer flavor owing to higher oil content.

By the early 21st century, the US avocado industry took in over $1 billion a year from the heavy-bearing, high-quality Hass cultivar, which accounted for around 80% of all avocados grown worldwide.

Owing to later suburban sprawl in Southern California, the mother tree stood for many years in front of a residence in La Habra Heights. The tree died when it was 76 years old and was cut down on 11 September 2002 after a ten-year fight with phytophthora (root rot), which often kills avocado trees. Two plaques by the private residence at 426 West Road mark where it grew. The wood was stored in a tree nursery, and from this stock, a nephew of Rudolph Hass, Dick Stewart, made keepsakes, jewelry, and other gifts. 

From 2010 to 2013, in mid-May, and starting again in September 2018, the city of La Habra Heights celebrated the Hass avocado at its Annual La Habra Heights Avocado Festival.

<text>La Mirada is a city in southeast Los Angeles County, California United States, and is one of the Gateway Cities, on the border with Orange County. The population was 48,008 at the 2020 census. The La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts and the Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center are two of its major attractions. It is the home of Biola University, an evangelical Christian institution of higher education.

==History==

La Mirada (Spanish for &quot;the look&quot;) was the creation of two men, Andrew McNally, a printer and mapmaker from Chicago (see Rand McNally) and his son-in-law Edwin Neff. In 1888, McNally purchased over of Rancho Los Coyotes, south of Whittier, for $200,000. He developed into his own home called Windermere Ranch and surrounded it with olive, orange and lemon groves. McNally built a plant to process the olive oil, which was of the best quality, as well as a railroad station on Stage Road. From here his olive oil and fruit were shipped all over the U.S.

In 1896, McNally turned his property over to his daughter and his son-in-law. McNally and Neff formed the La Mirada Land Company, which published a booklet entitled &quot;The Country Gentleman in California&quot;, advertising parcels of land for sale including pictures, a map and descriptions of the scenic olive, alfalfa, lemon and grapefruit groves.

In 1946, &quot;Along Your Way&quot;, a &quot;Station by Station Description of the Santa Fe Route Through the Southwest,&quot; describes La Mirada with a population of 213, surrounded by orange, lemon, walnut and olive groves; oil wells; olive oil factory; and fruit packing houses.

The city received a lot of attention for the fact that it was going to be completely structured and planned out. Referred to as &quot;the Nation&#x27;s completely planned city&quot; during the early 1950s, the city of La Mirada received a lot of attention from the State Fair. The Fair praised the city for planning for the future while still maintaining practicality for today.

In 1953, the land was sold to subdivisions for 5.2 million dollars, one of the largest real estate transactions in California. 
In 1954, Louis M. Halper, a prominent Southland residential and commercial builder, purchased 2,100 acres of La Mirada land for $8,000,000. Halper launched construction on what was to be a $150,000,000 community with schools, shopping centers, and 10,000 homes that he completed by the end of two years. His firm had taken over the acreage from a group of corporations and Harold L. Shaw, who launched the original La Mirada development. He said at the time the entire community would be redesigned for maximum advantages of a modern planned city. Halper had developed a new pattern for community development by wholesaling land to other builders and establishing the La Mirada Civic Council to control quality. Three and four-bedroom homes were sold in the $13,000 price range. By 1960, the year the city was incorporated, La Mirada had grown from a mere 100 homes to over 8,000. The city was incorporated as &quot;Mirada Hills&quot; on March 23, 1960. On November 8, 1960, voters approved a change of name to the current La Mirada, which was officially certified on December 15, 1960.

Today, the current population is just over 50,000 with the addition of a new subdivision on the eastern portion of the town.

Each year the five members vote one of themselves to be the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem.

In the California State Legislature, La Mirada is in , and in .

In the United States House of Representatives, La Mirada is in .

The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Whittier Health Center in Whittier, serving La Mirada.

===Emergency services===
The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) operates the Norwalk Station in Norwalk, serving La Mirada. In addition the department operates the La Mirada Substation.

The Norwalk Station is also responsible for providing contracted police services to the city of Norwalk as well as unincorporated South Whittier. The department has a substation in La Mirada located adjacent to City Hall.

Crime in La Mirada is consistently lower than in neighboring communities and fell 8.9% in 2018 after spiking close to 30% over the three previous years, mirroring the experiences of most communities across the state.

Fire protection and paramedic services are provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD). The department maintains Station #49 in La Mirada adjacent to City Hall, provides coverage to the central parts of the city. Station 49 also serves as the headquarters for Battalion 21.

In May 2010, a ribbon cutting was held to celebrate the opening of a second fire station operating in the city. Station 194 moved from its temporary home at 1401 South Beach Boulevard into the new quarters at 13540 Beach Boulevard. The site was chosen as it provides first-in coverage to the city of La Habra, which funded half of the cost of the construction project.

In return for investment towards the construction of Station 194, La Habra now enjoys the benefits of having a fourth Paramedic Assessment Fire Engine serving the city at no cost to La Habra taxpayers for a 20-year period (La Habra signed a ten-year fire service agreement extension in 2015). The entire cost of the four-person crew is funded by the County Fire District in which La Mirada belongs.

The construction of the new fire station, which was a key component of this agreement, was completed in just over four years after a series of design and construction delays. Neighborhoods in eastern La Mirada that once experienced six-minute response (travel) times can now be reached in three minutes or less.

Crews from two nearby stations also include parts of La Mirada as their first-in district. Engine 35, stationed in Cerritos on Artesia Boulevard, covers most of the industrial areas of the city that are south of Interstate 5.

Station 15 located in East La Mirada on Santa Gertrudes Avenue handles the north and northeast sections of town. The four-person crew assigned to Quint 15 now staff the only truck company in the area. In addition to ladder truck duties a Quint also has the ability to pump water at a fire. Prior to the 2005 reduction of staff at the La Mirada Boulevard station, there was a truck staffed as well as the engine and paramedic squad currently staffed.

La Mirada both receives and provides assistance to neighboring fire agencies called for in agreements called automatic aid.

In the southern part of the city, resources based in Buena Park and South Santa Fe Springs respond to fires instead of County Fire resources further away and the favor is returned in designated areas outside of La Mirada.

The La Mirada-based Paramedic-Unit, Squad 49 also responds to medical emergencies in Satna Fe Springs when that city&#x27;s medics are unavailable.

An expanded agreement went into effect in 2018 with the City of Fullerton that has seen a sharp increase in the response by La Mirada fire resources to both medical and fire calls there by both Squad 49, and Engine 194 Beach and Hillsborough Station.

==Education==
Public education in a majority of La Mirada is governed by the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District, headquartered in neighboring Norwalk. La Mirada has one public secondary school, La Mirada High School.

The Creek Park and Granada Heights neighborhoods in northern La Mirada are within the boundaries of the East Whittier City School District K - 8th grade, the Whittier Union High School District, and Rio Hondo College District all with campuses in nearby Whittier.

<text>La Puente (Spanish for &quot;The Bridge&quot;) is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The city had a population of 39,816 at the 2010 census and is approximately east of downtown Los Angeles.

==History==

The original inhabitants of the area now occupied by the city of La Puente were the Tongva lived in a village called Awingna, which linguists translate as &quot;abiding place.&quot; The Awingna chief Matheo (who also held sway over several other nearby villages) was baptized at Mission San Gabriel in 1774.
In 1769, the Spanish Portolá expedition became the first Europeans to see inland portions of Alta California. On July 30, the party camped on the east side of the San Gabriel River, in today&#x27;s unincorporated area of Bassett. Father Juan Crespi wrote in his diary that, the next day, they had to build a bridge (Spanish &quot;puente&quot;) to cross the miry San Gabriel River.

With the establishment of Mission San Gabriel, the area encompassing Awingna and what is now the city of La Puente became part of Rancho La Puente, established as a mission outpost and ranch. The rancho was visited by the Jedediah Smith party in November 1826, the first Americans to travel overland to California.

Following secularization of the missions in the 1830s, former mission ranchos passed into private ownership. In 1842, John Rowland and William Workman were granted the Rancho La Puente. In 1884, the area was named &quot;Puente&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot; in Spanish; in old Spanish the noun was often feminine, as opposed to modern Spanish &quot;el puente&quot;). In Crespi&#x27;s diary, it was written as &quot;la puente&quot;, and that spelling has persisted.

The area was known for its fruit and walnut groves during the 1930s. The city was even home to the world&#x27;s largest walnut packing plant. 
A small airport called the &#x27;Skyranch&#x27; operated in La Puente from 1944 to 1951 before it was closed and developed for housing.
Today, the city is heavily urbanized, but the area still has some historical landmarks from its founding days nearby, for instance, the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum in neighboring City of Industry.

Redevelopment of the business districts in La Puente have been ongoing. However, the local government has been relatively unsuccessful in its attempts to attract big-box retailers and restaurant chains. La Puente retains many aging 1950s-era strip malls.

<text>La Verne is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The population was 31,334 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area was home to Native Americans.

The European history of the area dates back to the 1830s when Ygnacio Palomares and Ricardo Véjar received the Rancho San Jose land grant from Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado in 1837. The land included the present day cities Pomona, Claremont, San Dimas, Glendora, and La Verne. The adobe that Palomares built in 1837 is still preserved in Pomona as La Casa Primera de Rancho San Jose (The First House). Palomares soon moved a mile or so northeast and constructed the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe. He ensured that a nephew, Jose Dolores Palomares, secured a tract of land a mile west.

In the mid-1880s, entrepreneur Isaac W. Lord purchased a tract of Jose Palomares&#x27; land and convinced the Santa Fe Railroad company to run its line across towards Los Angeles. Lord had the land surveyed for building lots and in 1887 had a large land sale, naming the new town &#x27;Lordsburg&#x27; after himself. He also had a large Lordsburg Hotel constructed, but the land boom was over when it was completed. It sat empty for several years until sold to four members of the German Baptist Brethren Church, who persuaded others of that denomination that it would be an excellent site for a new institution of higher learning. Lordsburg College was founded in 1891.

In 1906 the town was incorporated as &quot;La Verne.&quot; Residents grew field crops, and then began planting citrus trees, which flourished. Lordsburg became known as the &quot;Heart of the Orange Empire.&quot; The city of La Verne flourished as a center of the citrus industry until after World War II, when the citrus industry slowly faded away. Two orange groves are on the grounds of the La Verne Heritage Foundation.

<text>Lancaster is a charter city in northern Los Angeles County, in the Antelope Valley of the western Mojave Desert in Southern California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 173,516, making Lancaster the 158th-most populous city in the United States and the 30th most populous in California. Lancaster is a twin city with its southern neighbor Palmdale; together, they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region.

Lancaster is located approximately north (via I-5 and SR 14) of downtown Los Angeles and is near the Kern County line. It is separated from the Los Angeles Basin by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and from Bakersfield and the San Joaquin Valley by the Tehachapi Mountains to the north. The population of Lancaster has grown from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 157,000 as of 2019.

==History==

Antelope Valley, the area where Lancaster is now located, was home to the Paiute tribe at the time of first contact with Europeans. The Antelope Valley&#x27;s central geography then served as the hub of a trade route for tribes trading between the California coast, the Central Valley, the Great Basin, and the pueblos of Arizona.

After statehood, the Antelope Valley again served as a geographic shortcut but for the Stockton-Los Angeles Road and the Butterfield Overland Mail, which had two nearby stops in Mud Spring and Neenach in the 1850s. However, Lancaster&#x27;s origins as a settlement start with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which replaced the stage coach routes. The railroad built a station house, locomotive watering facility, section gang housing, and railroad track in the location of the town&#x27;s current center. In 1876 the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley, linking San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Lancaster began as a Scottish settlement. The origin of Lancaster&#x27;s name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former Pennsylvania home (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the Lancaster News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, Lancaster was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.

The town was devastated by the decade-long drought that began in 1894, killing businesses and driving cattle north, though fortunes improved somewhat in the late-1890s following the nearby discoveries of gold and borax. The Tropico Gold Mine in Rosamond was briefly the largest goldmine in Southern California before its 1956 closure. The Pacific Coast Borax Company mine would later become the world&#x27;s largest borax mine, producing nearly half of the world&#x27;s supply of borates. The 1912 completion of Antelope Valley High School allowed students from the growing region to study locally instead of moving to distant cities, hosting the state&#x27;s first high school dormitory system.

Lancaster State Prison opened in 1993 and before that Los Angeles County hosted no prisons but accounted for forty percent of California&#x27;s state-prison inmates. &quot;Most of Lancaster&#x27;s civic leaders and residents&quot; opposed the building of the prison, and four inmates escaped from LAC in its first year of operation. Nevertheless, by 2000 a proposal to increase the proportion of maximum-security inmates received little criticism.
In 2005, Hyundai Motor Co. announced the grand opening of a 4,300-acre, $60 million &quot;Proving Ground&quot;, a state-of-the-art testing facility for cars and sports utility vehicles in nearby California City.

In 2010, the city opened The BLVD, a one-mile revitalized stretch of Lancaster Boulevard between 10th Street West and Sierra Highway, with additional construction on Elm Avenue and Fig Avenue continuing for the next few months.

City leaders set the goal of becoming the nation&#x27;s first Net-Zero municipality, wherein the city would produce more clean energy than it consumes. Much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure including City Hall, local schools, and the minor league baseball stadium are solar-powered. In March 2013, Lancaster became the first city in the USA to require solar panels on all new homes in an effort to make the community more carbon neutral. The rule took effect in January 2014.

===War Eagle Field / Mira Loma===
War Eagle Field is a former airfield located in the Mojave Desert, about west of central Lancaster.

In 1944, the flight school changed its name to Mira Loma Flight Academy. The airfield inactivated on October 1, 1945, and was declared surplus in 1946. Responsibility for it was given to the War Assets Administration. The land was then bought by Los Angeles County. The airfield was converted to the Mira Loma Detention Center. In 2012, Los Angeles County closed the detention center. Los Angeles County is currently collaborating with the City of Lancaster, the faith-based community, and the non-profit community to convert the facility into a winter shelter.

Fox Airfield) along Avenue G, North Valley Industrial Center, Lancaster Business Park, Enterprise Business Park, Centerpoint Business Park, and the Southern Amargosa Industrial Area. The former Lancaster Redevelopment Agency is credited with attracting major business operations to the area such as SYGMA, Rite Aide, Micheals, Bank of America, and many more. In 2012 the state of California abolished all local redevelopment agencies. The city&#x27;s economic development department is now responsible for recruiting large employers and is involved in attracting retail and dining to Lancaster Town Center, Front Row Center, and other retail centers throughout the city.

Another focus of the Agency and the city was the revitalization of Downtown Lancaster. With historic buildings interspersed with modern amenities such as a library and performing arts center, downtown businesses formed the Lancaster Old Town Site (LOTS). LOTS has resulted in the renovation of business facades and attraction of new businesses, including boutiques and restaurants in the Old Town Area.

In 2009, Lancaster had 17% unemployment. Given the strength of China&#x27;s economy in the face of the global recession, Mayor R. Rex Parris identified recruitment of Chinese manufacturing firms as a high priority in 2009. In early 2010, Mayor Parris led a delegation to explore trade opportunities with China. An essential component of this trade mission was a stop in Shenzhen, China to meet with representatives of the battery, alternative energy, solar panel, and vehicle manufacturing firm BYD. BYD was looking to break into the United States vehicle manufacturing market, and was introduced to the City of Lancaster by Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich and his wife, Christine.

Lancaster&#x27;s partnership with BYD began with the &quot;Home of the Future&quot;, in which KB Home utilized BYD&#x27;s energy efficiency and storage technology to construct some of the first affordable near net-zero homes in the U.S. Through the success of this project, a working relationship was born, which BYD and Lancaster continued to cultivate as BYD Auto prepared to enter the U.S. market. Once the firm was ready to establish its manufacturing facility, Lancaster was its first stop. In May 2013, BYD Auto announced two manufacturing facilities to be located in Lancaster. These include a 120,000-square-foot BYD electric bus manufacturing facility, as well as a separate 44,000-square-foot energy storage system (large scale battery) manufacturing facility. By April 2019, BYD Lancaster had produced over 300 electric buses for US and Canada. Lancaster has the highest solar production per capita in California.
