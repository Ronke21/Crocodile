<text>Lucas is a city in Lucas County, Iowa, United States. The population was 172 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company established a station at Lucas in 1866, named after Lucas County and Robert Lucas. A plat for the town was filed on May 9, 1868 and the town was incorporated on March 18, 1887. The town grew slowly until coal was discovered in the area.
In 1876, the Whitebreast Coal and Mining Company began working a shaft one mile (1.6 km) east of Lucas. This proved successful, and in 1878, they platted a company town there, which they named Cleveland . By 1880, Cleveland had a population of 380, and the first mine was producing 650 to 700 tons of coal per day by the labor of 280 miners and 33 mule drivers. A second mine was opened 3/4 mile from the first, and the two mines sold coal to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and several other railroads to the south and west. The Cleveland post office was open from 1877 to 1891 and then reopened between 1899 and 1908. Very little remained of Cleveland by the 1930s.

In 1893, the Lucas Coal Company was working a two-foot coal seam down, employing 24 men.

The Big Hill mine in Lucas worked a coal seam below the surface using room and pillar methods, with a shaft not far from the Burlington station. This mine was closed in April 1904 and stripped of equipment, but by mid-1905, plans were in place to reopen it. The reopening lasted until 1907, when the mine was again closed, as the rock directly above the coal was sandstone and it was saturated with water. This mine is noteworthy because John L Lewis got his first coal mining job here, before going on to head the United Mine Workers of America.

United Mine Workers local 799 was organized in Lucas in 1899; its membership was 121 in 1902, but it fell to 57 in 1907 and just 24 in 1912.
UMW local 1120 was organized in Cleveland in 1899; membership was 350 in 1902, fell to 125 in 1907 and no membership was reported in 1912. Mine wages varied from $2.36 to $2.56 per day in Cleveland in 1907 (there are no wage figures for Lucas that year).

In 1919, Lucas was home to the second most productive coal mine in Iowa, Mine No. 2 of the Central Iowa Fuel Company. This produced 217,169 tons of coal that year and employed 360 men. The last coal mine in the Lucas area was the Iowa-Nebraska Mine, closed in 1923. This mine was located about southwest of Lucas (). The former mine site is now in the Lucas Unit of the Stephens State Forest. The site is now the site of Mine Pond and the Mine Pond Campground in the state forest. This forest was a base of operations for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The CCC established the pine and hardwood forest that now dominates this land.

==Geography==
Lucas is located on the north bank of White Breast Creek, a tributary of the Des Moines River that flows east through the Southern Iowa drift plain.

<text>Larchwood is a city in Lyon County, Iowa, United States. The population was 926 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Larchwood was founded &quot;circa&quot; 1872 by a group of McLean County, Illinois land developers: Jesse W. Fell (10 November 1808 – 25 February 1887) and Charles W. Holder (25 September 1819 – 10 April 1900). Fell was born in Pennsylvania, had settled in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1831 and had played an active role in founding many Illinois towns, including Clinton, Normal, Pontiac, and Towanda. He was a close friend of Abraham Lincoln, and with his brother Kersey Fell had persuaded Lincoln to write his famous autography. He was nationally known for his love of trees. Holder was a partner in many of Fell&#x27;s projects, including Towanda and Normal. Holder, Illinois was named in his honor. In the summer of 1869, Fell traveled to northwestern Iowa and selected a tract of about forty sections, more than of land. Fell wrote, “I have never beheld such a large body of surpassingly beautiful prairie as is here to be found. There is absolutely no waste of land, and scarce a quarter of a section not affording an admirable building site.” Holder then entered the land. Larchwood was established at the center of their holdings. Fell frequently visited the site and in May 1873 and personally supervised the planting of some 100,000 saplings and tree cuttings. The town did not grow as rapidly as expected, and in 1881 the development was sold to an Englishman, Richard Sykes.

<text>Oskaloosa is a city in, and the county seat of, Mahaska County, Iowa. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Oskaloosa was a national center of bituminous coal mining. The population was 11,558 in the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==


Oskaloosa derives its name from Ouscaloosa who, according to town lore, was a Creek princess who married Seminole chief Osceola. A local tradition was that her name meant &quot;last of the beautiful&quot;. (This interpretation of &quot;last of the beautiful&quot; is not correct. &quot;&quot; in the Mvskoke-Creek language means &quot;black rain&quot;, from the Mvskoke words &quot; (rain) and &quot; (black). &quot;loosa&quot; is an English corruption of the Mvskoke word &quot;. For example, see the Wikipedia entry for Tuskaloosa, eponym of the town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In addition the Mvskoke word &quot; means &quot;Black Water&quot;). The first European-American settlers arrived in 1835, led by Nathan Boone, youngest son of frontiersman Daniel Boone. Acting on instructions from Stephen W. Kearny, he selected this as the first site of Fort Des Moines, located on a high ridge between the Skunk and Des Moines rivers. The ridge was originally called the Narrows.

The town was formally platted in 1844 when William Canfield moved his trading post from the Des Moines River to Oskaloosa. The town was designated by the legislature as the county seat in the same year.

The Des Moines Valley Railroad built north from Eddyville, Iowa through Oskaloosa to Pella, Iowa in 1864. In 1873, this became the Keokuk and Des Moines Railroad, and in 1887, it was leased by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The Central Iowa Railway followed, which became the Iowa Central Railway in 1888 and was absorbed by the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1901. In 1883, the Burlington and Western Railway reached Oskaloosa; this was a narrow gauge line that was widened to Standard Gauge in 1902 and then merged with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.

On January 6, 1882, most of the buildings in the north half of Oskaloosa were severely damaged and most of the plate glass windows in the area were broken by an explosion. Three boys were killed in the explosion. The boys had been seen shooting at the A. L. Spencer gunpowder magazine half a mile north of the town center.

The first bituminous coal mine in the area was opened shortly after 1853 by Robert Seevers, who drove a drift into a four-foot coalbed in an exposed creek bank east of town. Initially, coal was mined entirely for local consumption, but with the arrival of the railroads, coal from the region was shipped widely. In the 1880s, more than one million tons of coal was mined in the county from 38 mines. By 1887, the report of the state mine inspector listed 11 coal mines in or very close to Oskaloosa. By 1895, the coal output of Mahaska County surpassed that of all other Iowa counties, and production had reached more than one million tons per year. In 1911, coal mining was reported to be the primary industry in the region. In 1914, the Carbon Block Coal Company of Centerville produced more than 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.

Several major coal-mining camps were located in the Oskaloosa area. Muchakinock was approximately five miles south of town, on the banks of the Muchakinock Creek. Lost Creek was a company town and post office with a population of about 500 in 1905, located about 10 miles south of town. On January 24, 1902, there was a mine explosion in the Lost Creek No. 2 mine. This was one of only two major mine disasters in Iowa between 1888 and 1913. A miner setting shots to blast coal from the coal face re-used a hole left over from a previous failed shot, and the result was a coal dust explosion that detonated barrels of gunpowder stored in the mine. Twenty men died on the site and 14 more were badly injured. The explosion sparked a statewide miner&#x27;s strike. As a result, in April 1903, the legislature enacted a law to regulate blasting in coal mines.

The Southern Iowa Fair is one of the largest traditional county fairs in Iowa and is held each July.

Art on the Square is held each June on the city square. This event features local and regional artists.

The City of Oskaloosa has a mayor-city council-city manager form of government under a home rule charter. The mayor and city council are elected. The city council is composed of seven members who make decisions regarding rules and regulations pertaining to Oskaloosa. The mayor is elected for a two-year term and council members are elected to serve for four years. The city manager is appointed by the city council.

Oskaloosa is a sister city with Shpola, Ukraine.

In July 2015, presidential candidate Donald Trump held a campaign event, a family picnic, at Oskaloosa&#x27;s George Daily Community Auditorium. He did not give press credentials to the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; for the event, due to its having had an editorial urging him to drop out of the race.

In November 2019, presidential candidate Joe Biden held a campaign event at William Penn University.

==Education==
Oskaloosa is the home of William Penn University, a private, liberal arts college. It was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1873 as Penn College. In 1933, the name was changed to William Penn College, and finally to William Penn University in 2000.

Oskaloosa was the home of the now-defunct Oskaloosa College.

The city&#x27;s public system, Oskaloosa Community School District, operates a high school, middle school, elementary school, and an alternative school. Oskaloosa Elementary opened in January 2005, merging five smaller buildings scattered across the city. The building is the largest elementary school in Iowa.

Also in Oskaloosa is Oskaloosa Christian Grade School, which was founded in 1946. SonShine Preschool started later, and is in the same building.

Transit services in the city are provided by Oskaloosa Rides. Free bus service is provided along one fixed-route loop in the city, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM. Paratransit services operated by 10-15 Transit are provided daily.

==Distinctions==
In the city&#x27;s town square is a bronze statue of Chief Mahaska, the 19th-century leader of a Native American tribe called the Ioway; he was memorialized by the name of Mahaska County. Restored in the 21st century, the statue was completed in 1907 by an Iowa-born sculptor named Sherry Edmundson Fry (1879–1966). At the time it was commissioned, Fry was living in Paris. He returned to Iowa the following summer to make preparatory drawings of Meskwaki at the nearby Settlement at Tama, Iowa, and to collect Indian artifacts and other reference materials. Returning to Paris, he began on a clay scale model, which he first showed at the Paris Salon in 1907. A year later, Fry exhibited the final full-sized sculpture, for which he won the &quot;Prix de Rome.&quot; Soon after, it was shipped to the United States, and arrived in Oskaloosa by railroad in September. The formal dedication of the statue was held on May 12, 1909, and attended by a crowd of about 12,000 people.

Oskaloosa boasts two private homes designed in 1948–51 by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Typical of his Usonian homes, these are the Carroll Alsop House at 1907 A Ave E and the Jack Lamberson House at 511 North Park Avenue.

Oskaloosa hosted the Iowa State Fair in 1858 and 1859, prior to the Civil War.

In 1934, Oskaloosa became the first city in the United States to fingerprint all of its citizens, including children.

==Municipal Band and historic bandstand==

The first settlers in the area brought along their instruments and a deep love of music. Residents organized a town band in 1864. In 1880, the band was called the K. T. Band (for Knight Templars). In approximately 1882, the city erected a double-deck bandstand in the center of the city park. The band had started playing in the city park when it was just a field. A brick walk through the park was constructed with money raised from a local talent minstrel show. In 1886, the Knee Gahh Band went to St. Louis for their national conclave and was a tremendous hit. That marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s prominence in the Midwest.

Charles L. Barnhouse developed the band &quot;atmosphere&quot; from the time he came to Oskaloosa in 1891. He exerted a creative influence to build up a musical organization that would become the pride of the city. His band garnered statewide acclaim, becoming the official band of the Iowa State Fair for four years. In 1904, the band played at the annual National Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic in Louisville, Kentucky. En route, it played by invitation at the World&#x27;s Fair in Saint Louis, Missouri. In the ensuing years the band became popular throughout Iowa and other states.

In 1907 and 1908, Oskaloosa had two bands playing concerts – the Iowa Brigade Band and LaRue&#x27;s Band. The merchants on High Avenue West employed their own band to compete with the Iowa Brigade Band in the park on Saturday evenings.

In 1911, the citizens decided to beautify the city and voted to fund improvements for the city park. The citizens recommended a new bandstand be erected in the center of the park. The old double-deck frame bandstand was moved to one side to be used while the new bandstand was being built. The first concert in the new bandstand was played on June 1, 1912, and the bandstand was dedicated on July 25, 1912.

<text>Bussey is a city in southeast Marion County, Iowa, United States. The population was 387 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==

Bussey is located at the intersection of routes G71 and T23. It is three quarter mile west of the Marion-Mahaska county line and two miles north of the Marion-Monroe county line. North Coal Creek flows past the community and on to its confluence with the Des Moines River seven miles to the northeast. Knoxville is approximately 14 miles to the northwest and Oskaloosa is approximately 13 miles to the northeast in Mahaska County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of its land.

==History==
Jesse Bussey, originally from Greene County, Pennsylvania, bought the land for the town of Bussey in 1867. He laid out the town of Bussey on the line of the Albia, Knoxville and Des Moines Railroad in 1875, the same year the line was acquired by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Mr Bussey went into the lumber and grain business there. By 1880, the population was close to 100, with four general merchandise stores and one drug store. The town was incorporated in 1895. There were some problems with the initial incorporation, so a second vote was held in 1899, after which James Bussey was elected as the first mayor.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were numerous coal mines in the Bussey area. In the early 1890s, the Powers company had two mine shafts in the area with a private tramway connecting them to the company&#x27;s tipple along the railroad line. J. A. Powers founded the O.K. Coal Company in Bussey, with a mile-long railroad spur to a mine a mile south of town. This mine was the largest producer in Marion County from 1895 to around 1902. Powers reorganized the O.K. company as the Mammoth Vein Coal Company when it moved its primary operations to Everist, a coal camp 3 miles west of Bussey and a mile north of Marysville. The Cricket Coal Company, later the Equality Coal Company, was based in Bussey and had a shaft outside of town, producing 18,000 tons of coal in 1915 from a coal seam that was 4 to 6 feet thick.

United Mine Workers local 69 was organized in Bussey in 1899. In 1902, it had 275 members, but by 1907 most of the local mining activity had moved to Everist, and it had only 8 members. Prior to union organization, the minimum wage was $1.50 per day, but by 1902, this had increased to $2.15 per day. By 1907, wages ranged from $1.90 to $2.70 per day.

<text>Knoxville is a city in and the county seat of Marion County, Iowa, United States. The population was 7,595 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase from 7,313 in the 2010 census. Knoxville is home of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, located next to the famous Knoxville Raceway dirt track.

==History==

The site for the future county seat of Marion County was selected because it was within a mile of the county&#x27;s geographic center, reasonably level, and near a good source of timber.

Knoxville is in south-central Iowa, 35 miles southeast of Des Moines. The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of the Sac and Meskwaki tribes. At that time, prairie grass covered the countryside at heights of 8 to 10 feet. In 1835, Dragoons first explored the Des Moines River valley through this area. In 1842, the Sac and Fox Indians signed a treaty to sell lands in central Iowa to the new settlers known as the New Purchase of 1842. By 1843, settlers began moving here. The first Marion County Courthouse was erected three years later.

Knoxville was founded in 1845 when Joseph Robinson and James Montgomery, Commissioners from Scott and Wapello County, selected the site for Knoxville and designated it as the county seat. They named Knoxville in honor of General Henry Knox, hero of the Revolutionary War. The city&#x27;s main streets are named after Robinson and Montgomery.

County surveyor Isaac B. Powers platted part of the town in September 1845, shortly after it was founded. Clairborne Hall laid out the remainder of the town in the winter of 1846–47. Additional surveys were made in December 1849 and September 1852.

The first sale of lots on October 21, 1845, saw the best sites in town go for $15 to $65. The first survey made the streets 80 feet wide, alleys 10 feet wide, and lots 120&#x27; × 60&#x27;, but the third survey changed the width of the streets to 50 feet, and made the blocks 265&#x27; × 240&#x27;.

The first Marion County courthouse was built on a lot owned by L.C. Corny. Contractor Lewis M. Pearch started work on May 29, 1846, at a cost of approximately $80,000.

Knoxville remained an unincorporated village until 1853, when a movement for incorporation began. A judicial order was issued after an election in which 64 votes were cast in favor of incorporation, with 4 votes against. Knoxville was duly incorporated as a City in 1855.
In early 1853, the citizens of Marion County created a committee to attract railroad development to the county and to Knoxville, promising to buy shares in any railroad that reached town. The first contender was the Muscatine, Oskaloosa &amp; Council Bluffs, proposing an east–west line that would pass through Knoxville, the line being suggested in January 1868 by the proposed Muscatine, Oskaloosa &amp; Council Bluffs. By 1875, when this line reached Knoxville, it was the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. The second railroad to reach Knoxville was the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific, which completed a line from Oskaloosa in 1876.

Systematic coal mining in Marion County began with the Union Coal Company&#x27;s mine in Flagler, east of Knoxville, around 1874 or 1875. For several years, the Number 5 mine in Flagler was one of Iowa&#x27;s most productive, employing around 150 men and working a coal vein over 8 feet (2.5 m) thick. The Oak Hill coal company also had mines in Flagler.

Shortly after the railroad reached Knoxville, J. T. James opened a coal mine in town eight blocks north of the courthouse. This mine continued in operation until 1890. A second mine nearby was operated by W. A. Gamble. In the 1880s, the White Breast Fuel Company opened the Number 11 mine at Flagler. This mine operated in a coal vein that was locally up to 14 feet thick, but only locally. The mine continued operating until 1892, working in progressively thinner coal as it expanded.

<text>Marysville is a city in Marion County, Iowa, United States. The population was 44 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Marysville is located on the north bank of Cedar Creek, 15 miles southeast of Knoxville, the county seat of Marion County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==

There are numerous coal exposures on the banks of the branches of Cedar Creek both north and south of Marysville. In 1846, one exposure south of Marysville was found to be on fire, and this fire continued until June 1851, when heavy rains and flooding extinguished the fire.

The county surveyor, Joseph Brobst, filed a plat for Marysville on March 4, 1851, creating 26 lots and a public square that was later subdivided into additional lots. Marysville was named after the 5 members of the Brobst family who were named Mary. Originally, the Marysville post office was named Ely or Ely&#x27;s. A Methodist church was established in 1867, a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Marysville Miner&quot;, was established in 1871, and a woolen factory was opened in 1872. Marysville was officially incorporated as a town in the late 1870s, and by 1910, it had three general stores, a post office, a 4-teacher public school, and telephone service.

A five-foot bed of coal was exposed along North Cedar Creek about 2 miles north of Marysville, and by 1867, several coal banks were open in the Marysville area and Jacob Kline had opened a mine about a mile north of Marysville, where the coal was 10 feet thick. By 1908, eleven different mines had been worked in the Marysville area, primarily by the Mammoth Vein Coal Company, which took over from the O.K. Coal Company in 1903. The Wabash Railroad built a 7-mile spur line to serve the mines.

===Everist===
The coal camp of Everist, Iowa was located about 2 miles north of Marysville near . The camp post office operated from 1905 to 1918. Everist served mines operated by the Mammoth Vein Coal Company and later the Empire Coal Company. Employment in 1914 was seasonal, varying from 90 to 300 men, and the mines at Everist shipped up to 800 carloads of coal per day circa 1914. The nearest railroad station was 6 miles away (by road) in Bussey. As is typical of coal camps, the coal company owned the houses in Everist and met the residents&#x27; needs through a company store. Scrip tokens for The Everist Mercantile Co. are occasionally found on the collectors&#x27; market. United Mine Workers local 981 was organized in Everist in 1905; by 1907, it had 480 members. Mine wages varied from $1.13 to $2.56 per day.

<text>Pleasantville is a city in Marion County in Iowa, United States. The population was 1,676 at the time of the 2020 census. Pleasantville is most famous for being the corporate headquarters of Smokey Row Coffee.

==History==
Pleasantville was surveyed and established as a town on August 1, 1849 on land then owned by William Wesley Jordan. Previous to the ownership of Mr. Jordan, the land comprising the original town plot of Pleasantville changed hands for one horse and $30.

A petition for incorporation was filed in District Court on June 11, 1872 with an election subsequently held in which there were 46 votes in favor and 16 votes against.

The completion of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad Line through Pleasantville in 1879 caused an increase in development and Pleasantville became one of the active business centers in Marion County and the principal shipping point between Knoxville and Des Moines.

The earliest population figures available begin in 1900 with 738 residents.

The first school was built in the fall of 1847, and in 1868, the school district joined with the Masonic Lodge in building a three-story brick building that remained a school facility until 1992. Today, the Pleasantville School district consists of three buildings, an elementary, a middle school, and a high school.

==Movie==
The movie Pleasantville was released in the United States on October 23, 1998. Shortly before and during the film&#x27;s release, as a promotional tie-in, an online competition gave entrants the chance to visit Pleasantville, Iowa. Over 30,000 people entered. The winner, who remained anonymous, declined the trip and opted to receive the $10,000 cash prize instead.

<text>Haverhill is a city in Marshall County, Iowa, United States. The population was 165 at the time of the 2020 census.

Sites in Haverhill include the Immaculate Conception oratory, the Matthew Edel Blacksmith Shop and House, and the Mid-Iowa Co-Op, which owns the grain elevators on the south end of the city. A series of wind turbines owned by Mid-American Energy stretch from Haverhill to the nearby town of Laurel.

==History==
The St. Joseph&#x27;s parochial school and the Immaculate Conception Church, established in the 1870s pre-date Haverhill&#x27;s official 1882 platting by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway (also known as the Milwaukee Road). The railroad carried both freight and passengers, with passenger service traveling east and west each stopping in Haverhill three times daily. The community mostly stored grain in elevators, while hosting several small industries and town services including a lumber company, blacksmith shop, bank, general store, grocer, and schools.

Throughout the 20th century, these businesses and services mostly closed. Rail traffic fell, first losing passenger rail service before freight traffic ceased in 1980. Prior to this, the German Savings Bank (established in 1908) shuttered in the early 1920s. By the mid-20th century, the public school had merged into the Marshalltown Community School District, with the St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic school closing in 1968.

The town was only officially incorporated in 1968, when residents chose to elect a city government, establishing municipal services, including a fire department. Just before the city&#x27;s official incorporation, the Haverhill Development Corporation expanded streets and available housing from 3rd Avenue to 4th Avenue. The town&#x27;s roads were then paved in the 1980s, with sewer services later overhauled in the 1990s and early 2000s.

<text>Marshalltown is a city in Marshall County, Iowa, and is the county seat of the county. With a population of 27,591 at the 2020 census, it is the 16th largest city in the state. Marshalltown is home to the Iowa Veterans Home and Marshalltown Community College.

==History==
Henry Anson was the first European settler in what is now called Marshalltown. In April 1851, Anson found what he described as “the prettiest place in Iowa.” On a high point between the Iowa River and Linn Creek, Anson built a log cabin. A plaque at 112 West Main Street marks the site of the cabin. In 1853 Anson named the town Marshall, after Marshall, Michigan, a former residence of his.

The town became Marshalltown in 1862 because another Marshall already existed in Henry County (In 1880, Marshall&#x27;s name changed to Wayland). With the help of Potawatomi chief Johnny Green, Anson persuaded early settlers to stay in the area. In the mid-1850s, Anson donated land for a county courthouse. Residents donated money for the building&#x27;s construction. In 1863 the title of county seat transferred from the village of Marietta to Marshalltown. The young town then began growing. By 1900, Marshalltown had 10,000 residents. Many industries began developing in Marshalltown, like Fisher Controls, Lennox International and Marshalltown Company.

Marshalltown plays a small but significant role in the life of Ebe Dolliver, a main character in MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

===Baseball===
Adrian Constantine &quot;Cap&quot; Anson, son of Henry and Jennette Anson, was the first European child born in the new pioneer town and is today known as Marshalltown&#x27;s “first son.” Adrian became a Major League Baseball player and was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game.
Baseball steadily became popular as Marshalltown grew in the mid-1800s. Adrian&#x27;s brother Sturgis also became a talented baseball player and both went to play on intra-school teams at the University of Notre Dame. Both later returned to Marshalltown to play baseball for the town team. Along with their father Henry, the town&#x27;s founder, they put together a team and became the most prominent team in the state of Iowa. The Marshalltown team, with Henry Anson at third base, Adrian&#x27;s brother Sturgis in center field, and Adrian at second base, won the Iowa state championship in 1868. In 1870 Marshalltown played an exhibition game with the talented Rockford Forest Citys. Although Marshalltown lost the game, Rockford&#x27;s management offered contracts to all three of the Ansons. Adrian accepted the contract, which began his professional career in baseball in 1871.

Baseball continued its popularity in Marshalltown. In the early 1880s Billy Sunday played for the town baseball team. In 1882, with Sunday in left field, the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13–4. Marshalltown later formed a minor league team naming it after the Anson family, the Marshalltown Ansons. From 1914 to 1928 the team played in the Central Association and Mississippi Valley League.

===Natural disasters===
====Tornado history====

On April 23, 1961, the south side of town was hit by an F3 tornado. It damaged numerous structures in the area, causing $1 million (1961 USD) in the town alone. It killed one person and injured 12. Marshalltown would be hit again on July 19, 2018, when another EF3 tornado with peak winds of 145 mph moved directly through downtown at 4:37 p.m. local time. It destroyed the spire from the top of the courthouse, while heavily damaging or destroying several homes, businesses, and historic downtown buildings. It was on the ground for 23 minutes along a path of destruction up to wide. Although there were no fatalities, 23 people were injured.

====2020 derecho====

On August 10, 2020, Marshalltown was hit by a powerful derecho, which caused extensive damage throughout the city. Over a hundred cars parked near a factory had their windows blown out. Reports described winds, roofs being ripped off, and loose wood debris embedded in the sides of buildings. One week after the storm, nearly 7,000 residents of the city were still waiting for power restoration; 99 percent restoration was achieved on August 23. The damage to public parks in the city and surrounding Marshall County was &quot;extensive&quot;, particularly to trees.

===Immigration===
Marshalltown&#x27;s Hispanic population in particular boomed in the 1990s and 2000s with immigrants mostly from Mexico, just like in many other Midwestern towns with meat-packing plants. Another smaller wave of Burmese refugees later arrived in the 2010s.

Federal law enforcement have twice raided the Swift &amp; Company (now JBS) meatpacking plant, first in 1996 and again in 2006, arresting suspected undocumented immigrants for alleged identity theft. One study estimated the 2006 raid caused a 6-month to 1-year economic recession in the area. Explaining the 2006 raid&#x27;s effect on the community, Police Chief Michael Tupper told The Washington Post in 2018 that “I think that there’s just a lot of fear that it could happen again. It was a very traumatic experience for our community. Not just for the families and people that were directly impacted, but for our school system, for our local economy, for our community as a whole. It was, in many ways, a devastating experience.”

This railroad was sold to the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1884, which itself was sold to Union Pacific Railroad in 1995. There has been no passenger rail service in Marshalltown since the last services there were discontinued in the early 1960s.

<text>Matthew Arnold (24 December 1822 – 15 April 1888) was an English poet and cultural critic. He was the son of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School, and brother to both Tom Arnold, literary professor, and William Delafield Arnold, novelist and colonial administrator. He has been characterised as a sage writer, a type of writer who chastises and instructs the reader on contemporary social issues. He was also an inspector of schools for thirty-five years, and supported the concept of state-regulated secondary education.

==Early years==
He was the eldest son of Thomas Arnold and his wife Mary Penrose Arnold, born on 24 December 1822 at Laleham-on-Thames, Middlesex. John Keble stood as godfather to Matthew.

In 1828, Thomas Arnold was appointed Headmaster of Rugby School, where the family took up residence, that year. From 1831, Arnold was tutored by his clerical uncle, John Buckland, in Laleham. In 1834, the Arnolds occupied a holiday home, Fox How, in the Lake District. There William Wordsworth was a neighbour and close friend.

In 1836, Arnold was sent to Winchester College, but in 1837 he returned to Rugby School. He moved to the sixth form in 1838 and so came under the direct tutelage of his father. He wrote verse for a family magazine, and won school prizes. His prize poem, &quot;Alaric at Rome&quot;, was printed at Rugby.

In November 1840, aged 17, Arnold matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, where in 1841 he won an open scholarship, graduating B.A. in 1844. During his student years at Oxford, his friendship became stronger with Arthur Hugh Clough, a Rugby pupil who had been one of his father&#x27;s favourites. He attended John Henry Newman&#x27;s sermons at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin but did not join the Oxford Movement. After his father&#x27;s death in 1842, Fox How became the family&#x27;s permanent residence. His poem &quot;Cromwell&quot; won the 1843 Newdigate prize. He graduated in the following year with second class honours in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot;.

In 1845, after a short interlude of teaching at Rugby, Arnold was elected Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. In 1847, he became Private Secretary to Lord Lansdowne, Lord President of the Council. In 1849, he published his first book of poetry, &quot;The Strayed Reveller&quot;. In 1850 Wordsworth died; Arnold published his &quot;Memorial Verses&quot; on the older poet in Fraser&#x27;s Magazine.

== Marriage and career ==
Wishing to marry but unable to support a family on the wages of a private secretary, Arnold sought the position of and was appointed in April 1851 one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors of Schools. Two months later, he married Frances Lucy, daughter of Sir William Wightman, Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench.

Arnold often described his duties as a school inspector as &quot;drudgery&quot; although &quot;at other times he acknowledged the benefit of regular work.&quot; The inspectorship required him, at least at first, to travel constantly and across much of England. As narrated by Stefan Collini in his 1988 book on Arnold: &quot;Initially, Arnold was responsible for inspecting Nonconformist schools across a broad swath of central England. He spent many dreary hours during the 1850s in railway waiting rooms and small-town hotels, and longer hours still listening to children reciting their lessons and parents reciting their grievances. But that also meant that he, among the first generation of the railway age, travelled across more of England than any man of letters had ever done. Although his duties were later confined to a smaller area, Arnold knew the society of provincial England better than most of the metropolitan authors and politicians of the day.&quot;

==Literary career==

In 1852, Arnold published his second volume of poems, &quot;Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems&quot;. In 1853, he published &quot;Poems: A New Edition&quot;, a selection from the two earlier volumes famously excluding &quot;Empedocles on Etna&quot;, but adding new poems, &quot;Sohrab and Rustum&quot; and &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot;. In 1854, &quot;Poems: Second Series&quot; appeared; also a selection, it included the new poem &quot;Balder Dead&quot;.

Arnold was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in 1857, and he was the first in this position to deliver his lectures in English rather than in Latin. He was re-elected in 1862. &quot;On Translating Homer&quot; (1861) and the initial thoughts that Arnold would transform into &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; were among the fruits of the Oxford lectures. In 1859, he conducted the first of three trips to the continent at the behest of parliament to study European educational practices. He self-published &quot;The Popular Education of France&quot; (1861), the introduction to which was later published under the title &quot;Democracy&quot; (1879).

In 1865, Arnold published &quot;Essays in Criticism: First Series&quot;. &quot;Essays in Criticism: Second Series&quot; would not appear until November 1888, shortly after his death. In 1866, he published &quot;Thyrsis&quot;, his elegy to Clough who had died in 1861. &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;, Arnold&#x27;s major work in social criticism (and one of the few pieces of his prose work currently in print) was published in 1869. &quot;Literature and Dogma&quot;, Arnold&#x27;s major work in religious criticism appeared in 1873. In 1883 and 1884, Arnold toured the United States and Canada delivering lectures on education, democracy and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1883. In 1886, he retired from school inspection and made another trip to America. An edition of &quot;Poems by Matthew Arnold&quot;, with an introduction by A. C. Benson and illustrations by Henry Ospovat, was published in 1900 by John Lane.

==Death==
Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure whilst running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool Landing Stage to see his daughter, who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American. His wife died in June 1901.

==Character==
&quot;Matthew Arnold&quot;, wrote G. W. E. Russell in &quot;Portraits of the Seventies&quot;, is &quot;a man of the world entirely free from worldliness and a man of letters without the faintest trace of pedantry&quot;. Arnold was a familiar figure at the Athenaeum Club, a frequent diner-out and guest at great country houses, charming, fond of fishing (but not of shooting), and a lively conversationalist, with a self-consciously cultivated air combining foppishness and Olympian grandeur. He read constantly, widely, and deeply, and in the intervals of supporting himself and his family by the quiet drudgery of school inspecting, filled notebook after notebook with meditations of an almost monastic tone. In his writings, he often baffled and sometimes annoyed his contemporaries by the apparent contradiction between his urbane, even frivolous manner in controversy, and the &quot;high seriousness&quot; of his critical views and the melancholy, almost plaintive note of much of his poetry. &quot;A voice poking fun in the wilderness&quot; was T. H. Warren&#x27;s description of him.

==Poetry==
Arnold&#x27;s literary career—aside from two youthful prize poems—had begun in 1849 with the publication of &quot;The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems&quot; by A., which attracted little notice and was soon withdrawn. It contained what is perhaps Arnold&#x27;s most purely poetical poem, &quot;The Forsaken Merman.&quot; &quot;Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems&quot; (among them &quot;Tristram and Iseult&quot;), published in 1852, had a similar fate. In 1858 he published his tragedy of &quot;Merope&quot;, calculated, he wrote to a friend, &quot;rather to inaugurate my Professorship with dignity than to move deeply the present race of humans,&quot; and chiefly remarkable for some experiments in unusual—and unsuccessful—metres. Arnold is sometimes called the third great Victorian poet, along with Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Robert Browning. 

Harold Bloom echoes Arnold&#x27;s self-characterization in his introduction (as series editor) to the &quot;Modern Critical Views&quot; volume on Arnold: &quot;Arnold got into his poetry what Tennyson and Browning scarcely needed (but absorbed anyway), the main march of mind of his time.&quot; Of his poetry, Bloom says,

Sir Edmund Chambers noted that &quot;in a comparison between the best works of Matthew Arnold and that of his six greatest contemporaries ... the proportion of work which endures is greater in the case of Matthew Arnold than in any one of them.&quot; Chambers judged Arnold&#x27;s poetic vision by

His 1867 poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; depicted a nightmarish world from which the old religious verities have receded. It is sometimes held up as an early, if not the first, example of the modern sensibility. In a famous preface to a selection of the poems of William Wordsworth, Arnold identified, a little ironically, as a &quot;Wordsworthian&quot;. The influence of Wordsworth, both in ideas and in diction, is unmistakable in Arnold&#x27;s best poetry. &quot;Dover Beach&quot; is included in Ray Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and is featured prominently in the novel &quot;Saturday&quot; by Ian McEwan. It has been quoted or alluded to in a variety of other contexts (see Dover Beach). Henry James wrote that Arnold&#x27;s poetry will appeal to those who &quot;like their pleasures rare&quot; and who like to hear the poet &quot;taking breath&quot;. He derived the subject matter of his narrative poems from traditional or literary sources, and much of the romantic melancholy of his earlier poems from Senancour&#x27;s &quot;Obermann&quot;.

Arnold was keenly aware of his place in poetry. In an 1869 letter to his mother, he wrote:

Stefan Collini regards this as &quot;an exceptionally frank, but not unjust, self-assessment. ... Arnold&#x27;s poetry continues to have scholarly attention lavished upon it, in part because it seems to furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, especially the corrosion of &#x27;Faith&#x27; by &#x27;Doubt&#x27;. No poet, presumably, would wish to be summoned by later ages &quot;merely&quot; as an historical witness, but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnold&#x27;s verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment.&quot;

==Prose==
Assessing the importance of Arnold&#x27;s prose work in 1988, Stefan Collini stated, &quot;for reasons to do with our own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing, the best of his prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry.&quot; &quot;Certainly there may still be some readers who, vaguely recalling &#x27;Dover Beach&#x27; or &#x27;The Scholar Gipsy&#x27; from school anthologies, are surprised to find he &#x27;also&#x27; wrote prose.&quot;

George Watson follows George Saintsbury in dividing Arnold&#x27;s career as a prose writer into three phases: 1) early literary criticism that begins with his preface to the 1853 edition of his poems and ends with the first series of &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot; (1865); 2) a prolonged middle period (overlapping the first and third phases) characterised by social, political and religious writing (roughly 1860–1875); 3) a return to literary criticism with the selecting and editing of collections of Wordsworth&#x27;s and Byron&#x27;s poetry and the second series of &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot;. Both Watson and Saintsbury declare their preference for Arnold&#x27;s literary criticism over his social or religious criticism. More recent writers, such as Collini, have shown a greater interest in his social writing, while over the years a significant second tier of criticism has focused on Arnold&#x27;s religious writing. His writing on education has not drawn a significant critical endeavour separable from the criticism of his social writings.

===Literary criticism===
Arnold&#x27;s work as a literary critic began with the 1853 &quot;Preface to the Poems&quot;. In it, he attempted to explain his extreme act of self-censorship in excluding the dramatic poem &quot;Empedocles on Etna&quot;. With its emphasis on the importance of subject in poetry, on &quot;clearness of arrangement, rigor of development, simplicity of style&quot; learned from the Greeks, and in the strong imprint of Goethe and Wordsworth, may be observed nearly all the essential elements in his critical theory. George Watson described the preface, written by the thirty-one-year-old Arnold, as &quot;oddly stiff and graceless when we think of the elegance of his later prose.&quot;

Criticism began to take first place in Arnold&#x27;s writing with his appointment in 1857 to the professorship of poetry at Oxford, which he held for two successive terms of five years. In 1861 his lectures &quot;On Translating Homer&quot; were published, to be followed in 1862 by &quot;Last Words on Translating Homer&quot;. Especially characteristic, both of his defects and his qualities, are on the one hand, Arnold&#x27;s unconvincing advocacy of English hexameters and his creation of a kind of literary absolute in the &quot;grand style,&quot; and, on the other, his keen feeling of the need for a disinterested and intelligent criticism in England.

Although Arnold&#x27;s poetry received only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful. Arnold is famous for introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics at the time and the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. His &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot; (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day, and his prefatory essay to that collection, &quot;The Function of Criticism at the Present Time&quot;, is one of the most influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature—even while saying, &quot;The critical power is of lower rank than the creative.&quot; Comparing himself to the French liberal essayist Ernest Renan, who sought to inculcate morality in France, Arnold saw his role as inculcating &quot;intelligence&quot; in England. In one of his most famous essays on the topic, &quot;The Study of Poetry&quot;, Arnold wrote that, &quot;Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry&quot;. He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were &quot;high truth&quot; and &quot;high seriousness&quot;. By this standard, Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; did not merit Arnold&#x27;s approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both &quot;high truth&quot; and &quot;high seriousness&quot;, such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of &quot;the object as in itself it really is.&quot;

Though unable to speak any of the Celtic languages Arnold maintained an interest in the Celtic-language literatures of Ireland and Wales, and his &quot;On the Study of Celtic Literature&quot;, first published in 1867, led him to be regarded as an expert in the field, though now it is usually viewed as an expression of orientalist or colonialist attitudes towards its subject.

===Social criticism===
He was led on from literary criticism to a more general critique of the spirit of his age. Between 1867 and 1869 he wrote &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;, famous for the term he popularised for the middle class of the English Victorian era population: &quot;Philistines&quot;, a word which derives its modern cultural meaning (in English—the German-language usage was well established) from him. &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; is also famous for its popularisation of the phrase &quot;sweetness and light&quot;, first coined by Jonathan Swift.

In &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;, Arnold identifies himself as a Liberal and &quot;a believer in culture&quot; and takes up what historian Richard Bellamy calls the &quot;broadly Gladstonian effort to transform the Liberal Party into a vehicle of political moralism.&quot; Arnold viewed with scepticism the plutocratic grasping in socioeconomic affairs, and engaged the questions which vexed many Victorian liberals on the nature of power and the state&#x27;s role in moral guidance. Arnold vigorously attacked the Nonconformists and the arrogance of &quot;the great Philistine middle-class, the master force in our politics.&quot; The Philistines were &quot;humdrum people, slaves to routine, enemies to light&quot; who believed that England&#x27;s greatness was due to her material wealth alone and took little interest in culture. Liberal education was essential, and by that Arnold meant a close reading and attachment to the cultural classics, coupled with critical reflection. Arnold saw the &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;reflection&quot; of Liberalism as naturally leading to the ethical end of &quot;renouncement,&quot; as evoking the &quot;best self&quot; to suppress one&#x27;s &quot;ordinary self.&quot; Despite his quarrels with the Nonconformists, Arnold remained a loyal Liberal throughout his life, and in 1883, William Gladstone awarded him an annual pension of 250 pounds &quot;as a public recognition of service to the poetry and literature of England.&quot;

Many subsequent critics such as Edward Alexander, Lionel Trilling, George Scialabba and Russell Jacoby have emphasised the liberal character of Arnold&#x27;s thought. Hugh Stuart Jones describes Arnold&#x27;s work as a &quot;liberal critique of Victorian liberalism&quot; while Alan S. Kahan places Arnold&#x27;s critique of middle-class philistinism, materialism, and mediocrity within the tradition of &#x27;aristocratic liberalism&#x27; as exemplified by liberal thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville.

Arnold&#x27;s &quot;want of logic and thoroughness of thought&quot; as noted by John M. Robertson in &quot;Modern Humanists&quot; was an aspect of the inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. &quot;There are four people, in especial,&quot; he once wrote to Cardinal Newman, &quot;from whom I am conscious of having learnt—a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression—learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are—Goethe, Wordsworth, Sainte-Beuve, and yourself.&quot; Dr. Arnold must be added; the son&#x27;s fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by Swinburne, and was later attested by Matthew Arnold&#x27;s grandson, Mr. Arnold Whitridge. Others such as Stefan Collini suggest that much of the criticism aimed at Arnold is based on &quot;a convenient parody of what he is supposed to have stood for&quot; rather than the genuine article.

===Journalistic criticism===
In 1887, Arnold was credited with coining the phrase &quot;New Journalism&quot;, a term that went on to define an entire genre of newspaper history, particularly Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s turn-of-the-century press empire. However, at the time, the target of Arnold&#x27;s irritation was not Northcliffe, but the sensational journalism of &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; editor, W. T. Stead.
Arnold had enjoyed a long and mutually beneficial association with the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; since its inception in 1865. As an occasional contributor, he had formed a particular friendship with its first editor, Frederick Greenwood and a close acquaintance with its second, John Morley. But he strongly disapproved of the muck-raking Stead, and declared that, under Stead, &quot;the P.M.G., whatever may be its merits, is fast ceasing to be literature.&quot;

He was appalled at the shamelessness of the sensationalistic new journalism of the sort he witnessed on his tour of the United States in 1886. In his account of that tour, &quot;Civilization in the United States&quot;, he observed, &quot;if one were searching for the best means to efface and kill in a whole nation the discipline of self-respect, the feeling for what is elevated, he could do no better than take the American newspapers.&quot;

===Religious criticism===
His religious views were unusual for his time and caused sorrow to some of his best friends. Scholars of Arnold&#x27;s works disagree on the nature of Arnold&#x27;s personal religious beliefs. Under the influence of Baruch Spinoza and his father, Dr. Thomas Arnold, he rejected the supernatural elements in religion, even while retaining a fascination for church rituals. In the preface to &quot;God and the Bible&quot;, written in 1875, Arnold recounts a powerful sermon he attended discussing the &quot;salvation by Jesus Christ&quot;, he writes: &quot;Never let us deny to this story power and pathos, or treat with hostility ideas which have entered so deep into the life of Christendom. But the story is not true; it never really happened&quot;.

He continues to express his concern with the historicity of the Bible, explaining that &quot;The personages of the Christian heaven and their conversations are no more matter of fact than the personages of the Greek Olympus and their conversations.&quot; He also wrote in &quot;Literature and Dogma&quot;: &quot;The word &#x27;God&#x27; is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge, but a term of poetry and eloquence, a term thrown out, so to speak, as a not fully grasped object of the speaker&#x27;s consciousness—a literary term, in short; and mankind mean different things by it as their consciousness differs.&quot; He defined religion as &quot;morality touched with emotion&quot;.

However, he also wrote in the same book, &quot;to pass from a Christianity relying on its miracles to a Christianity relying on its natural truth is a great change. It can only be brought about by those whose attachment to Christianity is such, that they cannot part with it, and yet cannot but deal with it sincerely.&quot;

==Reputation==
Harold Bloom writes that &quot;Whatever his achievement as a critic of literature, society or religion, his work as a poet may not merit the reputation it has continued to hold in the twentieth century. Arnold is, at his best, a very good, but highly derivative poet, unlike Tennyson, Browning, Hopkins, Swinburne and Rossetti, all of whom individualized their voices.&quot;

The writer John Cowper Powys, an admirer, wrote that, &quot;with the possible exception of &quot;Merope&quot;, Matthew Arnold&#x27;s poetry is arresting from cover to cover—[he] is the great amateur of English poetry [he] always has the air of an ironic and urbane scholar chatting freely, perhaps a little indiscreetly, with his not very respectful pupils.&quot;

==Family==

The Arnolds had six children: 
*Thomas (1852–1868); 
*Trevenen William (1853–1872); 
*Richard Penrose (1855–1908), an inspector of factories; 
*Lucy Charlotte (1858–1934), who married Frederick W. Whitridge of New York, whom she had met during Arnold&#x27;s American lecture tour; 
*Eleanore Mary Caroline (1861–1936) married (1) Hon. Armine Wodehouse (MP) in 1889, (2) William Mansfield, 1st Viscount Sandhurst, in 1909; 
*Basil Francis (1866–1868).

** A good starting point for those new to Arnold&#x27;s prose. &quot;Like many late century scholars, Collini believes Arnold&#x27;s chief contribution to English literature is as a critic. ... Collini insists Arnold remains a force in literary criticism because &#x27;he characterizes in unforgettable ways&#x27; the role that literary and cultural criticism &#x27;can and must play in modern societies&#x27;&quot; (p. 67). Mazzeno, 1999, pp. 103–104.
* Nicholas Murray, &quot;A Life of Matthew Arnold&quot; (London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; New York: St. Martin&#x27;s, 1996)
** &quot;...focuses on the conflicts between Arnold&#x27;s public and private lives. A poet himself, Murray believes Arnold was a superb poet who turned to criticism when he realised his gift for verse was fading.&quot; Mazzeno, 1999, p. 118.
* Ian Hamilton, &quot;A Gift Imprisoned: A Poetic Life of Matthew Arnold&quot; (London: Bloomsbury, 1998)
** &quot;Choosing to concentrate on the development of Arnold&#x27;s talents as a poet, Hamilton takes great pains to explore the biographical and literary sources of Arnold&#x27;s verse.&quot; Mazzeno, 1999, p. 118.

<text>Melbourne is a city in Marshall County, Iowa, United States. The population was 786 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Melbourne was platted February 23, 1882, by Milwaukee Land Company, in section 6 of Logan Township and was incorporated December 30, 1895. Melbourne was the only town in Marshall County to be served continuously by two major railroads. Melbourne&#x27;s growth was rapid and made possible by three railroads and the population increased to 423 by 1910. Melbourne suffered the worst disaster in the town&#x27;s history when a fire consumed the whole business district in 1903; then in 1981 the southern end of town was destroyed by a tornado.

The mayor of Melbourne from 1984 until 1998 was Bill Crews, an openly gay man who revealed his orientation during his term, in 1993. At the time, Melbourne was believed to be the smallest municipality in the United States to have an openly gay mayor.

<text>Glenwood is a city in, and the county seat of, Mills County, Iowa, United States. The population was 5,073 in the 2020 census, a decline from 5,358 in 2000.

==History==
Located in a hollow of the Loess Hills on the east side of the Missouri River, Glenwood was established by Mormons in 1848 as Coonsville. It prospered during the California Gold Rush largely due to the grain mill on Keg Creek. Coonsville was the scene of anti-Mormon mob violence. It became the county seat of Mills County in 1851. In 1852, after most Mormons left for Utah, it was renamed Glenwood after a Presbyterian minister, Glenn Wood.

The community supported the creation of Nebraska Territory in 1854. Two Glenwood attorneys were elected to the Nebraska territorial legislature, and they were run out of town for accepting shares in Scriptown. At the end of the Civil War, an Iowa Veteran&#x27;s Orphans Home was founded here. The evangelist (and professional baseball athlete) Billy Sunday lived at the orphanage as a child.

The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad was completed through Glenwood in 1869. During the late 19th century, the community was widely known as Iowa&#x27;s center of fruit production, particularly of apples, and it hosted an annual Apple Carnival. Early industries included an iron foundry, an expansive marble and stone works, the Glenwood Creamery, and a large cannery that covered a city block on the east side of Locust Street. It distributed its products under the brand-name &quot;The Glenwood.&quot; Darting &amp; McGavern&#x27;s &quot;Sanitary&quot; cannery on South Vine and Railroad Avenue canned tomatoes, pumpkin, apples, and beets into the 1920s.

In 1876 the State Veterans&#x27; Orphan&#x27;s Home at Glenwood was adapted for use as the Iowa Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children, the seventh such facility in the country and the first located west of the Mississippi River. The Glenwood facility expanded with increased acceptance of treatment and institutionalization for intellectual disability; it became the Iowa Institution for Feeble-Minded Children. The grounds and Administration Building were largely patterned on the Kirkbride Plan, as state funding permitted. (The Administration Building has since been demolished.)

The institution has long dominated Glenwood both economically and culturally, although the IIFMC was self-sufficient and intentionally isolated the residents from the rest of the town. By 1925, the Glenwood IIFMC was the home of 1,555 inmates classified as idiots, imbeciles, and morons, according to contemporary definitions. The IIFMC became the Glenwood State-Hospital School in 1941. By the early 1950s, the facility covered ; it had 310 staff members for the 1,968 patients. Under the influence of eugenics theory, the state had ordered sterilization of those defined as feeble-minded or worse, and experimental treatments such as cold baths and electroshock were used to reduce symptoms of psychosis and depression. The de-institutionalization of Glenwood began in the late 1950s. A November 17, 1957 article in the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; revealed that Mayo Buckner had spent 59 years confined to Glenwood, despite an IQ of 120, indicating above-average intelligence. National attention followed for Buckner and the Glenwood State-Hospital School, which were featured in the December 9, 1957 issue of &quot;Time&quot; and the March 25, 1958 issue of &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. During the 1970s, the facility completed a transformation from traditional ward buildings into group home-styled cottages. It is now known as the Glenwood Resource Center and provides services and skills training to support people living in communities.

After World War II, the town of Glenwood became a center of meat-packing. During the early 1950s, it had one of America&#x27;s largest kosher packinghouses, with most of its product shipped to New York and the East Coast. The packinghouse was later modified to process both cattle and pork; it was bought by Swift &amp; Company and then closed in the 1980s. Meatpacking has moved to sites further west, closer to ranching areas.

Trajet , a whirlpool manufacturer, now occupies the former slaughterhouse. A large industrial laundry operated for most of the 20th century in the town until it was purchased and closed by Cintas.

Transportation links include the BNSF; U.S. Route 34, and U.S. Route 275 pass through Glenwood, and Interstate 29 is located a few miles west on the floodplain of the Missouri River. Tourist destinations are the Loess Hills and the National Scenic Byway.

In March 2019, Mills County was hit with catastrophic flooding. While Glenwood itself was not directly affected, residents were without clean water for weeks on a boil order. Glenwood officials worked with Mills County to help flood efforts in nearby towns like Pacific Junction, which was nearly completely submerged with hundreds displaced.

==Geography==

Glenwood is located at (41.045581, -95.742371). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

* The Glenwood Earth Lodge and Mills County Natural History Museum.
* The IIFMC Hospital at the Glenwood Resource Center was constructed during the 1890s with conical towers, Romanesque Revival arched balconies, an Italianate cupola, and still-impressive interior spiral staircase. The three-story brick building is used as offices by the Glenwood Resource Center.
* The IIFMC Fire Station at the Glenwood Resource Center was built in 1903 with a Dutch Colonial parapeted roof.
* The VJ Meyer School Building at the Glenwood Resource Center was built in the mid-1950s to improve the level of education available to residents confined to what was then the Glenwood State Hospital-School. The school was named after Dr. VJ Meyer, the Superintendent at Glenwood from 1945 to 1957. The building was dedicated in September 1957 when the gates of the institution were opened to the public for the first time. From 1992 to 2007 this was the location of the Glenwood Middle School.
* The three-story JV Hinchman Building at Sharp and Walnut Streets was completed in 1882 by Hoosier druggist turned financier Joseph Hinchman.
* The 1920 Glenwood State Bank building at 12 North Walnut on the Glenwood Courthouse Square was designed by Danish immigrant architect J. Chris Jensen of Council Bluffs and is notable locally for its Greek Revival marble facade. For many years this was the location of Hamilton&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Clothes and is now home to Glenwood Land Surveying Services.
* The First Christian Church at 305 First Street was built in 1867 at a cost of $1,800. It has been a private residence for many years.
* 411 Sharp is a unique two-story Italianate commercial building on the south side of the Glenwood Courthouse Square that was constructed in 1874 with prominent window hoods and is now the location of the Loess Hills Maker Space.

* The Hubbell Home at 202 Locust was built in the early 20th century and remains interesting for its Queen Anne style, prominent dormer windows, and adjacent stable long since converted into a garage.
* The Robinson Block at 102 South Walnut on the Glenwood Courthouse Square was constructed during the early 20th century and features a variety of 19th century architectural elements, including a second-story bay window.
* The Buffington Block at 420 1st Street was built on the north side of the Glenwood Courthouse Square during the 1890s with one of the town&#x27;s most distinguished cornices and seven second-story Italianate arched windows. A Ben Franklin Stores operated here during the latter half of the 20th century.

* The Wheeler&#x27;s Super Service Station at 102 South Vine on the Glenwood Courthouse Square was constructed during the early 1920s to serve traffic along the Bluegrass Highway which became U.S. Route 34. The one-story brick building is unusual locally for its early Moderne architecture.
* The Glenwood Opera House Block at 412-416 First Street was built in 1891 on the Glenwood Courthouse Square with a variety of Richardsonian Romanesque elements. It first began showing motion pictures in 1908, became the Rex Theater by the 1920s, and, after many ownership changes, continues to show movies to the present day although live performances ended in the mid-20th century. 
* The Mintle Company Building is a one-story late Moderne structure at 209 Sharp that was built in 1947 along what was then U.S. Route 34. Mintle was a dealer in J.I. Case farm equipment, Pontiac automobiles, and offered a full line of Frigidaire products. The building is now used as the Glenwood Police Department.
* Lilac Terrace were the neighborhoods that developed after the &quot;West Hill&quot; school was completed in 1868. By the early 20th century the area west of Sharp and Hazel Streets was one of the community&#x27;s more prestigious addresses and still contains some notable architectural styles, including the L.W. Russell home, the H.M. Bogan and James Miller homes, and particularly the Queen Anne style William Lamb mansion on the northwest corner of Hazel and Sharp Streets which has been divided into apartments. Also of interest are the Morris Kaiman home at 102 South Hazel, the Robinson home at 105 North Hazel, and the Addison Meyers home at 404 North Hazel. The Works Progress Administration financed Glenwood High School replaced the West Hill School in 1937, became Glenwood Junior High from 1966 to 1987, and is now part of West Elementary.

He fell into the creek looking for the ball near hole five. It is rumored that he haunts the hole and players are discouraged from looking for balls in the creek.
* Seminary Hill immediately north of the Glenwood Courthouse Square developed after the late 1860s when the private Western Iowa College opened on the city block west of Chestnut between First and Second Streets. This became the Glenwood Methodist Seminary in the 1870s and the location of the East School until the 1970s. The surrounding neighborhood still contains a majority of the town&#x27;s dominant Protestant churches, including the Glenwood First Congregational Church at 407 Second Street established by abolitionist John Todd in 1857.

<doc id="114066" wikidata="Q1928682" url="?curid=114066" title="Malvern, Iowa">
<text>Malvern is a city in Mills County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,046 at the time of the 2020 census. The Wabash Trace—a railroad converted to a bicycle trail—passes through Malvern. The Mills County Fair is held here, although Glenwood is the county seat. Malvern is the largest town in the eastern half of the county.

==History==

The pioneer village of Milton was established in the fall of 1869. It was later renamed Malvern when it was discovered that there was already another Milton, Iowa. It was one of four communities in the area that came into existence with the completion of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad on November 18, 1869.

John D. Paddock and his bride were the first residents of Malvern. They arrived in September and put up a small -story building that served as their home and the community&#x27;s first store.

The completion of the railroad soon brought a flood of new residents and business enterprises. White Cloud, a town of perhaps 200 persons and a variety of businesses, was located about where the present Wabash Trace Nature Trail crosses the Nishnabotna River three miles southeast of Malvern. It soon closed down when the new railroad was built two miles north. Several business enterprises and White Cloud residents moved to Malvern.

Malvern grew almost explosively in its first two years. In its fifth year, Mr. Paddock reported in his Brief History of Malvern, it had a population of 800. It served a particularly productive farming area. It soon had a number of factories, including a hog packing plant, an electric generation plant (in 1892) which permitted a municipal water system, and in the early part of the twentieth century, developed a varied poultry industry that at one time furnished employment for up to 200 persons. Malvern started a school system in 1870, a county fair in 1873, a Chautauqua in 1905, built the town library in 1916 and the present Liberty Memorial Community Building in 1926

When the “good roads” movement came to Iowa, the town was omitted from Highway 34, causing some economic stress. At the time it also had the Wabash and Tabor &amp; Northern Railroads, which were also having some economic stress. The town experienced additional stress in the 1950s when much of Iowa&#x27;s poultry industry moved to Arkansas.

The success of the Malvern community has always been linked to agriculture in many ways. When fewer family farms and farm workers, became the norm, in the 1960s, 1970s, and especially the difficult 1980s, the economy of Malvern suffered as well, losing many of the established businesses that had so long lined the streets in this community.

Today Malvern is a rural community with a golf course, swimming pool, new library and Carnegie Conference Center, agricultural businesses and government offices, a bank, physician&#x27;s offices, Mills County Fair Grounds, the Wabash Trace Nature Trail, and numerous other businesses.

<text>Pacific Junction is a city in Mills County, Iowa, United States. The population was 96 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Pacific Junction was established by the railroad in 1871 to serve as the western terminus of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, the eastern terminus of the Nebraska Burlington &amp; Missouri River RR, and a station on the Kansas City, Council Bluffs, &amp; Saint Joseph Railroad. All three were consolidated as part of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, today&#x27;s BNSF. After several rough and tumble years of growth Pacific Junction was incorporated in 1882. The scene of violence during the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888, PJ&#x27;s population peaked during the early 20th century with just over 700 people. Railroad traffic through town remains almost constant although the town&#x27;s connections to the railroad have declined significantly since 1971. Historic structures include the 1914 Pacific Junction Public School which graduated its last high school class in 1961 and closed for good in 1986. On the early morning of December 3, 2021, two BNSF trains collided two locomotives and 16 cars derailed in Pacific Junction.

The 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods had a devastating impact on Pacific Junction. Following the failing of the Mills County levees on March 17, 2019, the city was flooded completely. Following a federal buyout program and the demolition of damaged structures, most lots now lie empty. The United States Postal Service has yet to return to the town, and the town hall is not currently usable. The city government has struggled financially in the aftermath, and has experienced difficulty in providing services. According to the 2020 Census, only around 20% of the pre-flood population of the city remains.

==Geography==
Pacific Junction is located at (41.018319, -95.799883).

== History ==
The first plat of the town was started in 1854 by a Dr. Moore and named after his eldest daughter “Cora”, but the name was never recorded. In 1855 a Mr. Gibbs arrived from Massachusetts, representing wealthy capitalists in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He prevailed upon Mr. Orrin Sage, a great banker from Ware, MA to invest in this community, and later Mr. Sage gave $2,000 and 600 acres of land to the Library Building Fund. Because of his benevolence, the town’s name was changed to Osage in his honor. 

In the winter of 1855-56, Dr. S. B. Chase of Decorah purchased land in the southwest part of the tract and in the spring of 1856 platted the present City of Osage. He named the east-west streets generally for trees and numbered the north-south streets. He was also responsible for setting out maple trees to line the streets. Even today, Osage is referred to as “the City of Maples”.  Dr. Chase built an elaborate residence and office on Free Street in 1869. That house still stands today and is used as apartments. Ten years after Dr. Chase’s death in 1891, Free Street was renamed Chase Street to honor his many contributions to Osage. 

Several of the businesses in Osage occupy structures built in the 1870’s. City Hall occupies the former Sage Library Building constructed in 1910 after a $10,000 gift from Andrew Carnegie. The very first library building was built in 1876 one-half block west of the current City Hall/Sage Library building. A Subway sandwich shop occupies the ground floor of the building today and the date of 1876 along with “Sage Library” is seen in the concrete and brick work of the second story. In 2002, a four-block area of Main Street was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. On both sides of Main Street within the district, one to multi-story masonry commercial buildings stand which were constructed in the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. (There are a few vacant lots and some newer buildings as a result of demolition and fire.) The Osage Commercial Historic District retains sufficient integrity and reflects how the town of Osage has prospered over the years. Main Street is 100 feet wide and was first paved in 1910. Since that time, it was repaved in 1975 and decorative sidewalks were built and trees planted in street boxes. The Main Street project was named the best municipal paving project in Iowa in 1975 by the Iowa Concrete Paving Association.

Cedar River Complex - The Cedar River Complex (CRC) is a community recreation destination that includes an events center, wellness center, museum and auditorium. The CRC offers opportunities to meet, play, learn and enjoy. Located in Mitchell County, Iowa, the Cedar River Complex is a multi-faceted recreation facility which includes an events center, a wellness center, the Mitchell County Historical Museum and an auditorium.

Watts Theatre - The Watts Theatre was opened in 1950 by the Jim Watts family, with a showing of &quot;Dancing in the Dark.&quot; The 44 by 132 foot building was designed and built as a state-of-the-art theater and included 580 seats and living quarters upstairs for the Watts family.
In 1994 Paul and Gloria Bunge purchased the building (which had been closed and stripped of all its equipment and seating) and restored it to its previous glory, including new heating and air conditioning, new projection equipment and a new sound system. The Bunges widened the aisles, left more room between rows, and installed 364 new seats designed for the building.
On June 14, 1994, the theater was reopened, again showing &quot;Dancing in the Dark.&quot;
The Bunges sold the theatre in 1998 to Robert Williams and his adult children, Bethany Jablonski, Ryan Williams, and Steve Williams. The Williams family made several improvements to the theatre, including a new roof, a replacement neon system, equipment upgrades, and a complete refurbishing of the apartment (which is now used as a viewing room and party facility).
In October 2006, the Williams family sold the theatre to the Walk Family.

Spring Park - Spring Park has been a destination park for the area dating back to 1894. Originally a private park along the Cedar River, the property was deeded to the City of Osage in 1938. Best known for its encased spring, the park is used as a picnic, playground, and popular primitive camping area. The spring&#x27;s water is tested frequently and is potable. Woodland flowers cover the grounds in the spring. The 2-mile Harry Cook Nature Trail runs from the west side of Osage to Spring Park, and most of the route runs adjacent to the Cedar River. Fishing and kayaking are also popular sports at Spring Park. Spring Park is located two miles west of Osage on Highway 9 to Spring Park Road, then half mile south.

<text>St. Ansgar is a city in Mitchell County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,160 at the 2020 census.

==History==
St. Ansgar is named for the patron saint of Scandinavia, a French Benedictine monk who Christianized much of Denmark, Sweden, and northern Germany between 830 and 865 A.D. The town is the site of First Lutheran Church of St. Ansgar, a pioneer Norwegian Lutheran Church founded in December 1853 by Claus Lauritz Clausen, who was commissioned by the Lutheran Church of Norway to form congregations for Norwegian immigrants in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.

The St. Ansgar church, congregation, and town served as a center for the dispersion of Norwegian immigrant settlers north across the border into Minnesota and into western Iowa from the mid-1850s into the late 1870s. Clausen formed 21 additional congregations. According to a booklet published by the First Lutheran Church of St. Ansgar on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the congregation, the church, which is made of limestone quarried from the banks of the nearby Cedar River and native hardwoods, is the oldest continuously active Lutheran church west of the Mississippi River.

Pastors in the Church of Norway received university training in census record-keeping; the parish keeps copies of congregation records continuously from founding to the present, making them a significant genealogical resource.

A fortified stone outbuilding locally called Fort Severson, 5.5 miles northwest of St. Ansgar near Carpenter, Iowa, was built in 1867 by settlers associated with the Clausen settlement anxious about the continued presence of Dakota Indians traveling through the area along the Deer Creek and the Cedar River. The settlers&#x27; fears were animated by the killing of settlers during the Spirit Lake Massacre in 1857 and the Dakota Uprising of 1862. The distinctively fortified building, which functioned both as a barn and a fort, is the sole surviving example of many that were built.

==Education==
Castana is within the Maple Valley–Anthon–Oto Community School District.

The community was originally a part of the Castana Consolidated Independent School District. The lower level of a building constructed in 1888 was the first classroom area. In 1897 a permanent $12,000, three story Castana Normal School building opened. An addition was completed in Summer 1911. The school district acquired a teacher&#x27;s residence hall in 1920; that building also housed classes for several grades.

In 1935 and 1936 the Castana Consolidated School, the final school building in Castana, was built by the Sioux City company Beuttler &amp; Arnold, funded by a $36,818 Public Works Administration grant and a $45,000 bond. It opened for classes on September 7, 1936. In November of that year the school district sold the previous school to the city government for $1,000, and the building was razed. The 1935–1936 school was renamed the Castana Community School in 1954.

The district began sending high school students to the Maple Valley Community School District in Mapleton and to Onawa in fall 1962. Castana joined the Maple Valley district along with Danbury in 1968. The merged district did not use the teacher&#x27;s residence and sold it in 1970. On July 1, 2012, the Maple Valley district consolidated with the Anthon–Oto Community School District to form the new Maple Valley–Anthon–Oto district.

A $2,200 bond approved by voters on June 15, 1880, resulted in the construction of a new school established on a site acquired for $200 on August 31, 1880. Another new building opened around 1903.

The Mapleton Consolidated School District, which operated the Mapleton Consolidated School, formed on July 12, 1916. The district purchased land for another new school, funded by a $95,000 bond that passed 280–70 on April 12, 1917, in August of the same year. The new school opened in October 1918. A vocational building funded by a $17,000 bond passed in 1926 finished construction in January 1927.

In 1955, Mapleton Community School District, as it was now known, absorbed the Ticonic Independent School District, serving Ticonic. An addition connecting both existing buildings in the Maple Valley School, funded by a $300,000 1957 bond, was completed in 1959. The school had 620 students and 39 teachers around that time.

The Mapleton Community School District merged into the Maple Valley Community School District in 1961. On July 1, 2012, the Maple Valley district consolidated with the Anthon–Oto Community School District to form the new Maple Valley–Anthon–Oto district.

Rodney is within the Maple Valley–Anthon–Oto Community School District.

Rodney was initially a part of the Rodney Public School District. There were several initial school buildings before a permanent school facility in northwest Rodney opened in the early 1900s. As of 1900, 75 students were enrolled, and this increased to 116 in 1925. For a period students in grades 1–10 attended school in Rodney while those finishing high school moved on to Mapleton or Smithland. The school system began sending all high school students to Smithland after it removed high school grades in 1947, and it paid the corresponding high school tuition from 1955 until the end of the district, when the residents voted to join the new Maple Valley Community School District in 1960. That year a private individual purchased and razed the Rodney School, and the students began attending Maple Valley schools in 1961. On July 1, 2012, the Maple Valley district consolidated with the Anthon–Oto Community School District to form the new Maple Valley–Anthon–Oto district.

<text>Albia is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County, in southern Iowa, United States. The population was 3,721 at the 2020 census.

The city of Albia is known for its historic square and city-wide Victorian Architecture. Albia is also known for the annual &quot;Restoration&quot; days celebration which commemorates the refurbishment of the square and the town which began in the mid-1960s.

==History==

Albia was incorporated as a town in 1856. The town was named after Albia, New York, the former home of an early settler.

On Feb. 14, 1893, there was a coal mine explosion in the Chicago and Iowa mine, about 2.5 miles west of Albia. This room and pillar mine had opened around 1877. By the time of the explosion, mining extended more than 1,000 yards from the hoisting shaft, and the mine employed 60 miners and 20 other men. One miner was killed outright and seven died later of their injuries, after a &quot;shot&quot; (gunpowder charge used to bring down the coal) ignited a dust explosion in the mine. This was one of only two major mine disasters in Iowa between 1888 and 1913.

In the early 20th century, the region around Albia was dotted with coal mining camps and company towns. Of these, Buxton, 9 miles north of Albia, is the most widely studied. It had a large Black population. Other former coal camps in the area include Hiteman, Bluff Creek, Lockman, Coalfield, Hocking, and Hynes.The growth in membership in the United Mine Workers union, as shown by the following data, is a useful measure of the importance of mining in the region. In 1902, UMW Locals 692 and 793 in Albia had an aggregate membership of 216. By 1912, UMW Locals 407, 782 and 793 in Albia had an aggregate membership of 338 (about 7.2% of the 1910 population). Miners in Hiteman, 5 miles northwest of town, joined the UMWA in 1898; between 1902 and 1912, membership grew from 450 to 688. Miners in Hynes, 7 miles east, joined the UMWA in 1896; between 1902 and 1912, membership grew from 330 to 543.

<text>Lovilia is a city in Monroe County, Iowa, United States. The population was 472 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Lovilla was laid out in 1853.

Coal was known north and south of Lovilia in the early 1900s, and there were scattered &quot;country mines&quot; in the area.

On March 30, 1953, there was a dust explosion at the O&#x27;Brien Mine, a coal mine near Lovilia. Two men, including the mine foreman, were in the mine to fire the black-powder shots at the end of the work shift. Both were killed in the blast. Volunteers from Lovilia went into the mine and brought out the bodies, and then the owner of the O&#x27;Brien mine, along with three officials of a nearby mine and an employee went underground to investigate. Of the five, only two survived; the others were overcome by bad air. The ensuing investigation determined that the dust explosion was caused by a blow-out in two of the blasted holes. A blow-out occurs when the force of the explosion blows the stemming out of a hole instead of breaking up the surrounding material. In the case of the O&#x27;Brien mine, the stemming used was a mix of coal dust and clay.

In 1972, the Lovilia Coal Company was operating one of the last two underground coal mines in Iowa. The mine employed 21 workers and produced 245,000 tons of coal that year. This was a room and pillar mine.

In 1985, the Star Coal Company of Lovilia was the largest employer in Monroe County, Iowa, with 150 employees. Coal production was 500,000 tons per year, about 80 percent of Iowa&#x27;s total coal production.

The 1937 Melrose Shamrocks were the Iowa state high school basketball champions.

The team finished their season 33–0, the first undefeated boys basketball team in Iowa history. In 2012, the Des Moines Register recognized the Shamrocks as one of the ten best State tournament teams in Iowa history. The Shamrocks made the State boys&#x27; basketball tournament again in 1938, 1950, and 1959.

Walt O&#x27;Connor and Jim Thynne from the 1937 team and Donald Knowles, a 1942 Melrose graduate, were inducted into the Iowa High School Athletic Association Hall of Fame. In March 2012, the Iowa High School Athletic Association inducted Coach Ad Hlubek into the Hall of Fame as a coach.

<text>Red Oak is a city in, and the county seat of, Montgomery County, Iowa, United States, located along the East Nishnabotna River. The population was 5,596 in the 2020 census, a decline from the 6,197 population in 2000.

==History==

Red Oak derives its name from Red Oak Creek which flows through the community and was noted for the red oaks on its banks. The first settlers arrived there in the 1850s. In 1865 it became the official county seat of Montgomery County and the courthouse which had been in the middle of the county seven miles northeast in Frankfort, Iowa was towed to the community during a snow storm. That courthouse remained in place until the current Montgomery County Courthouse was built in 1891. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1869 the community was officially founded when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (called the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad at the time) arrived. The community was named Red Oak Junction by the railroad on March 20, 1876. The junction was a line off the main Chicago to Council Bluffs, Iowa line that went to Nebraska City, Nebraska and on to Lincoln, Nebraska. The Junction name was dropped in 1901 although the community continues to celebrate its history each summer in Junction Days. In 1903 a depot was opened by the railroad. Preservation efforts for the depot have been enacted since 1993. Today it is the Restored BN and World War II Museum celebrating the community&#x27;s disproportionate casualties during World War II and other wars, significant military heritage and community pride in service to country. The depot is one of nine places in Montgomery County on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Montgomery County, Iowa.

Darwin R. Merritt, born in Red Oak on April 12, 1872, graduated third in his class from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland on July 1, 1897. On February 15, 1898, he perished in the explosion that sank the in the harbor of Havana, Cuba. His body was later recovered and interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Red Oak.

The community suffered, in a national per capita comparison, a disproportionate number of casualties in the Civil War and World War II.

In the American Civil War, the area provided more Union troops per capita than any other in the state. Company M (which also included residents from Montgomery County) had 160 casualties among its 250 members; 52 men were killed in action.

Early World War II battles claimed a disproportionate number of soldiers from Red Oak, although the final casualty statistics tend to disprove the oft-repeated statement that Red Oak suffered more losses per capita than any other American community. In the Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943, forty-five soldiers from Red Oak alone were captured or killed; more than 100 telegrams arrived in Red Oak saying that its soldiers were missing in action. In recognition of Red Oak&#x27;s casualties, the city&#x27;s name was given to a &quot;victory ship&quot;. The SS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot; has become a floating museum in the shipyard where it was built, in Richmond, California.

The old Burlington Northern depot has been transformed into the Restored BN Depot and World War II Museum telling this history.

The Red Oak School District was established in 1870, while Webster Eaton first published the Red Oak Express newspaper in 1868.

==Villisca axe murders==
On the night of June 9, 1912, the Moore family and two guests were brutally murdered with an axe, though it was only on the morning of June 10, 1912, that they were found in their home by a neighbor and Ross Moore, the brother of Josiah Moore.

Josiah B. Moore and Sarah Montgomery were married on December 6, 1899. They had four children: Herman, Katherine, Boyd, and Paul. Joe was a prominent and well-liked businessman. By 1912, the Moore Implement Company (a John Deere Company franchise) was a solid competitor with other Villisca and area hardware stores, including the Jones Store owned by his former employer, F.F. Jones. Sarah was active in the Presbyterian church and assisted with Children&#x27;s Day exercises. On the morning of June 10, 1912, Joe (43) and Sara (39), their four children, and two visiting children (Lena and Ina Stillinger), were found bludgeoned to death with the Moores&#x27; own axe. Their unsolved murders began a chain of events that split the borough of Villisca and forever changed the course of the town&#x27;s history and the lives of its inhabitants.

==Education==
It is within the Villisca Community School District. Residents are zoned to Southwest Valley High School, operated by the Corning Community School District, and shared with the Villisca district as part of a grade-sharing agreement.

==History==
Atalissa was platted in 1859. It was named by its founder, William Lundy, for a mining town in California, which in turn was named for an Indian queen Atalissa.

From 1974 to 2009 Atalissa was the home of a few dozen intellectually challenged men who worked in a nearby turkey processing plant. They lived together in an old schoolhouse and were taken each workday to the plant, and after expenses were taken out, were paid no more than $65/month. They were removed and relocated by state agencies in 2009, after being found to be living in unacceptable conditions. A 2013 verdict awarded the men a total of $240 million in damages, since reduced to $50,000/man. The men&#x27;s plight had a profound effect on social services in Iowa, and their experiences and subsequent court case was the subject of the documentary film &quot;The Men of Atalissa&quot;.

<text>Muscatine ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Muscatine County, Iowa, United States. The population was 23,797 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase from 22,697 in 2000. It is located along the Mississippi River. The local business association states that the name Muscatine is not used by any other community.

Muscatine is the principal city of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area (2010 census population 54,132) the estimate was 54,184, which includes all of Muscatine and Louisa counties, making it the 283rd-largest micropolitan statistical area.

== History ==

Muscatine began as a trading post founded by representatives of Colonel George Davenport in 1833. Muscatine was incorporated as Bloomington in 1839; the name was changed to reduce mail delivery confusion, as there were several Bloomingtons in the Midwest. Before that, Muscatine had also been known as &quot;Newburg&quot; and &quot;Casey&#x27;s Landing&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;Muscatine&quot; is debated. It may have been derived from the Mascouten Native American tribe. The Mascoutin lived along the Mississippi in the 1700s. In 1819 Muscatine Island was known as &quot;Mascoutin Island&quot;.

In the 1838 United States General Land Office map, the town is labelled &quot;Musquitine&quot;, which may be a variation of &quot;Musquakeen&quot;, an alternative name for Muscatine Island; &quot;Musquakeen&quot; may have derived from the Meskwaki indigenous people who lived close by. Major William Williams, who was visiting in 1849 when the town was still called both Bloomington and Muscatine, claimed, &quot;Muscatine in English is Fire Island,&quot; in his list of the meanings of Siouan language names.

Williams wrote a brief description of the settlement:


From the 1840s to the Civil War, Muscatine had Iowa&#x27;s largest black community, consisting of fugitive slaves who had traveled the Mississippi from the South and free blacks who had migrated from the eastern states. One of the most prominent community leaders was Alexander G. Clark Sr., born free in Pennsylvania. He was a barber, a respected position at the time, and eventually became a wealthy timber salesman and real estate speculator. In 1848 he was among the founders of the local African Methodist Episcopal Church, which had been established as the first independent black denomination in the US.

In the antebellum period he assisted fugitive slaves, and petitioned the state government to overturn racist laws before the Civil War. In 1863, Clark helped organize Iowa&#x27;s black regiment, the 60th United States Colored Infantry (originally known as the 1st Iowa Infantry, African Descent), though an injury prevented him from serving.

In 1868, he gained desegregation of Iowa&#x27;s public schools by suing the Muscatine school board after his daughter Susan was turned away from her neighborhood school. Eleven years later, in 1879 his son Alexander Jr. became the first black graduate of the University of Iowa College of Law and its first black graduate from any department. Clark Sr. went to the college and became its second black law graduate five years later, despite being 58 years old. He said that he wanted to serve “as an example to young men of his own race.” Clark rose to prominence in the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to state and national conventions.

In 1890, Clark was appointed ambassador to Liberia by President Benjamin Harrison. He was one of four Muscatine residents to be appointed as a diplomatic envoy between 1855 and 1900, a remarkable feat for a town of such small size: George Van Horne was consul at Marseille, France during the 1860s; Samuel McNutt served at Maracaibo, Venezuela in 1890; and Frank W. Mahin represented his country in Liberec (Reichenberg), Austria-Hungary in 1900.

Less than a year after arriving in Liberia, Clark died of fever. His body was returned to the US, where he was buried in Muscatine&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery. In 1975 the city moved his former house about , to make room for a low-income apartment complex for senior citizens; the latter was named in his honor. The University of Iowa&#x27;s chapter of the Black Law Students Association (BLSA) is named for the Clarks, as a testament to the accomplishments of father and son, and their places in the history of civil rights in Iowa.

Mark Twain lived in the city briefly during the summer of 1855 while working at the local newspaper, the &quot;Muscatine Journal,&quot; which was partly owned by his brother, Orion Clemens.

He noted some recollections of Muscatine in his book &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;:


In 1884, J. F. Boepple, a German immigrant, founded a pearl button company. He produced buttons that looked like pearls by machine-punching them from freshwater mussel shells harvested from the Mississippi River. Muscatine&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Pearl of the Mississippi,&quot; refers to the days when pearl button manufacturing by the McKee Button Company was a significant economic contributor. In 1915, Weber &amp; Sons Button Co., Inc. was the world&#x27;s largest producer of fancy freshwater pearl buttons. From that time forward, Muscatine was known as &quot;The Pearl Button Capital of the World&quot;. Weber is still manufacturing today and celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2004.

Muscatine is nearly as well known as the &quot;Watermelon Capital of the World&quot;, a title that reflects the agricultural rural nature of the county.

Muscatine was home to minor league baseball. The Muscatine Muskies was the last moniker of the minor league teams that played in Muscatine from 1910 to 1916. Muscatine was a member of the Northern Association (1910) and Central Association (1911–1916). Baseball Hall of Fame member Sam Rice played for the Muscatine Wallopers in 1912. Muscatine played at League Field, now named &quot;Tom Bruner Field&quot;.

Muscatine was the home town and operating location of broadcaster Norman G. Baker, inventor of the calliaphone. In 1925–1931, Baker operated the powerful radio station KTNT, published a newspaper, and operated the Baker Institute, a clinic. He also owned numerous businesses in the town.

Muscatine was formerly a stop on the shared Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad and Milwaukee Road line. Restructuring of the railroads followed declines in passenger traffic and the Rock Island station was eventually demolished. The two railroads split near the railroad crossing on county highway X61. A portion of the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s line is extant; it serves business and is used for the storage of rolling stock.

Muscatine was hit by an EF3 tornado on June 1, 2007, which destroyed or damaged areas of the city.

On February 15, 2012, Xi Jinping, Vice President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, visited Muscatine. He had previously visited in 1985 as part of a Chinese delegation to learn about American agriculture. He returned to Muscatine when he toured the U.S. in 2012 before becoming president. The visit prompted the public appearance of both supporters and protesters. The latter criticized China&#x27;s human rights record in Tibet.

In 2017, the Sino-U.S. Cultural Center was established for $1 million (equivalent to $ in ), by Glad Cheng (born 1971), owner of Muscatine Travel and chairman of the China Windows Group Inc.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Muscatine is primarily located on a series of bluffs and hills at a major west-south bend in the Mississippi River. The river-bend gives the city roughly 260 degrees of riverfront. The &quot;highland&quot; area of the town is divided into three ridge-like hills by Papoose Creek and Mad Creek, each of which flow individually into the Mississippi in downtown Muscatine. The city&#x27;s main roads follow these ridges and valleys in a radial fashion.

Several large working-class neighborhoods and industrial sectors have been built on what is called &quot;Muscatine Island&quot;. This flat, sandy expanse was largely underwater before a portion of the Mississippi River rerouted to follow the course of the present-day Muscatine Slough. It is unclear when the river changed course. The hills, river, and island are all integral to the diversity of Muscatine&#x27;s economy and housing sector. As the city&#x27;s urbanized area develops, the areas of highest elevation in the &quot;High Prairie&quot; crescent (between the Cedar and Mississippi Rivers) are increasingly taken from agricultural use and developed as suburban housing.

Positioned some (30 minutes) from the Quad Cities, (52 minutes) from Iowa City and some (75 minutes) from Cedar Rapids, Muscatine is the smallest link in a non-contiguous populated area which surpassed 800,000 residents in the decade following the 2000 census. The key feature of this region is that although the populated areas are non-contiguous, a high percentage of residents commute among the cities for work, particularly those in professional fields.

===Print===

The &quot;Muscatine Journal&quot; newspaper circulates daily Monday through Saturday throughout the Muscatine area and on muscatinejournal.com. Established in 1840, the &quot;Muscatine Journal&quot; was once owned by Mark Twain&#x27;s brother, Orion Clemens, and Twain wrote for the paper during his time in Muscatine. The publication and its weekly shopper &quot;Hometown Extra&quot; have been owned by Lee Enterprises, based in Davenport, Iowa, which as of January 2025 owned 72 markets in 25 states.

The &quot;Voice of Muscatine&quot;, a publication of Jam Media Solutions, has been an operation newspaper since October 28, 2015. It is a county-wide publication, servicing Muscatine County.

===Radio===
Jam Media Solutions, LLC. has two radio stations in Muscatine; KWPC-AM has been a long part of the city&#x27;s history, and KMCS-FM has been in the community since 1996.

Townsquare Media&#x27;s KBEA-FM transmits from a tower near north of Muscatine, but broadcasts from studios shared with other Townsquare Media stations in the Quad Cities community of Davenport.

Residents also receive radio broadcasts from stations in the Quad Cities, Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, Burlington, Waterloo, and Aledo, Illinois (WRMJ).

===Television===
Muscatine and Muscatine County are part of the Television Market.

Depending on location, terrain, and type of antenna used, some Muscatine area residents can also receive television signals from Cedar Rapids–Waterloo, and the Iowa side of the Ottumwa–Kirksville market.
==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Muscatine is located along two designated routes of Iowa&#x27;s &quot;Commercial-Industrial Network&quot;, U.S. Highway 61 and Iowa Highway 92. Highway 61 serves as a major agricultural-industry route to the south from Burlington to Muscatine, where it becomes a heavy-industrial and major commuter route to the northeast between Muscatine and Davenport. In conjunction with Iowa 92, which provides access to the Avenue of the Saints (U.S. 218/IA 27) to the west and the lightly populated western Illinois via the Norbert Beckey Bridge to the east, Highway 61 serves as a shortcut for traffic from northeastern Missouri and southeastern Iowa en route to the Quad Cities, Chicago, and points beyond. Several regional highway improvement projects are in the works to further establish and capitalize on this trade-route. Additionally, Muscatine is connected to Interstate 80 to the north by fifteen miles () of Iowa Highway 38. Iowa Highway 22 also connects with U.S. 218/IA 27 to the west, and Davenport to the east. The port of Muscatine is proposed for construction.

The MuscaBus is the primary provider of mass transportation in Muscatine, with four routes serving the region. As of 2019, the system provided 149,140 rides over 21,796 annual vehicle revenue hours with 4 buses and 5 paratransit vehicles. MuscaBus operates 4 weekday bus routes on a pulse system with three routes leaving City Hall on the hour and half hour. On Saturdays, two routes operate from City Hall. Hours of operation for the system are Monday through Friday from 6:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M and Saturdays from 8:30 A.M. to 4:15 P.M. There is no service on Sundays.

==Environmental problems==
Grain Processing Corp. (GPC) has been known to pollute the air by emitting small particles from its coal burning, acetaldehyde as a byproduct from corn ethanol processing, and also lead. &quot;The plant released more lead than any other plant in Iowa, according to Iowa Department of Natural Resources data. It emitted more acetaldehyde – a probable carcinogen chemically similar to formaldehyde – than almost any plant in the country.&quot; In 2006 GPC had to pay a $538,000 fine () for violating the hourly operating limit for years. In July 2014, the company agreed to new, more stringent, air emissions permits with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and federal regulators. The company moved from coal to natural gas as their fuel source and built a new $83 million (equivalent to $ in ) animal feed dryer to meet the new emissions requirements. The company claimed that, by 2018, these projects would reduce overall pollution by 87%.

Environmental improvements from GPC and other businesses in the area allowed EPA&#x27;s Muscatine County SO2 Nonattainment Area, which includes all of the City of Muscatine, to be re-classified to attainment status for EPA&#x27;s 1-hour SO2 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) on October 4, 2018. The actions required to achieve attainment status resulted in a reduction of over 10,000 lbs of SO2 emissions per year.

The Muscatine Area Resource Recovery for Vehicles and Energy program (MARRVE) is building a food waste collection station for the anaerobic digesters at the municipal wastewater facility. The first phase of MARRVE began operating in December 2019. MARRVE processes between 25 and 30 tons of food waste per day. MARRVE will generate biogas for vehicles and biosolids for fertilizer, while also reducing local methane emissions.

<text>Nichols is a city in Muscatine County, Iowa, United States. The population was 340 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Muscatine Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Name==
The original name of the site of the current town was &quot;Railroad Addition&quot;. The town was later referred to as &quot;Nichols Station&quot; in reference to the previous holder of the town&#x27;s site. Nichols was named by the early settler Benjamin F. Nichols in honor of his father, Samuel Nichols, who was instrumental in bringing the railroad to the area. Samuel Nichols was a heavy investor in the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad Company as well as owner of large landholdings. Samuel Nichols had given the rail company the right of way to construct the rail line across his land, as well as to establish a depot at the current site of Nichols.

==History==
Nichols was established in the early 1870s in an area of Section 15 of Pike Township known locally as Elephant Swamp. The community was intended as a rail town for the shipment of agriculture products and furs to distant markets, and had been constructed on land donated to the rail company by Samuel and Benjamin Nichols with the intention of establishing a rail depot. The lots for the future community were surveyed by county surveyor George Bumgardner in June 1871. Two rail lines would eventually run through the town – the Muscatine &amp; Western Railroad and the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railroad – which were both branches of the Rock Island system. The first rail line and rail depot was constructed in the early 1870s. Dr. S. H. Smith constructed the first building on the future site of Nichols in 1871, which Mr Smith used as both a drug store and as a home. Construction on the Muscatine &amp; Western Railroad reached the site in 1873, and the rail company laid out an addition to the town, calling it Railroad Addition. At first many of the buildings and homes in the community were log cabins, which were then replaced by more permanent brick buildings. Benjamin Nichols established the first post office in 1870 and served as the first postmaster. The first school was built in 1872. In the winter of 1873-1874 a Christian church was organized with services being held in schoolhouses until the construction of the church in 1874, with services being conducted by Rev. John Powell. The German Evangelical Protestant Church was organized in 1874 by Rev. K. F. Obermann. The Catholic church – Church of St. Mary - was built in 1874 with Father Nicholas Dugan serving as its first pastor. A Methodist church was organized in 1875 by J. A. Bolton. The town soon grew with the addition of several banks, an opera house, and a town hall that was constructed in 1897. The early economy of the community centered on the two rail lines that ran through the community as well as the buying and shipping of furs as well as agriculture. The Foley and Brugman Brothers operated two large grain elevators which held 15,000 bushels each. Cattle and hogs were also shipped out to markets through the rail lines.

On September 18, 2020, Nichols&#x27; central business district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Ijem Avenue Commercial Historic District.

==Geography==
Nichols is located at (41.479113, -91.308291) in section 15 of Pike Township, situated in the western edge of Iowa&#x27;s Muscatine County. The area is a mix of prairie and rich bottom land.

West Liberty High School was ranked Eighth (#8) Best High School in Iowa, according to the US News &quot;Best High Schools 2013 Rankings.&quot;

=== Dual Language Program ===

International Spanish Academies are recognized by the Ministry of Education and the Government of Spain. The WLCSD Dual language Program allows students to take all of their classes in both Spanish and English, increasing their bilingual skills and their understanding of another culture through language immersion. Students enter the program in pre-kindergarten and parents make a commitment on behalf of their child and themselves to participate in the program through fifth grade.

The WLCSD Dual Language Program was the first of its kind in the State of Iowa. It began in the fall of 1997 when the district received a five-year $1.7 million federal grant from the United States Department of Education. After a year of planning and model analysis, the program was implemented in the fall of 1998 at the pre-kindergarten and kindergarten grade levels. From 1999 through 2002, the district added grade levels as the first class advanced through each grade. In the spring of 2011, the first graduating class of Seniors marked the final establishment of the dual language program in all K-12 grade levels.

<doc id="114106" wikidata="Q646487" url="?curid=114106" title="Primghar, Iowa">
<text>Primghar is a city in, and the county seat of, O&#x27;Brien County, Iowa, United States. The population was 896 at the time of the 2020 census. Primghar is 23.5 miles south of Iowa State Highway 9, 28 miles east of Sioux Center and 6.75 miles north of Iowa State Highway 10.

==History==
In a brief history of O&#x27;Brien County, Arthur M. Schierholz states: &quot;the courthouse location in (the county of) O&#x27;Brien in the extreme southeast corner of the county became a growing issue. To resolve the matter, an election was held on November 11, 1872, to determine the location of the courthouse.&quot; A total of 360 votes were cast, with 307 voting to move the courthouse to the exact geographical center of the county. Another historian wrote, &quot;Probably the only case in Iowa, perhaps anywhere, where a bare spot of raw prairie was actually voted to be the county seat.&quot; This eventually became the town of Primghar. The present O&#x27;Brien County Courthouse was completed in 1917. The name Primghar was received from the first letter of eight people who had a major part in platting the town.

==Geography==
Primghar is located at (43.087722, -95.627892).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Roads and highways===
The only major highway that passes through Primghar is U.S. 59, going north–south. B40 road runs east–west through the town.

===Topography===
Primghar lies at an elevation of 1520 feet. This area of northwest Iowa is gently rolling. Today, fields are marred by few boggy areas and much of the land is terraced to reduce erosion. Until fill was hauled in, the south side of the courthouse square was a &quot;boggy, muddy slough.&quot; When the first settlers arrived, there were few trees and almost without exception prairie grass grew to six foot.

In the immediate vicinity of Primghar the topsoils and subsoils are silty clay loam. (Galva, Marcus, Primghar, and Sac soils by name.) Clay loam glacial till is at a depth of 30 to 60 inches in most places. There are no mineral assets of commercial value, save rock and gravel. Back in 1873 this dearth of underground wealth was yet to be decided. There was a $1000 reward posted for anyone finding mineable coal reserves. No one claimed the prize.

There is an abandoned rock quarry, one mile south-southeast of Primghar, which was donated by the Tjossem family to Primghar in 1989 and is now known as Tjossem Park, a fishing area and public picnic/camp ground.
