<text>Ehrenberg, also historically spelled &quot;Ehrenburg&quot;, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in La Paz County, Arizona, United States. The population was 1,470 at the 2010 census. Ehrenberg is named for its founder, Herman Ehrenberg.

Ehrenberg is located on the Colorado River, which forms the border with Riverside County, California, near the city of Blythe. It is situated close to Interstate 10, at the southern end of the Parker Valley and next to the Palo Verde Valley.

==History==
In 1863, German mining engineer Herman Ehrenberg was hired to survey a new townsite along the Colorado River, approximately from La Paz, Arizona. The town, named Mineral City, began to grow in 1866, after a new landing was established there, supported by the steamboat captains of the George A. Johnson Company. Mineral City attracted miners and many businessmen away from La Paz and by September 20, 1869, had grown large enough to win a post office. The same year it was renamed &quot;Ehrenberg&quot;.

Over the next several years the town continued to grow, surpassing La Paz. By 1875 there were 500 residents. The population of La Paz dwindled, and many storekeepers relocated to Ehrenberg.

Around the start of the 20th century, railroads began to bypass the river as the major means of transporting goods. The town&#x27;s population declined, and it lost its post office on December 31, 1913.

Many of the surviving older buildings in town were torn down in the 1950s to make way for a trailer park.

<text>Parker (Mojave &#x27;Amat Kuhwely, formerly &#x27;Ahwe Nyava) is the county seat of La Paz County, Arizona, United States, on the Colorado River in Parker Valley. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,417.

==History==
Founded in 1908, the town was named after Ely Parker, the first Native American commissioner for the U.S. government. The original town site of Parker was surveyed and laid out in 1909 by Earl H. Parker, a railroad location engineer for the Arizona &amp; California Railway. The town officially incorporated in 1948 and became the county seat for the newly created La Paz County on January 1, 1983.

===Camp Colorado and Parkers Landing===
The town&#x27;s name and origin began when a post office called Parker was established January 6, 1871, at Parker&#x27;s Landing and the site of the Parker Indian Agency, named for Ely Parker, on the Colorado River Indian Reservation, four miles downriver from the site of the railroad bridge of the modern town, to serve the Indian agency. What became Parkers Landing was established on the river as the place to land and pick up cargo and personnel for the Indian Agency and the U. S. Army detachment that was stationed there at Camp Colorado from 1864 to 1869, during the first years of the Reservation. Camp Colorado was abandoned after sparks from the departing steamboat Cocopah rapidly burned down the brush huts of the officers of the garrison, and endangered its barracks and storehouses.

==Geography==
The city is on the Colorado River just south of the Headgate Rock Dam and Moovalya Lake. Arizona State Route 95 and California State Route 62 (across the Colorado River) serve the city.

<text>Avondale is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, adjacent to Phoenix. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 89,334, up from 76,238 in 2010 and 35,883 in 2000.

Avondale, incorporated in 1946, has experienced rapid residential and commercial growth in the years since 1980. Once primarily a sparsely populated farming community with many acres of alfalfa and cotton fields, Avondale has transformed into a major bedroom suburb for Phoenix.

==History==
William &quot;Billy&quot; G. Moore, arrived in Arizona in the late 1860s, settling near the Agua Fria River in 1880. Moore called bought land and named his settlement &quot;Coldwater, Arizona&quot; - apparently for both the river and the water that flowed from a local spring. He served a brief stint as Justice of the Peace for the Agua Fria area. He eventually established a stage stop near Agua Fria crossing, the Coldwater Stage Station in the 1880s. The state station was one of the very earliest stage stations in the region, supplying travelers with provisions on their way from Tucson to northern Arizona and California. A saloon and a general store were also built, bringing in more commerce for the settlement.

The post office was established in 1896 at a site near Avondale Ranch. From 1901 until 1905, William Moore served as Postmaster of the Coldwater post office. The post office eventually became known as Avondale, taking the name of the nearby ranch, and the name Coldwater was discontinued. In December 1946, the City of Avondale was incorporated.

Subsequent development resulted in a conglomeration of styles and architecture along Western Avenue typical of small western towns, with ranching, the railroad, and cotton farming as the main industries. Recently, the city has seen tremendous growth in new development, both residential and commercial, while the Old Town area along Western Avenue preserves the historic business district and safeguards opportunities for small, independent businesses.

Avondale is a modern city, near the heart of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Over the last decade, population growth took place at a rate of over 114%, making the city one of the fastest-growing in Maricopa County.

==Geography==
Avondale is located at (33.435322, −112.349758). It is bordered to the west by Goodyear, to the north by Litchfield Park, and to the east by Phoenix and Tolleson.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.54%, are water. The Gila River crosses the southern part of the city, joined from the north by the Agua Fria River.

Interstate 10 crosses the northern part of Avondale, with access from exits 129 through 133A. The freeway leads east to Downtown Phoenix and west to Blythe, California.

===Climate===
Avondale has a large amount of sunshine year-round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, the city has a Hot desert climate, abbreviated &quot;Bwh&quot; on climate maps.

Winters are sunny and mild with nighttime lows averaging between and 50 °F (4 °C and 10 °C) and daytime highs ranging from to 75 °F (16 °C to 24 °C). The record low temperature recorded in Avondale is 16 °F (−9 °C). Summers are extremely hot, with daily high temperatures at or above 100 °F (38 °C) for the entirety of June, July, and August, as well as many days in May and September. An occasional heat wave will spike temperatures over 115 °F (46 °C) briefly. Nighttime lows in the summer months average between and 80 °F (21 °C and 27 °C), with an occasional overnight low above 80 °F (27 °C) not uncommon. Avondale&#x27;s record high temperature stands at an impressive 125 °F (52 °C), a few degrees warmer than the record for Phoenix, and just shy of Arizona&#x27;s state record of 128 °F (53 °C), recorded in Lake Havasu City on June 29, 1994.

Snow is rare in the area, occurring once every several years. Lows in the winter occasionally dip below freezing, which may damage some desert plants such as saguaros and other cacti. In the summer (mainly July, August, and early September), the North American Monsoon can hit the Phoenix area in the afternoon and evening (possibly continuing overnight), causing rain showers even from a sunny morning. Dust storms are occasional, mainly during the summer.

===Gila and Salt River Meridian===

The surveying marker of the Gila and Salt River Meridian is located on Monument Hill. Ever since 1851, this has been the center point used by the state to measure the land in Arizona. The federal government recognized this point for measuring the boundary between the United States and Mexico after the Mexican–American War ended. The first survey, conducted in 1867, involved the first of Arizona. Up until 1874, this was the epicenter of all surveying in Arizona for property deeds. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 2002, Reference #02001137. Monument Hill is located at 115th Avenue and Baseline Road in Avondale.

<text>Buckeye is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. It is Arizona&#x27;s second-largest city by area, and it is the westernmost suburb in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 91,502, up from 50,876 in 2010, and 6,537 in 2000. It was the fastest-growing city in the United States for 2017, 2018, and 2021.

==History==
The Buckeye area was first inhabited by the Hohokam culture. In 1877, Thomas Newt Clanton led a group of six men, three women, and ten children from Creston, Iowa, to Arizona, where they settled in the Buckeye area.

Early settler Malie M. Jackson developed of the Buckeye Canal from 1884 to 1886, which he named after his home state of Ohio&#x27;s moniker, &quot;The Buckeye State&quot;. The town was founded in 1888 and originally named &quot;Sidney&quot;, after Jackson&#x27;s hometown in Ohio. However, because of the significance of the canal, the town became known as Buckeye. The name was legally changed to Buckeye in 1910. The town was incorporated in 1929, at which time it included . The town&#x27;s first mayor was Hugh M. Watson (1956–1958), who founded the Buckeye Valley Bank. Today, Watson Road is the site of the city&#x27;s commercial center.

In 2008, Buckeye was featured on &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; as part of a week-long series entitled &quot;Blueprint America&quot;.

A vote to designate the town as the City of Buckeye became effective in 2014.

In May 2019, population estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau placed Buckeye as the fastest growing city in the United States by percentage from 2017–2018, growing by 8.5%.

==Geography==
Buckeye is located approximately west of downtown Phoenix in the Buckeye Valley. Interstate 10 passes through the central part of the city, north of the original town center. U.S. Route 80 once passed through the city, while Arizona State Route 85 skirts what was the city&#x27;s west edge. The city limits now extend to the north and to the south of the original town center.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.04%, were listed as water. The Gila River flows westward through the Buckeye Valley south of the center of the city. The Buckeye Hills and Little Rainbow Valley are to the south, beyond which the city limits extend as far as Margies Peak. To the north the city limits include the southern part of the White Tank Mountains and continue north nearly as far as City of Surprise. The Hassayampa River, a tributary of the Gila, flows southward through the northern part of the Buckeye city limits.

Soils in Buckeye are alkaline and mostly well drained loam or clay loam except in northern neighborhoods such as Verrado, where gravelly sand or sandy loam with varying degrees of excessive drainage are common.

The record high temperature of occurred on July 28, 1995, and temperatures above may occur in any month. Cooler weather may occasionally occur during summer, but such periods are no less unpleasant as they result from monsoonal weather, with its attendant higher cloudiness and humidity; however, actual rainfall from the monsoon is much more infrequent than in Flagstaff, Nogales or even Tucson. The heaviest daily rainfall has been on September 2, 1894, but between 1971 and 2000 no month had more rainfall than in December 1984.

The winter season from November to March is warm to very warm during the day, not much cooler than during a typical afternoon, but 20.2 mornings typically fall to or below , though no snowfall was recorded during the 1971 to 2000 period, and only twelve afternoons did not reach .

==Geography and climate==
Carefree is in northeastern Maricopa County, bordered by the city of Scottsdale to the south and east and by the town of Cave Creek to the west. Carefree and Cave Creek are sometimes thought of as a single community. The two towns share the local landmark Black Mountain, which rises more than above them, to an elevation of .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.05%, are listed as water.

Carefree has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) with hot summers and mild winters, avoiding a designation of arid by being located closer to the rain-catching central mountains of Arizona, so that it receives about 70 percent (around ) more rainfall annually than does Phoenix. There are 141 afternoons annually with highs of at least , 63.4 afternoons of at least , and three afternoons that exceed . During the winter, 8.3 mornings will fall below freezing; the coldest temperature reported in Carefree is , which occurred on January 13, 1963, and January 7, 1971.

==Sites of interest==

The Carefree sundial, designed by architect Joe Wong and solar engineer John I. Yellott, was erected in the Sundial Circle plaza in 1959 and claims to be the &quot;third largest sundial in the Western Hemisphere&quot;. The sundial, which points to the North Star, is made from a steel frame and covered in anodized copper. It measures in diameter. The metal gnomon, the shadow-casting portion of the dial, stands above the plaza and extends .

Carefree was the long-time home of Southwestern Studios, originally built in 1968 as Fred Graham Studios by actor, stunt man, and Arizona Film Commissioner Fred Graham. The sprawling desert property adjacent to North Scottsdale featured three state-of-the-art soundstages, edit bays, 35mm screening room, make-up, production facilities, western street and backlot. In the early 1970s, Stage 1 of the studio was used for &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; starring Dick Van Dyke, Hope Lange, Fannie Flagg, and Marty Brill. Stage 1 also was used for the filming of one of Orson Welles&#x27; last films, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, with John Huston, Oja Kodar, Susan Strasberg, Bob Random and Peter Bogdanovich.

The studio was used for the filming of Bob Hope&#x27;s last feature film, &quot;Cancel My Reservation&quot;, with Eva Marie Saint, Ralph Bellamy, and Forrest Tucker. Scenes were also shot in Carefree and at the studio for Michaelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, on the back lot, where a mock-up of the Carefree mansion was built and then exploded. The studio was also used for Paul Newman&#x27;s scenes in &quot;Pocket Money&quot;, for Bill Cosby&#x27;s feature debut, &quot;Man and Boy&quot;, for which the western street was built, and for &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, again the western street. The short, silent feature &quot;Time River&quot; was shot on Stages 2 and 3 and extensively on the back lot and western street sets.

Southwestern Studios was also used in television productions. In 1973–74, local resident Hugh Downs produced and hosted two pilot episodes for a unique show, &quot;Foursome&quot;, that was both a game show and talk show, where four celebrities came together to play various games and interact with each other. In one episode, actors Janet Leigh and Robert Culp and comedians Jo Anne Worley and Alan Sues played a game of tennis. In the other episode, shot on Stage 3, dancer-singer-actor Ann Miller, Robert Culp, Jo Anne Worley, and Alan Sues played a popular board game. In 1974, Southwestern Studios was the location on Stage 2 and the back lot for the filming of the TV movie, &quot;McMasters of Sweetwater&quot;, starring Jack Cassidy and Loretta Ball and directed by Robert Butler.

Later renamed Carefree Studios, the studio was razed in 1999. The studio, western street, and pristine desert back lot property was developed into retail space and residential development.

Gordon Lightfoot wrote and sang a song named &quot;Carefree Highway&quot;. He took the name from a section of Arizona State Route 74 in north Phoenix, to explain his mood at that time. The highway runs from the foot of (North) Tom Darlington Drive at the South-West corner of Carefree about 30 miles westward to Lake Pleasant Parkway in Peoria, AZ.

==Education==
The town is served by Cave Creek Unified School District.

==Transportation==
Arizona State Route 74 runs along the south border of Carefree. Cave Creek Road runs along the east edge of Carefree, then curves and becomes an east-west road through Carefree.

<text>Chandler is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, and a suburb in the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the fourth-most populous city in Arizona, after Mesa, Tucson, and Phoenix. Chandler is considered to be a part of the East Valley.

As of the 2020 census, the population of Chandler was 275,987, up from 236,123 at the 2010 census. Chandler is a commercial and tech hub for corporations like Intel, Northrop Grumman, Wells Fargo, PayPal and Boeing.

== History ==
In 1891, Dr. Alexander John Chandler, a Canadian and the first veterinary surgeon in the Arizona Territory, settled on a ranch south of Mesa and studied irrigation engineering. By 1900, he had acquired of land and began drawing up plans for a town-site on what was then known as the Chandler Ranch. The town-site office opened on May 16, 1912.

The original town-site was bounded by Galveston Street to the north, Frye Road to the south, Hartford Street to the west, and Hamilton Street to the east. By 1913, a town center was established, featuring the Hotel San Marcos, which also had the first grass golf course in the state. Chandler High School was established in 1914. Chandler was officially incorporated on February 16, 1920, after 186 residents petitioned the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to approve incorporation.

Most of Chandler&#x27;s economy was sustained during the Great Depression (though the Depression was to blame for the cancellation of a second San Marcos hotel), but the cotton crash a few years later had a much deeper impact on the city&#x27;s residents. A. J. Chandler lost his San Marcos hotel to creditors as a result. Later, the founding of Williams Air Force Base in 1941 led to a small surge in population, but Chandler still only held 3,800 people by 1950.

By 1980, the population had grown to 30,000, and it has since paced the Phoenix metropolitan area&#x27;s high rate of growth, with suburban residential areas and commercial use areas swallowing former agricultural plots. The population has nearly doubled in the last twenty years. Some of this growth was fueled by the establishment of manufacturing plants for communications and computing firms such as Microchip, Motorola and Intel.

<text>El Mirage is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 35,805, up from 31,797 in 2010.

==History==
The Hohokam Native American tribe were the earliest inhabitants of the area that is now El Mirage. The ingenious Hohokam developed an elaborate irrigation network using only stone instruments and organized labor. They were commonly known as the &quot;Canal Builders&quot;.

During the early 1930s, migrant farm workers settled in El Mirage on the west bank of the Agua Fria River. Mexican migrants came to El Mirage to help build the canals and harvest the first crops. Farming and agriculture remain central to El Mirage&#x27;s economy, but it has witnessed a robust industrial growth over the past few decades, emerging as a diverse urban community. 

In 1977, the city annexed 2,000 acres of land for a proposed planned community with apartments, shopping centers, and industrial development. Immediately following this announcement Attorney General Bruce Babbitt, sued in an attempt to undo this annexation due to its proximity to Luke Air Force Base. The lawsuit failed, but prompted the cities of Glendale and Goodyear to work together to buy land surrounding the base to stop any further annexations.  

In the early eighties, El Mirage announced its plans for economic redevelopment. The city planned to build more housing but the centerpiece of the plan was a $20 million resort and convention center, along with a golf course. A spring training baseball stadium, medical center, and auto mall were also pitched for the area. The proposed redevelopment sat, however, only five miles north from the Air Force base’s runway. Once again officials from Luke Air Force Base and other government officials began to raise concerns and turn public opinion against the project. City officials travelled to Washington D.C. to fight the land use disputes, arguing that the base had known about the land acquisitions leading to the redevelopment plans and could have raised concerns before it spent the money purchasing land and making deals with companies. Ultimately, nothing would be built on the land largely due to the concerns from Luke AFB. As a result of all of this, in 2009 when Luke Air Force Base was bidding to get the new F-35 fighter jets, El Mirage was an outlier among local cities. While many cities stood behind the Air Force base’s bid wanting to keep the base operational, El Mirage voiced its opinion against the facility.  The city believed that the base had hurt its financial potential and would continue doing so. 

The city became an incorporated town on June 25, 1951. The city held a special election to become a city in 1983, and has continued to grow since.

==Arts and culture==

===The Fountain===
Fountain Hills has the world&#x27;s fourth-tallest fountain, and the second tallest in the United States. It was built in 1970 in Zürich by Robert P. McCulloch, the year before the reconstruction of the London Bridge in Lake Havasu City, another of McCulloch&#x27;s projects. The fountain sprays water for about 15 minutes every hour on the hour between 9am and 9pm. The plume rises from a concrete water-lily sculpture in the center of a large man-made lake. The fountain, driven by three turbine pumps, sprays water at a rate of per minute through an nozzle. With all three pumps under ideal conditions, the fountain reaches in height, though in normal operation only two of the pumps are used, with a fountain height of around . When built it was the world&#x27;s tallest fountain, a record it held for over a decade.

The Town of Fountain Hills has partnered with EarthCam to bring live streaming views of its world-famous fountain. The live stream camera can be accessed on the Experience Fountain Hills website.
To help celebrate the fountain&#x27;s 50th year, the town installed a new LED lighting system with four lights mounted directly under the fountain and six lights on the shore for a total of 10 lights to provide ample lighting and still meet the Dark Skies regulations.
=== International Dark Sky Community ===

In January 2018, the town of Fountain Hills was designated an International Dark Sky Community by the International Dark Sky Association. The town is one of only two International Dark Sky Communities located near a large metropolitan area. , 34 communities in the world have earned the Community designation, among Dark Sky Reserves, Parks, and Sanctuaries. The Fountain Hills Dark Sky Association (FHDSA) worked with town council and town staff to change outdoor lighting and sign ordinances to address light pollution. This designation is a result of both geography and lighting ordinances. The community is shielded from the lights of the larger cities in the Phoenix metro region by the McDowell Mountains to the west. The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation to the east, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community to the south, and the McDowell Mountain Regional Park all help the town preserve its dark skies. The absence of street lights and the presence of only low-impact outdoor lighting creates an outstanding environment for stargazing. The Fountain Hills Dark Sky Association is currently working to develop a International Dark Sky Discovery Center that will include a Dark Sky Observatory, Hyperspace Planetarium, Inspiration Theater, and an Immersion Zone. Fountain Hills was the home to Charles W. Juels&#x27; Fountain Hills Observatory , where 475 asteroids were discovered between 1999 and 2003, including 20898 Fountainhills.

==Events==
The town hosts a number of events each year at Fountain Park, including three large art fairs: the Spring Fountain Festival of Fine Arts and Crafts and the Fall Fountain Festival of Fine Arts and Crafts, both presented by the Fountain Hills Chamber of Commerce. Each year, the town hosts a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration in which the town&#x27;s fountain is dyed green. The Greening of the Fountain tradition began in 1979. Other signature events include a 4th of July celebration, an annual Music Fest, Irish Fest, and Concours in the Hills — a car show which featured over 1,000 vehicles and 50,000 attendees in February 2024.
== Arts ==
Fountain Hills is home to one of the largest public art collections in Arizona. The art collection, which features over 150 pieces, is part of a partnership between the Town of Fountains Hills and the Public Art Committee of the Fountain Hills Cultural and Civic Association. Art is a significant part of the Town&#x27;s heritage. The eight fountains along the Avenue of the Fountains were the beginning of the public art collection. Bronze sculptures and fountains with Community Profile themes ranging from the whimsical to the serious dot the streets and adorn the public buildings, plazas and parks. The collection also contains a wide variety of other art types and media, including paintings, stone, photography and metals. Residents and visitors are invited to wander the streets or take the &quot;Art Walk&quot; guided tour.

Fountain Hills Theater is a performing arts venue entering its 28th season and offering over 16 productions a year to local communities as well as performing an arts education year-round for youth.

<text>Gila Bend (; O&#x27;odham: Hila Wi:n), founded in 1872, is a town in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. The town is named for an approximately 90-degree bend in the Gila River, which is near the community&#x27;s current location. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 1,892.

Just outside the town is the San Lucy district (O&#x27;odham: Weco Cekṣanĭ) of the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation, with a small settlement, San Lucy (O&#x27;odham: Si:l Mek) bordering the town itself.

==History==
=== Oyadaibuc ===
The town of Gila Bend is situated near an ancient Hohokam village. Father Eusebio Francisco Kino was the first European to visit, arriving in 1699 on his first journey of exploration to the Colorado River. The Hohokam site along the fertile banks of the Gila River had been abandoned, and other tribes lived in the vicinity. 132 Pima people lived in a ranchería called &quot;Oyadaibuc&quot;, or as Kino named it &quot;San Felipe y Santiago del Oyadaibuc&quot;, near the modern town, and other Pima lived in three rancherias up river to the north mixed with the Cocomaricopa or Opa. During one of his three visits to Gila Bend, Kino counted 960 Opas living in their own rancherias down river to the west of Oyadaibuc as far as a few miles beyond Agua Caliente. The Opa and Pima used the flood waters of the river to irrigate their crops.

Oyadaibuc was also visited by Juan Bautista de Anza, commander of the Presidio at Tubac and founder of the city of San Francisco, and by Father Francisco Tomas Garces in 1774. As late as the 1820s Maricopa were living at Gila Bend. After the 1820s, the Maricopa, under relentless pressure from the Yuma and other tribes, and population loss from epidemics, were compelled to leave the Gila Bend and join the Pima in the Middle Gila region. By the time of the California Gold Rush, the Maricopa villages were all located east of the Sierra Estrella, on the Gila River, below the Pima Villages.

===Tezotal===
During the Mexican–American War, the expeditions of Kearny (1846), Cooke (1847) and Graham (1847) passed through the area but found no village. Only Graham found corn stubble on the riverside with which to graze his cattle. From 1849, what became the Southern Emigrant Trail passed through the area, which by 1854 had acquired the name &quot;Tezotal&quot; or &quot;Tesotal&quot;, from the scientific name of the desert ironwood tree (&quot;Olneya tesota&quot;), given it in the botanical report of the Boundary Survey along the Gila River led by William H. Emory.

===Gila Ranch===
From 1857, the place at was named &quot;Gila Ranch&quot; and was a stagecoach water and camping stop on the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line. In 1858. as &quot;Gila Ranch Station&quot;, it was a stage station on the more famous Butterfield Overland Mail route to California. Gila Bend Station was located east of Murderer&#x27;s Grave Station and west of Maricopa Wells Station across the waterless Forty Mile Desert. In 1859, Desert Station was established with its own well on West Prong Waterman Wash, roughly midway across the Forty Mile Desert. Also two tanks were established, one midway between Desert Station and Gila Ranch and the other midway between Desert Station and Maricopa Wells stations, to water the horses. The two riverside stations carried the water to supply these tanks. In 1860 the Gila Ranch station was burned down, but soon rebuilt. In 1861, the Butterfield line shut down, but during the American Civil War Gila Ranch remained a stop for freighters to and from the riverport of Arizona City on the Colorado River, passing travelers, the troops of the Confederate Army that briefly passed through and then the California Column of the Union Army that invaded Confederate Arizona and occupied New Mexico Territory in 1862.

===Gila Bend===
After the Civil War, from 1866 other stage routes were established in the Arizona Territory, and the Gila Ranch Station again was an active stage station. A settlement, Gila Bend, grew up around it from 1865 and acquired a post office at the station on May 1, 1871. Stage and freight routes, especially from the mining camps and boom towns in central Arizona, converged here especially after the railroad arrived in 1879. In 1880, after wells had been drilled by the railroad near their Gila Bend station (that was located away from the river), the population began to move to settle at a new town south-southwest of the old one near the station. Among the first to move was the postmaster at the old stage station, now postmaster of the new town.

The nickname the &quot;Crossroads of the Southwest&quot; stems from the area having been part of an important transportation route in the settling, development and growth of the American Southwest. Gila Bend was the &quot;center of a wheel&quot;, with spokes leading in many directions.

A more recent event in the area was the October 1995 sabotage of the Amtrak &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; train.

On December 14, 2006, Volkswagen of America, Inc., leased of land at a cost of $55 million for 25 years, west of Gila Bend, on which they plan to develop a new automobile proving ground.
Gila Bend enjoys a minor notability among tourists and aficionados of roadside attractions. Besides the quirky welcome sign, the town boasts several roadside sculptures and the Space Age Lodge motel and restaurant (opened in 1963), named for its &quot;Space Age&quot; themed architecture and decor.

In 2010 Abengoa Solar secured a US$1.45 Billion loan guarantee to build a large 280 megawatt concentrated solar power plant in Gila Bend. It was estimated that the project would employ a peak of 1,500 workers, with an operational permanent employment of approximately 85 workers. The Solana Generating Station began providing power for Arizona Public Service in 2013.

<text>Gilbert is a town in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. Located southeast of Phoenix, Gilbert is home to 288,128 residents. It is the fifth-largest municipality in Arizona. Nearly a third of Gilbert residents are under the age of 18. As Gilbert approaches buildout, the population is expected to reach 330,000.

Incorporated on July 6, 1920, Gilbert was once known as the &quot;Hay Shipping Capital of the World&quot;. It has since transformed into an economically diverse suburban community, characterized by a strong economy, competitive schools, and safe neighborhoods. Gilbert is home to many companies with focuses on advanced manufacturing, aerospace and defense, biotechnology, clean technology, and renewable energy. In 2023, it was declared one of the fastest-growing communities in the nation.

==History==
Gilbert was established by William &quot;Bobby&quot; Gilbert, who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer&#x27;s Grocery Store, Gilbert&#x27;s first store, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it stands today. In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the Mormon colonies in Mexico due to the actions of Pancho Villa&#x27;s forces settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.

Incorporated on July 6, 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals. It remained an agricultural town for many years and was known as the &quot;Hay Capital of the World&quot; from 1911 until the late 1920s.

Gilbert Town Hall is home to a 9/11 Memorial that features an eight-foot steel girder beam that held up the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Former Gilbert Fire Chief Collin DeWitt raised money for three years to create the memorial and bring the beam from New York City to Arizona. He drove to collect it himself along with then Assistant Fire Chief Jim Jobusch.

The memorial&#x27;s design angles the beam, putting it in reach of everyone. Four granite walls bear the names of those killed in the attacks.

<text>Glendale () is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. Located about nine miles northwest of the state capital Phoenix, Glendale is known for State Farm Stadium, which is the home of the Arizona Cardinals football team. The city also contains the Arrowhead Towne Center shopping mall. As of the 2020 census, Glendale had a population of 248,325.

==History==
In the late 1800s the area that is now Glendale was all desert. William John Murphy, a native of New Hartford, New York, who resided in the town of Flagstaff in what was then the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building the Arizona Canal from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land. Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.

In 1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy raised capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses. Murphy decided to refer to this land as &quot;Glendale&quot;. In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from Phoenix to Glendale and ending in the town of Peoria by building an diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue.

In 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town&#x27;s ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots. It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west. The construction of a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue. The railroad allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive building materials.

The construction and commercial applications of the Beet Sugar Factory in 1906 also contributed to the growth of Glendale. Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in the city. Several other businesses were founded around this time such as Glendale Ice Company, Pacific Creamery Company, Glendale Milling Company, and Southwest Flour and Feed.

World War I ushered in a renewal for Glendale, with cotton prices rising throughout the period. Cotton continues to be a source of economic prosperity in Glendale with many farms still along the Loop 101, despite many farmers switching to more profitable crops. A high demand for food, also kept farmers busy. Numerous farms and orchards were established and thrived through the early 1900s.

World War II brought the birth of Thunderbird Field to train civilian pilots for the Army. In late 1940, a few Hollywood actors and businessmen, headed by Leland Hayward, approached the Army to establish a primary flight training school. This group chose the site of Thunderbird Field primarily because of its abundance of space, excellent weather, and good visibility. While this field was being built in 1941, the Army was busy working on a larger base for $4.5 million, Luke Field (now Luke Air Force Base). This base was named for the first pilot to receive a Medal of Honor, Lt. Frank Luke Jr. Thunderbird Field would later become the Thunderbird American Graduate School for International Management.

The military and college presence, as well as the increase in population (nearly doubling between 1950 and 1960), sparked a need for utilities, parks, schools and streets. Over the next 40 years, the city added a landfill, water treatment plant, sewage plants, libraries, parks, public safety facilities, an airport, a city hall and a civic center. In the 1970s, Glendale practiced strip annexation to claim future territory to annex that another city couldn&#x27;t claim. Current strip borders are along Northern Avenue, Peoria Avenue, Perryville Road, and Camelback Road.

Arrowhead Towne Center opened in 1993, and the surrounding neighborhood, Arrowhead Ranch, made the area a hotspot for housing and shopping. The completion of Loop 101 throughout Glendale opened the city to the rest of the Valley.

In recent decades, the city has begun major investment into tourism. The establishment of the Westgate Entertainment District, housing Desert Diamond Arena, and State Farm Stadium in the early 2000s made Glendale a destination for locals and visitors. Construction of the VAI Resort and Mattel Adventure Park, scheduled to open in 2025, will continue to grow Glendale’s tourism economy creating hundreds of new jobs and proving more than a thousand new hotel rooms for the city. The completion of Loop 303 in 2011 also resulted in an increase in industrial development.

In 2024, the city called on the Department of Defense to lobby for Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs to veto bipartisan legislation to increase housing supply in Arizona. Ryan Lee, the city’s intergovernmental-programs director, confirmed to &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that he was behind the move. State Representative Analise Ortiz, whose district includes parts of Glendale, criticized the city for going behind legislators&#x27; back to lobby against the legislation, &quot;This is not the way we typically go about creating policy.&quot;

<text>Goodyear is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. It is a suburb of Phoenix and at the 2020 census had a population of 95,294, up from 65,275 in 2010 and 18,911 in 2000. It was the third-fastest-growing city in Arizona between 1990 and 2000.

The city is home to the Goodyear Ballpark, where the Cleveland Guardians and Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball hold spring training.

In 2008, Goodyear won the All-America City Award, sponsored by the National Civic League. The city is named after the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The company cultivated extensive farmland here to grow cotton for use in its tires.

==History==
Goodyear was established in 1917 with the purchase of of land by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to cultivate cotton for vehicle tire cords. World War II was important to Goodyear in the 1940s as the current Phoenix Goodyear Airport was built, but after the war, the economy suffered. Goodyear became a town on November 19, 1946. At the time, it had 151 homes and 250 apartments, a grocery store, a barber shop, beauty shop and a gas station.

===World War II===
Luke Field Auxiliary #6 (Goodyear Field) was built by the United States Army Air Forces in 1943. It served as a satellite airfield for Luke Army Air Field (AAF). According to the &quot;History of Luke AFB&quot;, this airfield boasted the most facilities. It had separate buildings for crew chiefs, operations, supply, barracks, pit latrine, crash truck shed, generator shed and a control tower. Luke AF Auxiliary #6 ceased operations by 1971.

The property, which is in a state of complete abandonment, is owned by the State of Arizona, which has worked with developers on proposals for use.

===Modern history===
In January 1965, the Phoenix Trotting Park, a harness racing track, opened. The current Interstate 10 passes north of the site. As the region lacked major roads from Phoenix to Goodyear, there was not enough business and the track closed two years later. The park was demolished in 2017.

The town became a city in 1985. In the same decade, the remaining of the original farmland was sold for future development. The Phoenix Goodyear Airport received its current name in 1986.

====Housing and growth====

Although Goodyear was founded in 1917, the majority of construction and population growth happened after 1990. 22 communities that are completed and under construction have a total area of approximately . These communities, along with another 21 communities for future suburban development, will contain almost 200,000 homes, with only 25,000 built.

Goodyear was affected by the 2000s American housing bubble, reducing home values. Since then, the housing market has rebounded considerably. According to Opendoor, ZIP code 85338 in Goodyear was the fifth most popular place in the Phoenix metro area to buy a home, based on home sales. There are also a variety of home options in 2019 to accommodate families, those who are single, and seniors. As the population in Goodyear grows faster than ever, home builders and community developers are working quickly to keep up with the demand.

Estrella is the largest community in Goodyear, at . The master-planned community is home to about 10,000 residents. Palm Valley, located north of Interstate 10, is , with variously sized homes. PebbleCreek is a community for active adult living, with 54 holes of championship golf, fitness centers, and restaurants.

<text>Litchfield Park is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. It is located west of Phoenix. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,847, up from 5,476 in 2010.

==History==

The town of Litchfield Park is a community outside of Phoenix named after its founder, Paul Weeks Litchfield (1875–1959). He was an executive of the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company who came to the Phoenix area in 1916 in search of suitable land to farm a long-staple cotton that had previously been available only from the Sea Islands off the coast of Georgia and from Egypt. This cotton was needed to strengthen the rubber in the pneumatic tire, of which Goodyear was the world&#x27;s largest producer. The East Coast cotton supply had been devastated by the boll weevil, and the African supply had been greatly reduced by World War I attacks from German U-boats. Litchfield went to the Phoenix area at the suggestion of the US Department of Agriculture, but was not successful in motivating local farmers to grow his cotton. Instead, he got Goodyear to form the Southwest Cotton Company in Phoenix, with Litchfield as its president, eventually purchasing some in the general Salt River Valley area, including around the present site of Litchfield Park, then known as Litchfield Ranch. Much of the land was bought for as little as $25 per acre. The cotton was cultivated with a workforce of mostly Mexican and Native American men. The U.S. Postal Service agreed to the name &quot;Litchfield Park&quot; in 1926. In 1929, the Wigwam Resort was opened to the public. In 1926, Litchfield went on to become the president of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, and then chairman of the board in 1930. He retired from the company in 1958, and spent the final months of his life as a resident of Litchfield Park at his home on Fairway Drive.

In 1964, Goodyear created Litchfield Park Land and Development Co. to expand Litchfield Park into a 90,000-resident community. Arden E. Goodyear was the head of the company, Patrick Cusick was vice president and general manager, and Victor Gruen was hired to design some of the buildings. Emanuel Cartsonis, who had worked with Cusick, became city planner. The plan called for 25,000 homes, a college, a junior college, eighteen elementary schools, ten junior high schools, and six high schools, as well as improvements to the town&#x27;s golf course and Phoenix Trotting Park at an expense of at least $750 million. Goodyear made many mistakes during development, including selling properties right up to the curb line, which means that the city must get permission from property owners before they can put in a sidewalk. They abandoned their plans for expanding Litchfield Park before they were completed and sold whatever land they could.

==Geography==
Litchfield Park is bordered to the southeast by Avondale, to the west by Goodyear, and to the north by Glendale.

<text>Mesa ( ) is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. The population was 504,258 at the 2020 census. It is the third-most populous city in Arizona, after Phoenix and Tucson, the 36th-most populous city in the U.S., and the most populous city that is not a county seat (except for independent cities Washington, D.C. and Baltimore which are not part of any county). It is the most populous city in the East Valley of the Phoenix metropolitan area. It borders Tempe on the west, the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community on the north, Chandler and Gilbert on the south along with Queen Creek, and Apache Junction on the east.

At least ten colleges and universities are located in Mesa, as is the Mesa Arizona Temple, one of the first LDS temples constructed outside of Utah. The city is home to the largest relief airport in the Phoenix area, Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport, located in the southeastern corner of the city.

==History==

The history of Mesa dates back at least 2,000 years to the arrival of the Hohokam people. The Hohokam, whose name means &quot;All Used Up&quot; or &quot;The Departed Ones&quot;, built the original canal system. The canals were the largest and most sophisticated in the prehistoric New World. Some were up to wide and deep at their head gates, extending for as far as across the desert. By AD 1100, water could be delivered to an area over , transforming the Sonoran Desert into an agricultural oasis. By 1450, the Hohokam had constructed hundreds of miles of canals, many of which are still in use.

After the disappearance of the Hohokam and before the arrival of the early settlers, little is known; explorers did not venture into this area. By the late 19th century near present-day Mesa, U.S. Army troops relocated the Apache, opening the way for settlement.

In March 1877, Mormon pioneer Daniel Webster Jones and Henry Clay Rogers left St. George, Utah. Jones had been asked by Mormon officials to direct a party of people in establishing a settlement in Arizona. They traveled south and settled on the north side of the present Mesa area. This settlement was initially known as Fort Utah and later as Jonesville. It was located near Lehi Road. In 1883, it was named Lehi at the suggestion of Brigham Young, Jr.

About this same time, another group dubbed the First Mesa Company arrived from Utah and Idaho. Their leaders were Francis Martin Pomeroy, Charles Crismon, George Warren Sirrine and Charles I. Robson. Rather than accepting an invitation to settle at Jones&#x27;s Lehi settlement, they moved up onto the mesa that serves as the city&#x27;s namesake. They dug irrigation canals and used some of the original Hohokam canals. By April 1878, water was flowing through them. The Second Mesa Company arrived in 1879 and settled to the west of the First Mesa Company because of more available farmland. This settlement was originally called Alma and later Stringtown. It was located near where Alma School Road.

On July 17, 1878, Mesa City was registered as a townsite. The first school was built in 1879. In 1883, Mesa City was incorporated with a population of 300 people. Dr. A. J. Chandler, who would later go on to found the city of Chandler, worked on widening the Mesa Canal in 1895 to allow for enough flow to build a power plant. In 1917, the city of Mesa purchased this utility company. The revenues from the company provided enough for capital expenditures until the 1960s. During the Great Depression, WPA funds provided paved streets, a new hospital, a new town hall and a library.

After the founding of the city, the elected official that most impacted the municipality was George Nicholas Goodman. He was mayor five different times during three different decades (1938–1942, 1946–1948, 1952–1956) (see: List of mayors of Mesa, Arizona). As mayor, he was directly involved in the process of acquiring land for both Falcon Field and Williams Field.

With the opening of Falcon Field and Williams Field in the early 1940s, more military personnel began to move into the Mesa area. With the advent of air conditioning and the rise of tourism, population growth exploded in Mesa as well as the rest of the Phoenix area. Industry—especially early aerospace companies—grew in the 1950s and 1960s. As late as 1960, half of the residents of Mesa made a living with agriculture, but that number declined substantially as Mesa&#x27;s suburban growth continued on track with the rest of the Phoenix metro area.

In May 1998 voters approved Proposition 100 which created 6 geographical council districts. Councilmembers are elected to represent these districts for four year terms. The mayor is elected to represent the city at large and also has a four-year term. Both Councilmembers and mayors cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.

=== Incorporation efforts ===
New River, and its neighbor Desert Hills, are unincorporated areas in Maricopa County which in 2019 was named the fastest-growing county in the United States for the third year running. While parts of Maricopa have had considerable development, New River has held off. New River has attempted to &quot;incorporate&quot; a number of times in its history, so as to control zoning regulations and development in the area.

* In 1979 the area tried to incorporate into a town, and while the necessary signatures were collected to move forward with incorporation, the Maricopa County Superior Court Judge vacated the election, finding that New River was too rural and did not meet the statutory requirements for incorporation. At this time, Phoenix was approximately away.
* In 1995, the area attempted again to incorporate. However, this time the region to incorporate would have included approximately . While a sufficient number of signatures was collected, the City of Phoenix declined to pass a resolution to approve New River&#x27;s request to incorporate. In 1999 there was another short-lived movement to incorporate, which also failed.
* In 2017, residents formed a committee to look into the feasibility of incorporating New River and its neighbor Desert Hills. In April 2019, the campaign to incorporate New River and Desert Hills was aiming to collect the signatures of ten per cent of registered voters needed to force a ballot on the issue in November 2019. In June 2019, it was reported that the campaign had failed to win the necessary approval of the City of Phoenix to have a vote on the issue, and the campaign group was reported as saying: &quot;It is unfortunate that we are unable to continue our efforts after this latest development.&quot; The incorporation effort was opposed by the Arizona State Land Department.

<text>Paradise Valley is a desert and mountain town in Arizona east of state capital Phoenix, of which it is a suburb. The town is known for its golf courses, shopping, real estate, and restaurant scene. According to the 2020 census, its population was 12,658.

The town&#x27;s name comes from the expansive area known as Paradise Valley that spreads from north of the Phoenix Mountains to Cave Creek and Carefree on the north and the McDowell Mountains to the east. Resident children in the majority of the municipality attend schools in the Scottsdale Unified School District.

==History==
The town&#x27;s history dates to a more agrarian society. After the initial European settlement, Paradise Valley was first used for cattle grazing. In the 1880s, when the land was being surveyed so it could be developed into agricultural lots, the name &quot;Paradise Valley&quot; first came into use, given by surveyors from the Rio Verde Canal Company and its manager at the time, Frank Conkey. The name may have been chosen due to the abundance of spring wildflowers and palo verde trees. Mainly an agricultural area during the 1800s and the first half of the 1900s, the area began to be settled after World War II, on large, lots for which it became known.

As the neighboring settlements of Phoenix and Scottsdale began to grow and annex adjoining areas, the residents of what became Paradise Valley were concerned that the qualities they most valued would be lost if they were consumed by their larger neighbors. These residents formed the &quot;Citizens Committee for the Incorporation of The Town of Paradise Valley, Arizona&quot;, which collected enough signatures to take to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. The supervisors granted the petition, allowing the town of Paradise Valley to be incorporated on May 24, 1961.

Today, Paradise Valley is one of Phoenix&#x27;s wealthiest suburbs.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which , or 0.18%, is water.

Mummy Mountain dominates Paradise Valley&#x27;s central terrain. Other landmarks include Camelback Mountain on the southern border and the Piestewa Peak mountainous area on the western border.


Several historical sites are within the town, including the Harold C. Price, Sr. House, McCune Mansion/Hormel Mansion, and Barry Goldwater Memorial Park.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census the town had a population of 12,658, consisting of 5,728 households.

From the 2000 census: The population density was . The 5,499 housing units averaged 354.8 per square mile (137.0/km2).

About 2.7% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 5,034 households, 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 76.1% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.3% were not families; 13.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 2.98.

In 2012, the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named Paradise Valley&#x27;s zip code, 85253, the 71st-most expensive in the United States. This ranking also makes it the most expensive in the state of Arizona. In February 2024, &quot;Business Insider&quot; highlighted how the city was seeing a notable increase in the number of wealthy transplants from California. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described this trend a year earlier.

==Government==
Mayor Jerry Bien-Willner, first elected in 2018, began his third term as mayor of Paradise Valley in 2022. The mayor and six town council members are the elected representatives of the Town of Paradise Valley. The council has six members, who are elected to serve four-year staggered terms. In 2010, voters approved direct election of the mayor. Scott LeMarr became the first directly elected mayor in 2012. The council still selects its vice mayor from among its members.

The Town&#x27;s accredited police department is led by Chief Freeman Carney.

In 2012, citizens gathered 500 signatures on a petition requesting that the council reconsider the issue of direct election of the mayor. In June 2012, the council voted to return the question of direct election of mayor to the people. Residents voted to keep direct election of the mayor.

Paradise Valley is in Congressional District 6, which has been represented by David Schweikert since its creation in 2011. Despite the town&#x27;s conservative lean, at the state level it has been represented by three Democrats since 2020. A part of Legislative District 28, it is represented by Christine Marsh in the State Senate and by Kelli Butler and Aaron Lieberman in the House of Representatives.

==Education==
Most of Paradise Valley is within the Scottsdale Unified School District. A small portion is served by Creighton Elementary School District and Phoenix Union High School District.

Several charter schools also are in the area including nearby Great Hearts Academies, BASIS Schools, and private schools such as Phoenix Country Day School.

==Economy==

==Confusion with other Paradise Valley designations==
The town is not to be confused with Paradise Valley Village, an official municipal designation, in northeast Phoenix. For instance, Paradise Valley Community College, Paradise Valley High School, Paradise Valley Mall, Paradise Valley Golf Course, and the former Paradise Valley Hospital are all several miles north of the town, in Phoenix. The Paradise Valley Unified School District does not serve the town of Paradise Valley either, only the areas north of it; its boundaries end a few miles north of the border.

<text>Peoria ( ) is a city in Maricopa and Yavapai counties in the U.S. state of Arizona. Most of the city is located in Maricopa County, while a portion of it in the north is in Yavapai County. It is a major suburb of Phoenix. As of the 2020 census, the population of Peoria was 190,985, up from 154,065 in 2010. It is the sixth-largest city in Arizona in land area and the ninth-largest in population. It was named after Peoria, Illinois. The word &quot;peoria&quot; is a corruption of the Miami-Illinois word for &quot;prairie fire&quot;. It is the spring training home of the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners, who share Peoria Sports Complex.

==History==

===Initial settlement===
Peoria sits in the Salt River Valley, and extends into the foothills of the mountains to the north. William John Murphy, who had worked on the Arizona Canal, recruited settlers to begin a community in Arizona, many of them from Peoria, Illinois. Albert J. and Elizabeth Straw were the first to establish residency in November 1886. They were followed by William T. and Sylvia Hanna, James M. and Clara Copes, and James and Ella McMillan, all from Peoria, Illinois. An old desert road connecting Phoenix to the Hassayampa River near present-day Wickenburg was the only major transportation route in the area until 1887, when a new road was laid out. Named Grand Avenue, this road angled through the newly designed town sites of Alhambra, Glendale, and Peoria and became the main route from Phoenix to Vulture Mine. The settlers filed Peoria&#x27;s plot map with the Maricopa County recorder on May 24, 1897, naming the settlement after their hometown.

The original plot map of Peoria included east and west streets (from south to north) Monroe, Madison, Jefferson, Washington, Jackson, Lincoln, Grant, and Van Buren. Streets going north and south were (from west to east) Almond (present-day 85th Avenue), Peach (present-day 84th Avenue), Orange (present-day 83rd Avenue), Vine (present-day 82nd Avenue), and Walnut (present-day 81st Avenue). The plot was roughly from present-day Peoria and 85th avenues to Monroe Street and 85th Avenue to Monroe Street and 81st Avenue to 81st Avenue and south of the Desert Cove alignment. On August 4, 1888, the Territory of Peoria was granted a post office in its name and served a population of 27. Maricopa County supervisors defined the boundaries for School District Eleven, covering , and the first class took place in an unoccupied brick store that faced north on Washington Street until Peoria&#x27;s first school building, a one-room structure completed in 1891.

===Early growth===
Between 1891 and 1895, a spur line of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway was placed through Peoria, along with Phoenix, Glendale, Alhambra, Hesperla, and Marinette. Peoria&#x27;s small depot on 83rd Avenue just off Grand Avenue was purchased by the city of Scottsdale in 1972 and now resides at McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park.

About 1919 the Peoria Chamber of Commerce formed. It operated as the informal government body until Peoria incorporated in 1954. The Peoria volunteer fire district formed in 1920 and remained all volunteer until the mid-1950s. The three-story Edwards Hotel was built in 1918, followed by the Mabel Hood building in May 1920 at the southwest corner of Washington Street and 83rd Avenue. The John L. Meyer or &quot;flatiron&quot; building was completed in June 1920 and the O.O. Fuel&#x27;s Paramount Theatre in July 1920. (It served as Fire Station 1 from 1950 until 2004.) The town&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Peoria Enterprise&quot;, was printed weekly from November 14, 1917, to April 1921.

Peoria&#x27;s first library was held at the women&#x27;s club in 1920 until it moved to the old Peoria City Hall in 1975 (where the Peoria Center for the Performing Arts was constructed and currently sits). The library eventually moved to the Peoria Municipal Complex. In May 1959 the Women&#x27;s Club gave the clubhouse to the City of Peoria.

Central School was built in 1906. By 1910, three additional classroom buildings were built next to the central school, and in 1918 another school building, containing an auditorium and four classrooms, was opened. In 1918, the attendance for Peoria schools was 190. School District Number Eleven was originally an elementary school district. Children going on to high school had to travel to Glendale High School. In 1919, the school board approved construction of Peoria High School.

===Postwar expansion===
Increased economic activity, combined with the presence of Luke Air Force Base and air conditioning, led to an increase in residential housing in Peoria. A postwar construction boom set the stage for Peoria to become a suburb of Phoenix, providing housing for the capital city as growth moved west.

In 1954, Peoria was home to 1,925 residents, with an area of . Peoria incorporated on June 7, 1954. A seven-member city council formed and held its first organizational meeting on June 14. Peoria was named the &quot;Rose Capitol of the World&quot; in 1956. By 1966, Peoria grew to encompass with of street. In 1968, the city passed a bond to issue securing the money to build a sewer system, which was completed in 1969. In 1970, Peoria began to transition to paid firefighting staff. From a population of 4,792 in 1970, the city grew to 12,351 in 1980 and 50,675 in 1990. Construction of the $30 million municipal complex began in 1988 at the edge of Peoria&#x27;s Old Town. The Police Department opened in 1989, the main city hall building and courts in 1991, and the library in 1993.

Spring training has a long history in Peoria. From the late 1970s to 1990, Peoria&#x27;s Greenway Sports Complex served as a minor league training facility for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. This small facility was located at 83rd Avenue and the Greenway Road alignment, the location of the future Peoria Sports Complex. Construction of the new complex was approved in 1990. It was completed in 1994 and was the first Major League Baseball spring training facility in the county shared by two teams. The San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners utilize the complex year-round for spring training and player development. The Sports Complex was also the short-lived home of the Arizona United for the 2014 season before they relocated to Scottsdale.

In 2005, the city broke ground on the Peoria Center for the Performing Arts, what the city saw as the keystone of the city&#x27;s “Old Town” area. Mayor at the time, John Keegan, saw the building as the key to the revitalization of the downtown district of Peoria, as well as a much needed cultural center for the northwest valley. The city chose the successful local community theater company, Theater Works, as the facility&#x27;s anchor tenant, agreeing to a 20-year lease. The performing arts center opened in 2007.

===Current developments===
Peoria&#x27;s identity is more related to resort and leisure living than the past, as that type of lifestyle migrates from the northeast Valley to Peoria. Peoria&#x27;s economic plan focuses on establishing the “Desert Empire,” a new corridor of industrial, commercial, and mixed development along the Loop 303, especially under mayor, Jason Beck.
The building of an Amkor semiconductor plant in the city has bolstered the city’s hopes of this development, with an estimated 2,000 new jobs.

The City of Peoria opened Paloma Community Park on October 3, 2020. The park offers a variety of recreational activities and amenities including fishing, lighted multi-purpose fields, and picnic ramadas.

The Agua Fria River is usually dry due to the New Waddell Dam that holds back Lake Pleasant in the northern end of the city. The New River is usually dry due to flood control measures and New River Dam. There are multiple washes and creeks that flow through the city as well, one of the most significant being Skunk Creek, due to its trails and connectivity with nearby Glendale.

<text>Rio Verde is a master-planned community east of Scottsdale in Arizona. It is a census-designated place (CDP) in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States located in the far northeast area of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. The population was 2,210 as of the 2020 census, up from 1,811 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area surrounding the Rio Verde community, northeast of downtown Scottsdale, was settled by small farmers in the 1880s, who grew hay and alfalfa to provide for nearby Fort McDowell,l a US Army camp (1865–1890) (now the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation). In the late 1890s, Frank Asher and William W. Moore acquired several of the small farm plots on the Verde River, combining them into what became the Box Bar Ranch; Moore later bought out Asher&#x27;s interest. After his death in 1929, Moore&#x27;s sons, Glen and Lin Moore, operated the Box Bar as a partnership, under the name &quot;Moore Bros Cattle Co.&quot;, with grazing leases both east and west of the Verde River. Lin Moore also ran the X2 Ranch, known as &quot;Moore&#x27;s Well&quot;, to the west, where he and his wife, Ada Lucille, had homesteaded in the 1920s. William Moore&#x27;s father, Ransom B. Moore, emigrated to Arizona from California in 1883 and ranched for many years on the Reno Ranch, west of the community of Punkin Center in Gila County. Ransom Moore, the founder of what is now Banning, California also was Gila County&#x27;s delegate to the 16th Arizona Territorial Legislative Assembly in 1891.

The &quot;Asher Hills&quot; overlooking the community to the west, were named for Frank Asher, who had been Glen Moore&#x27;s brother-in-law and William Moore&#x27;s partner for a while. The granddaughter of Asher&#x27;s wife Ella, Jacque Mercer, was Miss Arizona and then Miss America in 1949.

In 1954 the Moore brothers retired from the active cattle business and sold the ranch and their holdings to the Page Land &amp; Cattle Co. (Lin Moore retained the X2 Ranch; after his death in 1960, his widow continued to operate the X2 until selling it in 1970.) The Moores&#x27; descendants, including historian Wyatt James, still reside in Maricopa County. A portion of Lin &amp; Lucille Moore&#x27;s homestead property on the foothills to the south, known as &quot;The Ochoa Place&quot;, has recently been incorporated into the expanding McDowell Mountains McDowell Sonoran Preserve.

In 1970, Page Land &amp; Cattle sold ranch land to Rio Verde Development, Inc., which in 1973 began to develop the tract as the master-planned community of Rio Verde. An 18-hole golf course was completed in 1973, and a second in 1981. Both were extensively renovated in 2007.

The unincorporated community&#x27;s water is provided through 3 designated aquifers. EPCOR operates the private utility infrastructure they purchased from Rio Verde Utilities in 2018. Rio Verde has nothing to do with Rio Verde Foothills which was provided with water by the City of Scottsdale at cost until January 1, 2023, when the municipal supply was cut due to drought conditions. A planned water district for Rio Verde Foothills was rejected by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in August 2022; several residents filed a lawsuit against the City of Scottsdale to resume service.

==Community characteristics==
Rio Verde is an established, member-owned and -governed active adult golfing and lifestyle community not to be confused with the adjacent Rio Verde Foothills. It is located near the Verde River and adjacent to the Tonto National Forest, the McDowell Mountain Regional Park, and the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation. As of the 2020 census there were 1,676 housing units in the community, of which 1,215 were occupied by residents. The total developed area of the planned community, as of 2021, was , or , compared to for the entire CDP. Rio Verde Community Church provides both interdenominational and Catholic services.

Rio Verde is an age-restricted community or &quot;adult community&quot;, which means one member of each household must be at least 55 years of age and no person under 19 can be a permanent resident of the community. The community is governed by a homeowners&#x27; association under Arizona&#x27;s planned community statutes.

==Geography==
Rio Verde is located in northeastern Maricopa County. By road it is northeast of the historic center of Scottsdale and northeast of downtown Phoenix. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. The Verde River, a south-flowing tributary of the Salt River, forms the eastern edge of the CDP and is about east of the developed community.

<text>Scottsdale is a city in the eastern part of Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, and is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Named Scottsdale in 1894 after its founder Winfield Scott, a retired U.S. Army chaplain, the city was incorporated in 1951 with a population of 2,000. At the 2020 census, the population was 241,361, which had grown from 217,385 in 2010. Its slogan is &quot;The West&#x27;s Most Western Town&quot;. Over the past two decades, it has been one of the fastest growing cities and housing markets in the United States.

Scottsdale is from its northern to southernmost edge, and covers . The city is bordered by the city of Phoenix to the west, Tonto National Forest to the north, the McDowell Mountains to the east, and the Salt River to the south.

==History==
===Early history===
Scottsdale was originally a Pima village known as , meaning . Some Pima people remain there today. Until the late 1960s, there was a still-occupied traditional dwelling on the southeast corner of Indian Bend Road and Hayden Road. The Pima who live in Scottsdale today reside in modern houses, not traditional dwellings. Many Pima and Maricopa people live in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which borders Scottsdale to the south and east.

===Early history and establishment===

In the early to mid-1880s, U.S. Army Chaplain Winfield Scott visited the Salt River Valley and was impressed with it and its potential for agriculture. Returning in 1888 with his wife, Helen, he purchased where historic Old Town is now, for $3.50 an acre ($ as of 2015) . Another landowner in the Southern part of town, Albert G. Utley, filed plans with Maricopa County for a city named &quot;Orangedale,&quot; using Scott&#x27;s Field as a border. When the newspaper, then called the &quot;Arizona Republican&quot;, published an article about the plan, they erroneously called the town &quot;Scottsdale.&quot; The article drew some publicity for the town, and ultimately this convinced Utley to change his filing and officially name the town &quot;Scottsdale.&quot;
In 1896, the Scottsdale Public School system was established, and opened the first schoolhouse, which was followed by the opening of the first general store by J. L. Davis, which also housed the first post office for Scottsdale in 1897. In the early 1900s the community supported an artists and writers culture, culminating in the opening of the region&#x27;s first resort in 1909, the Ingleside Inn, just south of the Arizona Canal and west of the Crosscut Canal (Indian School Road at about 64th Street) in what is today Scottsdale. Also in 1909, Cavalliere&#x27;s Blacksmith Shop opened in downtown Scottsdale, and the original schoolhouse was replaced by the much more expansive Little Red Schoolhouse, which stands to this day. While not in its original building, Cavalliere&#x27;s has been in continuous operation since that time.

In 1912, both the Phoenix Street Railway Company and a competitor, the Salt River Valley Electric Railway Company, proposed building streetcar lines to Scottsdale, but due to an economic downturn, neither was built. Between 1908 and 1933, due to the construction of the Granite Reef and Roosevelt dams (in 1908 and 1911, respectively), Scottsdale&#x27;s population experienced a boom, growing steadily during those years. It became a small market town providing services for families involved in the agricultural industry.

During the First World War, Scottsdale and its environs supported a large cotton farming industry, due to the creation of Long Staple Egyptian Cotton, developed by the US Department of Agriculture. Cotton is still grown in southern Arizona, but Scottsdale&#x27;s cotton boom ended with the loss of government contracts at the end of the war.
In 1920, a second resort was opened on of property owned by the artist Jessie Benton Evans. Called the Jokake Inn, meaning &quot;mud house&quot;, the structure still stands on the grounds of the Phoenician Resort.

The Depression years saw an influx of artists and architects to Scottsdale, which included, in 1937, Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright and his wife purchased acres of desert at the foot of the McDowell Mountains and established Taliesin West, his winter home and his architectural firm&#x27;s southwestern headquarters. Scottsdale and the rest of Phoenix have seen an everlasting influence from Wright. Many buildings throughout the region were designed by him. His influence on the regional architecture is commemorated by a major street bearing his name and a spire memorial designed by Wright in North Scottsdale.

===World War II===
Among the more significant events during the years of World War II was the opening of Thunderbird II Airfield in 1942 (it later became Scottsdale Airport), where 5,500 pilot cadets received their primary flight training before the war&#x27;s end. Scottsdale was the site of a German POW camp at the intersection of Scottsdale and Thomas Roads in what today is Papago Park.

===Development of Indian Bend Wash, 1950s–1970s===
In 1950, the town continued to grow as Motorola became the first of many technology companies to build a plant in Scottsdale. It built a second plant in 1956. With a population of approximately 2,000, the city was incorporated on June 25, 1951. It appointed its first mayor, Malcolm White, and adopted the motto &quot;The West&#x27;s Most Western Town&quot;. The seal, depicting a mounted cowboy surrounded by a 64-pointed starburst, was designed by Mrs. Gene Brown Pennington. The city also became a tourist destination with the opening of the city&#x27;s first modern resorts, the Hotel Valley Ho and the Safari Hotel, in 1956.

The town began a period of rapid population growth after its incorporation in 1951, growing from 2,000 to 10,000 residents during the 1950s. This growth necessitated development into the floodplain known as the Indian Bend Wash. Floodplains throughout history have been enticing locations for development due to their flatness, ease of building and inexpensiveness. This is even more tempting in a desert, where flooding so rarely happens. As Scottsdale expanded, the north-south Indian Bend Wash virtually bisected the city. In the late 1950s, the problem became more and more pronounced, until in 1959 the Arizona State Legislature formed the Maricopa County Flood Control District (MCFCD). The MCFCD became the lead player in developing a comprehensive flood plan for the entire county.

At the same time, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began to look into flooding in Maricopa County. Over the next several years, it presented several plans, which all revolved around constructing concrete canals and levees to channel and divert the floodwaters, as well as building bridges over the canal, similar to the storm drains of Los Angeles. But during MCFCD meetings between 1961 and 1963, a different course of action was developed. This plan became known as the multi-use, or Greenbelt, concept. The two concepts were at odds with one another until the canal plan was defeated in a bond referendum in 1965. In 1966, a study was commissioned that validated the Greenbelt concept as a way to prevent flood damage. After a major flood in 1972, work on the Greenbelt project began in earnest. It was completed in 1984, although minor projects continue. Today, the Scottsdale Greenbelt connects four city parks—Vista del Camino Park, Eldorado Park, Indian School Park and Chaparral Park—through a bike path.

===Further expansion and development, 1970s–1980s===

The city continued to grow in the 1960s and 1970s, the population reaching almost 68,000 by 1970. Most of the unused property within the city limits was to the north, so that was the direction in which the city expanded. The city, which in 1959 had spanned , expanded its borders to encompass . Large ranch tracts covered huge areas in the northern part of the city. One of the largest of these was the McCormick ranch, a ranch serving much of the eastern boundary of Scottsdale owned by Fowler and Anne McCormick. Fowler&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Cyrus McCormick, the inventor of the grain reaper, and his maternal grandfather was John D. Rockefeller. When Anne died in 1970, the property was sold to Kaiser-Aetna for $12.1 million. This started a series of large-scale, master-planned communities within Scottsdale&#x27;s borders, including Scottsdale Ranch (1978), Gainey Ranch (1980), McDowell Mountain Ranch (1992), Desert Mountain (1986), and DC Ranch (1990s).

In 1975, the city annexed the &quot;east Shea&quot; section, bordering Fountain Hills, expanding its area from . This was followed by a four-year period from 1981 to 1984 during which the city annexed an additional (almost) .

Faced with this rapid expansion and growth, many residents became concerned about losing their southwestern scenery. The McDowell Sonoran Conservancy was born in 1991. Teaming with developers, a plan was developed to set aside the McDowell Mountains and adjoining areas in a huge preserve. In 1995, Scottsdale&#x27;s citizens voted to implement a sales tax to purchase acreage for this purpose. When completed, the planned for the McDowell Sonoran Preserve will be nearly one-third of Scottsdale&#x27;s land area, equal in size to Bryce Canyon National Park.

===Modern===
From its official incorporation in 1951 with a population of 2,000, Scottsdale has grown to a 2020 census count of 241,361. It is now the state&#x27;s seventh-largest city. Scottsdale is commonly defined by its high quality of life, and in 1993 was one of several cities to receive a &quot;Most Livable City&quot; award from the United States Conference of Mayors. The Scottsdale Airpark, surrounding the city&#x27;s airport, became a hotspot for a variety of large and small businesses, ranging from light industry to luxury auto sales. The Airpark in the 2000s emerged as one of the top employment centers in the Phoenix metro area. The airport supported 3,462 jobs, which boosted the Scottsdale economy.

==Geography==

The city is in the Salt River Valley, or the &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;, in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert. Scottsdale, long and wide at its widest point, shares boundaries with many other municipalities and entities. On the west, Scottsdale is bordered by Phoenix, Paradise Valley, and unincorporated Maricopa County land. Carefree is along the eastern boundary, as well as sharing Scottsdale&#x27;s northern boundary with the Tonto National Forest. To the south Scottsdale is bordered by Tempe. The southern boundary is also occupied by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which extends along the eastern boundary, which also borders Fountain Hills, the McDowell Mountain Regional Park and more unincorporated Maricopa County land. The highest point is Butte Peak at an elevation of 4,890 ft.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which , or 0.24%, are water.

===Environmental issues===
From the 1950s to the 1970s, several large manufacturing companies in the Scottsdale and Tempe areas used the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) in their manufacturing and operating processes. In 1981, TCE began to show up in two Scottsdale drinking wells, and in 1983, the Indian Bend Wash superfund site was listed on the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Priorities List. Physical construction of environmental remediation systems was completed by 2006, with soil cleanup expected to be completed in five years and groundwater cleanup in 30 years.

The city developed one of the first automated garbage trucks in 1969, replacing crews who dumped cans into a train of open trailers pulled by a truck, with a single operator sitting in an air conditioned cab.

===Cityscape===

The city is loosely divided into four areas: South Scottsdale (McKellips Road north to Thomas Road), Old Town (Downtown) Scottsdale, Central Scottsdale (also known as the &quot;Shea Corridor,&quot; extending from Camelback Road north to Shea Boulevard), and North Scottsdale.

South Scottsdale has for many years been the working-class neighborhood. The median resale home price is US$291,500, compared to $667,450 in North Scottsdale. Part of McDowell Road in South Scottsdale used to be known as &quot;Motor Mile,&quot; having at one time 31 dealerships on the street. The strip at one time generated over $10 million in sales tax revenue each year and was one of the most profitable auto-miles in the United States. In recent years, many of these dealerships have left the city, including 6 in 2008 alone. South Scottsdale is the home to a new research center for Arizona State University known as &quot;SkySong&quot;, a collaboration between the university, local business, and global companies. The development has attracted the research and development arms of a number of international corporations.

Old Town Scottsdale is an area with many streets, old-fashioned stores, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and art galleries. It contains the major nightlife for the area and is a major art center of metro Phoenix. Scottsdale&#x27;s main cultural district is also in this area, which includes the high-end Scottsdale Fashion Square, one of the country&#x27;s 20 largest malls. The district has seen a revival, with new condominiums and hotels under construction.

The Shea Corridor is so named because it is in close proximity to the east-west Shea Boulevard. The houses in this region were generally built during the 1970s. Real estate in the Shea Corridor (Central Scottsdale) has increased during the 1990s, and overall, the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale real estate market saw the largest gain in house prices in the nation during the mid-2000s with a 38.4% increase in value. A number of communities in this central region of Scottsdale remain among the most highly desired residential areas in the metropolitan area, including Gainey Ranch and McCormick Ranch. A large portion of Scottsdale Road in the Shea Corridor has been dubbed the &quot;Resort Corridor&quot; for the high number of resorts on the street. The second Ritz Carlton in the Phoenix metropolitan area will be along this corridor.
North Scottsdale is the most actively developed area of Scottsdale, as it was historically the least built up. This part of the city also claims many of the most expensive houses in Arizona, with many exceeding $5 million in value. The city&#x27;s borders are rapidly expanding to the east and west in this area, containing the McDowell Mountain range. Much of the residential boom in North Scottsdale is driven by available land to build coupled with the fast growth of &quot;Scottsdale Airpark&quot;, the second largest employment center in the Phoenix metropolitan, as of 2008. The Scottsdale Airpark, home to over 55,000 employees, 2,600 businesses and of office space is expected to continue growing by over 3,000 employees per year. Many important companies are headquartered or have regional headquarters in the park, including Acronis, AXA, GE Capital, DHL, Discount Tire Company, Fidelity Investments, Blue Yonder, The Vanguard Group and Quicken Loans.

Though the majority of Scottsdale residents consider themselves of, or practicing of, the Christian faith(s) – including Protestant and Roman Catholic – the city&#x27;s high population growth over the years has resulted in a more diverse population. Most notably, greater numbers of Eastern Orthodox and Jews have been added to the population. Though smaller in number, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities also exist within the city of Scottsdale. There is also a small population of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as is common throughout Phoenix, Arizona, and the Western United States.

==Economy==

The tourism industry is Scottsdale&#x27;s primary employer, accounting for 39% of the city&#x27;s workforce. In 2005, Scottsdale attracted over 7.5 million visitors to the city, providing an economic impact of over $3.1 billion.

The city of Scottsdale is tied with Atlanta for fourth, after New York City, Las Vegas, and Chicago respectively, as having the most AAA Five-Diamond hotels and resorts in the United States. In 2015, AAA bestowed four such properties in Scottsdale with the highest honor: The Phoenician and The Canyon Suites, part of The Luxury Collection, Four Seasons Hotels Scottsdale at Troon North, and the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Princess Resort and Spa.

In 2016, Scottsdale had the highest number of destination spas per capita of any city in the United States.

The region&#x27;s year-round warm weather and abundant sunshine is a major factor in Scottsdale&#x27;s tourism appeal. In particular, during the winter, thousands of tourists and retirees from the midwest, the northeast, and as far away as Canada (known locally as &quot;snowbirds&quot;) flood the area with visits from brief to long term. Those who practice the same migration routine annually often end up purchasing winter homes in the area.

The Mayo Clinic has one of its three major campuses in Scottsdale. This and its resulting effects have made Scottsdale an attractive destination for medical care.

The aviation industry has also grown in Scottsdale, with the construction of Scottsdale Airport in North Scottsdale, in the 1960s. Today, it is one of the busiest single-runway airports in the United States in terms of aircraft operations. However, there is little to no commercial air service; nearly all operations are corporate or general aviation.

The immediate area surrounding the Scottsdale Airport, known locally as the Airpark, has developed rapidly as a regional center of commerce. By 2004, the Airpark had grown to become the second-largest employment center in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, with over 50,000 people being employed within a few-mile radius of the airport itself – notably in financial, retail, service, technological, design and manufacturing fields.

Among the companies headquartered in Scottsdale are APL, Cold Stone Creamery, Carlisle Companies, Discount Tire, Discovery Land Company, Fender, Go Daddy, Blue Yonder, Kahala, Kona Grill, Liveops, Magellan Health, Meritage Homes, Nextiva, Advisor Group, Paradise Bakery &amp; Café, P.F.

==Arts and culture==

The city has an annual Scottsdale Arts Festival.

The highest concentrations of galleries, studios and museums that are open to the public are in Downtown Scottsdale. Its Scottsdale Arts District can be segmented into three distinct districts. The largest is the Scottsdale Main Street Arts District, home to the largest and most diverse collection of styles and genres, the more contemporary Marshall Way Arts District, and the more touristy and western-themed Old Town district, which has the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. The popular Scottsdale Artwalk is held weekly, every Thursday evening.

Scottsdale&#x27;s affluent culture has been depicted by shows such as MTV&#x27;s &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot;, which filmed an episode in the area in 2006, and by the short-lived CBS reality show &quot;Tuesday Night Book Club&quot;.

===Annual cultural events and fairs===
&quot;The West&#x27;s most western town&quot; prides itself in its rich Western history, preserving while heavily promoting its plethora of &quot;western&quot; activities and events. The Scottsdale Arabian Horse Show has taken place since 1955. Today, the show attracts thousands of visitors and tourists, to see nearly 2000 purebred Arabian and Half-Arabian horses competing for various prizes and recognition. The show also features over 300 vendors and exhibitions, and over 25 demonstrations and shows.

The Scottsdale Jaycees Parada del Sol, an annual month-long event that has been held in Scottsdale since 1954. Originally named The Sunshine Festival, the PRCA Rodeo was added in 1956. Cowboys and cowgirls from across the nation converge in Scottsdale to participate in this cultural and historical event. The event begins each year with the &quot;Parada del Sol Parade&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest horse-drawn parade with over 150 entries in any given year.
Since 1971, Scottsdale has been home to the Barrett-Jackson Auto Show. Due to the success of this week-long event held every January, the organizers behind it have more recently inaugurated similar but smaller shows in Palm Beach, Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada. Now held at the expansive West World exhibition complex in North Scottsdale, the event is an auto enthusiast&#x27;s and collector&#x27;s spectacle. The show is known for featuring both exotic, luxury automobiles and historic vehicles which have been expertly restored to mint condition.

Since 2007, Scottsdale has been hosting low and high fashion shows in the annual Scottsdale Fashion Week, including popular department store line fashion designers and some higher end ones during the month of November.

The Scottsdale Culinary Festival is held annually during April. Though many of its individual events are held citywide, they concentrate in the downtown area. Entirely, it is estimated the week-long festival draws over 40,000 people. The most heavily attended such event is the festival&#x27;s Great Arizona Picnic, an outdoor fair-like showcase of both well-known local and national chefs and restaurants. It is held on the lawn of the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall.

The annual Scottsdale International Film Festival concentrates on the use of film to foster of the world&#x27;s cultures, lifestyles, religions, and ethnicities.

===Museums and art galleries===
Scottsdale is home to more than 125 professional art galleries and studios, one of the highest per-capita anywhere in the nation. The city has quickly become a center for art in the United States. According to the Scottsdale Convention &amp; Visitor&#x27;s Bureau and &quot;American Style Magazine&quot;, the city has become one of the country&#x27;s largest art markets, usually only sharing ranks with New York City, New York and Santa Fe, New Mexico in terms of commerce generated as a direct result of art sales and purchasing.

Its galleries and studios are noted for their western and Native American themed art, with a growing interest in contemporary arts over the past couple of decades – an element most visible by the large number of modern art galleries which have opened along the Marshall Way Arts District, and the opening of the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art (also referred to as SMoCA) in 1999. Both are in Downtown Scottsdale. Located in the Old Town district of Downtown Scottsdale, the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall is home to the two-theater Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts, the Scottsdale Historical Museum, as well as the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. SMoCA is the only permanent museum dedicated solely to the contemporary arts in the state of Arizona. Also in Old Town, Western Spirit: Scottsdale&#x27;s Museum of the West opened in January 2015, featuring historical and cultural exhibits from 19 states of the American West, including Arizona.

Taliesin West, architect Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s winter home and school from 1937 until 1959, is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in Arizona. The complex is in the northeast fringe of the city, at the base of the McDowell Mountains.

===Nightlife===
Scottsdale is home to a variety of nightclubs, restaurants, hotels, lounges and bars most notably in the Old-Town district.
This is evident by the growing number of style-conscious hotels that have opened up throughout Downtown Scottsdale which equally cater to the nightlife crowds.

The majority of nightlife is concentrated in Downtown Scottsdale, between Camelback and Osborn roads. This is the most active and popular nightlife destination in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Similar to well-known nightclub districts in other major cities, much like Atlanta&#x27;s Buckhead district and Miami&#x27;s South Beach, most of Downtown Scottsdale&#x27;s major bars and clubs are generally within walking distance. Crowds of over 40,000-strong are known to congregate to this area. Old Town Scottsdale consists of active night clubs, dive bars, entertainment restaurants and shopping around every corner. Scottsdale Fashion Square introduces the Old Town Scottsdale lifestyle with approximately 2 million square feet of luxury retail space.

=== Attractions ===
There are several attractions within the city of Scottsdale. There is the newly built Great Wolf Lodge water park and hotel right off of the 101 freeway. The Talking Stick Resort is an attraction and a part of the Scottsdale night life with their 98,000 square feet casino. Within the same vicinity are the Butterfly Wonderland, OdySea Aquarium that holds over 6,000 animals in 2,000,000 gallons of water, iFly Zone and many shopping centers including Fashion Square, just north of Old Town Scottsdale. Scottsdale Fashion Square introduces Old Town Scottsdale being in the top 30 largest malls in the country and providing upscale shopping and luxury.

===Indian gaming===
Southeast Scottsdale borders the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. For several years, the Scottsdale Pavilions, a major outdoor shopping center, marked the only commercial property operating on tribal lands. In 1998, the tribe opened the first permanent casino in the Scottsdale area, Casino Arizona, at Loop 101 and McKellips Road. The success of Casino Arizona led to the construction of a second location, Casino Arizona at Indian Bend, in a temporary facility less than north.

The passage of Proposition 202 in November 2002 redefined casino gaming in Arizona, permitting &quot;Vegas-style&quot; blackjack and poker, expanded number of slot machines and wider food and beverage service options. Both casinos underwent significant expansions following the passage of Proposition 202, with Casino Arizona at Indian Bend more than doubling in size.

In 2010, the temporary tent facilities hosting the Casino Arizona at Indian Bend were deconstructed following the opening of Casino Arizona at Talking Stick Resort. The casino is adjoined to the newly constructed 15-story Talking Stick Resort &amp; Spa, which features the Talking Stick golf course, a 36-hole golf course designed by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore. Today, the two casinos collectively have over 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Freeways====
State Route 101 – locally known as Loop 101 – provides convenient Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways access.

====Air====
The city is home to Scottsdale Municipal Airport , a single-runway airport in North Scottsdale. While the airport serves some tour and commuter flights, the plurality of aircraft operations are corporate and transient general aviation traffic.

Commercial air travel is served by Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix and Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport in Mesa.

====Public transit====
Public bus service for Scottsdale and the Phoenix Metropolitan Area is provided by Valley Metro.

The city of Scottsdale runs a network of local neighborhood circulators, labeled the &quot;Scottsdale Trolley.&quot; Using trolley-replica buses, the public service is free to riders. , there are two circulating &quot;routes,&quot; known individually as the Downtown Trolley and the Neighborhood Trolley. These connect at the Loloma Station transit center in downtown Scottsdale.

The Downtown Trolley circulates through downtown Scottsdale, and the Neighborhood Trolley circulates from downtown Scottsdale to neighborhoods throughout South Scottsdale, connecting with the city of Tempe&#x27;s own free public circulator, the Tempe Orbit at Roosevelt and Scottsdale Road. From there, riders can transfer onto the Tempe Orbit, and travel to Tempe, including Arizona State University&#x27;s main campus, and the downtown Tempe, or Mill Avenue, area.

Between December 2007 and 2009, Scottsdale was a member of the board of Valley Metro Rail line which connects the neighboring cities of Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa. There was a study in 2001, and some discussion since, of extending the light rail line into Scottsdale. The city&#x27;s Transportation Master Plan identifies Scottsdale Road as the city&#x27;s high-capacity corridor, which could be light rail, modern streetcar service, or bus rapid-transit (BRT).

A street railway interurban line was proposed to connect Scottsdale with Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa as early as 1913 but was never built; Scottsdale is the largest American city that has never had a rail line.

<text>Sun City is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, that is located within the Phoenix metropolitan area.

The population was 39,931 as of the 2020 census. Its adjoining sister city is Sun City West. Both Sun Cities are retirement communities popular with snowbirds.

== History ==
In June 1959, James G. Boswell II, then owner of the J.G. Boswell Company, sold the company’s Marinette and Santa Fe ranches to Del E. Webb Development Co for more than $20 million. This land, totaling 20,000 acres, would become the company’s first retirement community, Sun City.

Sun City was opened January 1, 1960, with five home models, a shopping center, a recreation center, and a golf course. The opening weekend drew 100,000 people, ten times more than expected, and resulted in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story. The future retirement community was built on the site of the former ghost town of Marinette. At first it was called the Marinette Retirement Community, but after a nationwide naming contest in which the winner would win a house, developer Del Webb selected the name Sun City.

Developer Del E. Webb expanded Sun City over the years, and his company went on to build other retirement communities in the Sun Belt. Sun City West was built in the late 1970s, Sun City Grand in the late 1990s, Sun City Anthem in 1999, and Sun City Festival in July 2006.

The community is well known to law students, as it is featured in the case &quot;Spur Industries, Inc. v. Del E. Webb Development Co.&quot;, 494 P.2d 700 (Ariz. 1972), commonly used in first-year property law courses to illustrate nuisance law.

<text>Surprise is a city in Maricopa County, in the U.S. state of Arizona. The population was 143,148 at the 2020 census, up from 117,517 in 2010 and just 30,848 in 2000.

Surprise is the spring training location of the Kansas City Royals and the Texas Rangers baseball teams.

==History==
The city was founded in 1938 by Flora Mae Statler. Statler was the daughter of another Arizona pioneer, Charles Gillett who helped found Glendale, specifically as a temperance community. Gillett owned much land in Glendale as well as the Verde Valley. Surprise officials previously thought the city was founded by Statler&#x27;s husband, real estate developer and state legislator Homer C. Ludden, but in 2010 property records were discovered which listed Statler owning the land before she met Ludden. Modern records often state that Statler named her land Surprise as she &quot;would be surprised if the town ever amounted to much,” with her daughter backing this claim. This claim is contested, however, since it was common for pioneers to name their settlements after their hometowns and Ludden hailed from Surprise, Nebraska, possibly influencing the name of the town.

When Surprise was subdivided to build inexpensive houses for agricultural workers, there were only a few houses and a gas station on the parcel of land. Since then, the town has experienced tremendous growth. It incorporated as a city in 1960. The original townsite is bounded by Greenway Road on the south, El Mirage Road on the east, Bell Road on the north, and Dysart Road on the west.

Surprise&#x27;s City Hall is located on the site of Luke Air Force Base&#x27;s former auxiliary airfield No. 3. The outline of the former runways can still be seen from aerial photos today.

Thousands of retirees moved to the city in the 1990s and early 2000s to live in Sun City Grand, an age-restricted resort-like community with homes built by the property development firm Del Webb. Surprise is about northwest of Del Webb&#x27;s original Sun City development and adjacent to Sun City West.

<text>Tempe ( ; &quot;Oidbaḍ&quot; in O&#x27;odham) is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, with the Census Bureau reporting a 2020 population of 180,587. The city is named after the Vale of Tempe in Greece. Tempe is located in the East Valley section of metropolitan Phoenix; it is bordered by Phoenix and Guadalupe on the west, Scottsdale and the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community on the north, Chandler on the south, and Mesa on the east. Tempe is the location of the main campus of Arizona State University.

==History==
The Hohokam lived in this area and built canals to support their agriculture. They abandoned their settlements during the 15th century, with a few individuals and families remaining nearby.

Fort McDowell was established approximately northeast of present downtown Tempe on the upper Salt River in 1865 allowing for new towns to be built farther down the Salt River. US military service members and Hispanic workers were hired to grow food and animal feed to supply the fort, and less than a year later, had set up small camps near the river that were the first permanent communities in the Valley after the fall of the Hohokam. (Phoenix was settled shortly afterward, by 1867–68.) The two settlements were &#x27;Hayden&#x27;s Ferry&#x27;, named after a ferry service operated by Charles T. Hayden, and &#x27;San Pablo&#x27;, and were located west and east of Hayden Butte respectively. The ferry became the key river crossing in the area. The Tempe Irrigating Canal Company was soon established by William Kirkland and James McKinney to provide water for alfalfa, wheat, barley, oats, and cotton.

Pioneer Darrell Duppa is credited with suggesting Tempe&#x27;s name, adopted in 1879, after comparing the Salt River valley near a -tall butte, to the Vale of Tempe near Mount Olympus in Greece.

From its founding in 1871 until 90 years later, Tempe was a sundown town where African Americans were permitted to work but forced to live elsewhere. In 1965, Warren and Carol Livingston were the first African Americans to buy property in Tempe.

In 1885, the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature chose Tempe for the site of the Territorial Normal School, which became Arizona Normal School, Arizona State Teachers College, Arizona State College and finally Arizona State University.

The Maricopa and Phoenix Railroad, built in 1887, crossed the Salt River at Tempe, linking the town to the nation&#x27;s growing transportation system. The Tempe Land and Improvement Company was formed to sell lots in the booming town. Tempe became an economic hub for the surrounding agricultural area. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors incorporated the town of Tempe in 1894.

The completion of Roosevelt Dam in 1911 guaranteed enough water to meet the growing needs of Valley farmers. On his way to dedicate the dam, former President Theodore Roosevelt applauded the accomplishments of the people of central Arizona and predicted that their towns would be prosperous cities in the future. Less than a year later, Arizona was admitted as the 48th state, and the Salt River Valley continued to develop.

On August 30, 1971, Tempe was hit by a rare F2 tornado that injured 41 people, the most injuries recorded from a tornado in Arizona, and caused damage in upwards of $3 million. One indirect fatality occurred when a man died from a heart attack during the storm.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tempe has expanded as a suburb of Phoenix, and as a center of education and commerce.

The city of Tempe is bordered by Mesa to the east, Scottsdale and the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community to the north, Phoenix and Guadalupe to the west, and Chandler to the south.

Tempe is generally flat, except for Tempe Butte or Hayden Butte (generally known as A-Mountain for Arizona State University&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; logo located on its south face), located next to Sun Devil Stadium, Twin Buttes and Bell Butte on the western edge of Tempe, and the buttes within Papago Park at northwest corner of Tempe. Elevation ranges from at Tempe Town Lake to atop Hayden Butte.
===Climate===
Tempe experiences a desert climate with a higher degree of diurnal temperature variation than neighboring Phoenix.

The Arizona Coyotes began using Mullett Arena as their home venue for the 2022-23 National Hockey League season after struggling to find long-term arena agreements in the greater Phoenix area. This was seen as a short-term solution until a new arena was built. After several unsuccessful attempts at securing a new arena, the Coyotes ultimately played what would be their final two seasons at Mullett Arena before ceasing operations in 2024, and relocating to Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Tempe is one of the most densely populated cities in the state and serves as a crossroads for the area&#x27;s largest communities.

Freeways make up the major transportation system for the Valley. Included in the system surrounding Tempe are Interstate 10 near the western edge as it traverses the Broadway Curve, Loop 202 crossing the northern side, Loop 101 following the eastern border, and U.S. Route 60 running east–west through the center of the city.

Valley Metro operates bus routes and the Valley Metro Rail system that serves Downtown Tempe and Arizona State University, providing service to Phoenix and Mesa. The City of Tempe operates a free neighborhood circulator service called Orbit involving five free shuttle routes near Arizona State University that operate on a regular basis seven days a week. Three other FLASH (Free Local Area Shuttle) circulate in northern Tempe around the university. Tempe residents and commuters make extensive use of public transit and service is offered on a more frequent basis than elsewhere in the greater Phoenix valley, or in the entire state. Most Tempe buses offer 15 minute service during rush hour and 30 minute service throughout the rest of the day.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, located northwest of Tempe, provides extensive air service to points throughout North America and to London, England, and various cities in Hawaii.

Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport is located in Mesa, and offers air service to many additional destinations.

Tempe is one of the few cities in the United States to permit self-driving taxis. Waymo currently offers service within most parts of the city as well as certain other portions of the Valley. In 2018, Tempe was the location of the first reported killing of a pedestrian by a self-driving car, when Elaine Herzberg was struck and killed by a car owned by Uber that was operating in autonomous mode. The incident caused Uber to suspend its self-driving car program nationwide, and its permit to operate in Arizona was revoked.

Tempe is home to the nation&#x27;s first zero-driving community called Culdesac Tempe which opened in 2023.  The $170 million development project will contain 761 apartments, housing 1,000 residents and 16,000 square feet of retail, serving as a form of infill development in the city as it is being built on a vacant 17-acre lot.  In this community, residents are contractually forbidden from parking a vehicle within a quarter mile radius of the area. Prices to live in Culdesac Tempe are projected to be similar to rent prices in the rest of the area and discounted public transport services are included in the monthly rent to allow for residents to travel to other places.

<text>Tolleson is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the city was 7,216 as of the 2020 census, up from 6,545 in 2010.

==History==
The city was incorporated in 1929 and named after founders Walter G. Tolleson and his wife Alethea H. Tolleson. The Tollesons moved to the area in 1910, buying a 160-acre ranch at the intersection of 91st Avenue and Van Buren Street. Walter Tolleson reopened the Ten Mile Store which was the first stagecoach stop and general merchandise store in route to Yuma from Phoenix. The store was located on what is now the intersection of 91st Drive and Monroe Street.

In 1912, the Tollesons subdivided their ranch, allowing more people to buy their land. In an effort to market his new community as a good opportunity for farmers, Mr. Tolleson chartered a train and provided free lunches for anyone to make the journey. He also gave away five dollars worth of gold to better entice people. Eighty lots were sold at a price of $50.00 per lot.

Leon Tolleson, Walter’s brother, became the first postmaster of the development in 1913. The with rural mail route operated out of Walter&#x27;s general merchandise store for a time before a stand alone post office was built at what is now 91st Avenue and Van Buren Street, where it is still located today.

Beginning in the 1940s, agriculture in the surrounding area began to take off, providing a great economic boost to the city. By the 1950s, Tolleson had become known as the &quot;Vegetable Center of the World.&quot; The early 1960s saw a rapid decline of agri-business as more machinery became available to farmers in the area, leading to decreased need for labor.

The 1970s city planners developed a master plan, began street beautification projects, encouraged new housing development and built a multi-million dollar sewage treatment plant essential for industrial and residential growth. The city hoped that this would help entice new businesses and homebuyers to move in driving up population and revenue once again, seen as an investment in the city’s future. Tolleson also expanded its land during the Phoenix metropolitan area’s “range war” in the late 1970s. Cities such as Avondale, Goodyear, and Phoenix, began annexing large chunks of land around where the I-10 was set to go through. Tolleson went from one square mile to six square miles during this time. The cities around Tolleson often had much more buying power so the small town could not grow as much as others. In one instance, Phoenix bought two strips of land measuring thirty and fifty feet wide between Tolleson and Avondale solely so that Tolleson would be confined to its existing space.

The 1980s marked the entry of Fry&#x27;s Food and Drug and Albertson&#x27;s Distribution Centers that generated spinoff industrial development to Tolleson. These distributors showed other businesses the strategic placement of Tolleson in moving supplies and products due to its close proximity to Phoenix as well as California, allowing for easy shipment of imports coming from the west coast. Tolleson also sits along Interstate 10, Union Pacific Railroad and State Route 85, as well as the newly constructed Loop 202 only 3 miles to the east creating an efficient transporting environment.

Today, Tolleson is an employment center for the West Valley, hosting over twenty Fortune 500 companies. The city employs more than 20,000 people, while having a population just over 7,000 residents. Tolleson has one of the highest jobs-to-residents ratios in the nation.

<text>Wickenburg is a town in Maricopa and Yavapai counties, Arizona, United States. The population was 7,474 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 7,920 in 2022.

==History==

The Wickenburg area, along with much of the Southwest, became part of the United States by the 1848 treaty that ended the Mexican–American War. The first extensive survey was conducted by Gila Rangers who were pursuing Natives who had raided the Butterfield Overland Mail route and attacked miners at Gila City.

In 1862, a gold strike on the Colorado River near present-day Yuma brought American prospectors, who searched for minerals throughout central Arizona. Many of the geographic landmarks now bear the names of these pioneers, including the Weaver Mountains, named after mountain man Pauline Weaver, and Peeples Valley, named after a settler.

A German named Henry Wickenburg was one of the first prospectors. His efforts were rewarded with the discovery of the Vulture Mine, from which more than $30 million worth of gold has been dug.

Ranchers and farmers soon built homes along the fertile plain of the Hassayampa River. Together with the miners, they founded the town of Wickenburg in 1863. Wickenburg was also the home of Jack Swilling, who prospected in the Salt River Valley in 1867. Swilling conducted irrigation efforts in that area and helped found the city of Phoenix. Wickenburg was supplied from the Colorado River, by steamboat, then over the La Paz–Wikenburg Road by wagons and pack mules. Wickenburg in turn became a supply point for the mines and army posts in the interior of Arizona Territory. In those years, the rapidly growing town had even once been viewed as a possible candidate for territorial capital and lost the opportunity in 1866 by just two votes in the newly-established legislature.

As the town grew, conflicts developed with the Yavapai people, who rejected a treaty signed by their chiefs, effectively breaking the treaty. When the American Civil War began in 1861, the Federal troops were all withdrawn and the settlements were left unprotected.

The Yavapai promptly began a series of attacks on the white townsmen. A company of Confederate cavalry brought temporary relief, but it fell back before the advance of Union troops from California. By 1869, an estimated 1,000 Yavapai and 400 settlers had been killed, with many on both sides fleeing to safer areas. With the end of the war, the Union troops and local volunteers forced the Yavapai onto a reservation, where they remain to this day.

However, Yavapai recalcitrants remained for years, and raids on stage-coaches, isolated farm houses, and periodic raids on villages kept the area in a constant state of tension. Finally, following several murders of Yavapai chiefs allied with America by insurgent Yavapai warriors, hostile warrior tribal leaders mobilized the entire Yavapai warrior band into a massive assault on the primary American settlement of Wickenburg and massacred or drove out much of the American populace.

In 1872, in response to the assassination of friendly Yavapai chiefs, the take-over of the entire Yavapai nation and its reservation by hostile elements, and with most of the American area under continual penetrating raids by Yavapai warrior bands, General George Crook began an all-out campaign against the Yavapai, with the aim of forcing the insurgent Yavapai warrior bands into a decisive battle and the removal of Yavapai settlers from American territory. After several months of forced marches, feints, and pitched skirmishes by combined Arizona territorial militia and US Army Cavalry, Crook forced the Yavapai bands into a single decisive battle. In December 1872, the Battle of Salt River Canyon in the Superstition Mountains decisively routed the Yavapai, and within a year most Yavapai resistance was crushed.

Having broken their treaty with America several times, with most of the friendly and allied chiefs killed by insurgent Yavapais, who also killed Americans, Crook was authorized to enter into new negotiations with the aim of reducing the size of the Yavapai reservation and removing it to an area more readily cordoned off from American communities and their communication lines. The surviving Yavapai warrior leaders grudgingly accepted the treaty which left the nation in far worse conditions than previously. They were compelled to surrender their firearms, move to the Fort Verde Reservation, accept a permanent Army garrison on their territory, accept direct administration by American Bureau of Indian Affairs agents and commissioners, have trade firmly emplaced in the hands of American government agents, and be regulated by an Indian Police force picked and trained by the US Army and later Arizona Territorial officers. After only two years on the Rio Verde Reservation, however, local officials grew concerned about the Yavapais&#x27; continued hostility, success, and self-sufficiency, so they persuaded the federal government to close their reservation and move all the Yavapai to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation.

The infant town of Wickenburg went through many trials and tribulations in its first decades, surviving the Indian Wars including repeating Indian raids, outlaws, mine closures, drought, and a disastrous flood in 1890 when the Walnut Creek Dam burst, killing nearly 70 residents. In spite of such challenging circumstances, the town continued to grow. Its prosperity was ensured with the coming of the railroad in 1895. The historic train depot today houses the Wickenburg Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center. As of 2007, however, only freight trains pass through Wickenburg; passenger trains ended their runs in the 1960s.

Along the town&#x27;s main historic district, early businesses built many structures that still form Wickenburg&#x27;s downtown area. Tourism led to the development of guest ranches, with as many as 14 operating in the 1950s and 1960s, when Wickenburg billed itself as the &quot;Dude Ranch Capital of the World&quot;, with development spurred by the construction of U.S. Route 60. As of 2007, some of these ranches still offer their hospitality. Rancho de los Caballeros is now a golf resort, while the Remuda ranch has been converted into the nation&#x27;s largest eating disorder treatment facility and is now Wickenburg&#x27;s largest employer. The Hassayampa community became a vital contributor to the US effort during World War II when the Army trained thousands of men to fly gliders at a newly constructed airfield west of Wickenburg.

<text>Youngtown is a town in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 7,056, up from 6,156 in 2010. It is part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1954, two developers bought of farmland and built the United States&#x27; first planned community dedicated exclusively to retirees. Designed by Ben Schleifer, who also had the idea of an active retirement community, the community was ironically named Youngtown. Frances Greer who owned the ranch that the development was built on. In 1955, 125 homes were built, with about 85 other lots sold.

Two years later, in 1957, Youngtown was featured in an episode of &quot;Wide Wide World&quot;. This put national attention on the area. As a result, more people began moving in, sparking a new movement for the community. 

In 1959, West Valley agriculturalist Jim Boswell II withheld land from Del Webb when selling land to build Sun City. The land between Alabama and Grand avenues and west of 111th Avenue, was saved specifically to allow Youngtown to have space for further expansion. A year later in 1960, on January 1, Sun City opened just east of the development. That same year, the town of Youngtown was incorporated and the country’s first AARP Chapter was established in the town.

In 1996, the town, citing its age restrictions, denied extending the stay of a 16-year-old child to live in the community. In response, Arizona attorney general Grant Woods investigated and determined that the age ordinance was unenforceable. In response, Youngtown repealed the age restrictions in 1999.

==Geography==
Youngtown is located on the east bank of the Agua Fria River, just south of US 60. It is bordered on the west by El Mirage, on the south by Glendale, and on the east by the much larger retirement community of Sun City. Youngtown is northwest of downtown Phoenix.

<text>Bullhead City is a city located on the Colorado River in Mohave County, Arizona, United States, south of Las Vegas, Nevada, and directly across the Colorado River from Laughlin, Nevada, whose casinos and ancillary services supply much of the employment for Bullhead City. Bullhead City is located at the southern end of Lake Mohave.

As of the 2020 census, the population of Bullhead City was 41,348. The nearby communities of Laughlin, Needles, Fort Mohave and Mohave Valley bring the Bullhead area&#x27;s total population to over 77,000, making it the largest economic region in Mohave County.

With over , Bullhead City is the largest city in Mohave County in terms of total land area.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the Colorado River Valley were the Mojave people. The rich soil and plentiful water provided the valley&#x27;s natives with the necessities to create a prosperous farming community. According to Mojave legend, life began on Spirit Mountain, the highest peak visible from the Bullhead City area.

The first account of European contact was with Spanish explorer Melchor Díaz, who in 1540 documented his travels in what is now northwestern Mohave County. He recounts meeting a large population of natives who referred to themselves as the Pipa Aha Macav, meaning &quot;People by the River&quot;. From &quot;Aha Macav&quot; came the shortened name &quot;Mojave&quot; (also spelled &quot;Mohave&quot;). While Mohave County uses the modern English spelling, the tribe retains the traditional Spanish spelling &quot;Mojave&quot;. Both are correct, and both are pronounced &quot;Moh-&quot;hah&quot;-vee&quot;.

Father Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary and explorer, crossed the Colorado River in the Bullhead City area in 1774.

===Hardyville===
In March 1864, the current site of Bullhead City was the location of a settlement called &quot;Hardyville&quot;. It was named for early resident and politician William Harrison Hardy. A New York native and an entrepreneur, Hardy established, with the support of George Alonzo Johnson&#x27;s steamboat company, a ferry service and steamboat landing where the Mojave Road crossed the Colorado River. He also built and owned the Hardyville–Prescott Road, a toll road from Hardyville to the new Arizona territorial capital of Prescott, and raised Angora goats. He was a colorful and somewhat controversial figure. He was the town&#x27;s first postmaster from January 17, 1865, and is credited with the invention of the riveted mail sack. He was also a Mohave County supervisor and a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. In 1864 his personal worth was over $40,000, making him the second-richest man in Arizona.

From 1864 to 1883, steamboats made regular trips up the Colorado River from Port Isabel in Mexico and, after the arrival of the railroad from Yuma, Arizona, stopping at Hardyville regularly to deliver supplies to the mines of the surrounding mining districts and those to the east in the interior of Arizona and carry out their ore for processing and sale. These stern-wheeler riverboats played an important part in the early development of the areas bordering the Colorado River, and Hardyville was considered the low water limit of navigation for the steamboats. Steamboat travel above that point to places in like El Dorado Canyon, Callville and later Rioville was possible only during the few months of the late spring to early summer flood caused by snowmelt in the upper Colorado River watershed. Hardyville was the starting point for wagon roads and pack trails to the mines and other settlements in the upper region of the river. It was also the port for flatboats that ascended the river as far as Callville in the extreme low water time of the year.

In April 1866, Brevet Brigadier General James Fowler Rusling visited the settlement and described it: 

Hardyville received a boost in 1867, when it became the county seat of Mohave County and the mills at Eldorado Canyon began operating, stimulating trade up river again. Hardyville had a population of 20 in 1870. The 1870s saw a population boom in Hardyville as mining became more profitable. With the end of hostilities with the Native Americans in Mohave County, mines in the interior boomed again, and the small town later grew with the construction of a general store, a saloon, a blacksmith shop, a billiard hall, and a respectable public hall.

However, in 1873, the county seat was moved to the mining boomtown of Cerbat. In 1877, the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived at Yuma. It bought out Johnson&#x27;s Colorado Steam Navigation Company, and by 1878 had built rails into Maricopaville, resulting in wagon traffic moving to that railhead that was closer to the mines in the northern interior than Hardyville. Traffic on the road to the interior mines of the east from Hardyville waned except for that to Cerbat, Mineral Park, and Chloride. In May 1881, Issac Polhamus, captain of one of the Southern Pacific-owned Colorado Steam Navigation Company steamboats, went into competition with Hardy for the trade to those mines, establishing Polhamus Landing, a rival landing five miles up river, closer to the mines, taking away most of its river trade. Worse yet, the construction of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad to its bridge crossing on the Colorado River near Needles, in May 1883, saw the remaining interior mining trade move away from the Colorado River and Hardyville. The Hardyville post office was discontinued in favor of the one in Mohave City on February 19, 1883. As the silver price declined in the late 1880s and early 1890s, the Hardyville mill, its only remaining economic resource, became idle and the remaining population of the town left, leaving it to become a ghost town. Hardyville still appears with that name on a September 1911 reprint of a U.S. Geological Survey Reconnaissance Map, Arizona, Nevada, California, Camp Mohave Sheet, Edition of March 1892.

Hardyville Pioneer Cemetery, a small cemetery, now a historic landmark at , is the most significant existing remnant of Hardyville. An unofficial historical marker for the town is in the parking lot across Highway 95 from the cemetery at . The Hardyville Mill ruins appeared on a USGS topographic map, at .

===Bullhead City===

Decades later, Hardyville would be resurrected as Bullhead City with the construction of Davis Dam between 1942 and 1953. The dam was originally called Bullhead Dam after &quot;Bull&#x27;s Head Rock&quot;, a well-known rock formation along the Colorado River. Steamboats on the river used the rock as a navigation point. After the construction of Davis Dam, the water level rose and now almost completely covers the landmark. The community that arose during the construction of Bullhead Dam was nicknamed Bullhead. Bullhead City became the headquarters for the construction project, which was completed in 1953. Thus the name Bullhead City was born. As the nearby Lake Mohave developed into a major tourism destination, and as the casino and resort town of Laughlin, Nevada, sprouted up across the river, Bullhead City grew rapidly.

In 1970, Bullhead City was the name of the six blocks that ran north–south along Highway 95 across the river from Don Laughlin&#x27;s casino. About a thousand people lived in the original Bullhead City at that time, with about 3,000 people in Riviera. In 1984, the small communities of Bullhead City, Riviera, and Holiday Shores voted to incorporate, choosing the name &quot;Bullhead City&quot; for its historical significance.

Bullhead City and the neighboring town of Laughlin, Nevada, have grown in popularity as tourist destinations, and so has the population. Today, tourism is by far the main economy in Bullhead City. In the summer months, tourists from all over come for water recreation on Lake Mohave and the Colorado River. Starting in the fall, tourists from colder states flock by the thousands in their motor homes because of the mild winters.

Bullhead City is home to an international airport, two full-service hospitals, and a community college. The city has a stabilizing housing market. It also serves as the shopping hub of the tri-state area.

==Geography==
Bullhead City is in western Mohave County on the east side of the Colorado River, which forms the Arizona–Nevada state line. It is west of Kingman, the Mohave county seat, north of Needles, California, south of Las Vegas, Nevada, and northwest of Phoenix. According to the United States Census Bureau, Bullhead City has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.30%, are water.

==Demographics==

Bullhead City first appeared on the 1980 U.S. Census as the census-designated place (CDP) of Bullhead City-Riviera. It incorporated in 1984 as Bullhead City and has appeared on every successive census.

Bullhead City and the neighboring communities of Laughlin, Nevada, Fort Mohave, Mohave Valley, Arizona, and Needles, California, make up what is referred to as the &quot;Tri-State Area&quot;. This is an economically interdependent group of communities, all geographically connected within a radius. The population of the tri-state area, including Bullhead City, is about 100,000. The catchment area of Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport, according to its own statistics, includes 110,000 residents.

<text>Colorado City is a town in Mohave County, Arizona, United States, and is located in a region known as the Arizona Strip. The population was 2,478 at the 2020 census. At least three Mormon fundamentalist sects are said to have been based there. A majority of residents and many local officials belong to the most prominent of these sects, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose corporation also owned much of the land within and around the town until state intervention in the 2000s.

==History==
Colorado City, formerly known as &quot;Short Creek&quot; (or the Short Creek Community), was founded in 1913 by members of the Council of Friends, a breakaway group from the Salt Lake City–based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Council of Friends membership desired a remote location where they could practice plural marriage, which had been publicly abandoned by the LDS Church in 1890. On July 26, 1953, Arizona Governor John Howard Pyle sent troops into the settlement to stop polygamy in what became known as the Short Creek raid. The two-year legal battle that followed became a public relations disaster that damaged Pyle&#x27;s political career and set a hands-off tone toward the town in Arizona for the next 50 years.

After the death of Joseph W. Musser, the community split into two groups: the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints stayed in Short Creek, while the Apostolic United Brethren relocated to Bluffdale, Utah. The FLDS changed the name of the community to Colorado City (on the Arizona side of the border) and Hildale (on the Utah side) to eliminate any ties to the Short Creek raids.

In January 2004, local FLDS fundamentalist leader Warren Jeffs expelled a group of 20 men, including the mayor, and gave their wives and children to other men. Jeffs, now a convicted sexual predator, stated he was acting on the orders of God, while the men expelled claimed they were penalized for disagreeing with Jeffs. Observers stated that this was the most severe split to date within the community other than the split between Colorado City and Centennial Park. According to the Utah attorney general&#x27;s office, this was not the first time Jeffs was accused of expelling men from the community; as many as 400 young men are estimated to have been expelled by Jeffs from 2001 to 2006. Most were removed for failing to follow Jeffs&#x27; rules, or for dating women without his permission. Many of these expelled men and boys were very naïve and sheltered and often wound up homeless in nearby towns such as Hurricane and St. George, Utah. Jeffs was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list and eventually arrested on August 28, 2006.

Most of the property in the town was owned by the United Effort Plan, a real estate trust of the FLDS. In 2007, the state authorities began dismantling church ownership of Colorado City lands. The FLDS church retaliated and indoctrinated their followers against the state, believing they were being targeted because of their beliefs. The FLDS followers became further secluded as a result. Remaining FLDS members refuse to believe the charges against Jeffs.

On April 6, 2010, law enforcement officials in Mohave County, Arizona, and Washington County, Utah, served five search warrants seeking records from town officers. The warrants were served on government officials and departments, including the Town Manager, David Darger, as well as Colorado City&#x27;s fire chief Jacob Barlow. As a result of the initial warrants, the Hildale Department of Public Safety was shut down, and emergency responders were prohibited from responding to calls without the approval of county officials. Firefighter Glen Jeffs indicated that the warrants referenced &quot;misuse of funds&quot;.

In response to a civil rights lawsuit by the United States Justice Department alleging that the Colorado City government, including law enforcement, was taking orders from the FLDS Church, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced in July 2012 that he was allocating funding to allow the Mohave County Sheriff&#x27;s Department to provide daily patrols in the town.

On March 20, 2014, a jury hearing the case of &quot;Cooke et al v. Colorado City, Town of et al&quot; ruled that the towns of Colorado City and Hildale had discriminated against Ronald and Jinjer Cooke because they were not members of the FLDS Church. The Cookes were awarded $5.2 million for &quot;religious discrimination&quot;. The Cooke family had moved to the Short Creek area in 2008 but were refused access to utilities by the towns of Colorado City and Hildale. As a result of the ruling, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne issued a press release stating that he &quot;wants to eradicate discrimination in two polygamous towns&quot; and believes that the court ruling will give him the tools to do it.

<doc id="106672" wikidata="Q931331" url="?curid=106672" title="Dolan Springs, Arizona">
<text>Dolan Springs is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Mohave County, Arizona, United States. The population was 1,989 at the 2020 census, down from 2,033 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Dolan Springs is located in north-central Mohave County at (35.615835, -114.260804). U.S. Route 93 forms the western boundary of the community, which extends northeast across Detrital Valley and into a smaller valley between the Cerbat Mountains to the south and Table Mountain Plateau to the north. The town center is northeast of US 93, along County Highway 25 (Pierce Ferry Road). US 93 leads southeast to Kingman, the Mohave county seat, and northwest to Boulder City, Nevada.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Dolan Springs CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 1,734 people living in the CDP, for a population density of 29.8 people per square mile (11.5/km2). There were 1,320 housing units, of which 837, or 63.4%, were occupied.

About 25% of the population were employed, and 14% of the population had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

==Education==
The CDP is in the Kingman Unified School District.

==Emergency services==
EMS response in the Dolan Springs area can take hours. The Lake Mohave Ranchos Fire District LMRFD has one ambulance that covers 2200 square miles of Mohave County. The LMRFD ambulance covers the first 50 miles of US93 from milepost one at Hoover Dam to milepost 50 near Dolan springs, and from the Hualapai Indian reservation to the Nevada Arizona border at the Colorado River.

The LMRFD has a couple volunteer firefighters with no emergency medical training and two paid firefighter EMT&#x27;s who are first out for fire protection, but also drive the ambulance, at times creating an either-or-or-situation.

The section of US Route 93 in Arizona was ranked as the most dangerous highway in the U.S. This 200-mile-long road runs between Wickenburg, Arizona, and the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge, also known as the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, near Nevada&#x27;s border. Many drivers use this route when driving between Las Vegas and Phoenix. Most of the fatal crashes occur along the segment in Mohave County, Arizona. Overall, 70 fatal crashes reportedly took place on this highway from 2010 to 2016.

Recent changes to the intersection of US93 and Pierce Ferry, the road to the Grand Canyon West, and the addition of several truck stops on US93 North of Dolan Springs have made the highway far more dangerous. Slow speed trucks entering and crossing US93 create a situation ripe for high-speed crashes. In 2022 there have been several fatal crashes between milepost-1 and milepost-50 on US93.

===Response Times===
Response times can be long in the LMRFD, at times taking hours for EMS to arrive. If the LMRFD is responding to a call in Meadview when you have an accident near Hover Dam, it can take over four hours for EMS to arrive. 
It would take 40 minutes for the LMRFD ambulance to respond to the call in Meadview, another 20 minutes to assess and load the patient, an hour to transport the patient to the hospital in Kingman, and 20 minutes to unload the patient. Once they clear the hospital it would take an hour to respond to your accident near Hoover Dam, 20–40 minutes on-scene, and an hour to transport you to the hospital in Kingman. The total time to transport you to the definitive care of a physician is 4 hours and 50 minutes. Medical helicopters do respond to accidents on US93, but protocols don&#x27;t allow them to transport a patient until a firefighter from the LMRFD arrives and assesses the patient.

===Average Response Times===
Emergency medical service units average more than 14 minutes in rural settings, with nearly 1 of 10 encounters waiting almost a half hour for the arrival of EMS personnel. Longer EMS response times have been associated with worse outcomes in trauma patients. &quot;NOTE The study excluded all encounters with arrival times 120 minutes or longer as these outliers were not representative of the general EMS experience. Some LMRFD EMS calls would have been excluded under these criteria&quot;.

Problems within the LMRFD going from six advanced life support ambulances and many volunteers to one ambulance and a handful of volunteers, but still covering 2200 Square Miles Blog Life and Death in Dolan Springs the Lake Mohave Ranchos Fire District

<text>Kingman is city in and county seat of Mohave County, Arizona, United States. It is named after Lewis Kingman, an engineer for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It is located southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, and northwest of Arizona&#x27;s state capital, Phoenix. The population was 32,693 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a U.S. Navy officer in the service of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, was ordered by the U.S. War Department to build a federal wagon road across the 35th parallel. His secondary orders were to test the feasibility of the use of camels as pack animals in the Southwestern desert. Beale traveled through the present-day Kingman in 1857 surveying the road and in 1859 to build the road. Beale&#x27;s Wagon Road became part of U.S. Route 66 and later Interstate 40. Remnants of the wagon road can still be seen in White Cliffs Canyon in Kingman.

Kingman was founded in 1882 before statehood, in Arizona Territory. Situated in the Hualapai Valley between the Cerbat and Hualapai mountain ranges, Kingman had its modest beginnings as a simple railroad siding near Beale Springs. Civil engineer Lewis Kingman supervised the building of the railroad from Winslow to Beale Springs. This spring had been used by Native Americans living in the area for centuries.

The Mohave County seat was originally located in Mohave City from 1864 to 1867. In 1865, the portion of Arizona Territory west of the Colorado River was transferred to Nevada after Nevada&#x27;s statehood, and became part of Lincoln County, now Clark County, Nevada. The remaining territory of Pah-Ute County became part of Mohave County. Its seat was moved to Hardyville (now within Bullhead City) in 1867. The county seat transferred to the mining town of Cerbat in 1873, then to Mineral Park near Chloride. After some time, the county seat and all instruments were permanently moved to Kingman in 1887.

During World War II, Kingman was the site of a U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) airfield. The Kingman Army Airfield was founded at the beginning of the war as an aerial gunnery training base. It became one of the USAAF&#x27;s largest, training some 35,000 soldiers and airmen. The airfield and Kingman played a significant role in this important era of America&#x27;s history. Following the war, the Kingman Airfield was one of the largest reclamation sites for obsolete military aircraft.

Postwar, Kingman experienced growth as several major employers moved into the vicinity. In 1953, Kingman was used to detain those men accused of practicing polygamy in the Short Creek raid, which was at the time one of the largest arrests in American history. In 1955, Ford Motor Company established a proving ground (now one of the Chrysler Proving Grounds) in nearby Yucca at the former Yucca Army Airfield. Several major new neighborhoods in Kingman were developed to house the skilled workers and professionals employed at the proving ground. Likewise, the development of the Mineral Park mine near adjacent Chloride, and construction of the Mohave Generating Station in nearby Laughlin, Nevada, in 1971 contributed to Kingman&#x27;s population growth. Also, the location of a General Cable plant at the Kingman Airport Industrial Park provided steady employment.

===Kingman explosion===

The Kingman Explosion, also known as the Doxol Disaster or Kingman BLEVE, was a catastrophic boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) that occurred on July 5, 1973, during a propane transfer from a Doxol railroad car to a storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66.

Firefighters Memorial Park in Kingman is dedicated to the 11 firefighters who died in the blaze.

===1980s and on===
The 1915-built Mohave County Courthouse and 1909-built Jail were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The downtown and other areas of Kingman were evaluated for historic resources in a 1985 study, the Kingman Multiple Resources Area study. The study identified 63 historic resources in Kingman and led to many of them being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The county courthouse and jail, a 1928-built locomotive (the Santa Fe 3759), a World War II gunnery school radio tower, and about 50 various houses and other buildings in Kingman are listed on the National Register, comprising the majority of National Register listings in Mohave County.

===Climate===
Kingman sits on the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert, but it is located in a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) due to its plateau location.

<text>Lake Havasu City (, ) is a city in Mohave County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 57,144, up from 52,527 in 2010. It is served by Lake Havasu City Airport.

==History==
The community first started during World War II as Site Six, an Army Air Corps rest camp on the shores of Lake Havasu. In 1958, American businessman Robert P. McCulloch purchased of property on the east side of the lake along Pittsburgh Point, a peninsula that would eventually be transformed into an island.

After four years of planning, McCulloch Properties acquired another of federal land in the surrounding area. Lake Havasu City was established on September 30, 1963, by a resolution of the Mohave County Board of Supervisors, as the Lake Havasu Irrigation and Drainage District, making it a legal entity (the act is referenced in resolution #63-12-1).

McCulloch Properties flew in prospective residents from around the United States for free in what became a substantial air operation. To qualify, prospective customers were required to put down a fully refundable deposit. McCulloch Properties acquired over a half-dozen commercial aircraft and in 1970, bought a small charter carrier, converting the operation into its own certificated airline, McCulloch International Airlines. From 1964 through 1978, 2,702 flights were made to Lake Havasu City bringing in prospective buyers. 

Lake Havasu City was incorporated in 1978.

London Bridge crosses the narrow Bridgewater Channel that leads from Lake Havasu (a segment of the Colorado River) to Thompson Bay (also on the river). Hoping to attract tourists and prospective buyers of residential lots, McCulloch bought it for US$2.5 million from the City of London, England, when the bridge was replaced in 1968. The bridge was disassembled on contract with Sundt Construction of Tucson, and the marked stones were shipped to Lake Havasu City and reassembled by Sundt for another US$7 million. The construction took three years to complete.

McCulloch gave an acre of land in Lake Havasu City to London. When Lake Havasu City wanted to use this land for a visitors&#x27; center, London leased it back for a quit rent of a Hopi Kachina figure.

Since its inauguration on October 5, 1971, London Bridge has become the second-largest tourist attraction in Arizona, after the Grand Canyon.

===Events===
Lake Havasu City is an active event destination for a wide range of people. During spring months, the community is joined by university students for spring break. In 1995, Lake Havasu City was featured during MTV&#x27;s Spring Break coverage. Attendance during Spring Break has taken a downturn in recent years, as the city has declined to issue permits to the large party organizers.

For boaters, March to September are the prime months on Lake Havasu. The city is also home to the International World Jet Ski Final Races, multiple professional fishing tournaments, custom boat regattas, the Western Winter Blast pyrotechnics convention, Havasu 95 Speedway, the Chilln-n-Swilln Beer Festival annual charity event, the Havasu Triathlon, and the Havasu Balloon Festival &amp; Fair.

During the winter months, the community is joined by retirees from colder regions of the country and Canada. During this period, multiple events are held on McCulloch Boulevard. Typically during the second weekend of February, McCulloch Boulevard is home to Winterfest, an annual event which draws thousands of visitors and residents for two days of food, activities, entertainment, and products from over 200 vendors from across the United States.

Swackhamer and starring David Hasselhoff and Stepfanie Kramer.

The director Andy Sidaris has directed three soft-core adult films in Lake Havasu: 1989&#x27;s &quot;Savage Beach&quot;, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Guns&quot;, and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Hard Hunted&quot;.

<text>New Kingman-Butler is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Mohave County, Arizona, United States, directly north of and bordering the city of Kingman. The population was 12,907 as of the 2020 census.

==Name and history==
New Kingman-Butler was named for Leroy Butler, who was the original land developer of the unincorporated community. &quot;New Kingman&quot; was the name of the original real estate development, but it is seldom used by residents except in a historical sense. The area commonly is referred to simply as &quot;Butler&quot;. Butler is a distinct locale among the neighborhoods of Kingman.

Butler makes up a substantial amount of the land area of the Kingman area as a whole, but is unincorporated, and is governed directly by Mohave County. There have been numerous plans and attempts to annex all or parts of Butler into the city of Kingman over the years, since it is an integral part of the Kingman community, but each has failed. One major problem with annexation into Kingman is the fact that Butler does not have a developed sanitary sewer system; all residences and buildings in Butler have individual septic tanks. The costs of developing and connecting a sewer system to all customers in Butler, if annexed into Kingman, is considerable. The fiscal assets required for such an investment by the City of Kingman likely could not be raised without assessment of a primary property tax on all landowners in the city; however, no such primary parcel tax has been approved by voters.

==Geography==
New Kingman-Butler is located in central Mohave County at (35.255054, -114.020470). It is bordered to the west by an extension of the city limits of Kingman, the county seat. Downtown Kingman is to the south.

==Arts and culture==

The town has the Hualapai Lodge, a motel and a small grocery market with fuel. It is an access point to Hualapai Hilltop, to the northeast, which is the trailhead from which hikers descend an trail, with a drop of , to the town of Supai, from which Havasu Falls and other waterfalls can be visited.

Peach Springs is located on the route of the former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway) and on historic US Route 66. Route 66 brought large numbers of cross-country travellers through the town until Interstate 40 was opened to the south in 1978. I-40 diverges from Route 66 at Seligman to the east, and the two roads do not meet again until Kingman to the west. As no connecting roads join the two highways at Peach Springs, the town went from being on the beaten path to being more than thirty miles from the new main road overnight. I-40 shortened the highway distance from Kingman to Seligman by at the expense of turning villages like Truxton, Valentine and Hackberry into overnight ghost towns. Peach Springs survived as the administrative base of the Hualapai tribe but suffered irreparable economic damage.

The John Osterman Shell Station, built by a Swedish immigrant in 1929, closed soon after the turn of the millennium. In 2007, the Hualapai Tribe received a $28,000 federal matching grant to rehabilitate the building, which has yet to re-open but which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

==In popular culture==
Peach Springs served as one of the inspirations for the fictional town of Radiator Springs in the Disney-Pixar movie &quot;Cars.&quot; The creators of the movie took a research trip along Route 66, visiting many small towns and drawing inspiration from their unique character and charm.

==Education==
It is within the Peach Springs Unified School District. At one time it had its own high school, Music Mountain Junior/Senior High School.

Valentine Elementary School District has its single K-8 school with a Peach Springs postal address, but the school is physically in Truxton. No part of the Peach Springs CDP is in that district.

==Environmental movement==
In 1988, Waste-Tech Services, Inc. approached and was approved by the tribal government of Dilkon, Arizona to build a $40 million recycling plant. It was hoped this project could bring 200 jobs to Dilkon; an area with 75% unemployment at this point. Further research revealed to the community that the recycling plant would instead be a toxic waste dump where waste was trucked in from California, Nevada, and Colorado to be burned in Dilkon. Public outrage built when it was discovered that medical human waste, including amputated limbs, would also be burned at this location. The Navajo believe that the dead are to be respected and this process appeared to them extremely disrespectful.
To combat the possibility of a Waste-Tech Services, Inc. facility, the citizens created the organization Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment (CARE). Co-founded by Lori Goodman and Abe Plummer, CARE was able to reduce the project’s credibility in Dilkon. On February 25, 1989, Waste-Tech Services, Inc. and its partner company High-Tech Recycling, Inc. put on a public hearing and brought in a panel of engineers to discuss the project, in hopes of gaining back public favor. The final citizen’s vote was ninety-nine opposed to the project, six for the project. On March 6, tribal leaders unanimously rescinded their approval of the project. CARE had successfully blocked the possibility of a toxic waste dump on their land.
Shortly after this success other Navajo grassroots environmental groups began to form to fight the overwhelming environmental racism stacked against them. Due to the lower lack of wealth and education on American Indian reservations, and their status as a minority, the U.S. government has allowed the encroachment of mining and energy companies for over 40 years to develop the Diné lands, creating environmental and health devastation and loss of aquifer water resources. CARE found that its success could benefit the other struggling organizations, so they banded together into a conglomerate environmental group representing all of the Navajo people, called Diné CARE. (Diné simply means &quot;The People&quot; and it is what the Navajo call themselves.)

<text>Heber-Overgaard is a census-designated place (CDP) in Navajo County, Arizona, United States. Situated atop the Mogollon Rim, the community lies at an elevation of . The population was 2,898 at the 2020 census. Heber and Overgaard are technically two unincorporated communities, but as of the 1990 census, their proximity led to the merged name of &quot;Heber-Overgaard&quot;.

Heber was settled in 1883, by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and the town is named after either Heber J. Grant or Heber C. Kimball, both prominent members of the LDS church. Overgaard, adjoining Heber, was settled ca. 1936 and was named after the owner of the first sawmill, Kristen Kristensen (Chris) Overgaard.

Heber-Overgaard&#x27;s early economy was founded on dry farming and ranching while tourism, retirement and timbering are the basis for present day industry.

==History==

===Founding===

In March 1873, Mormon pioneers from Utah were sent to the Little Colorado River area under the direction of Horton D. Height. In 1876, a large group of these settlers established four settlements on the Little Colorado River, which they named Brigham City, Sunset, Obed and Allen&#x27;s Camp (Joseph City). In Allen&#x27;s Camp, a dam had been built on the Little Colorado River in April, but high waters in July washed it out. By August, many settlers had returned to Utah. Eight married couples and six single men were all that remained in Allen&#x27;s Camp. By 1882, the Obed settlement had collapsed and both Brigham City and Sunset were near collapse due to several years of drought. At this time, John Bushman, of Allen&#x27;s Camp, was sent by Lot Smith, then president of the Little Colorado Stake, to scout the forests to the south in anticipation of relocation. Dry farming in the forested mountains was thought to be easier due to higher rain fall, lush grasses, and plentiful timber.

On December 6, 1882, Bushman set out for the forest with five brethren: W.C. Allen; J.H. Richards; J.C. Hansen; H. Tanner; and J.E. Shelley. Upon arrival they began digging wells in search of water. These men were later joined by Hans Nielson, Lehi Heward and John Scarlet. By April 13, 1883, two cabins had been built and grain planted, but only four families remained (Lehi Heward, John Scarlet, Hans Nielson, and James Shelley). John Bushman never settled in the area, but he and his family contributed time and encouragement to the local settlers. The first summer, houses were built, land cleared, and corrals constructed. Crops were planted not only for food, but also to barter for goods that could not be made at home. The growing season was four months long.

In 1887, Lehi Heward abandoned the settlement and relocated to Pine, Arizona. He was urged to do so, because of the Pleasant Valley War. Buckskin Canyon, where he had settled, was named after the buckskin chaps his wife Elisabeth had made for him. John Scarlet was next to leave in 1888. His wife Lulu had become ill in June 1885. This may have contributed to his subsequent departure. In 1887, he was mentioned to have joined the posses of Joe McKiney&#x27;s, under-sheriff for C.P. Owens. In 1889, Nathan, Alva, and Samuel Uriah Porter, arrived in Heber from St. Joseph (Joseph City). They grew crops of corn and potatoes between Heber and St. Joseph. The following year brought the Penrod and Sharp families from nearby Wilford. Samuel Porter would later describe the Penrods as anti-Mormon, and the Sharps as dishonest. In 1898, Hans Nielson abandoned his estate on the west bank of the Black Canyon where today&#x27;s SR 260 enters town. Childless, Hans Nielson had been the first presiding elder for what became the Heber branch of the Joseph City Ward. James Shelley homesteaded land comprising the center of Heber and south down the Black Canyon. Of the original four pioneer families, starting out with four head of cattle, three daughters, and a few worldly possessions, James and Margaret Shelley were the only family to make Heber a long-term commitment.

===Early Heber===

In 1882, Heber J. Grant was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Early on in his service in the quorum he made many trips to Arizona earning the title &quot;The Arizona Apostle&quot;. On one such trip, he passed through the settlement on his way to Phoenix, and stayed with the Shelleys in their cabin. The townspeople latter named their settlement after Mr. Grant.

An alternative version of Heber&#x27;s namesake history is that John W. N. Scarlett named the settlement after Heber C. Kimball, former Chief Justice of the State of Deseret.

The post office in Heber was established in 1890, and on September 11, 1890, James Shelley was appointed the first postmaster of Heber. Mail was brought by buckboard every Wednesday from Holbrook to Heber. It was then sorted and distributed. This duty was performed by James Shelley, in addition to being a farmer, cattleman, husband and father.

Marion and Clarence Owens came to farm in Heber with their families in 1891. The following year, two practicing polygamists arrived from Utah to escape prosecution. One was called &quot;Brother Luck&quot;. In 1893, Joseph Porter arrived in Heber to help his brother, Samuel Porter, with his farm. Also in 1893, John Nelson occupied a ranch in Brookbank Canyon, and the Baca family had settled near the head of Black Canyon. John Nelson and partner, Nicholas Valentine, were in the sheep business, and the Porters hauled their wool to the Holbrook railroad. Nicholas Valentin died four years later from a rabies bite acquired from a skunk.

Many settlements were located in the fertile cattle ranching and farmlands of Black Canyon. Potatoes, corn, milk, eggs and large gardens were the livelihood of many families. Potato fields could be found down Buckskin Canyon, near the present day &quot;Buckskin Artist Community&quot;. Cornfields and large gardens could be found where the present day High School ball fields and &quot;Tenney&#x27;s Trailer Park&quot; are located. All available land near town and in forests clearings was converted to farmland. Wilford, Jersey Gulch, Baca ranch and present day &quot;Potato Patch&quot; were favorite locations.

During this time period, locals were said to be fearful of the Apache Native Americans. Food was said to be given to all natives, that passed through town, in order to &quot;keep the peace&quot;. At this time, travel to and from St. Joseph was sometimes perilous due to outlaws and quicksand. Horses were the primary mode of transportation, and horse thieves were a major problem.

On August 28, 1895, Joseph Porter and Mary Maude Shelley were married. Many locals with the surname of Porter, can trace their family roots to them. In 1896 Samuel, Alva and Nathan Porter divided up their farm. In addition to farming, Samuel Porter was often called upon to administer to the residents of Heber to alleviate pain and suffering by using prayer and petitions. A drought affected the residents of Heber that Summer, followed by crop destroying hail storms in August. In January 1897, Wickliff Bushman, while delivering mail to Heber from Holbrook during a snow storm, contracted the measles and died at 23 years old. Three of Samuel Porter&#x27;s children also contracted the disease, but survived. Margaret Shelley had twin boys that June, but only one son survived.
In 1891 John Hoyle, Johann Frederick Heil, an immigrant from Baden, Germany, and former cook for the Hashknife Outfit, opened the first Heber store. He was called &quot;Hoyle&quot; rather than &quot;Heil&quot; because some cowboys had trouble pronouncing his name. In addition to his store, he had a farm located down Buckskin Wash. John Hoyle had relocated to Heber from the failed Wilford, Arizona settlement, 7 miles south of Heber, where he had a store and ranch. Samuel Porter helped him on his farm, and hauled freight to and from Holbrook. He ran the store until his death on August 2, 1912, of paralysis (possibly polio). He had no heirs to claim the land in the United States. Through a German consulate, twenty-eight distant heirs were located and $3,046 was divided among them.

May 1898 was so dry that water was hauled from wells in Wilford for household use. Heber wells still had enough for livestock. A small reservoir had been built below town, and filled up when water ran down the Black Canyon. A diversion dam was built to divert water from the wash to the ditch. When the rains finally came in July, the Independence Day celebration had cause for additional celebration. Residents celebrated by firing guns, fire crackers, Pie Nie, and a dance that evening. Years later, The 4th of July would remain just as large a celebration in Heber. Alva Porter&#x27;s Farm eventually became the rodeo grounds, where present day Mogollon High School sits. During celebrations, the community roped calves, rode bucking horses, held pistol shooting contests, foot races, and dances.

===20th century===

Alva Porter was married to Charlotte Shelly, in 1899, and homesteaded just north of Heber in the Black Canyon. In 1901, Samuel Porter handed his farm over to his brother Alva, and departed from Heber. Porter&#x27;s farm was located where today&#x27;s Tenney trailer park, and the Mogollon ball fields stand.

In 1904, severe drought caused hundreds of cattle belonging to the Aztec Land and Cattle Co. to die from thirst and hunger. During the spring, drinking water had to be hauled from 15 miles away. Many pioneers became disheartened and left the area. In late June, James Shelly and 2 sons desperately drove their cattle to &quot;Blue Lake&quot;, found on the Apache reservation. They remained there until the rains came on July 20. Despite trespassing, the natives gave them no trouble.

In 1912, after John Hoyle&#x27;s death, Alva Porter purchased much of John Hoyle&#x27;s merchandise and he and his brother-in-law Thomas Shelley started a new store close to John Hoyle&#x27;s old one. Alva eventually sold his share to Thomas who ran the store with his wife, Eva Tanner, until 1957. The store would later become the &quot;Heber Country Store&quot; and later &quot;IGA Supermarket&quot;.

In 1916, James, and Margaret Shelley returned to Joseph City, their final home. Three Shelley children: Sarah Ellen Shelley (husband Harvey Wimmer), Walter Shelley (wife Roxie Smith), and Eliza Marie Shelley (husband Loran Webb) joined them later. Two Shelley children: Amon Shelley (wife Elva Bigler), and John Edward Shelley (wife Fern Oliver), remained in Heber.

Joseph Porter and Maude Shelley were granted a patent on John Hoyle&#x27;s land in 1920. They homesteaded this land located in Buckskin Wash, just south of the Black Canyon. Thomas Shelly homesteaded south of Joseph Porter in Buckskin wash. Maude Shelley would later die in 1929.
By the 1930s, Heber had become a logging town. Horses were used to haul logs up until 1965. Logging and ranching were the predominant industries until the mid-90s, at which time the Mexican spotted owl injunction was put on the Sitgreaves National Forest. Bill Porter built the first sawmill in Heber just south of present-day HWY260 along the Black Canyon. This ran until 1935 when it burned down. In 1946 Lorin Donald (Donnie) Porter relocated his &quot;Wagon Draw&quot; sawmill to Heber. It ran until 1984 when a change of ownership was soon followed by bankruptcy.

In the year 1900, when Kristen Kristensen &quot;Chris&quot; Overgaard was 19 years old, he moved to the United States with the intention of earning his living in the lumber mill business. He was born March 23, 1881, the second son of a Danish family, in a little Danish town called Veddum, in Aalborg County, Denmark. After two or three years in Nebraska, he returned to Denmark where he became a carpenter. Before he left Denmark again in 1910, he owned a sawmill in Solbjerg, Aalborg County, Denmark. Before Chris Overgaard&#x27;s time in Overgaard Camp (later Overgaard Village), Navajo County, Arizona, he lived in and owned a sawmill in Keystone, South Dakota. His first wife Jensine Kirstine Dehn died in october 1930. In 1931 he married Lilian Hansen, born in Lincoln Township, Johnson County, Nebraska January 17, 1904. In 1935 Chris Overgaard he broke up the sawmill in Keystone. From South Dakota, Chris Overgaard moved to Arizona in 1936, &quot;lured by the lush stands of Ponderosa&quot;. Modular mill pieces were hauled by train to nearby Holbrook, and then transported by wagon to &quot;Overgaard’s stop&quot;. Originally called &quot;Oklahoma Flats&quot;, the town later changed its name in honor of Mr. Overgaard. The sawmill was assembled across SR 260 from the present day &quot;Overgaard Food Center&quot;. Mr. Overgaard ran the sawmill until financial reversals resulted in its sale. He then moved with his wife, Lillian and there son Chris Lee born in april 1939, to Ripley Ohio, and he lived to the age of 85. The sawmill was eventually replaced by a senior center that was later lost in the Rodeo–Chediski Fire in the summer of 2002. The &quot;Rim Country Senior/Community Center&quot; has since been rebuilt. The post office in Overgaard was established on October 14, 1938. William T. Shockley served as the first postmaster in 1938, followed by Christ Overgaard in 1939.

On February 1, 1971, the local Sheriff&#x27;s Posse formed a committee to promote the construction of a Fire Department for the Heber-Overgaard area. By March of the same year, land was secured for the location of the new Fire Department. In February 1972, the Sheriff Posse disbanded because some members had moved out of the area. In early 1973, the newly formed American Legion Post 86 took over the task of forming a Fire Department and Fire District for the area. They were able to obtain the signatures necessary to have an election called to form a Fire District. A petition was put together and used to propose the formation of a Fire District to the County Board of Supervisors. The American Legion put up the necessary funds to have an election. On June 4, 1973, by unanimous vote, the Heber-Overgaard Fire District was established. It had an area of 102 square miles. On June 14, Ivan Wilson was elected as the first Fire Chief of the new District and Larry Rhodes as the Secretary-Treasurer. Walt Downs and John Shaffery Sr. were the first two men to sign up as Firefighters.

The first Fourth of July parade was held in 1976. Since its inaugural year, the parade has become one of Heber&#x27;s most popular ways to celebrate independence day, drawing crowds upwards of 20,000. In recent years, the parade and fireworks displays have been moved to the weekend nearest the 4th of July as a convenience to non-locals.

On July 4, 1980, Les Parham, of Heber-Overgaard, put on his first of 39 years worth of fireworks displays, his last being on July 6, 2019. Fundraising was spearheaded by the Heber-Overgaard Chamber of Commerce and was solely paid for by the contributions of viewers who enjoyed the show. The first show was held in what was once known as the Porter softball field, SW corner of Parkview and HW260, to an audience of several hundred. A country fried steak dinner fundraiser was held to cover expenses. Today, an audience in the thousands views the display at the Mogollon High School fields. This is primarily paid for by parking lot donations at the Tall Timbers County Park festivities and the Mogollon High School fireworks display.

In 1988, Heber-Overgaard celebrated its first Oktoberfest event at Tall Timbers County Park. Originally taking place in October, the festivities were eventually moved to September as a convenience to seasonal visitors. The event primarily consists of food, live music, a beer garden and arts and crafts booths.

On August 24, 1995, federal Judge Carl Muecke ordered the 11 national forests of Arizona and New Mexico to halt all logging until their forest plans adequately protect the Mexican spotted owl. The injunction was placed after a lawsuit was filed by Robin Silver, conservation chairman of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity. The controversial shutdown affected 8 large mills, several small mills and hundreds of jobs. Many Heber-Overgaard residents were forced to relocate and find work elsewhere. Black ribbons were placed throughout town to raise awareness of the situation, and to show support for the loggers and their families. Environmentalists argued that &quot;jobs would vanish no matter what, for if cutting continued at its current rate, the old-growth forests would be gone within thirty years and the mills forced to close anyhow&quot;. The forests remained closed for over eight years. In 2002, the Parker Mill, in Clay Springs (16 miles away), and the Snowflake Mill (35 miles east) were two of the first mills to start up again.

===21st century===

In 2002, the Rodeo–Chediski Fire was a wildfire that burned in Heber-Overgaard beginning on June 18, 2002, and was not controlled until July 7. It was the second worst forest fire in Arizona to date, destroying 268 structures in Heber-Overgaard, (mainly in Overgaard) and consuming . Overgaard was evacuated for nearly two weeks while the fire was fought.

Founded in 2005 and opening to the public in 2017, the Apache-Sitgreaves Observatory offers public viewing of the night sky using the largest dedicated public telescope in Arizona. The 36-inch diameter telescope at Apache-Sitgreaves Observatory, bordering the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest on Overgaard&#x27;s east side, has some of the darkest skies and is the closest observatory to the Phoenix metro area.

Today, Heber-Overgaard has evolved into a retirement and tourism destination. Recreational and lifestyle activities such as hiking and fishing can be enjoyed in the summer, and cross-country skiing in the winter. With a four-seasons climate, the town is a haven for those wishing to escape the heat of Phoenix. Land ownership in the Heber-Overgaard area is private, but surrounded by federally owned lands. , nearly 66% of the houses are second homes. While the full-time resident population is 2,822, summertime population numbers climb to nearly 12,000.

* The country rock band &quot;Mogollon&quot; was formed in Overgaard in the early 1980s. The group&#x27;s name was derived from the nearby Mogollon Rim. What was once &quot;a good way for a few high school buddies to impress the girls and to combat the boredom of a small town&quot; soon turned into &quot;one of the Premier Country Rock Entertainment groups in the West.&quot; Mogollon has performed at Heber-Overgaard&#x27;s annual Independence Day fireworks festivities on numerous occasions.
* On November 5, 1975, logger Travis Walton was allegedly abducted by a UFO while working with a logging crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. He was found five days later at a Heber gas station. He was not naked, as is popularly believed. The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the &quot;best-known instances of alleged alien abduction&quot;. His book about the alleged alien encounter, &quot;The Walton Experience&quot; (1978), was loosely adapted into the movie &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (1993) by Paramount Pictures.
* The Heber area is mentioned in the book, &quot;Weird Arizona&quot;, as being a prominent site for supposed Mogollon Monster (bigfoot) encounters.

<text>Holbrook () is a city in Navajo County, Arizona, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city was 5,053. The city is the county seat of Navajo County.

Holbrook was founded in 1881 or 1882, when the railroad was built, and named to honor the first chief engineer of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, Henry Randolph Holbrook.

==History==

The Holbrook area was inhabited first by the Ancestral Puebloans, then Puebloans, then the Navajo and Apache. In 1540 Coronado searched for the Seven Cities of Cibola and camped some east of Holbrook. Coronado sent an expedition west to find the Colorado River, and they crossed the Little Colorado some east of Holbrook and found a wonderland of colors they named &quot;El Desierto Pintada&quot; – The Painted Desert. The expedition was then led by the Hopis to the Grand Canyon.

=== U.S. settlements ===
After the Mexican–American War ended in 1848 the area was ceded to the United States. From 1851 to 1857 the U.S. Army sent three expeditions along the 35th parallel, the third led by Lt. Beale who created a wide wagon road. The area was known as Navajo Springs, after a spring a dozen miles northeast of Holbrook. Soon afterwards a store and saloon were established at the confluence of the Rio Puerco and Little Colorado Rivers two miles east of Holbrook, and the area became known as Horsehead Crossing.

In 1876, Mormons emigrated from Utah and began settlements near Horsehead Crossing on both the Little Colorado and Rio Puerco rivers. During 1881 and 1882, railroad tracks were laid down and a railroad station was built to supply wood and water and to freight supplies south to Fort Apache. The community was then named Holbrook after the first engineer of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. The railroad sold a million acres to a Boston investment group which established the Aztec Land and Cattle Company, better known as the Hashknife Outfit. It leased another million acres of government land and became one of the largest cattle ranches to ever exist. Holbrook became its headquarters and quickly grew into a cow-town.

=== Wild west cow-town ===
The Hashknife Outfit hired cowboys, many of whom were wanted men hiding from arrest. Rustling of cattle and horses over two million acres plagued the Hashknife Outfit. With cowmen, sheepmen, farmers, rustlers and outlaws competing for the same land, a range war ensued, called both the Pleasant Valley War and the Tonto Basin War. It likely killed as many men as any of the western range wars. Many of the events that played out during the Pleasant Valley War up to 1887 occurred in and around Holbrook, including the famous Holbrook Shootout.

=== Holbrook shootout ===
On September 4, 1887, Commodore Perry Owens, the Apache County Sheriff, came to Holbrook to arrest Andy Blevins, a.k.a. Andy Cooper, for horse theft. Blevins had also recently bragged about killing two men and had killed many more, including two lawmen.

Sheriff Owens insisted on confronting the Blevins brothers alone, knowing there would likely be a shootout. He went to the Blevins&#x27; house, which still stands, knocked on the door, and when Blevins asked what he wanted, announced he&#x27;d come to arrest him. Blevins resisted arrest and a shootout occurred. Blevins, two brothers, a friend, and Blevins&#x27; horse were shot; all died, except one brother.

Owens emerged unscathed, despite being shot at from a half-dozen feet (2 m) away. Owens single-handedly taking on four men made him a western legend rivaling the Earp Brothers and Texas John Slaughter as lawmen of the Old West.

=== Later development ===
Holbrook was known as &quot;the town too tough for women and churches&quot; and in 1914 was said to be the only county seat in the U.S. that didn&#x27;t have a church (the Mormons had moved 25 miles (40 km) south to Snowflake and Taylor). The original railroad station was replaced by the Santa Fe Depot in 1892.

Navajo County was divided off of Apache County in 1895 and Holbrook became the county seat. Many lawmen and cowboys from the area became Rough Riders with Theodore Roosevelt in the late 1800s. But by 1902, The Hashknife Outfit was bankrupt and the land was sold to the Babbitt brothers.

President Roosevelt named the Petrified Forest (including part of the Painted Desert) a National Monument in 1906. Holbrook was incorporated in 1917. Most of the Beale Wagon Road became Route 66 in 1926 and passed through both the Petrified Forest and Holbrook. Tourism started taking over the economy.

=== Holbrook meteorite ===
Arizona is famous for its huge Meteor Crater, but Holbrook also witnessed its own small meteor event. In the evening of July 19, 1912, a smoke trail appeared in the sky and soon after, at 7:15 p.m., a meteorite with an estimated mass of 190 kilograms (419 pounds) exploded high in the atmosphere.

An estimated 16,000 or more minor fragments rained down over Navajo County in an area approximately east of Holbrook. The primary explosion was heard at least away, and one of the witnesses in Holbrook, then 17-year-old Pauline McCleve, described the event as the loudest sound she ever heard. The largest piece of the Holbrook Meteorite that has been recovered was found shortly after. It weighs and resides at Arizona State University in Tempe.

The Holbrook meteorite was found to be of the chondrite (stony) type.

Jeddito is a part of the Cedar Unified School District.

The Navajo name of Jádító (Antelope Water) was derived from nearby watering points, which were frequently used by antelopes. Most families living within the Jeddito &quot;island&quot; are members of the extended families who were forcefully evicted from the old Hopi Reservation (District 6) in September and October 1944. This marked the first mass relocation of Navajos determined to be living on the wrong side of the Navajo-Hopi boundary. The portion referred to as Jeddito &quot;island&quot; is totally surrounded by the Hopi Partitioned Land. Another segment of the chapter&#x27;s land base is part of the main Navajo reservation on the Apache County side. The &quot;island&quot; part is situated exclusively in Navajo County.

White Cone High School served Jeddito until the closure of the school in 2012.

<text>Keams Canyon (Hopi: Pongsikya or Pongsikvi; ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Navajo County, Arizona, United States, on the Hopi Reservation. The population was 304 at the 2010 census.

Pongsikya is a narrow box canyon that is named after a plant of edible greens that survived along the seasonal stream that drains from Antelope Mesa and flows through the long canyon.
Here William Keam, and then his cousin Thomas Keam, operated a trading post during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. They served the Navajo Indians and opened the door to commercial trade for the Hopi Indians. The nearest trading post was some away and Keam&#x27;s trading post was east of the Hopi Indian&#x27;s settlements on First Mesa.
With the opportunity for full year round trade nearby, the regional Indians quickly identified the canyon with the traders and the name Keams Canyon took hold.

==Transportation==
Winslow is served by Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport (IATA: INW, ICAO: KINW), originally constructed by Transcontinental Air Transport; however, there is no commercial airline service. The airport was designed by Charles Lindbergh, who stayed in Winslow during its construction. At the time it was the only commercial airport between Albuquerque and Los Angeles.

Winslow&#x27;s railroad station has twice-daily Amtrak service (one train eastbound and one westbound) with the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;. The city is on BNSF&#x27;s Southern Transcon route that runs between Los Angeles and Chicago, Illinois. It is also a crew change point for the railroad.

Hopi Senom Transit provides bus service from Winslow to the Hopi Reservation.

Interstate 40 runs just north of Winslow; the Business route is the historic U.S. Route 66.

==Main sights==

The historic La Posada hotel has been restored.

The nearby Meteor Crater, sometimes known as the Barringer Crater and formerly as the Canyon Diablo crater, is a famous impact crater.

Standin&#x27; on the Corner Park is a downtown park featuring murals depicting the &quot;Girl my Lord in a flatbed Ford&quot;. Winslow also has an annual Standin&#x27; On The Corner street festival, traditionally held the last week of September.

The Painted Desert and Petrified Forest are about east of Winslow. The Little Painted Desert is north of Winslow.

The 9-11 Remembrance Gardens honors those who lost their lives during the September 11 attacks. The memorial was constructed using two beams recovered from the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers in New York City. A large number of citizens donated time and money to the erection of the memorial, which was in place and celebrated on the first anniversary of the event, September 11, 2002.

==Historical events==
In the era of steam locomotives, Winslow was an important stop on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway for adding water and fuel. Passengers could disembark and have enough time to have a meal during the extended stop. During the 1920s many celebrities chose to come west to Hollywood and when they stopped in Winslow a parade took place. The local newspaper often documented these special events.

Winslow was also home to a roundhouse and maintenance depot for the Santa Fe. When the facility at Barstow, California was given the engineering responsibility for newer diesel locomotives, Winslow began its slow decline. Company brass moved out, as did other employees needed for maintenance and repairs.

In 1949 when the Shah of Iran came to America and toured some sights, he chose to come to the Grand Canyon. His plane landed at the Winslow airport and the entourage took land transport to get to the canyon.

In the 1970s, Winslow was chosen as the site of one of ten Decision Information Distribution System radio stations, designed to alert the public of an enemy attack. The system was never implemented and the station was never built.

==In popular culture==
Winslow was mentioned in the popular 1972 song &quot;Take It Easy&quot; written by Jackson Browne and Glenn Frey and performed by the Eagles.

&quot;The Crew&quot; video game featured Winslow as a location, as did its sequel &quot;The Crew 2&quot;. However, it is incorrectly called Winston, Arizona. It may have been confused with the name of a small town called Winston, New Mexico.
