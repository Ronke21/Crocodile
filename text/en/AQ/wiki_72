<text>Kingsford Heights is a town in Union Township, LaPorte County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,335 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Michigan City, Indiana-La Porte, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. Also known as &quot;Victory City,&quot; the town was built by the United States government for workers that worked in the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant, an ammunitions plant that served the US during World War II and later the Korean War.

==History==
During World War I, the U.S. east coast munitions plants faced devastating accidents and sabotage, prompting grave concerns among military planners in the late 1930s. To mitigate these risks and expand output, establishing inland facilities became a priority. In line with this strategy, the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant was established in 1940, playing a crucial role in the effort.

One of the primary challenges was accommodating the anticipated 10,000 workers and their families, considering LaPorte County&#x27;s total population was only 16,000 in 1940. Federal planners responded by creating an entire village near the plant, originally named Victory City, which later became Kingsford Heights in 1942.

The original plans for Kingsford Heights included 3000 homes, along with several businesses, civic buildings, schools, a community center, and a park. However, with the conclusion of World War II and soon after, the Korean War, the development of Kingsford Heights ceased as the ordnance plant closed, and many workers relocated for new job opportunities.

Despite the halt in development, the remaining residents purchased the land from the government and incorporated the town to sustain local services. They also opted to rename the town from Victory City to Kingsford Heights.

Kingsford Heights bears resemblance to other Federal projects like Penderlea Homesteads in North Carolina and to a lesser degree, Greenbelt, Maryland; Greendale, Wisconsin; and Greenhills, Ohio. While these projects often featured multi-family units, Kingsford Heights primarily consisted of single houses. The planning aspect of Kingsford Heights remains highly significant, reflected in the inclusion of the entire community within its boundary, even encompassing lots without houses.

<text>La Porte () is a city in LaPorte County, Indiana, United States, of which it is the county seat. Its population was estimated to be 21,341 in 2022. It is one of the two principal cities of the Michigan City-La Porte, Indiana metropolitan statistical area, which is included in the Chicago–Naperville–Michigan City, Illinois–Indiana–Wisconsin combined statistical area.

La Porte is located in northwest Indiana, east of Gary, and west of South Bend. It was first settled by European Americans in 1832. The city is twinned with Grangemouth in Scotland.

==History==
The settlement of La Porte was established in July 1832. Abraham P. Andrew, one of the purchasers of the site, constructed the first sawmill in that year. The first settler arrived in October, building a permanent cabin just north of what would become the courthouse square.

After the US extinguished land claims by the Potowatomi and other historic tribes of the area by treaty and removal to Indian Territory, in 1833, a federal land office was established in La Porte. People came to this office from newly established surrounding counties to buy land from the government, including Solon Robinson, founder of Crown Point. The office was moved to Winamac in 1839.

By 1835, the settlement had grown to the extent that La Porte was incorporated as a town. A newspaper was established in 1836. La Porte Medical School, the first of its kind in the Midwest, was founded in 1842.

By 1852, La Porte had become a well-established settlement of considerable size for its time and vicinity, with 5,000 residents. In that same year, it was granted a city charter by the Indiana General Assembly, and the first mayor was elected. La Porte continued to grow, attracting numerous, diverse industries, the largest of which became the Advance-Rumely Company. Advance-Rumely developed and manufactured the Oil-Pull tractor engine, considered to have played a pivotal role in the agricultural development of the Great Plains. By 1869, Advance-Rumely was the largest employer in La Porte.

During the 1850s, numerous maple trees were planted along Indiana and Michigan Avenues in the city by local resident Sebastian Lay. Subsequently, La Porte became known as the &quot;Maple City&quot;. Today, Indiana and Michigan Avenues comprise a historic district in the city, containing many homes and other structures of architectural and historical interest. Between 1892 and 1894, the third and current LaPorte county courthouse was erected at a cost of $300,000. The structure is built of red sandstone from Lake Superior, shipped by boat to Michigan City and then by rail to La Porte. The courthouse is considered to be one of La Porte&#x27;s best-known structures. In 2007 the exterior of the building was extensively restored at a cost of $2.9 million.

==Parks and recreation==

La Porte has an extensive city park district.

*Allesee Park, (Boyd Boulevard) – is a 6-acre neighborhood park on the south side of the city. It was developed adjacent to a housing subdivision to provide recreational facilities to the neighborhood. The Park was named after George Allesee Sr (18989-1968), long time Physical Director of the La Porte YMCA who also broadcast La Porte Slicers Games on the Radio for 50 years. The park includes a baseball diamond, basketball half-court, benches, parking, playground, and a walking track. Improvements were made in 2000 thanks to a donation by one of his sons to the La Porte Park Foundation.
*Ben Rees Park, (Scott Street) – is a 1.5-acre parcel that is half of a square block located near the Civic Auditorium. The park was the site of the Fourth Ward School in the early 1900s. The school was demolished in the 1920s and the property was donated to the city in the 1940s. The park was named in honor of Ben C. Rees, a local attorney and school board member. A new playground, basketball court and gazebo shelter were installed through the help of community volunteers and contributions.
*Bill Reed Tennis Complex (2150 A Street) – features several tennis courts, parking, water fountains and a pavilion.
*Charles W. Lindewald Park, (Park Street) – is considered La Porte&#x27;s first park. A parcel of land, 9.4 acres on Lower Lake, was purchased in 1890. The original parcel contained a notable grove of white oaks, of which a few stands of this native timber still remains. Facilities include a picnic shelter with grills, playground, restrooms, water fountains, ball diamond, basketball half-court and 12 lighted horseshoe pits, which are home to the La Porte Horseshoe Pitches Association.
*Clarke Field, (Farrand Avenue) – is a two square block area of 6 acres that was a donation to the city in the late 1930s. The park is generally surrounded with tall, mature fir evergreen trees that provide a buffer for the adjacent residential areas. The main recreational usage at Clarke Field are two ball diamonds, one used primarily by the La Porte High School junior varsity and La Porte Babe Ruth Baseball and the other for younger age levels. The park also contains a playground, ball diamonds, a concession stand, water fountains, and public restrooms.
*Fox Memorial Park, (Truesdale Avenue) – originally started in 1911 with only 15 acres, has grown today to 170 acres. In the early 1900s, flowers, shrubs, and trees were planted to further beautify the hills of mature oak, hawthorn and wild apple. The entire park was landscaped and strolling paths developed. Fox Memorial Park includes Clear Lake, which encompasses approximately 100 acres of the total park. The trees planted in the early 1900s have matured and additional recreational facilities have been developed at the park. The park has ball diamonds, including Ron Reed Field; basketball; playgrounds; picnic shelters with grills; fishing; boating; water fountains; walking and fitness trials; and Thrills ‘n’ Spills Skate Park. The park also contains the Dennis F. Smith Amphitheatre, home to events such as the Arts in the Park program.
*Hastings Park (Monroe St.) – is a small park, featuring a playground and benches.
*Kesling Park (2150 A Street) – is located on the southern edge of the community. It started with a small 2-acre land donation and has since grown through additional donations by the Kesling family to the present day size of 90 acres. Today, residents from all of La Porte enjoy the modern facilities including four ball diamonds, six tennis courts, a walking and nature trail, soccer fields, basketball courts, sledding hill and picnic shelters. The park also contains Fort La Play Porte, a large community-built playground.
*Koomler Park (Miller Street) – covers 4 acres in southern La Porte. It was initially a play area developed by the federal government in the 1940s for children of the workers at the Kingsbury Ordinance Plant. In 1962, this land was transferred to the city for exclusive use as a park. Today, Koomler Park serves the residents of Maple Terrace and offers a ball diamond, basketball court and playground.
*LaPark (1st Street) – is adjacent to Bethany Lutheran Church.
*Rumley Park (Home Street) is a 4-acre neighborhood park that was purchased and developed entirely with federal funds in 1980. It was actually a replacement park for the former Marquette Park, which was located four blocks away. Marquette Park was a piece of donated land that was unsuitable and unbuildable for a park. Rumley Park offers a basketball court, playground, picnic facilities and fishing.
*Scott Field (Jefferson Avenue) – was the result of another land donation of a developer. Originally, in the layout of Scott&#x27;s Second Addition, 5 acres in the middle of the new housing development was left as a neighborhood play area. The land was donated to the City of La Porte in 1923. It was not until 1952 that the Park Department entered a 99-year lease, for $1 per year, with the school corporation. The park currently includes a shelter, playground, ball diamond, open play, half-court basketball and picnic facilities.
*Soldiers Memorial Park (250 Pine Lake Ave.) – was dedicated in 1928 and contains 556 acres. It is the largest city park and known for its trees, water sports and organized recreational activities. The park encompasses all of Stone Lake, 140 acres of water and all but 628 feet of shoreline. Also the park provides a variety of active and passive recreational activities including swimming, playgrounds, diamond sports (softball, baseball and t-ball), volleyball, mountain biking, cross-country skiing, fishing and boating. The property is approximately 85 percent woodlands and water. Access is available to Stone Lake, Pine Lake, Crane Lake and Craven Pond.

==History==

The inland part of Michiana Shores was the site of the logging town of Corymbo in the 1860s and 1870s. Corymbo, located on the Michigan Central railroad, was home to a mixture of lumbermen and railroad employees. A post office was established there in 1861, but had been discontinued by 1880. The land was owned by the local Burgwald family, which sold it in the 1920s to the Long Beach Land Company.

The modern-day beach community began to be developed in the 1930s, when developers Orphie Gotto and Clarence Mathias began to build it as a log cabin town for vacationers. Many of the early residents were schoolteachers from Chicago. The town was incorporated in 1947.

Limestone from a nearby quarry, called the &quot;Empire Quarry&quot;, was used to build the Empire State Building in New York City.

Bedford area limestone was also used in the construction of the Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church located in Merrillville, Indiana.

Bedford received $500,000 in grants from the federal government to build a ten-story replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza out of local limestone; however, the work was never completed, despite a further $125,000 being allocated to finish it.

<text>Mitchell is a city in Marion Township, Lawrence County, Indiana, United States. The population was 4,350 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Mitchell was built as a railroad town in the mid-19th century. At this location in Lawrence County, the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railroad, better known by the shorter name of &quot;the Monon&quot;, was built as a north-south line from New Albany to Chicago, passing through the area which became Mitchell in 1853. In 1857, the east-west Ohio and Mississippi Railway (later part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) was completed, as part of a link between Cincinnati and St. Louis.

At the intersection of the two rail lines, a new town was planned. As the O&amp;M railroad was surveyed, the owners of the land arranged for one of the surveyors, Ormsby McKnight Mitchel (1810–1862), a West Point graduate and professor at the University of Cincinnati, to plat their new town in exchange for naming it for him. (The second &quot;L&quot; in Mitchell was added later.) A native of Kentucky, Ormsby Mitchel grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, and was also an attorney and notable astronomer. He later became a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–1865), and is best known for ordering the raid that became famous as the Great Locomotive Chase. He was known as &quot;Old Stars&quot;. General Mitchel died of yellow fever while serving in Beaufort, South Carolina. 

The town was incorporated in 1864, becoming a city in 1907. Mitchell hosted a number of manufacturers, including (in 1919) the wagon, truck and bus body enterprises of Ralph H. Carpenter which became known as the Carpenter Body Company. School bus body production continued until 1995.

In 1851, the Mitchell area was the birthplace of outlaw and train robber Sam Bass (1851–1878). He was orphaned at age 13, but was apparently engaged in lawful activities until 1877, when he became an icon of the &quot;wildness&quot; of the American Old West as he robbed banks, stagecoaches and railroad trains before being fatally wounded by Texas Rangers the following year. Despite Bass&#x27; short-lived criminal career, he is remembered as part of a robbery of gold on September 18, 1877 which remains the largest robbery in Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s history.

Mitchell was also the birthplace of astronaut Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom (1926–1967). A mechanical engineering graduate of Purdue University, he joined the United States Air Force and was selected as a member of NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury space program. Gus Grissom was the second American to fly in space on Liberty Bell 7 and also flew aboard Gemini 3. He died in a launch pad fire at Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a training exercise for Apollo 1 on January 27, 1967.

Spring Mill State Park is located just east of Mitchell. It includes a memorial to Grissom as well as several caves and a pioneer village. The buildings in the village are original structures from the former mill town that was located here, recreations of buildings in the town, and other pioneer-era buildings that were moved to the park.

The Monon became part of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Both it, and the former B&amp;O are now part of CSX Transportation&#x27;s rail network. In modern times, Mitchell is also served by the Union Pacific system.

In the late 20th century, Mitchell&#x27;s downtown area was defined as a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town developed an Urban Enterprise Zone, and industrial park, and at the end of the century, was working to attract new businesses and industry while also capitalizing on its heritage through antique shops and tourism.

The Mitchell Downtown Historic District and Mitchell Opera House are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="112443" wikidata="Q2652839" url="?curid=112443" title="Oolitic, Indiana">
<text>Oolitic is a town in Indian Creek and Shawswick townships, Lawrence County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,184 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Oolitic was platted on March 23, 1896, by the Bedford Quarries Company. It was incorporated in 1900. In 1910, its population was 1,079; in 1914 it had risen to about 2,000. Oolite is a type of limestone found in Indiana.

Oolitic is the site of a limestone statue of comic-strip boxer Joe Palooka, moved there from Bedford in 1984.

Oolitic is the opposing basketball team during the season opener in the film &quot;Hoosiers&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Oolitic has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Oolitic has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Geology==
The town is built upon oolitic limestone, which gives the town&#x27;s name. The town was founded for the purpose of quarrying this material, for building purposes.

Oolitic was originally platted as &quot;Limestone&quot; on September 26, 1888. In 1896, the name was sent to Washington, D.C., to allow a post office to be established. The request was refused because of a town already named Limestone, Indiana. Doctor R. B. Short suggested using &quot;Oolitic&quot;, and Oolitic became incorporated on November 4, 1901.
The word Oolitic was used as an adjective for oolitic limestone (derived from the Greek word oolite, meaning eggs and stone). Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and quartz, along with the small shells and eggs left behind when this area was covered by an inland sea.
Found immediately north of Oolitic are some of the largest limestone quarries in the world, many of them in continuous operation since the 1830s. Many famous buildings have been built from local oolitic limestone, including the Empire State Building. Visitors can see the &quot;Empire Hole,&quot; about half a mile north of Oolitic, where 35,017,500 pounds of limestone block were extracted in 1931 and shipped to Manhattan for the 102-story building. The Empire Hole was also the source of the stone used in the Empire State Building’s 2001 renovations.

<text>Anderson is a city in and the county seat of Madison County, Indiana, United States. The population was 54,788 at the 2020 census. It is named after Chief William Anderson. The city is the headquarters of the Church of God and its Anderson University. Highlights of the city include the historic Paramount Theatre and the Gruenewald House.

==History==
Prior to the organization of Madison County, William Conner entered the land upon which Anderson is located. Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated of their land to Madison County on the condition that the county seat be moved from Pendleton to Anderson. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from Pendleton to Anderson.

The city is named for Chief William &quot;Adam&quot; Anderson, whose mother was Lenape and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson&#x27;s name in Lenape was &quot;Kikthawenund&quot;, meaning &quot;creaking boughs&quot;. The Lenape village was known as &quot;Anderson&#x27;s Town&quot;, though the Moravian missionaries called it &quot;The Heathen Town Four Miles Away&quot;. Anderson was also known as &quot;Andersonton&quot; before being formally organized as Anderson.

Introduction of internal improvements by the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act caused a growth in the population in 1837. In December 1838, Anderson was incorporated as a town with 350 inhabitants. The Central Canal, a branch of the Wabash and Erie Canal, was planned to come through Anderson. Work continued on the canal during 1838 and the beginning of 1839, but the work was soon suspended by the state following effects of the Panic of 1837. The town again became a sleepy village until 1849, when it was incorporated a second time as a town. Many new commercial ventures located around the courthouse square.

This incorporation was short-lived, and Anderson once again went back to village status in 1852. However, with the completion of the Indianapolis Bellefontaine Railroad, as well as their station in 1852, Anderson burst to life. The third incorporation of Anderson as a town occurred on June 9, 1853. The population continued to increase. On August 28, 1865, with a population of nearly 1,300 people, Anderson was incorporated as a city.

Between 1853 and the late 19th century, twenty industries of various sizes located there. On March 31, 1887, natural gas was discovered in Anderson. As the Indiana gas boom began, this discovery led new businesses that could use natural gas, such as glass-making, to move to the city. Anderson grew to such proportions that a Cincinnati newspaper editor labeled the city &quot;The Pittsburgh on White River&quot;. Other appellations were &quot;Queen City of the Gas Belt&quot; and (because of the vulcanizing and rubber tire manufacturing business) &quot;Puncture Proof City&quot;.

In 1897 the Interurban Railroad was born in Anderson. Charles Henry, a large stock holder, coined the term &quot;Interurban&quot; in 1893. It continued to operate until 1941. The Commercial Club (formed on November 18, 1905) was the forerunner of the present chamber of commerce.

The year 1912 spelled disaster for Anderson: the natural gas ran out. The city had left its gas-powered lights on day and night, and there are stories of a pocket of natural gas being lit in the river and burning for a prolonged period for the spectacle of it. The result of the loss of natural gas was that several factories moved out. The whole city slowed down. 

This club persuaded the Remy brothers to stay in Anderson and others to locate there. For decades, Delco Remy and Guide Lamp (later Fisher Guide), which during World War II built the M3 submachine gun and the FP-45 Liberator pistol for the Allies, were the top two employers in the city. From 1913 through the 1950s, the Ward-Stilson Company was one of the country&#x27;s largest producers of uniforms, regalia, furniture and props for the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows, and dozens of other U.S. fraternal organizations.

The Church of God of Anderson located its world headquarters in Anderson in 1905. Anderson Bible School was opened in 1917, and this was separated from Gospel Trumpet (now known as Warner Press) in 1925. At the same time, it became known as Anderson Bible School and Seminary. In 1925, the name was changed to Anderson College and eventually to Anderson University in 1988.

Over the years, 17 different types of automobiles were manufactured in Anderson, with the Lambert family among the city&#x27;s leaders in its development and the Buckeye Gasoline Buggy the Lambert product. Many other inventions were perfected in Anderson, including the gas regulator (Miron G. Reynolds), the stamp vending machine (Frank P. Dunn), clothes presser (H. Donald Forse), &quot;Irish Mail&quot; handcars (Hugh Hill), flower car for funeral homes (Francis M. McClain, automatic gearshift (Von D. Polhemus)), Sisson choke (Glenn Sisson), and the vulcanizing process to retread tires (Charles E. Miller).

Anderson hosted a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise for the 1949–50 season, being one of the smaller cities to have had a major league franchise in a Big Four American sport. The Anderson Packers were a founding member of the NBA (under that name), but folded after one season.

Like most other industrial cities in Indiana and the Rust Belt as a whole, Anderson suffered tremendously from deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, nearly 22,000 people were employed by General Motors in the 1970s in Anderson; by 2006 this number had declined to fewer than 2,600. Anderson has since struggled with higher rates of poverty and unemployment.

The city government consists of a mayor and a city council. The mayor is elected in citywide vote. The city council consists of nine members. Six are elected from individual districts. Three members are elected at large.

==Economy==
When General Motors closed its operations in Anderson, the city was dealt a major economic blow, as GM was the biggest employer in Anderson. Nevertheless, in 2007, Anderson was ranked 98th in the &quot;Forbes&quot; List for 100 Best Places for Businesses among Smaller U.S. Metro areas. However, a more recent (2014) appraisal of Anderson from the &quot;Indiana Business Review&quot; was mixed, noting that &quot;long-term trends are negative&quot;, citing &quot;a long-term downward trend in area employment&quot; and &quot;acceleration in the number of food stamp recipients&quot;. More recent unemployment has been reduced, but improvements still lag behind the rest of the state.

For 2013, estimated household median income was $33,574 (vs. Indiana state median of $48,248). Per capita money income was $18,216 (Indiana per capita of $24,635). 25.8% of the city&#x27;s population was estimated at living below poverty level, vs. a statewide estimation of 15.4%. Madison County, of which Anderson is the seat, has nearly three times as many food stamps recipients per capita as does Indiana as a whole.

As of February 2019, the ten largest employers in Madison County were:

Until 1997, Anderson had three high schools: Highland, Madison Heights and Anderson. In 1997 Madison Heights was closed and Anderson High School moved into that facility. Beginning in the fall of 2010, Highland High School closed and was converted into a junior high school, consolidating all students in grades 9-12 into Anderson High School.

Anderson also has a charter school (non-traditional, tuition-free public school) called Anderson Preparatory Academy. Currently, Anderson Preparatory Academy features grades K-12. Anderson Preparatory Academy is a college preparatory, military-based academy. All cadets in grades 6-8 are members of the Civil Air Patrol. High school cadets are all members of the Air Force JROTC program. Original plans called to only offer grades 6–9, then add on another upper grade each year before extending the lower years.

<doc id="112447" wikidata="Q2229531" url="?curid=112447" title="Elwood, Indiana">
<text>Elwood is a city in Madison and Tipton counties in the U.S. state of Indiana. The Madison County portion, which is nearly all of the city, is part of the Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson metropolitan statistical area. The population of Elwood was 8,410 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Elwood was laid out in 1853 under the name &quot;Duck Creek&quot;. It was incorporated as a city in 1891.

A post office was established under the name &quot;Duck Creek&quot; in 1855, was renamed to Elwood in 1869, and has been operating since. The first railroad was constructed in Elwood in 1857.

On August 17, 1940, the Republican National Committee held a formal notification ceremony to recognize Elwood-born Wendell Willkie as its nominee for President of the United States to run against Franklin Roosevelt. Held at Callaway Park on the outskirts of town, the ceremony drew 150,000 people for what would become the largest political rally in American history at the time. People came in 60,000 automobiles, 63 special trains, 300 Pullmans, and 1,200 buses. The Indiana University band led a parade in which 249 other bands also marched in the procession. When Willkie stepped onto the platform, the crowd cheered him for ten minutes before he could begin his speech. However, oppressive heat and Willkie&#x27;s underwhelming, flat speech left many disappointed by the end of the day.

===Sundown town===
By the 1880s, Elwood had become a sundown town, prohibiting Black people from residing within the town. In 1897, when a number of Black families attempted to settle in the town and were driven out, &quot;The Evening Times&quot; in Washington, D.C., reported that for more than two decades Black people had not been &quot;permitted to remain any length of time.&quot; This prohibition remained in place for most of the 20th century.

At the rally for Wendell Willkie, noted above, which drew around 150,000 people to the city, some prominent Black reporters, such as Marse Callaway of Baltimore, were allowed to briefly stay in a hotel downtown, but others were unable to stay the night due to the community&#x27;s sundown status. Other Black people were discouraged from attempting to attend the rally at all due to the sundown signs posted at the city limits. These signs and policies remained in place for decades afterwards.

By the late twentieth century sundown policies were less strictly enforced, although as recently as 2002 law enforcement in nearby Marion considered Elwood to still be unwelcoming of Black people. In 2015, after Goshen, Indiana, passed a resolution acknowledging its history as a sundown town, Elwood&#x27;s own past became a topic of discussion. The mayor of Elwood stated that while he had had no knowledge of the racially exclusionary policies of Elwood&#x27;s past, he would address them if they were part of Elwood&#x27;s &quot;lingering reputation&quot;.

==Geography==
Elwood is located in northwestern Madison County. The equivalent of two half-blocks of land in Tipton County are also within the city limits.

Indiana State Road 28 passes through the city as Main Street, leading east to Alexandria and west to Tipton. State Road 13 (Anderson Street) crosses SR 28 in the center of Elwood; it leads north to Point Isabel and south to Lapel. State Road 37 crosses the southeast corner of the city limits, leading northeast to Marion and southwest to Noblesville. Anderson, the Madison county seat, is southeast of Elwood by local roads.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Elwood has a total area of , all land. Big Duck Creek flows through the center of town, leading southwest to the White River near Strawtown.

<text>Markleville is a town in Adams Township, Madison County, Indiana, United States. It is part of the Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson metropolitan statistical area. The population was 484 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Markleville was laid out by John Markle in 1852, and named after him. It was incorporated as a town in 1912.

The site of the Fall Creek Massacre, chronicled by Jessamyn West in her novel &quot;Massacre at Fall Creek&quot;, is located about a mile from Markleville. A historical marker located just east of Markleville on State Road 38 tells the story of the massacre. In 1824, four men named Hudson, Sawyer, John T. Bridge, Sr. and John Bridge, Jr. were tried and sentenced to death for the murders of eight members of a small group of Seneca Indians, including women and children.

All were publicly hanged except for 18-year-old John Bridge, Jr., who was pardoned on the gallows in person by Indiana Governor J. Brown Ray because of his age. This was the first time in U.S. history that white men were subjected to capital punishment for the murder of Native Americans.

The flag consists of three white rings on a blue background with a red flame amidst the rings. The symbolism of the flag and its rings, according to Mrs. Shettle is as follows:

* The image of a ring itself stands for continuity. There is no beginning and no ending. It stands for the past, present, and future of the Town of Orestes. The rings also are in the form of the letter &quot;o&quot; which stands for Orestes.
* The three different rings have their own individual meanings:
** One symbolizes our Delaware American-Indian Heritage.
** One stands for the Gas Boom from which the Town of Orestes was created.
** One represents the more than 300-year-old Orestes Oak Tree, which is a point of pride in the town.
* The flame stands for the Torch of Liberty and also symbolizes the discovery of gas which was the impetus for the creation of the Town of Orestes.
* The colors of the Flag are red, white, and blue to represent freedom, which the Citizens of Orestes hold dear, but the blue is brighter than normal to overemphasize their love of independence.

Unintentionally, Mrs. Shettle noted that a descending dove, in blue, can be seen in the flame which is a symbol of peace and Christianity.

<doc id="112457" wikidata="Q2018240" url="?curid=112457" title="Beech Grove, Indiana">
<text>Beech Grove is a city in Marion County, Indiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population is 14,717. The city is located within the Indianapolis metropolitan area. Beech Grove is designated an &quot;excluded city&quot; under Indiana law, as it is not part of the consolidated government of Indianapolis and Marion County.

== History ==

By the turn of the 20th century, the Beech Grove area was a rural section of Marion County. Notable residents included poet and women&#x27;s-rights activist Sarah Tittle (Barrett) Bolton (1814–1893) and Indianapolis financier Francis McClintock Churchman (1833–1891).

Bolton&#x27;s farm, &quot;Beech Bank&quot;, and Churchman&#x27;s cattle farm, &quot;Beech Grove Farm&quot;, both reflected the abundance of beech trees in this area. This would eventually provide the reason for the city&#x27;s name, although an early railroad stop in the area was known as &quot;Ingallstown&quot;. The city&#x27;s Sarah T. Bolton Park, situated on some of the former Beech Bank farmland, still contains several large beech trees along its southern boundary.

The actual city came into existence as a company town for a new railroad repair facility, the Beech Grove Shops, constructed by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad (nicknamed the &quot;Big Four&quot;). Through acquisitions and mergers over the years, the railroad shops have been run by the New York Central, Penn Central and, presently, Amtrak rail systems. The complex sits on with underroof. In 2007, Amtrak had 550 employees working there. In recognition of the city&#x27;s heritage as a railroad town, Amtrak&#x27;s business car 10001 is named &quot;The Beech Grove&quot; and is often used by agency officials when they travel the system. 

Although Beech Grove was incorporated in late 1906, it did not see rapid growth until the completion of the railroad facility in 1908; as of July 1907, for example, there were only four homes and two businesses in place.

Beech Grove grew with two annexations after World War II, with the final one (1967) taking place just before the Unigov legislation which merged Indianapolis with most of the rest of Marion County, preventing future annexation.

Two famous actors have listed Beech Grove as their birthplace—Clifton Webb (November 19, 1889–1966) and Steve McQueen (March 24, 1930–1980). Webb was born before Beech Grove came into existence as a separate entity, while McQueen was born at the city&#x27;s St. Francis Hospital.

On October 15, 1948, Beech Grove received the honor of a visit by a sitting President of the United States. Harry S. Truman, a Mason, came to the city&#x27;s Masonic Lodge during his &quot;whistle stop&quot; re-election campaign to participate in a ceremony involving a member of his staff who was one of its members.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The city&#x27;s elevation, measured in feet above sea level, ranges from 766 (the Beech Creek waterway, where it is crossed by South 9th Avenue) to 845 (the northeastern portion of the Amtrak railroad property). It is higher than that of downtown Indianapolis.

The city contains several small non-navigable waterways. Beech Creek, McFarland Creek, Pullman Creek, and Victory Run all feed into Lick Creek, which (after leaving the city limits) feeds into the West Fork of the White River.

The city is located within parts of four of Marion County&#x27;s townships. In order of city land size, those townships are Perry, Franklin, Center, and Warren. In order of city population, the list is Perry, Center, and Franklin; the Warren Township section is uninhabited railroad land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Beech Grove has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The per capita income for the city was $19,647. About 4.4% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.1% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
Although geographically completely surrounded by Indianapolis, Beech Grove is an excluded city so it maintains its own police, public works, and parks departments and operates its own senior-citizens&#x27; center. However, in July 2021, the city council began consideration of an interlocal agreement under which the Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) would provide fire protection services for the next 20 years. Current Beech Grove firefighters would become members of IFD. The ambulance service would continue to be operated by the city.

Beech Grove&#x27;s government was first organized as a &quot;Town Board&quot; system on November 12, 1906. The system remained until 1935, consisting of three elected ward representatives and a clerk-treasurer. From 1911 to 1939, board members were elected as representatives of locally organized political parties (e.g., Progressive, Citizens&#x27;s Ticket, Peoples&#x27;s Ticket).

Upon legally becoming an Indiana fifth-class city in 1935, its first mayor and four city council members were elected (three district members, and one at-large). Beech Grove achieved Indiana fourth-class city status in 1961. The present city council consists of five district members and two at-large members, plus an elected clerk-treasurer.

The mayors, their political affiliations, and their terms of office, have been:
* Charles Adams (Progressive, 1935–1938); (Democratic, 1939–1942)
* E. Allen Hunter (Republican, 1943–1948 and 1952–1955)
* Richard H. Byland (Democratic, 1948–1951)
* David D. Finney (Democratic, 1956–1958)
* Elton H. Geshwiler (Democratic, 1959–1991)
* J. Warner Wiley (Democratic, 1991–2003)
* Donald &quot;Joe&quot; Wright (Republican, 2004–2011)
* John Jennings (Republican, interim, 2011)
* Terry Dilk (Republican, 2011)
* Dennis Buckley (Democratic, 2012-2023)
* James W. Coffman (Democratic, 2024)

Mayor Joe Wright announced his resignation from the office as of January 14, 2011; city councilman John Jennings was named as interim mayor, until the appointment of Terry Dilk on January 25, 2011, by the Marion County Republican Committee to fill out Wright&#x27;s term through the 2011 elections. Dilk was defeated in the November 8, 2011, election by former City fire chief Dennis Buckley, who became the first Mayor to have been the child of a former candidate for the same office (his father, Robert Buckley, was defeated in the 1967 election).

The 1951 Mayoral election featured Democrat Alice Stratton, one of Indiana&#x27;s first female candidates for such an office.

The city flag was not adopted until the 1970s, when a competition was held in which citizens were invited to submit designs. The winning designer was Mike Hart. The flag features an orange, black and white logo on a blue field; the logo shows the profile of an old-style railroad locomotive, in orange, with a white circle superimposed in the center. The circle contains a depiction of the tower complex of St. Francis Hospital, and bears the name of the city, the year &quot;1906&quot; and the motto &quot;Where Tradition Welcomes Progress.&quot;

==Education==

The city has its own school district, the Beech Grove City Schools, but Franklin Township Community School Corporation also serves some of this region. Beech Grove City Schools consists of five facilities (Hornet Park, Central Elementary, South Grove Intermediate, Beech Grove Middle, and Beech Grove High). Its high school athletic teams, the &quot;Hornets&quot; (colors: orange and black) participate as members of the statewide Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA), the Marion County Athletic Association, and the Indiana Crossroads Conference.

The city&#x27;s first school was opened in 1907 in the upstairs of the Wheat Grocery Store at 423 Main Street. Between 1909 and 1929, a series of school buildings and additions were constructed in the 1000 block of Main; only the original gymnasium remains from these structures. The high school was begun in 1917 and its first graduating class was in 1922.

A new combined junior high/high school was built in 1955 at 1248 Buffalo Street, just northwest of the existing school site. The previous complex became Central Elementary. The new facility operated on a split-day schedule, with high school students attending in the morning and junior high students attending in the afternoon.

By 1960, the city&#x27;s growth to the south prompted the building of South Grove Elementary (later Intermediate) at the 800 block of South 9th Avenue. With the population growth, the present high school was built in 1966 just east of the 4000 block of South Emerson Avenue and the 1955 facility remained as the junior high (later middle) school.

Before the 1990s, the kindergarten education experience was only offered in the city by private specialty schools (past examples being Cassidy&#x27;s and Happy Time). As part of the state&#x27;s trend to incorporate this age level within the public schools, the city school system joined with the city&#x27;s Parks Department in the development of Hornet Park, a dual-use facility built on the grounds of the former Olympia Club (a private swimming/recreation club). Kindergarten (and, added recently, 1st grade) classes are held in the south part, while the city offers meeting rooms and exercise facilities in the north part.

Within the traditional focus in Indiana on high-school basketball, the Beech Grove Hornets have earned two Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) State Championships. Its girls team won first, in Class 3A of the 2003 tournament. From that team, senior Katie Gearlds won both the IHSAA&#x27;s Patricia Roy Mental Attitude Award (for Class 3A) and the &quot;Miss Basketball&quot; honor for the entire State. She went on to the WNBA&#x27;s Seattle Storm in the 2007 season. Its boys team won its only State Championship, also in Class 3A, of the 2022 tournament. During the non-class years before 1996, the school had earned only three Sectional (equivalent to District in some states) titles (two by the boys&#x27; team in 1966 and 1992, and one by the girls&#x27; team in 1978); since the change to classes in Indiana high-school basketball, the boys&#x27; team has won one Class 3A Sectional title (2008).

Beech Grove High School&#x27;s &quot;Marching Hornets&quot; band program has earned four Indiana State School Music Association (ISSMA) State Band Finals berths in its history and earned their first ISSMA Regional Gold rating in nine years in 2005. The Marching Hornets continue to achieve great levels of success on the marching music field. After 2005, the band has returned to the level of success that they had during the James Williams years. They have grown to become one of ISSMAs Class C &quot;powerhouses&quot; in the South. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Marching Hornets returned to the state finals for the first time in 19 years, where they placed 5th in Class C on 2009, 7th in Class C in 2010, and 2nd in Class C in 2011. They would continue to reach state finals in Class C in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. During the 2017 season, Beech Grove High School&#x27;s growing enrollment reclassified the Marching Hornets as a Class B program. The Marching Hornets would take 5th place in 2017— their inaugural season in Class B.

Also within the city limits are the Holy Name of Jesus School (Roman Catholic, grades pre-school to 8), built in 1922. Many students from Holy Name of Jesus continue their high school studies at Beech Grove High School or the nearby Roncalli High School.

Beech Grove has a public library, a branch of the Indianapolis Public Library. For many years the city maintained its own library, but in April 2016, the boards of the Indianapolis and the Beech Grove public libraries voted to merge, with the Beech Grove library becoming the 23rd branch library of the Indianapolis library system on June 1, 2016.

==Medical institutions==
Franciscan Health Indianapolis, formerly known as St. Francis Hospital, was founded in Beech Grove by the monastic order of the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration in 1914. The Beech Grove hospital closed in 2012 after most medical services were transferred to a more modern, suburban hospital campus in south Indianapolis.

==Religious institutions==
Beech Grove&#x27;s oldest churches have existed since the earliest days of the city. Father Peter J. Killian established the Blessed Sacrament Parish (Roman Catholic Church) in the upstairs of his home in 1908; its present name of Holy Name of Jesus Parish was taken in 1918. A Methodist Episcopal meeting in the Clapp family home in 1908 eventually led to the present Beech Grove United Methodist Church. A noon-time Christian men&#x27;s meeting of &quot;Big Four&quot; railroad employees in 1910 was the genesis of the present Beech Grove Christian Church. In late 1912, the First Baptist Church (since 1937, General Association of Regular Baptist Churches) was organized and is now in its second location within the city.

Churches established in the city in later years include Beech Grove Wesleyan Church (formerly Pilgrim Holiness Church, in the 1920s); Faith Assembly of God (Assemblies of God, 1958); South Emerson Church of God (Reformation Movement, Church of God (Anderson), 1961); Southwood Baptist Church (Southern Baptist Convention, 1962); and Ascension Lutheran Church (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, 1972). In recent years, independent community churches have appeared (e.g., Body of Christ Fellowship, Church on The Word, Omega Harvest).

The Benedict Inn is a multi-use facility operated by the local Our Lady of Grace Monastery of the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict. It contains meeting rooms, a gymnasium, and an indoor pool, which were part of the former Our Lady of Grace all-girls Catholic high school.

==Civic institutions==

Established service groups include chapters of the Lions International and Kiwanis. The local Beech Grove Promoters Club was founded in 1953 as a chapter of the National Exchange Club, but left that organization in 1957 and adopted its present name. It organizes the city&#x27;s two main public festivals—the 3rd of July Fireworks and the Fall Festival (since 1959) in September.

The city also contains Lodges of the Free and Accepted Masons, Fraternal Order of Eagles and Loyal Order of Moose. Posts of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars are also active.

Past civic organizations which, while no longer in existence, performed service to the city include the Beech Grove Civic League and the Beech Grove Jaycees. The Jaycees organized a &quot;Buck-A-Brick&quot; campaign in the 1950s to build a house-sized Beech Grove Civic Center on South 3rd Avenue, offering meeting rooms to the citizens. (This facility is now the home of the Body of Christ Fellowship.)

==Transportation==

The city has direct access to the Interstate Highway System as it straddles exit 52 of Interstate 465. It is served by local public bus routes of Indianapolis&#x27; IndyGo system. Routes 12-Minnesota and 13-Raymond serve 17th Avenue (Sherman Drive) from Southern Avenue to Main Street, with select trips serving Albany Street from 17th Avenue to 25th Avenue. Route 14-Prospect serves Emerson Avenue from the Amtrak railroad crossing all the way to Thompson Road, the southern end of Beech Grove. Route 16-Beech Grove serves Albany Street from 25th Avenue to 17th Avenue, 17th from Albany to Main, Main from 17th to Emerson Avenue, and Emerson to Thompson Road. Routes 12, 13, and 14 run seven days a week, while Route 16 runs only Monday through Saturday. There is currently no light rail or streetcar service, although one existed in the past.

Beech Grove maintains an address-numbering system distinct from surrounding Indianapolis. Addresses are numbered as either east/west or north–south from the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue.

The city&#x27;s street grid reflects two distinct urban planning styles. The original roadway connecting Beech Grove to Indianapolis was Churchman Avenue, running northwest from Beech Grove. The original city was built to the north of Churchman Avenue, on a north–south grid pattern with alleys, centered on the widened roads of Main Street and Fifth Avenue. While a parkway was planned for both sides of Lick Creek, only a small segment of it was actually established.

With the post-World War II &quot;Baby Boom&quot; population growth, new streets were built south of Churchman Avenue in the modern style of sweeping curves and cul-de-sacs.

Certain streets change names at the Beech Grove city limits. Indianapolis&#x27; Troy Avenue becomes Beech Grove&#x27;s Albany Street; Indianapolis&#x27; Sherman Drive becomes Beech Grove&#x27;s 17th Avenue; and Indianapolis&#x27; Emerson Avenue becomes (in places) Beech Grove&#x27;s 1st Avenue.

==Local media==
Beech Grove has no daily newspaper, but its news events were mainly covered for many years by a free weekly newspaper headquartered within the city. Titled &quot;The Southside Times&quot;, the weekly was for most of its existence known as the &quot;Perry Township Weekly&quot;. &quot;The Southside Times&quot; left its longtime Main Street home in November 2012 in favor of a house on US 31 South, while the space was filled by Shupe&#x27;s Lawn Care company. Past Beech Grove newspapers included the &quot;Independent&quot;, the &quot;Graphic,&quot; and the &quot;Spotlight&quot;. The city has no local radio or television station. It is part of the Indianapolis radio/television market and has its own cable TV Government-access television channel available on the Comcast system.

<doc id="112461" wikidata="Q1806779" url="?curid=112461" title="Lawrence, Indiana">
<text>Lawrence is a city in Marion County, Indiana, United States. It is one of four &quot;excluded cities&quot; in Marion County. The city is home to Fort Benjamin Harrison within Fort Harrison State Park. The population was 49,370 at the 2020 census. The city is on the northeast side of Indianapolis.

==History==
The municipality was platted in 1849 under the name &quot;Lanesville&quot;, but other names were tried because there was already another Lanesville in Indiana. The name &quot;Jamestown&quot;, in honor of the town&#x27;s founder James White, was used for a while, but in 1866 the Marion County Commissioners approved the name &quot;Lawrence&quot;, which is also the name of the township in which it is located. The name was in honor of Captain James Lawrence, naval hero of the War of 1812. In 1929 the citizens of Lawrence voted to become an independent town, where they first established the town marshal, as well as other parts of government.

In 1969, Indianapolis and Marion County adopted a unified government structure known as Unigov. Lawrence is one of four &quot;excluded cities&quot; and therefore retains its own municipal government. Its citizens vote not only for the mayor and council of Lawrence, but also for the mayor of Indianapolis and representatives on the Indianapolis City-County Council.

<text>Argos is a town in Green and Walnut townships, Marshall County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,777 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
In 1833, Sidney Williams arrived in the area which is now Marshall County and purchased of land on the present day site of Argos. Mr. Williams built a tavern, an inn, and helped build a section of Michigan Road. Mr. Williams sold his land to Clark Bliven, the man who built the courthouse on the Williams&#x27;s land. This local place of rest wasn’t considered a town until some time later. On January 8, 1851, John Pleak and Marquis L. Smith, laid out the town of Sidney, which is the predecessor to Argos. The town of Sidney was named in honor of Sidney Williams.

In 1854, the post office was removed from Sidney through political manipulations. Schuyler Colfax, the congressman in the district, was asked to name the post office. He had a great interest in Greek history, which led him to name the post office &quot;Argos&quot; after the ancient Greek city made famous in the Iliad of Homer.

On November 6, 1856, the town of Fremont, adjoining the town of Sidney, was laid out by Joseph H. Rhodes. Fremont was named after Col. John C. Fremont, who on November 6, 1856, won the Republican candidate for president.

On May 21, 1859, a meeting was held in the school house for anyone interested in the formation of a new township. The purpose of the meeting was to consolidate Sidney and Fremont, select a name for the township, and appoint a suitable person to be the trustee. The names that were offered up for the town were Argos, Noble, and Richland. Noble was withdrawn. The vote total was Argos 12, Richland 8, and thus Argos became the name for the consolidated towns. The commissioners ordered the Township to be called Walnut Township due to the abundance of walnut trees in the area. John A. Rhodes and Charles Brown were proposed for trustee. Rhodes won by a vote of 18 to 4.

The town of Argos was incorporated in the state law in December 1869.

The Argos Downtown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

<text>Plymouth is a city and the county seat of Marshall County, Indiana, United States. The population is 10,214 in the 2020 census. Plymouth was the site of the first retail outlet of defunct U.S. retailer Montgomery Ward in 1926.

==History==


===Early history===
This area was part of the territory of the Potawatomi Native Americans, one of the historical tribes encountered by American settlers. In the nineteenth century, the United States government made numerous treaties to buy and extinguish Native American claims to land in the former Northwest Territory and the Southeast.

===First settlements===
Marshall County was formed in 1836, during the early years of settlement and before the forced removal of the Potawatomi people in 1838. It was named for U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall, who died in 1835. Marshall County is notable as the starting point in 1838 of the Potawatomi Trail of Death, which was the forced removal by United States forces of Chief Menominee and 859 Potawatomi Indians from Indiana to Indian Territory, at the site of present-day Osawatomie, Kansas, a distance of . The first settlers arrived in what is now Marshall County in 1835. They arrived as a result of the end of the Black Hawk War as well as the completion of the Erie Canal. They consisted primarily of settlers from New England, &quot;Yankees&quot; descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the colonial era. They were mainly members of the Congregational church, although due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Marshall County. As a result of this heritage, some place names in Marshall County are named after places in New England, such as Plymouth, which is named after Plymouth, Massachusetts, the site where the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landed in 1620.

Plymouth, located near the center of Marshall County, was established on both banks of the Yellow River, a stream flowing from northeast to southwest across the county. In 1836, a dam and sawmill were constructed on the river. Many of the original settlers were immigrants from Germany, and mostly practiced farming. Upon their arrival, the land was covered with dense forests and marshlands, which required clearing and drainage before it could be cultivated. Early crops grown in Marshall County included corn, wheat, oats, rye, and beans.

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the forcible removal of Native American tribes from this area. In 1832, the United States government acquired the land through the Treaty of Tippecanoe.

Plymouth became the county seat of Marshall County in 1836 and established its first post office in 1837. The town was officially incorporated in 1851, and by 1900, its population had grown to 3,656, making it the largest town in the county.

====Potawatomi relocation====
Although many Potawatomi had relocated to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas, Chief Menominee and his band of the Yellow River refused to go. Militia under the authority of United States Army officers rounded them up and in September 1838, the band of 859 headed west, in what became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. They traveled more than 660 miles to Osawatomie, Kansas, with many of the Potawatomi walking. More than 40 of the tribal members died on the march.

====American Civil War====
During the Civil War, Union Army soldiers arrested Daniel E. VanValkenburgh, editor of the &quot;Plymouth Weekly Democrat&quot;, who criticized what he viewed as Lincoln&#x27;s abuses of power. VanValkenburgh also criticized Department of Ohio commander Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s lieutenant, General Milo S. Hascall. Hascall was in charge of the District of Indiana. VanValkenburgh called Hascall a donkey in the pages of the &quot;Democrat.&quot; Hascall promptly dispatched soldiers to arrest VanValkenburgh and brought him before Burnside to answer charges of violating Burnside&#x27;s General Order No. 38. Burnside let VanValkenburgh off with a warning. The &quot;Democrat&quot; became the first of eleven Democratic newspapers suppressed or threatened with suppression in May 1863.

===Later history===
On July 6, 1915, the Liberty Bell stopped in Plymouth on its trip from Philadelphia to the Exposition at San Francisco.

Much of Plymouth&#x27;s history was documented in two major newspapers during the 19th century. The &quot;Marshall County Republican&quot; (also titled &quot;Plymouth Republican&quot; and &quot;Plymouth Tribune&quot;) operated from 1856 to 1922. Its main rival the &quot;Marshall County Democrat&quot; (also titled &quot;Plymouth Democrat&quot;) appeared from 1855 to 1932 (and as a weekly only edition until January 1, 1941). The &quot;Plymouth Daily Pilot&quot; acquired the &quot;Republican&quot; in 1922, and the &quot;Democrat&quot; became the &quot;Plymouth Daily News&quot; in 1932. The &quot;News&quot; and &quot;Pilot&quot; merged to become the &quot;Plymouth Pilot-News&quot; in 1947.

As part of Plymouth&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebration in 1966, organizers created the first Marshall County Blueberry Festival, to take place over Labor Day weekend. This tradition has continued annually, and the Festival typically brings in tens of thousands of visitors over the four-day event.

In July 1982, five firefighters were killed when their fire truck overturned while responding to a call. The tanker truck crashed on a curve near West School on state road 17.

In March 2024, a semi-truck crashed into a Hacienda from US-30.

The East Laporte Street Footbridge, Heminger Travel Lodge, Marshall County Courthouse, Plymouth Downtown Historic District, Plymouth Northside Historic District, Plymouth Southside Historic District, and Plymouth Fire Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Peru is a city in, and the county seat of, Miami County, Indiana, United States. It is north of Indianapolis. The population was 11,073 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous community in Miami County. Peru is located along the Wabash River and is part of the Kokomo-Peru Combined Statistical Area.

Residents of Peru usually pronounce the name of Peru like the name of the nation of Peru as it is commonly pronounced in American English. Elderly Hoosiers commonly use the archaic pronunciation of .

==History==

On August 18, 1827, Joseph Holman bought land near the confluence of the Mississinewa and Wabash rivers from Jean Baptiste &quot;Pechewa&quot; (Wildcat) Drouet de Richardville, the chief of the Miami people. The sale was approved on March 3, 1828, by President John Quincy Adams. On March 12, 1829, Holman had the land surveyed and laid out the town of Miamisport.

Peru was founded in 1834 by William N. Hood, who had bought of land from Miamisport&#x27;s founder Joseph Holman five years earlier. By 1835, court was being held in Peru rather than Miamisport, and the name &quot;Miamisport&quot; quietly disappeared as Peru became the dominant community in the area. Frances Slocum was reunited with members of her family near Peru in 1837, after nearly sixty years of living among Native Americans.

Early in the 20th century, Peru was home to a pioneering automobile maker, Model Automobile Company; like many other early automobile manufacturers, Model did not survive.

In 1913, Peru suffered a massive flood, the worst of its time. Between March 24 and March 27, of rain fell on Peru, and sent water from the Wabash and Mississinewa rivers rushing down its streets at speeds of , destroying everything in its path. Before the flood of 1913, Peru was a busy town, full of activity and jobs, with 15,000 inhabitants, 100 factories, a trolley service, railroads, a new hospital (Duke&#x27;s), a circus (which employed 1,000 people on the road), and a new concrete bridge (largest of its kind in the world at the time). The total loss for Peru was estimated at $3,000,000 (1913 figures). Many people died, as well as many of the circus animals.

Public enemy John Dillinger and his gang robbed the Peru police department armory on October 21, 1933. They acquired one Thompson submachine gun, two Winchester rifles, two shotguns, four .38 revolvers and a half-dozen bulletproof vests.

On June 23, 1972, Martin J. McNally hijacked American Airlines Flight 119 while in flight from St. Louis to Tulsa. After receiving a ransom of $502,500, he jumped out of the back of the Boeing 727 in what was the ninth copycat hijacking in the style of D. B. Cooper. The entire ransom as well as a weapon were found near Peru. A fingerprint led to his arrest. The money was found in a sealed canvas mail bag by local farmer Lowell Elliott while he was working in his soybean field. Another farmer, Ronald Miller, discovered a Spitfire submachine gun in his corn field when a blade hit it while applying liquid nitrogen fertilizer.

The movie &quot;Little Big Top&quot;, which starred Sid Haig, was shot and directed in the town of Peru by Peru native Ward Roberts who also wrote the movie. Scenes show the famous drive up to the &quot;Mr. Weenie&quot; restaurant and the Circus building.

The Brownell Block/Senger Dry Goods Company Building, James Omar Cole House, Miami County Courthouse, Peru High School Historic District, and Shirk-Edwards House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Circuses===
Peru was the winter headquarters for several famous circuses, including Hagenbeck–Wallace, Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, and others. The International Circus Hall of Fame is located in Peru. Annually during the third week of July, the Peru Amateur Circus holds performances for the whole week, ending with the Circus City Festival and Parade. All of the performers are amateurs, ranging in age from 7 to 21 years. Peru is also the home of the world&#x27;s only remaining manufacturer of steam calliopes.

Mariya Rasputina, daughter of Grigori Rasputin, was mauled by a bear in Peru while working for the Hagenback-Wallace Circus, but survived.

<text>Bloomington is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County, Indiana, United States. The population was 79,168 at the 2020 census. It is the seventh-most populous city in Indiana and the fourth-most populous outside the Indianapolis metropolitan area. It is the home of Indiana University Bloomington, the flagship campus of the Indiana University system. Established in 1820, IU Bloomington enrolls over 45,000 students.

The city was established in 1818 by a group of settlers from Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, and Virginia who were so impressed with &quot;a haven of blooms&quot; that they called it Bloomington.&lt;ref name=&quot;about/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is the principal city of the Bloomington metropolitan area in south-central Indiana, which had 161,039 residents in 2020. Bloomington has been designated a Tree City USA since 1984. The city was also the location of the Academy Award–winning 1979 movie &quot;Breaking Away&quot;, featuring a reenactment of Indiana University&#x27;s annual Little 500 bicycle race.

==History==
The area in which Bloomington is situated was previously inhabited by the Delaware, Potawatomi, Miami, and Eel River Miami. 

Bloomington was platted in 1818. A post office has been in operation at Bloomington since 1825. Bloomington was incorporated in 1827.

The current city logo was adopted on January 6, 1986, by the Bloomington Common Council. It was a combination of peony and trout lily, inspired by both quilt patterns used by regional folk artists in 19th century and the shape of Downtown Square.

The Elias Abel House, Blair-Dunning House, Bloomington City Hall, Bloomington West Side Historic District, Cantol Wax Company Building, Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, Cochran-Helton-Lindley House, Courthouse Square Historic District, Hinkle-Garton Farmstead, Home Laundry Company, Illinois Central Railroad Freight Depot, Johnson&#x27;s Creamery, Legg House, Millen House, Millen-Chase-McCalla House, Monroe Carnegie Library, Monroe County Courthouse, Morgan House, J.L.

Many African Americans moved to Bloomington from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky during the 1860s through the 1880s. Bloomington also attracted Scotch-Irish Presbyterians from South Carolina.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Bloomington has a total area of , of which (or 99.15%) is land and (or 0.85%) is water.

===Climate===
Bloomington has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). South Central Indiana receives an abundance of rain, with a yearly average of nearly 50 inches.

===Geology===
Bloomington is an area of irregular limestone terrain characterized by sinks, ravines, fissures, underground streams, sinking streams, springs and caves. It is in the rolling hills of southern Indiana, resting on the intersection of the Norman Uplands and the Mitchell Plain. The city&#x27;s relatively varied topography is a sharp contrast to the flatter terrain more typical of central to northern portions of Indiana.

===Water===

Bloomington is on comparatively high ground, the summit of the divide between the basins of the West Fork and East Fork of Indiana&#x27;s White River. Accordingly, there are no major watercourses within the city, nor is much groundwater available for wells. The largest stream within the city is Clear Creek, with its eastern branch known on the Indiana University campus as the Campus River, formerly the Jordan River.

Because natural lakes or rivers or groundwater are absent from the city and its environs, a number of dams have been constructed on nearby creeks over the last 100 years to provide for the water needs of Bloomington and Monroe County. Early 20th-century damming projects occurred at locations southwest of the city, the most notable being the Leonard Springs Dam. Because of the limestone formations underlying the reservoirs and the dams, water kept seeping from the reservoirs through naturally developing underground channels. Despite all efforts, the city was never able to fully stop the leakage and had to resort to pumping leaking water back to the reservoir.

By the 1920s, a more radical solution was needed to deal with the water crisis. A new reservoir, known as Griffy Lake, was constructed in a more geologically suitable area north of the city. (It is now within Bloomington&#x27;s official city limits.) Later, in the 1950s, two much larger reservoirs, Lake Lemon and Monroe Lake were created in the northeastern and southeastern parts of Monroe County. Monroe Lake was created by the US Army Corps of Engineers for flood control but has since been used to supply the city and the county with water. The water pumping station at Griffy Lake was mothballed until May 2020.

Presently, the city is supplied with drinking water from Monroe Lake, via the Monroe Water Treatment Plant on S. Shields Ridge Rd. Originally opened in 1967, it was expanded in 2014, and now is capable of producing 30 million gallons of water per day. The sewer water from the northern part of the city is treated at the Blucher Poole Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1968) and discharged into the Bean Blossom Creek. The sewer water from the southern half of the city goes to Dillman Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (constructed 1982) and is then discharged into the Clear Creek.

===Environment===
PCB pollution, associated with Westinghouse&#x27;s operations, long was a concern in the area. A number of sites, in particular, Bennett&#x27;s Dump and Lemon Lane Landfill at the northwestern edge of the city and Neal&#x27;s Landfill in the county, were listed as Superfund sites. Clean-up operations at the Bennett Quarry site, started in 1983, were largely completed by 2000., while cleanups at the other sites were completed in 2012.

<text>Ellettsville is a town in Richland Township, Monroe County, Indiana, United States. The population was 6,655 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bloomington, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Ellettsville was platted in 1837. In 1818, Edward Ellett, Sr, and his wife Eleanor settled in what is now known as Ellettsville with their four minor sons: David, Richard, Johnston and Barton. The first winter, they lived in a three-sided log cabin they built. Also settling that year were their two eldest sons, William and Samuel, with their wives and families. Within a few years daughters Sarah, Phoebe and Nancy settled in the area with their husbands. In 1826, their third eldest son, Edward, Jr., also arrived in the town that was named Ellettsville in 1837. Samuel Ellett built the first courthouse in 1820. It was completed ahead of schedule and at the cost of $400. By 1822, the first school opened and with Samuel Ellett&#x27;s children attending.

When Indiana celebrated its sesquicentennial in 1987, a historical marker was placed to mark the grave of the town&#x27;s founder, Edward Ellett, Sr. (c.1762-1833). Two of Edward Ellett&#x27;s sons, Samuel and Edward Jr., fought in The War of 1812. In turn, three of the founder&#x27;s grandsons fought to preserve the Union in the Civil War. Stephen R. Ellett fought with the 67th Indiana Infantry Regiment, at the Battle of Vicksburg, while his younger brothers, James W. Ellett and John H. Ellett, volunteered and fought with the 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment at Gettysburg. James Ellett died in service of his county in 1864 in Alabama while his brother, John Ellett, was wounded at Chancellorsville but survived the Civil War. The family tradition of loyal service to the U.S. was later followed by the founder&#x27;s great great grandson, Dale Ellett, who volunteered and died in World War II in 1945 fighting against Nazi Germany.

The post office at Ellettsville has been in operation since 1837. The community was incorporated as a town in 1866.

Ellettsville Downtown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

<text>Crawfordsville () is a city in Montgomery County in west central Indiana, United States, west by northwest of Indianapolis. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 16,306. The city is the county seat of Montgomery County, the only chartered city and the largest populated place in the county. It is the principal city of the Crawfordsville, IN Micropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Montgomery County. The city is also part of the Indianapolis–Carmel–Muncie, IN Combined Statistical Area.

The city was founded in 1823 on the bank of Sugar Creek, a southern tributary of the Wabash River and named for U.S. Treasury Secretary William H. Crawford. The city is home to Wabash College, a private liberal arts men&#x27;s college, and the General Lew Wallace Study &amp; Museum, a National Historic Landmark.

==History==
===Early 19th century===
In 1813, Williamson Dunn, Henry Ristine, and Major Ambrose Whitlock, U.S. Army, noted that the site of present-day Crawfordsville was ideal for settlement, surrounded by deciduous forest and potentially arable land, with water provided by a nearby creek, later named Sugar Creek, that was a southern tributary of the Wabash River. They returned a decade later to find at least one cabin had been built in the area. In 1821, William and Jennie Offield had built a cabin on a little creek, later to be known as Offield Creek, southwest of the future site of Crawfordsville.

Whitlock, a Virginian who had served under Gen. &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne in the Northwest Indian War, laid out the town in March 1823. Crawfordsville was named in honor of William H. Crawford, a fellow Virginian who was Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents Madison and Monroe at that time and who had issued Whitlock&#x27;s commission as Receiver of Public Lands. Whitlock was the first settler in the town.

According to a diary of Sanford C. Cox, who in 1824 was one of the first schoolmasters in the area, &quot;Crawfordsville is the only town between Terre Haute and Fort Wayne... Maj. Ristine keeps tavern in a two-story log house and Jonathan Powers has a little grocery. There are two stores, Smith&#x27;s near the land office, and Issac C. Elston&#x27;s, near the tavern... David Vance [is the] sheriff.&quot;

It was successfully incorporated as a town in 1834, following a failed attempt three years earlier. 
In November 1832, Wabash College was founded in Crawfordsville as &quot;The Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College&quot;. It was created by Presbyterian missionaries but later became non-sectarian. On December 18, 1833, the &quot;Crawfordsville Record&quot; carried a paid announcement of the opening of this school. The school is one of only three remaining all-male liberal arts colleges in the country and has a student body of around 900.

In 1842, 9-year-old Horace Hovey discovered remarkably well-preserved Pentacrinites or Crinoids along the banks of Sugar Creek, which drew researchers and fossil enthusiasts to the area.

Crawfordsville grew in size and amenities, adding such necessities as a bank and fire department. It gained status as a city in 1865 when the state of Indiana granted its charters.

===Late 19th century===
In 1862, Joseph F. Tuttle, after whom Tuttle Grade School was named in 1906 and Tuttle Junior High School (now Crawfordsville Middle School) was named in 1960, became president of Wabash College and served for 30 years. &quot;He was an eloquent preacher, a sound administrator and an astute handler of public relations.&quot; Tuttle, together with his administrators, worked to improve relations in Crawfordsville between &quot;Town and Gown&quot;.

Several future and past Civil War generals lived in Crawfordsville at different times. Generals Lew Wallace and Mahlon D. Manson spent most of their lives in the town. Generals Edward Canby and John P. Hawkins spent some of their youth in Crawfordsville. General Henry B. Carrington lived in the town after the war and taught military science at Wabash College. Several other future generals were students at Wabash before the war, including Joseph J. Reynolds, John C. Black (brevet brigadier), Speed S. Fry, Charles Cruft, and William H. Morgan.

In 1880, prominent local citizen Lew Wallace produced Crawfordsville&#x27;s most famous literary work, &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;, a historical novel dealing with the beginnings of Christianity in the Mediterranean world. In addition to Wallace, Crawfordsville lived up to its nickname &quot;The Athens of Indiana&quot; by being the hometown of a number of authors, including Maurice Thompson, Mary Hannah Krout, Caroline Virginia Krout, Susan Wallace, Will H.

Hoosiers have long believed that the first basketball game in Indiana occurred on March 16, 1894, at the Crawfordsville YMCA between the teams from Crawfordsville&#x27;s and Lafayette&#x27;s YMCAs. Recent research, however, conclusively shows that while Crawfordsville was among the first dozen or so Indiana communities to adopt the sport, it was not the first place basketball was played in Indiana. Nevertheless, Crawfordsville had a vibrant basketball playing culture from early on with teams from the local YMCA, Wabash College, Crawfordsville High School, and a business college competing against each other. Crawfordsville was also the site for one of the earliest intercollegiate basketball games, between Wabash College and Purdue University, in 1894 at the city&#x27;s YMCA.

In 1882, one of the first rotary jails in the country opened. It served from 1882 until 1972. The Montgomery County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence is now a museum and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===20th century===

The beginning of the 20th century marked important steps for Crawfordsville, as Culver Union Hospital and the Carnegie Library were built in 1902. Culver operated as a not-for-profit, municipally-owned facility for 80 years, but was then sold to for-profit American Medical International, and in 1984 was relocated from its original location near downtown to a new campus north of the city. The hospital&#x27;s ownership was transferred to Sisters of St. Francis Health Services, Inc. in 2000 and renamed St. Clare Medical Center. In 2011, it was again renamed, to Franciscan St. Elizabeth Health - Crawfordsville. In 1911, Crawfordsville High School was founded, and promptly won the state&#x27;s first high school basketball title. Crawfordsville&#x27;s major employer for much of the century, commercial printer RR Donnelley, began operations in Crawfordsville in 1922.

Recent history has held few nationally noteworthy events for the city but much internal change. Nucor Steel, CSI Closures (formerly Alcoa), Raybestos Products Company, Pace Dairy Foods, and Random House have all created factories in or near Crawfordsville which provided employment to much of the population. Manpower has taken over as the primary employer in the city and has allowed most of the local companies to reduce employees. In 2008, Raybestos laid off the majority of its workforce with less than 100 employees left. Wabash College won the Division III NCAA basketball title in 1982. The college plays an annual football game against Depauw University for the Monon Bell, one of the oldest rivalries in all college sports. In 1998, the state began a proposed project to widen U.S. Route 231, in an attempt to ease intrastate travel flow.

===21st century===

In 2005, the Crawfordsville District Public Library moved into a new building across the street from the city&#x27;s Carnegie library. The library retained ownership of the old building and re-opened it as the Carnegie Museum of Montgomery County in 2007.

On May 8, 2007, approximately a quarter-block of historic buildings in the 100 block of South Washington Street was burned in a major fire. A woman in one of the buildings reported the fire. One person, Leslie Eric Largent, died in the fire. The fire was covered by the press statewide. Two buildings, built circa 1882, were completely destroyed: one housed the Silver Dollar Bar (formerly Tommy Kummings&#x27; Silver Dollar Tavern); the other contained the New York Shoe Repair and Bargain Center at the corner of Pike and Washington streets. Above the shoe store were several apartments where residents were sleeping. On May 22, the fire was ruled to have been an act of arson.

In 2015, Crawfordsville won a Stellar Community grant from Indiana Office of Community &amp; Rural Affairs.

On May 17, 2018, a new clock tower built by Kentucky-based Campbellsville Industries was put into place on the courthouse&#x27;s original clock tower base. The original clock tower had been taken down in 1941 due to structural concerns. The clock tower was made possible by the Montgomery County Courthouse Clock Tower Committee and its fundraising efforts spanning more than twenty years. The clock tower was dedicated on June 17, and the bells and chimes were sounded for the first time.

===National Register of Historic Places===

Lane House, and Montgomery County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence. Two of the properties are historic districts: Crawfordsville Commercial Historic District, and Elston Grove Historic District. Two listings are active churches: Bethel AME Church of Crawfordsville, and Saint John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The other properties are currently used as a law office (Otto Schlemmer Building), senior apartments and recreation center (Crawfordsville High School), a private residence (McClelland-Layne House), the headquarters of the local Daughters of the American Revolution chapter (Col. Isaac C. Elston House), and a former hospital renovated for senior apartments Culver Union Hospital.

<text>Darlington is a town in Franklin Township, Montgomery County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 711 at the 2020 census, down from 843 in 2010.

==History==
Darlington was platted by Enoch Cox in 1836. The city takes its name from Darlington, in England. The post office at Darlington has been in operation since 1837.

The Pennsylvania Railroad (Vandalia district) made stops in Darlington for many years from the late 19th century up until the 1960s.

Many people in Darlington would ride the PRR to Lake Maxinkuckee on weekends during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The Vandalia District started southwest of Terre Haute and bisected Montgomery County from Waveland, through Crawfordsville, to Darlington, continuing on to Colfax, where it crossed the NYC Big Four branch.

A man named Arthur Baird II killed his parents, Arthur and Katherine, and his pregnant wife Nadine on September 6–7, 1985; this was the first triple murder to occur in Montgomery County, as well as the first murder in the county since 1978.

On June 2, 1990, an F-3 tornado touched down southwest of Darlington and destroyed multiple homes, barns, and property around the area. The town suffered significant damage from the storm.

<text>Ladoga is a town in Clark Township, Montgomery County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 1,081 at the 2020 census, up from 985 in 2010.

==History==
Ladoga was platted in 1836 by John Myers. Myers invited his friends to help him find a name. He required that the name not end in -burg or -ville and that it would not be named after another town. He chose &quot;Ladoga&quot; after finding Lake Ladoga on a map of Russia. In 1837, the town&#x27;s post office was established, which still operates today.

In 1840 there were fifteen buildings in Ladoga, including two large stores selling general merchandise — one owned by Taylor Webster and one owned by William Nofsinger. By 1848, there were thirty families living in the town. The Haw Creek Academy was built two miles south of Ladoga in 1838 by the Christian Church. In 1855, the Ladoga Female Seminary was established by the Baptist Church, which quickly decided to allow male students, and shortly afterward the Ladoga Male Academy was established, which soon allowed female students. (Both decided to let in the other gender because of financial concerns.) Central Normal College was founded in Ladoga in 1876; it moved to Danville in 1878. The original building still stands in Ladoga. Known as Normal Hall, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

===Ferris wheel===
The town of Ladoga lays claim to the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair Ferris Wheel. Designed by Pittsburgh bridge-builder George Washington Gale Ferris Jr., Luther V. Rice of Ladoga agreed to build it. After the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, it was placed in Ferris Wheel Park for a while, then moved to St. Louis, Missouri, for its World&#x27;s Fair.

==Geography==
Ladoga is located in southeastern Montgomery County. Indiana State Road 234 passes through the town as Main Street, leading east to Jamestown and west to Shades State Park. Crawfordsville, the Montgomery county seat, is to the northwest, and Indianapolis is to the southeast.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ladoga has a total area of , all land. Big Raccoon Creek crosses the southeast and southwest corners of the town, flowing southwest, then northwest to the Wabash River south of Montezuma.

<text>Martinsville is a city in Washington Township, Morgan County, Indiana, United States. The population was 14,980 at the 2020 United States Census. The city is the county seat of Morgan County.

==History==
Martinsville was founded in 1822. It is said to be named for John Martin, a county commissioner. A post office has been in operation at Martinsville since 1823.

The Morgan County Courthouse, completed in 1859, features a red brick and Italianate design, and is one of the few pre-Civil War courthouses in Indiana. Architect Isaac Hodgson designed the courthouse, and it was built by Perry Magnus Blankenship. Hodgson designed six Indiana courthouses including Jennings County Courthouse (1859), Morgan County (1857), Henry County Courthouse, Bartholomew County Courthouse (1871), and his largest in Marion County, in Indianapolis.

In 1899, Eugene Shireman, a Martinsville entrepreneur, turned his swamp land into fisheries and started Grassyfork Fisheries. Once dubbed the &quot;Goldfish Capital of the World&quot;, today Martinsville has several large fisheries that sell fish to many parts of the world. Shireman&#x27;s actions changed the landscape of the Martinsville area, and his fisheries can be seen today throughout Shireman subdivision. Martinsville is also home to other fisheries.

From 1888 until 1968, visitors sought out the Martinsville&#x27;s sanitaria for health benefits from their artesian mineral water. Over nearly 100 years, almost a dozen sanitaria were in operation for various periods of time, including the first black spa in Martinsville.

Albert Merritt (1871–1958), founder of the Boys&#x27; Club in Martinsville, born near Bowling Green, was the son of freedmen. He came to Martinsville Mineral Springs Sanitarium in the 1890s from a job as a porter at the Sennings Hotel in Louisville, and lived at the sanitarium for the rest of his life, never marrying. He worked with the children of Martinsville for fifty years, building a clubhouse on North Marion Street. Merritt Park on the northwest end of town is named for Albert.

Visitors would travel by rail and road to bathe and refresh in the mineral springs and waters. Many luminaries visited Martinsville in the early 20th century to enjoy the mineral waters and spas for their perceived therapeutic and restorative qualities.
In 1892, the Old Hickory Furniture Company was formed. The Morgan County Public Library&#x27;s Digital Archive has a collection of photographs of Old Hickory furniture including some displays for Marshall Field &amp; Co.

In recent years, Martinsville has an array of different businesses, with the courthouse square and downtown area being host to a number of locally owned restaurants, bakeries, and shops, and areas like the Grand Valley Shopping Center and Artesian Square being host to a number of restaurant chains and retail shops. In 2014, a local judge upheld an effort by the city to annex sufficient land to increase the size of the city by a third, making I-69 the frontage road for the city.

More than a dozen Martinsville locations are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Race relations===
Historically, Martinsville was the place of some racial controversies, such as the 1968 murder of 20-year-old African American Carol Jenkins, who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver while selling encyclopedias door-to-door. Jenkins&#x27; murder remained unsolved for 33 years until Kenneth Richmond was arrested for the crime. Richmond was a Hendricks County resident who was passing through Martinsville on the night Jenkins was murdered. The white couple Don and Norma Neal, who called the police to try to help Carol a half-hour before she died, proposed a monument in Carol&#x27;s memory on the courthouse grounds. The County Commissioners approved (2-1), the dissenting vote remarking it was the responsibility of the city not the county in the location for the monument. When many citizens contacted the commissioners later with similar feelings to that effect, the project was put on hold. In November 2017, Martinsville partnered with Carol&#x27;s hometown of Rushville to hold memorial events in Carol&#x27;s honor with her family present. Martinsville also dedicated a monument in Carol&#x27;s memory and presented a smaller replica of the stone to Carol&#x27;s family. That year, the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; reported that Martinsville still had a reputation among African Americans as a sundown town.

In 1998, high school basketball games in Martinsville between Martinsville High School and Bloomington High School North erupted in racist insults hurled at Bloomington players by Martinsville fans and assaults on two Bloomington players by Martinsville players. Conference Indiana banned Martinsville from hosting conference games for a year, the highest penalty ever leveled in high school sports in Indiana.

Many Martinsville residents dispute the reputation for racism and prejudice pointing out an annual award for service to the community named after a beloved African American citizen, Albert Merritt, who had a club for Martinsville boys in the 1930s.

<text>Mooresville is a town in Brown Township, Morgan County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The town is notable for being where the current flag of Indiana was created. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 9,411.

==History==
Mooresville was founded in 1824 by Samuel Moore after he had bought the area for $2 per acre. The town is named for him. A post office has been in operation at Mooresville since 1826.

The Mooresville Commercial Historic District, Mooresville Friends Academy Building, and Mooresville Gymnasium are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town was home to Paul Hadley, a watercolorist, who in 1916, had designed the current Indiana state flag for a flag contest sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution during the state&#x27;s 1916 centennial anniversary. Hadley&#x27;s flag design was adopted as the official state &quot;banner&quot; on May 31, 1917, and was later renamed to the official state &quot;flag&quot; in 1955.

The official Mooresville town flag was designed in 1974 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mooresville&#x27;s founding. The town flag was designed to look similar to the Indiana state flag, given that Mooresville is where the state flag was created. The flag consists of a yellow background with a circle of 19 blue stars with the top star being the largest. In the center of the flag is a blue cross with the date 1824 and a blue star in the lower left side of the cross. Below the cross is the name Mooresville with the letters curving. The circle of stars represents how Indiana was the 19th state of the union, with the large star representing Indiana&#x27;s statehood. The cross in the center represents the state&#x27;s motto, &quot;the crossroads of America.&quot; The date refers to the year that the town of Mooresville was founded, 1824. The star on the cross represents Mooresville&#x27;s position relative to Indianapolis.

On April 8, 2020, an EF1 tornado hit downtown, with significant winds around . From this tornado, a building on the southeast corner of Indiana and Main streets had partially collapsed in on itself. There were no injuries from the event. The building sat ruined for several months before being torn down. Due to the building&#x27;s old age, the damages could not have been repaired.

On July 3, 2020, a group of 100 Black Lives Matter protesters marched through the streets of the town. This protest was met with quick counter protesting from a group of town locals. The two groups of protesters stood at a face off across the road on 31 S Indiana Street, with the situation escalating to the point where a small group of men camped out on a nearby roof of a business wielding multiple guns. Police at the scene were aware of the men with guns, but they couldn&#x27;t do anything as the men were on their private property. The scene played out for several hours, only being held back by the police on both sides of the road.

In November 2023, the retail supermarket store Walmart in collaboration with Hasbro had released a Monopoly board game themed after the town of Mooresville titled &quot;Mooresville-Opoly.&quot; This board game sold for a limited time at the Camby Walmart store only.

<text>Kendallville is a city in Wayne Township, Noble County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. The population was 10,222 as of the 2022 census.

==History==
Kendallville was founded in 1849, and the post office had already been in operation in the area since 1837. The city was named after Amos Kendall, 8th United States Postmaster General.

The Iddings-Gilbert-Leader-Anderson Block and Kendallville Downtown Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===1992 tornado===
On July 14, 1992, Kendallville was unexpectedly struck by a significant F2 tornado. The tornado formed on the city&#x27;s west side and traveled eastward at 30 miles per hour, hitting the city&#x27;s downtown area, shopping center and residential area. The tornado increased in velocity as it uprooted trees and tore down power lines, narrowly missing the Noble County fairgrounds where the county fair was being held that week. Witnesses report the tornado touched down and lifted several times throughout its life cycle.

The tornado exited the city from its east side before dissipating in Dekalb County, traveling for 8 miles and reaching a maximum path width of 150 yards. Maximum wind speeds were estimated to be 157 miles per hour, and one-inch-in-diameter hail was reported south and west of Kendallville. 

The city&#x27;s emergency sirens did not sound; the tornado formed so rapidly and in such close proximity to town that city officials did not get an opportunity to activate them. Additionally, weather radar failed to detect the circulation due to its relatively small width for a tornado of its intensity.

Although there were no fatalities in the storm, injuries were sustained by 28 people. 31 homes were destroyed, and damages were estimated to be in excess of $13 million.

<doc id="112521" wikidata="Q1455289" url="?curid=112521" title="French Lick, Indiana">
<text>French Lick is a town in French Lick Township, Orange County, Indiana, United States. The population was 1,722 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
French Lick was originally a French trading post built near a spring and salt lick. A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. On Johnson&#x27;s 1837 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. The town was founded in 1857. French Lick&#x27;s post office has been in operation since 1847.

The sulfur springs were commercially exploited for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, French Lick was famous in the United States as a spa town. In the early 20th century it also featured casinos attracting celebrities such as boxer Joe Louis, composer Irving Berlin and gangster Al Capone.

Because of wartime travel restrictions, the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox held spring training in French Lick from 1943 to 1944; in 1945 the Cubs stayed in town while the White Sox moved to Terre Haute, utilizing Memorial Stadium. In order to conserve rail transport during World War II, 1943 spring training was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River.
