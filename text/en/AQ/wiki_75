==History==
Postville was platted in 1853. The city was named for Joel Post, a pioneer settler.

After numerous accusations of mistreatment of cattle, pollution, and violations of labor law, the federal government raided the facility in May 2008, resulting in hundreds of arrests of undocumented workers. Agriprocessors filed for bankruptcy on November 5, 2008; SHF Industries bought the plant at auction in July 2009 and it has resumed production under the new name &quot;Agri Star&quot;.

===Ethnic groups===
In 2017 about one quarter of Postville&#x27;s population were recent immigrants from Latin America and Somalia; Greg Flakus of &quot;Voice of America&quot; stated that this was ethnically diverse compared to most Iowa towns, which are almost uniformly non-Hispanic white, even though &quot;Postville is not all that diverse&quot; compared to major American metropolitan areas. The earliest immigrants were from England, Germany, and Scandinavia.

Orthodox Jews established Agriprocessors circa 1987; its founders came from New York City. At its peak, there were about 100 Orthodox Jewish families in Postville. After the 2008 raid, the number declined, and in 2017 there were about 50. Postville has services for Jewish families typically seen in larger communities. It also has a Jewish elementary school and a yeshiva. A Judaic library opened in 2005, but closed after the raid.

The 2008 raid led to the arrests of Hispanics; the resulting lack of labor drew Somalis to Postville from Minnesota and Wisconsin to work in the area kosher factory. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; said this caused a &quot;cultural shift&quot;.

&quot;&quot; discusses the arrival of the Orthodox Jews.

==Economy==
Postville&#x27;s growth was due to the presence of two large meat processing plants, Agriprocessors and Iowa Turkey Products. The Iowa Turkey Products plant burned in December 2003; it was rebuilt in Marshall, Minnesota.

Agriprocessors, a kosher meat plant, was the largest of its type in the world. As of February 2008 it employed about 900 people and purchased $100 million worth of livestock annually. In May 2008, it was the target of a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. Subsequently, a criminal complaint was filed against Agriprocessors and its principal for alleged violations of child labor laws. As a result of its legal problems, Agriprocessors became insolvent and was run by a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee until SHF Industries bought it at auction in July 2009. It resumed business as Agri Star Meat &amp; Poultry, LLC under the new ownership.

, 700 people, more than 30% of the total population, work at Agri Star; about 100 are of Somali origin.

Postville is also the home of a composites factory, Norplex-Micarta, started in 1975. The Norplex factory produces laminated plastics plate, sheet, and profile shapes. As of 2007 it employed between 150 and 200 workers.

==Education==
Postville Community School District operates public schools. John R. Mott High School is the local high school.

Mesivta of Postville is the area yeshiva.

<text>Waukon is a city in Makee Township, 
Allamakee County, Iowa, United States, and the county seat of Allamakee County. The population was 3,827 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Waukon is often said to be named for Waukon Decorah, a Ho Chunk (Winnebago) leader who was a U.S. ally during the 1832 Black Hawk War, although the city is also said to be named for his son Chief John Waukon. Winnebagos lived in this area of Iowa in the 1840s, before being forced to relocate to Minnesota.

The first white settler arrived in 1849, and the town was founded and the Waukon Post Office opened in 1853. A courthouse was completed in 1861, and the county seat was moved to Waukon in 1867 after 8 elections attempting to decide the location of the county seat. The town was incorporated in 1883. Ryan Griffith was the first mayor of Waukon, winning the 1883 election by purely being a stud. He also had major help winning the campaign from Dr. Andrew Eisenhower Kovarik.

Waukon is only about 16 miles from Waukon Junction, on the Mississippi River, but the rail line between these two points was 33 miles long, climbing 600 feet through some of the roughest terrain in Iowa. The Waukon and Mississippi Railroad, which opened in 1877, was originally built as a narrow gauge line. The line was originally controlled by the Chicago and Northwestern but was quickly acquired by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. The line was widened to standard gauge after purchase by the Milwaukee Road. Its only marginal traffic through its existence led to the road&#x27;s abandonment in the late 1960s.
There is a deposit of limonite (Iron Ore) about 3 miles northeast of Waukon called Iron Mine Hill, holding an estimated 10 million tons of ore. This is the highest point in northeastern Iowa. the Waukon Iron Company began developing an open-pit mine and ore-washing plant on this site in 1899, with a capacity of 300 tons per 10-hour shift. Production was seriously limited by the need to haul the ore 3 miles to the railroad, and the mine was, ultimately, a failure.

A second and better capitalised attempt to mine this deposit was begun in 1907 by the Missouri Iron Company, with a railroad connection built in 1910 and a new ore processing plant completed in 1913 with a capacity of 350 to 400 tons per day. The total investment was estimated at $225,000, and two patents were issued for the machinery in the ore processing plant. This mine became the principal mine of the new Mississippi Valley Iron Company of St. Louis, Missouri in 1916.

That year, the mine produced 10,151 tons of concentrated ore, and in 1917, it produced 22,612 tons. In 1918 the mine produced over 7000 tons before it was shut down because of World War I.

The mine never recovered from this shutdown, and the equipment was sold for scrap in 1937. Iron Mine Drive and Allamakee Street cross north of the sites of both old mines ().

==Geography==
The headwaters of the north branch of Paint Creek are in Waukon, and the town is just south of the headwaters of Village Creek. This is on the west edge of the deeply eroded Driftless Area of northeast Iowa. The town sits on a plain underlain by the Galena Limestone formation. There are many sinkholes in this plain south of Waukon. To the north, a tongue of Galena Limestone underlies Iron Hill.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Centerville is a city in and the county seat of Appanoose County, Iowa, United States. The population was 5,412 in the 2020 census, a decline from 5,924 in 2000. After the turn of the 20th century Centerville&#x27;s coal mining industry attracted European immigrants from Sweden, Italy, Croatia, and Albania. Centerville is also home of the largest town square in the state of Iowa.

== History ==
Founded in 1846 by Jonathon Stratton under the name of &quot;Chaldea,&quot; the city was planned around a unique two-block long city square. The name was later changed to Senterville, named after William Tandy Senter, a prominent Tennessee politician. When incorporation papers were filed in 1855, someone mistook the name for a misspelling and corrected it to Centerville.

=== A mining town ===
The first coal mine in Centerville was opened in 1868, with its mine shaft about one-half mile from the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad depot. Horse-power was used to raise coal from the mines until 1872, when the Watson Coal Company opened a mine equipped with a steam hoist. The Centerville Block Coal Company, organized in 1894, consolidated the operation of numerous mines in the region to become the dominant mining company. In 1914, Centerville Block Coal produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state. Centerville Block&#x27;s largest competitor, formed around the same time, was the Scandinavian Coal Company, organized by a group of Swedish immigrants. By 1938, coal production in the Centerville region was 600,000 tons per year. The mines were in the Mystic coal bed, 125 feet below ground in Centerville but exposed at the surface in Mystic, 5 miles to the northwest.
Centerville Block Coal&#x27;s Relay Mine Number 3 was located on the west side of town (Number 31 on the map). By 1908, the coal face was a mile from the base of the shaft. Mules were used to haul trains of loaded coal tubs to the main haulage way, where they were hauled by a continuous loop of cable the last half mile to the shaft. The coal seam here was about 3 feet thick, and the shaft was 107 feet deep. A centrifugal blower 12 feet in diameter provided ventilation, and compressed air was used to power mining machinery.

Local Assembly 1020 of the Knights of Labor was based in Centerville and had a membership of 150 in 1884. On April 1, 1885, 325 miners in town went on strike, protesting a 20% drop in wages reflecting a decrease in the demand for coal during the summer months. Later, the United Mine Workers of America had a very strong presence in Centerville. In 1912, UMWA Local 553 in Centerville had 1194 members, making it the second largest UMWA local in the country. The largest UMWA local was in Buxton, Iowa.

In 1910, the Scandinavian Coal Company drilled a 550-foot exploratory hole in Centerville, discovering a deposit of gypsum and anhydrite 10 feet thick near the bottom. The Centerville Gypsum Company was formed to exploit this deposit, and between 1912 and 1913, the company bored a shaft down to the gypsum. Water problems delayed the opening of the mine until 1917, and commercial production began in 1919. The mine was closed in the early 1930s.

The Sunshine mine, about 3 miles west of Centerville (number 30 on the map), was very small in 1908, with just a horse-powered hoist at the pit head. By the 1930s, this was a large mine with an attached mining camp and a mountain of mine waste 500 feet long. The Sunshine Mine Drive-In is a theater on the former mine site that opened in 2005, but has since closed and fallen into disrepair.

=== The post-coal era ===
Centerville experienced its peak population in the early 1900s as the popularity of coal peaked. After that point, as usage dwindled, the coal industry that had been the community&#x27;s life blood collapsed. In the 1950s and 1960s a civic movement to promote new industries began. This effort culminated in the building of Rathbun Dam, near the city of Rathbun, Iowa, forming Rathbun Lake, known as &quot;Iowa&#x27;s Ocean&quot;, that was dedicated on July 31, 1971, by President Richard M. Nixon.

In June 2006 the Centerville Daily Iowegian reported that the city&#x27;s largest employer, a Rubbermaid plant, that opened in Centerville in 1985, would shut down in September 2006 displacing 500 workers. In 2007, the former Rubbermaid building was purchased by Lee Container, a manufacturer of products made of high density polyethylene plastic resin.

The Southern Iowa Railroad was an electric interurban connecting Centerville to Moravia with a branch to Mystic. The railroad disbanded in 1967. The Appanoose County Community Railroad (APNC) was a short-line railroad founded in 1984, operating on discarded former rail lines, and connecting to the BNSF railroad in Albia. The APNC was succeeded by the Iowa Southern Railway in 2016 and still provides rail service to the city.

<text>Moravia is a city in Appanoose County, Iowa, United States. The population was 637 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Moravia is named for the religious faith. Moravian families left Salem, North Carolina, in 1849 to start a colony in the west. Money was sent to purchase forty acres of land for a town site by several benevolent Moravian sisters. It was their wish that town lots be sold and the money be used to build a Moravian Church. The families made the long journey to Iowa and acquired many acres of land.

The town site of Moravia was laid out on June 27, 1850 and was recorded July 15, 1851. The surveying was done using a pocket compass and tapeline for measuring instruments. The old ridge road from Unionville, Iowa, to Moravia and west to Iconium, Iowa, supplied part of the Mormon Trail of 1846 from Nauvoo, Illinois, to Salt Lake City, Utah.

<text>Mystic is a city in Appanoose County, Iowa, United States. The population was 322 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

At the end of the 19th century, &quot;the valley of Walnut Creek was one continuous mining camp, known under different names, Jerome, Diamond, Mystic, Clarkdale, Rathbun and Darby&quot; (later known as Darbyville). The present name is derived from Mystic, Connecticut. A. M. Elgin opened the first coal mine in the Mystic area in 1857, about 1.5 miles north of Mystic on Little Walnut Creek. The Mystic coal seam was exposed on the surface there, and drifts were opened and abandoned over the next few decades until the hills were honeycombed with mines.

In 1858, Isaac Fuller opened a large mine in Mystic, shipping coal for domestic use in nearby Centerville. In 1887, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway built a line through Mystic, leading to an explosive growth in mining. By 1893, there were 14 mines in Mystic and 2 in Brazil, just to the south. It is noteworthy that the terms &quot;brass&quot;, &quot;brazzle&quot; and &quot;brazil&quot; are English dialect terms for pyrite or to coal seams with significant pyrite content and that a shale layer not far above the Mystic coal seam in Mystic and Brazil contains significant pyrite.

Local Assembly 3335 of the Knights of Labor was based in Brazil and had a membership of 75 in 1884. The miners of Mystic and Brazil joined the United Mine Workers in 1898. By 1902, Local 201 in Brazil had 220 members and Local 634 in Mystic had 569 members. By 1912, Local 201 had 370 members and Locals 239 and 634 in Mystic had a combined membership of 851. The total UMWA membership in 1912 represents about 1/4 of the entire population.

In 1914, the Lodwick Brothers Coal Company of Mystic produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state.

==Geography==
Mystic is located in the valley of Walnut Creek, approximately four miles southwest of its confluence with the Chariton River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Audubon is a city and the county seat in Audubon County, Iowa, United States. The population was 2,053 in the 2020 census, a decline from 2,382 in the 2000 census.

==History==
The city is named for John James Audubon the world-famous ornithologist, artist, and painter.

Audubon was laid out by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, on September 23, 1878. An auction sale of town lots was held on October 15, 1878, with a total sales of $6,190. The railroad was completed on December 6, 1878, and by December 16, 1878, over fifty houses, a bank, five general stores, one jewelry store, two hotels, one restaurant, three meat markets, three blacksmith shops, one harness shop, one livery stable, two coal yards, two lumber yards, one elevator, three grain dealers, and a school house were built. With the four months of rapid growth in Audubon there was already talk of moving the county seat from Exira which was 13 miles away. In 1879 the railroad built what was to become the county courthouse and leased it to the county for five years free of cost, in case the county seat was moved to Audubon. In the 1879 general election the vote approved the moving of the county seat to Audubon.

Although the railroad was responsible for starting the town, Ethelbert J. Freeman was the driving force behind the growth of Audubon. Having lived in Exira, Freeman was the agent for the sale of the railroad lands and the town lots and was one of the first people to live in Audubon. Already active in county politics, he became the first mayor of Audubon and was prominent in the incorporation of the town in 1880. Freeman was half owner of the Citizens Bank, chief of the fire department, and became the manager of the waterworks built in 1882 and later manager of the electric light plant when it was built in 1891.

The first postmaster was Arthur L. Sanborn, appointed February 15, 1879. The town post office contains a mural, &quot;Audubon&#x27;s Trip Down the Ohio and Mississippi – 1820&quot;, painted in 1942 by Virginia Snedeker. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Robert Hunter was the first school teacher from 1878 to 1879. The school keep growing in size and enrollment and by the fall of 1887 the school had eight school rooms, a teaching staff of 10, and 416 pupils enrolled. Audubon was a well-established city by 1900, and growth slowed after that. In 1915 the city was recorded to have a public library, 9 lawyers, 10 medical professionals, 3 veterinarians, 7 clergymen, 4 bankers and many other businesses.

Audubon was a RAGBRAI overnight stop in 1986 and 2006.

<text>Luzerne is a city in Benton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 112 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Cedar Rapids Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Luzerne was founded following construction of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway through the territory. Luzerne was named and platted as a town on the railroad by Isaac B. Howe, the Superintendent of the Iowa Div. of the railway, in 1868.

In October of 1867 it was determined to relocate a station at &quot;Buckeye&quot; to an empty place in the plains midway between Blairstown and Belle Plaine. This move was a mere 2 miles to the east. The new station was named Luzerne, named by IB Howe for the Swiss town that he longed to visit. Buckeye no longer exists but would now be an empty place 2 miles to the west of Luzerne. 

It might seem strange that there would be some advantage moving a station 2 miles; plus also a number of buildings that needed moving as well. The Buckeye station was run by railroad magnate John I Blair’s railroad group who owned the Cedar Rapids &amp; Missouri River railroad which had originally planned the road to Omaha. The DR&amp;MR was now under permanent lease to the Chicago &amp; North Western, who wanted any excuse to squeeze out Blair if it could be to their benefit. Taking full advantage of the Luzerne station, Howe purchased the land and platted a new town there on 17 April 1868. 
This was shortly after the C&amp;NW had connected with the Union Pacific&#x27;s Transcontinental railroad in Council Bluffs, giving Luzerne a direct connection with the Pacific Coast the following year.

In 1897, Walford gained national attention when the general store burned down, leaving a charred corpse; since two men were missing, news stories about the identity of the corpse and the hunt for the survivor made the headlines for weeks.

<text>Dunkerton is a city in Black Hawk County, Iowa, United States. The population was 842 at the time of the 2020 census. It is part of the Waterloo–Cedar Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The story of the settling of Lester Township, Black Hawk County, Iowa, begins with the arrival of Jonathan Owen and his wife Hannah to Illinois in 1850 where land was selling for $20 an acre. The Owens sent their son, Eli, on to Iowa where the land was cheaper. Eli staked his claim on 40 acres in what is now Lester Township, four miles north of the current town of Dunkerton. The following year Jonathan Owen, Philander Canfield, and Alonzo Barber came from Illinois and staked their claims for land in Lester Township at the Federal Land Office Dubuque for $1.25 an acre. In 1853, the Owen family, Philander Canfield, and Alonzo Barber came from Illinois with ox-drawn wagons to settle in the area. More families arrived in 1854-1855. 

The village that sprang up near these first settlers in northern Lester Township was named Lester (sometimes referred to as Lester Center) and was located two and one-half miles north of the current town of Dunkerton.

In 1853, two brothers, James and John Dunkerton arrived from Ohio to stake out a claim of land in Lester Township. On August 22, 1854, John died and was one of the first to be buried in the Lester Township cemetery. James remained and built up his land. On December 25, 1854, he married Christiana Hodges. 

In 1886 the Chicago Great Western Railway was being built between Oelwein, Iowa and Waterloo, Iowa. There were two proposed locations for a station in Lester Township. On September 22, 1886, A. S. Cummings, as spokesman, met with the Board of Supervisors and railroad officials to ask that the station be built on the Mary French property (south half of northeast corner of Section 27). At the same time, Mr. and Mrs. James Dunkerton were boarding the surveyors working for the railroad. These men were so pleased with the Dunkerton&#x27;s hospitality that they recommended the route cross the Dunkerton farm. Mr. Dunkerton made the company an offer that if the railroad crossed his farm, and if a station named Dunkerton was located on it, he would donate the right of way through his land. Otherwise, the company would be required to pay for the land they crossed. His offer was accepted, and grading began in August and was completed December 1, 1886. 

On October 19, 1886, the town of Dunkerton was surveyed and platted by John Ball, the Black Hawk County surveyor. The plat was filed and recorded. The town was called Dunkerton to coincide with the name of the railroad station. Several villages in the surrounding area (Lester, Blakeville, Barclay, Frogtown, and Gresham) gradually ceased to exist as businesses and homes moved to Dunkerton to be near the railroad.

In 1899, A.S. Cummings took the steps necessary to have the town incorporated. John A. Campbell was the first mayor, E.W. Magee, Sr. the town clerk, and C.M. Roberts the treasurer.

Dunkerton History Museum

The Dunkerton History Museum is located in the lower level of the Dunkerton Public Library, 203 E. Tower Street. The museum board is currently in the process of restoring three historic buildings in the lots to the east of the library: the Barclay #3 one-room school, which will become an extension of the museum and house historic displays; the Gresham (Bennington #1) school, which will be restored as a reproduction of a one-room school and a venue for hosting one-room school experiences; and the Lincoln Depot, which will tell the story of the railroad serving as the catalyst for the founding of the town of Dunkerton in 1886. Hours of the museum coincide with the library&#x27;s open hours.

<text>Evansdale is a city in Black Hawk County, Iowa, United States. The population was 4,561 in the 2020 census, an increase from 4,526 in 2000. It is part of the Waterloo–Cedar Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==

Evansdale&#x27;s longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal form are 42.467837, -92.282105.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Evansdale is a border to border suburb of Waterloo.

==History==
Evansdale began its existence in 1947, when the residents of the Home Acres and River Forest Area adjoining the east city limits of Waterloo were confronted with a common drainage problem, formed the Home Acres Improvement Association. In August of that year the Association petitioned for articles of incorporation as a town and presented their documents to District Judge William T. Evans through Parkersburg attorney Dale Van Eman, hence Evansdale. The poll resulted in a 205-106 favorable count to incorporate. The history of growth in the area can be timed back to the turn of the century. Situated in East Waterloo Township, Evansdale evolved from several different sections that were developed. Around the turn of the century, William T. Evans owned a farm just south of Watermelon Avenue in what is approximately the present route of Highway 20. Lafayette Road, an extension of Lafayette Street from Waterloo, cut through the Evans&#x27; farm. Just east of Evans&#x27; farm was a farm owned by Julia B. Richards. The County School #1 sat on the corner of Richards&#x27; property in what eventually became known as Evans Crossing. This was the first of the sections which later became Evansdale.

Other large farmers in the area at the time were: Mary C. Crumrine, Jacob Griffith, Samuel R. White, C.C. Wolf, Hugh Newell, Lore Alford, James Gardner, George Shirley, J.H. Johnston, August Westendorf, Frederick Timmermann and Carl Bunger. Another section of land was made up in part by the land owned by C.C. Wolf. The land was located between what is now Grand Blvd. and the present site of Evans Road. In the early 1900s Wolf built the Elk Run Hotel to be used as a summer resort. The hotel had a large ballroom and dining room and was well known by the residents of northeast Iowa. Commuter trains of the Illinois Central railroad brought weekend visitors to the resort, which faced the Cedar River.
At that time, Wolf, who was originally from Parkersburg, began to plat lots in the area. However, his hotel business failed, and in 1928 William Fox formed the Home Acres Land Association and developed the land formerly owned by Wolf and some additional land in Evansdale. Mr. Fox operated an insurance agency in Evansdale for many years. The Home Acres Land Association was originally headquartered in the Elk Run Hotel. A third section, which was developed prior to the land development by Fox was Casebeer Heights. Lore Alford, a prominent Waterloo lawyer owned the land at the turn of the century. He sold the property to Jack Casebeer, a Waterloo restaurant owner. Casebeer developed the land as a summer resort.
Other sections of Evansdale were developed just prior to 1941 but it was the building boom following the War that created the problems that precipitated the incorporation of the city. Shortly thereafter on November 1, 1947, one-hundred and ten voters turned out to elect the only ticket on the ballot at that time with William Wiltfang as mayor. The first council meeting was conducted November 24, 1947, in an abandoned chicken house owned by Councilman Boelman.
Since that time, Evansdale&#x27;s growth has been steady but complicated. With the growth of the city the installation of sewers and water lines were necessary to keep pace with the needs of the community. Progress was complicated by the introduction of the Urban Renewal program in 1969. However, the program provided for a fresh start for the city with new housing and renovation to give Evansdale a new look.

== Government ==
Evansdale is administered by a five-member city council and a mayor. One council member is elected from each of Evansdale&#x27;s four wards, and one is elected at-large. The current mayor is Doug Faas. Who has served as a former Evansdale City Council member, and also previously served as a board member on the Waterloo Community School Board. His predecessor was Chad Deutsch. Deutsch was elected in 2007 after unsuccessful attempts in 2001 and 2005 to unseat former Mayor John Mardis, and served three terms as Mayor.

John Mardis served eight consecutive terms as mayor, which made him the longest serving Evansdale Mayor. In 2007 the city had a budget of $3.8 million and a tax rate of $6.75 per $1000 of taxable property valuation. A new community response center was built to house the police and fire rescue, who were outgrowing their respective areas.

Janesville was founded in 1849 by John T. Barrick, a Quaker and abolitionist who had relocated to Iowa from Ohio.

Janesville was a farming community with a population of 311 in 1900, according to the Iowa Data Center . The town&#x27;s population increased to just 445 by 1950.

During the farm crisis and economic recession that hit Northeast Iowa in the 1980s, Janesville&#x27;s population declined slightly. Since the mid-1990s, with the completion of the four lane bypass U.S. Highway 218 / Iowa Highway 27, known as the &quot;Avenue of the Saints&quot;, Janesville&#x27;s population is again increasing. New residential subdivisions continue to develop within the city of Janesville and the surrounding area.

==History==

Coal mining played an important part in the early history of the Boone area. Local blacksmiths were already mining coal from the banks of Honey Creek south of what became Boone in 1849.

Boone was platted as a town in 1865 by John Insley Blair. It was incorporated the following year, when the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company railroad station was built there. The town was originally named &quot;Montana&quot;; it was renamed to Boone in 1871. The nearby town of Boonesboro was also chartered in 1866; Boonesboro was annexed to Boone in 1887. The present name is a tribute to Nathan Boone, son of explorer Daniel Boone.

Commercial mining was spurred by the arrival of the railroad. In 1867, Canfield and Taylor opened a mine just west of town. Their mine shaft was 242 feet deep, and they hauled coal to the railroad by wagon. In 1874, a railroad spur was built to the mine. This mine was taken over by the railroad, and operated for 30 years.
There were coal seams in the Boone area; the upper vein, about 3 feet thick, was always worked using longwall mining, while the lower vein was always mined using room and pillar mining. In 1912, United Mine Workers Local 869 in Boone had 554 members, close to 10% of the population at the time.

The grocery chain Fareway originated in Boone. The company maintains their business offices in town also.

The first Casey&#x27;s General Store was founded in Boone, Iowa in 1968.

Other larger businesses that have had or still maintain facilities in Boone include Gates Rubber, Heinrich Envelope, Archway Bakery, Lowe-Berry Seeds, Coca-Cola Bottling, Quinn Iron &amp; Wire Works (now Besser Quinn Machine &amp; Foundry), Mid-States Steel, Sunoco Products, Specialty Leather Productions, Randy&#x27;s Frozen Meats, PDM Distribution, ProLiant Biologicals, APC, Thermomass Composite Tech, CDS Global, Patterson Logistics and Stoll Bottling.

== Transportation ==

Boone is located on U.S. Route 30. The original Lincoln Highway ran through the center of town, but a new four-lane highway was built in the late 1960s that bypassed the center of Boone to the south. There is also a network of paved country roads radiating out in all directions.

Boone is served by the mainline of the Union Pacific, which purchased the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad (C&amp;NW) in 1995. Boone was a division and crew change point on the railroad under the Chicago &amp; North Western and some of that business remains today. There is a moderate-sized rail yard to the east of the downtown area. The locomotives no longer sound their horns in the town proper due to modifications to the various points where streets intersect with the rail line.

Boone was also the exact midpoint on the Fort Dodge, Des Moines &amp; Southern Railroad, an electric interurban line converted to diesel in 1955 after a flood on the Des Moines River devastated the Fraser hydroelectric power plant that supplied power to the railroad. It connected with the C&amp;NW downtown. It was purchased by the C&amp;NW in 1968 and subsequently abandoned. The western part of the line to Fraser has been resurrected as the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad, a tourist line.

The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad also ran a branch line into Boone from the southeast. It likewise connected with the C&amp;NW. The line was trimmed back to Luther in the late 1960s and completely abandoned a few years later.

===Tourist attractions===

Vincenzo Miserendino&#x27;s final and largest statue of Theodore Roosevelt, which was eight times life-size was commissioned in 1941, and was scheduled to arrive in Boone, Iowa, in 1943. However, before casting, its 4,000 pounds of bronze was appropriated for World War II. Miserendino commented that Theodore Roosevelt himself would have approved of that decision to put the service of the country first. Later, in 1946, the Roman Bronze Corporation of Corona, New York City, produced the casting in Miserendino&#x27;s original mold. On January 6, 1948, it was placed in . Residing on three large granite blocks, the 6&#x27; 3&quot; statue depicts Roosevelt rising out of a mountainous landscape with his hand outstretched as if addressing a crowd.

==History==

Madrid was a small coal mining community during the winter and a farming community during the summer. Mining became a larger part of its economy as time went on. Initially, coal was used locally for winter heating, hence the reason for it being considered a part-time job by most residents. The Carpenter Coal Company opened a mine between Madrid and Woodward in 1901, and the Reese Brothers Coal Company opened two mine shafts near Madrid. The Carpenter Brothers named their coal camp Scandia, and changed their corporate name to match. By 1914, The Scandia Coal Company of Madrid produced over 100,000 tons of coal per year, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state. In 1912, Locals 709 and 2460 of the United Mine Workers union, both based in Madrid, had an aggregate membership of 397, representing about 1/3 of the total population in 1910.

Madrid gained a large Italian and Croatian population who worked in its coal mines during the 1920s and 1930s. In 2017 the town was featured in an episode of &quot;Madrid de sol a sol&quot;, a show from Spanish public channel Telemadrid exploring locations named &quot;Madrid&quot;.

==Transportation==
Ogden is located on U.S. Route 30. The original Lincoln Highway (Walnut St.) ran through the center of town, but a new four-lane highway was built in 1965 that bypassed Ogden immediately south of town. The original pour for Hwy 30 was resurfaced in Ogden&#x27;s business district. One notable aspect are the footprints in the cement that were evident towards the western edge of the business district - Walnut &amp; 6th St. - where they crossed the roadway. A section, which features the footprints, was removed prior to the resurfacing work and are preserved in downtown Ogden U.S. Route 169 (First St.) intersected with Hwy 30 at Walnut St. until Hwy 30 was relocated south of town. The presence of these two main routes benefitted Ogden&#x27;s businesses which thrived from all the traffic these two roadways brought through the town.

The east/west line of the former Chicago &amp; North Western railroad (a key link between Chicago and the western US) - now Union Pacific - ran through town parallel to U.S. 30. A depot was maintained in Ogden when the C&amp;NW provided passenger service prior to 1956 along that line. The C&amp;NW merged with the Union Pacific in 1995. Railway Express Agency had an office in the depot which brought freight and parcel services to Ogden also.

<text>Sheldahl is a city in Polk, Boone, and Story counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 297 at the time of the 2020 census.

The Boone County portion of Sheldahl is part of the Boone Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the Story County portion is part of the Ames Metropolitan Statistical Area. Together, these two areas form the Ames–Boone Combined Statistical Area. The small portion of the city that extends into Polk County is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area was settled by 120 Norwegian immigrants from Lisbon, Illinois on June 7, 1855; including Osmond and Anna Sheldahl and five of their children. It incorporated as a city on January 18, 1882.

The Chicago and Northwestern Railway established a NE to S rail line through Sheldahl during the 1880s. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad connected with this line 2 miles north in Slater. In 2005, Union Pacific Railroad sold a 25-mile discontinued rail corridor—which included the recently abandoned line through Sheldahl—to the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, which enabled the construction of the recreational High Trestle Trail. Access to the trail, including a parking area and washroom, is located in Sheldahl.

=== Grump ===
Readlyn&#x27;s motto is &quot;857 Friendly People &amp; One Old Grump&quot;, as is prominently written on the city&#x27;s sign on Iowa Highway 3. This refers to a local legend associated with Readlyn, as well as an actual title of honor given to a random senior resident of Readlyn in an annual ceremony by the Readlyn Community Club.

According to local legend, Readlyn&#x27;s &quot;Grump&quot; originated early in the city&#x27;s history, when a railroad passed through the area. In 1904, an unkempt elderly nomad whose real name is not known, who had been freighthopping since his youth, disembarked from a train that arrived in Readlyn with the intent of settling down there. However, within his first day of staying in Readlyn, residents noticed he would persistently ignore everyone who tried to greet him and never seemed to display much emotion aside from a fatigued frown, and soon he became known in Readlyn as the &quot;Old Grump&quot;. The Old Grump&#x27;s reputation held until roughly one year later when, upon experiencing an unclear amusing event in the city, he laughed &quot;for the first time in years&quot;.

The tradition of honorarily assigning a Grump began in 1990, when Sam Sickles volunteered to be the first honorary Grump, owing to his age and grumpy attitude. Every third week of June since then, during a series of community events known as &quot;Grump Days&quot;, a new Grump has been chosen from Readlyn residents aged 65 or older who submit their names for selection. The only exception to this was in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; to compensate, two Grumps were crowned in 2021. Though the title&#x27;s name suggests it is given for poor behavior, the Grump title is considered a prestigious honor by Readlyn residents, and those who have been the Grump generally view it as a source of pride. The Grump is expected to participate in community events and parades, writes a monthly article about positive local events in the city newspaper, and is given benefits and goods such as a special hat and a custom license plate. Photos of the Grumps are preserved in the Readlyn Historical Society, as well as at Grumpy&#x27;s Spirits, Suds &amp; Grub, a local restaurant. The &quot;Grump&quot; as a character is also associated with Readlyn institutions such as a cartoon-styled statue of a &quot;Grump&quot;, loosely based on the original Old Grump, on a bench serving as a local tourist attraction.

<text>Waverly is a city in Bremer County, Iowa, United States. The population was 10,394 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Bremer County and is part of the Waterloo–Cedar Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The sister city of Waverly is the German city of Eisenach, which is famous for the Wartburg castle. Waverly is the location of Wartburg College, which is named after the castle.

==Early Waverly history==
=== Indian reservation===
The first permanent residents of Waverly were settled there against their will. Because of their alleged assistance given to Chief Black Hawk during the Blackhawk War of 1832, the Winnebago were forced to cede their lands east of the Mississippi and to move to Neutral Ground in what is now northeastern Iowa. They were to receive $270,000 ($10,000 per year for 27 years) and were required to surrender several of their tribesmen accused of murdering whites during the war. At that time there were three tribes living in the area, the Ho-Chunk numbering about 500, the Meskwaki numbering about 100 and the Pottawattomi numbering about 50. With Iowa statehood in 1846, the Winnebago were moved again. In an 1845 treaty, the Winnebago exchanged their Iowa lands for the Long Prairie (Crow Wing River) reserve in Minnesota and $190,000. In 1848, a detachment of United States troops from Fort Atkinson, Iowa, came to enforce the removal. All told, between 1840 and 1863, the Winnebagoes were moved five times. They were pushed first to northeastern Iowa, then to Long Prairie, Minnesota, then to Blue Earth, Minnesota, then to Crow Creek, South Dakota. In 1865, after the constant upheaval cost 700 tribal members’ lives, the current Winnebago Reservation in Nebraska was established by the treaties of 1865 and 1874. The tribe lost more than two thirds of this land in the General Allotment Act of 1887. By 1913, only of cropland, woodland, and pasture remained. The tribe is federally recognized and organized under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. The Winnebago Tribe established a constitution in 1936 which was amended in 1968.

===Settlement===
Frederick Cretzmeyer is credited with being the first European settler in Waverly. Having purchased in 1852, he built a log hut on the east side of the Cedar River (or what was once called the Red Cedar River). Soon more homes were constructed as other settlers arrived, with some of their later homes built just over the hill behind the old recycling center.

William Patterson Harmon came to Waverly in the spring of 1853 with the idea of establishing a town and a saw mill. He purchased most of what is now Waverly from the United States Government for $1.25 an acre. The area was incorporated as a town on April 25, 1859, according to the Library of the State of Iowa. (A centennial celebration was held in August 1956.)

Two stories exist on how the town was named. The speaker at the ceremony was said to have been a fan of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels and when it came time to name the town (which settlers had wanted to call Harmonville or Harmon) he inadvertently called it Waverly. The myth goes that Jennie Harmon Case later wrote that it was her father who was the speaker and that he made the decision to name the town after the favorite book, instead of the proposed &quot;Harmonville.&quot; Coincidentally, Bremer County&#x27;s name also honors a person eminent in literature. Bremer was named in 1850 by Governor Hempstead, who was an admirer of the Swedish feminist author Fredrika Bremer.

The first school was started by Charles Ensign in a log cabin in 1854. A stone school house was erected by 1855 and additional schools were built in 1861 and 1868. The first graduating class of the Waverly High School was the class of 1875 with two students. Wartburg College moved to Waverly from Clinton, Iowa, in 1856. The public library was established in 1866.

In 2014, the Waverly East Bremer Avenue Commercial Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among the noted buildings in the listing is the WPA-era post office, which contains a mural designed by artist Mildred W. Pelzer for the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The painting, called &quot;A Letter from Home in 1856&quot;, depicted a farm family pausing during plowing to read a letter from their former home.

==Roadside attraction==
Brandon is home to Iowa&#x27;s largest frying pan. Constructed in 2004, the frying pan promotes the Brandon Community Club&#x27;s semi-annual Cowboy Breakfast. The pan weighs over 1,000 pounds.

It took these men a little over forty volunteer man hours to construct the frying pan. It is made out of scrap steel that was donated by local farmers. The pan was originally built as a promotional tool for the Brandon Area Community Club&#x27;s annual fundraiser, the &quot;cowboy breakfast&quot;. They chose to build a large frying pan because the cowboy breakfast is cooked over open flames using mostly cast iron frying pans.

===Dimensions===
It is quantitatively 10 times the size of a 10-inch frying pan.
*Weight: 1,200 pounds
*Total length: 14 feet 3 inches
*Rim diameter: 9 feet 3 inches
*Base diameter: 8 feet
*Handle length: 5 feet

===Capacity===
The frying pan is calculated to hold 88 times as much as a 10-inch frying pan.
*528 eggs (44 dozen)
*352 pork chops (1/2 pound chops)
*88 pounds of bacon
*440 hamburgers (1/2 pound burgers)

<text>Independence is a city in, and the county seat of, Buchanan County, Iowa, United States. The population was 6,064 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Independence was founded on June 15, 1847 near the center of present-day Buchanan County. The original town plat was a simple nine-block grid on the east side of the Wapsipinicon River. The town was intended as an alternative to Quasqueton (then called Quasequetuk), which was the county seat prior to 1847. The village of Independence had fewer than 15 persons when the county seat was transferred there.

On Main Street, on the west bank of the Wapsipinicon, a six-story grist mill was built in 1867. Some of its foundation stones were taken from that of an earlier mill, the New Haven Mill, built in 1854, that was used for wool processing. (Prior to the incorporation of Independence on October 15, 1864, a short-lived neighboring village, called New Haven, had grown up on the west side of the river, hence the name New Haven Mill.) The 1867 mill, now called the Wapsipinicon Mill, was a source of electrical energy from 1915 to 1940. Some structural restoration occurred in recent years, and the mill now functions partly as an historical museum.

A courthouse was built in 1857, on the east side of the town, on a site described at that time as &quot;the highest tract of land in the neighborhood,&quot; where offers &quot;a fine view of the city of Independence, the Valley of the Wapsipinicon, and the surrounding Country&quot;. The original courthouse was replaced in 1939 by a Moderne or Art Deco structure.

Among the town&#x27;s distinctions has been the long-term presence of the Independence State Hospital (formerly called the Iowa State Hospital for the Insane), located on a large, remote tract of land on the west edge of town. The recently restored main building, called the Reynolds Building (made of &quot;native prairie granite&quot; in French Second Empire style), was built in 1873. Today it is open to the public for scheduled tours.

For a few years in the late 1880s and early 1890s, Independence was a nationally known horse-racing center, and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Lexington of the North&quot;. This came about as a result of the meteoric financial success of Charles W. Williams. A telegraph operator and creamery owner from nearby Jesup, Iowa, Williams (with no experience in breeding horses) purchased in 1885 two mares, each of which within a year gave birth to a stallion. These two stallions, which Williams named Axtel and Allerton, went on the set world trotting records, with the result that Williams&#x27; earnings enabled him to publish a racing newspaper titled &quot;The American Trotter&quot;, to build a large three-story hotel and opera house called The Gedney, and to construct a figure-eight shaped race track on the west edge of town, on a large section of land called Rush Park, where he also built a magnificent horse barn, his family mansion, and peripheral structures. The burgeoning community was soon home to other mansions, churches, and even a trolley-car service. Williams went on to raise other record-breaking horses, but he lost much of his fortune in the Panic of 1893. Williams subsequently moved to Galesburg, Illinois, where (among other things) he became acquainted with the young Carl Sandburg (as mentioned in Sandburg&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Always the Young Strangers&quot;). Today, the location of Williams&#x27; race track (which was the original site of the Buchanan County Fairgrounds) is a corn field. His house is still standing, but, in recent years, the Rush Park barn was demolished by a bulldozer, to make way for a fastfood drive-in and an auto parts store. In the years that followed the race track days, the town lost most of its importance when the railroad terminal at Independence was pushed further west to Waterloo, Iowa.

It is not widely known that Independence has an historical connection with the American-born writer Gertrude Stein. While living in Paris, Stein became close friends with an American expatriate painter named William Edwards Cook, who was born in Independence in 1881. It was Cook who taught Stein how to drive (so that she could transport supplies for the French during World War I). In her second autobiography, titled &quot;Everybody’s Autobiography&quot;, she talks about her fondness for the state, and for Cook&#x27;s hometown in particular, which she had never visited (although, as a child in San Francisco, she was well aware of the town&#x27;s sudden celebrity as a horse racing center). Her fondness for Iowa is also partly attributable to her close friendship with American writer Carl Van Vechten (who would become her literary executor), who had grown up in nearby Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In 1933, when Stein traveled throughout the U.S. on a book publicity tour, she eagerly agreed to speak at Iowa City (on the second floor of what is now the Prairie Lights Bookstore), with the provision that she would be able to fly over Independence, to see Cook&#x27;s birthplace from the air. Unfortunately, the Midwest was hit by a major winter storm that day, and Stein&#x27;s visit to Iowa was entirely cancelled. Cook himself had returned to Independence for an extended visit in 1925, to assist in settling the affairs of his father, an Independence lawyer who had died the year before. When Cook returned to Paris, he used part of his inheritance to commission a young architect named Le Corbusier to design, on the outskirts of Paris, what is now considered to be one of the first Cubist houses, called Maison Cook or Villa Cook.

The race track at Rush Park has also the distinction of being the site of the first one-mile bicycle speed record of under two minutes, which was set in 1892 at Independence by John S. Johnson.

Of additional interest are several other buildings of historic and architectural value. Among these are the Christian Seeland House and Brewery at 1010 4th Street Northeast (1873), an Italianate style mansion and brewery; Saint John&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church at 2nd Street and 4th Avenue Northeast (1911); the Munson Building, formerly the Independence Free Public Library, at 210 2nd Street Northeast (1893–95); Saint James Episcopal Church on 2nd Avenue Northeast, just north of 2nd Street (1863, 1873); and the Depression-era United States Post Office Building at 2nd Street and 2nd Avenue Northeast (1934), not for its architecture, but because hanging inside in the lobby is a WPA mural from the 1930s, titled &quot;Postman in the Snow&quot;, painted by a former Independence resident named Robert Tabor. About 10 miles east of Independence, south of U.S. Highway 20, near Quasqueton, is the Lowell Walter house or Cedar Rock, a state-owned Frank Lloyd Wright house that is open to the public from May through October.

==Notable person==

*Larry Lujack (born Larry Lee Blankenburg in Quasqueton, June 6, 1940; died December 18, 2013, in Santa Fe, New Mexico) Radio DJ, member of the National Radio Hall of Fame and NAB Hall of Fame. Best known for his work on radio stations WCFL (AM), and WLS AM/FM in Chicago.

==In popular culture==

The place name Quasqueton entered popular culture with the 1979 publication by TSR, Inc. of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons® B1 game module by Mike Carr, entitled “In Search of the Unknown.” The module, designed specifically for new players and Dungeon Masters, featured a fictional stronghold within a rocky promontory that its builders and former residents (a warrior named Rogahn and a wizard named Zelligar) had named Quasqueton.

Prior to creating that work, Carr had lived in nearby Cedar Rapids and, knowing of the town, chose the very distinctive name of Quasqueton for his fictional setting. Before the internet, few individuals outside of eastern Iowa had heard of it – but after the advent of online search engines, the actual source of the name was revealed to the curious.

In 2018, Goodman Games published &quot;Into the Borderlands,&quot; a hardbound volume that reprinted the first two B series modules released by TSR -- B1 &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot; and B2 &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; by Gary Gygax -- presenting them as originally released for Basic Dungeons &amp; Dragons and in updated versions for the 5th Edition of the D&amp;D game.

<text>Albert City is a city in Buena Vista County, Iowa, United States. The population was 677 at the 2020 census.

The town was established in 1890 on property owned by George Anderson, and was initially named Manthorp, after a town in Sweden.

Albert City was incorporated in 1900.

The museum in Albert City is located in the former Chicago, Milwaukee and Pacific Railroad-Albert City Station, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Sioux Rapids is a city in Buena Vista County, Iowa, United States. The population was 748 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Two early surveyors, Lane and Ray, found the area so attractive for settlement that in 1855 they illegally laid a claim and built a cabin in section 12 of Barnes Township and over-wintered there. William S. Lee was a wealthy New Yorker who came to Sioux Rapids in 1858, staked a very early claim, and soon controversially acquired around 60,000 acres of “swamp land” at 16¢ per acre. For this he was contracted to build a courthouse and construct a bridge over the Little Sioux River, but never did. He sold large amounts of this land, but after years of legal action, Lee and his purchasers lost all their claims in 1882 in a final case against them. Lee returned to New York in 1863 to educate his children, returning in 1868 to find his early claim had been “jumped” by a William Fuller. In 1870, after reversal of an earlier decision, Fuller was allowed to keep his land, in a protracted case finally decided by the US Secretary of the Interior. In 1868, Fletcher Americus Blake he built the first frame house in Sioux Rapids, and with T.W. Twiford the first flour mill in the county, using the Little Sioux River for water power. His mill also operated as a saw mill. In the 1870 census he is listed as a manufacturer with real estate worth $4,500. Blake was the first postmaster in Sioux Rapids and the first person from the county to be elected to the Iowa House, serving in the 1872 session. That year he sold his mill and moved to Denver for health reasons. In 1869 David Evans and lawyer D. C. Thomas bought out the Ridgeway homestead and the present town of Sioux Rapids was platted out. On the Lee 1870 census, David is a substantial landowner and also blacksmith. He was in this business with his son-in-law H. W. Mayne until 1881. In 1889 he sold his remaining town lots to buy a farm in Clay County near Linn Grove. During the 50th anniversary for Sioux Rapids, on July 4, 1905, Evans rode together in the “Historic Parade” with his 89 year old, long time buddy, Johnny Burr, another ex-soldier pioneer hunter-trapper and faithful attendant at Abner Bell’s deathbed in 1895. The Evans and their wives are buried at Linn Grove, with many other Welsh pioneers.
Sioux Rapids was named from the Rapids on the Little Sioux River. In 1869, Sioux Rapids was designated the county seat of Buena Vista County. In 1876, the courthouse at Sioux Rapids burned, and in 1878, the county seat was transferred to Storm Lake.

<text>Storm Lake is a city in and the county seat of Buena Vista County, Iowa, United States. The population was 11,269 in the 2020 census, an increase from 10,076 in the 2000 census. Located along the northern shore of Storm Lake , the city is home to Buena Vista University, King&#x27;s Pointe Waterpark Resort, the Living Heritage Tree Museum, and the Santa&#x27;s Castle holiday attraction. It is the principal city of the Storm Lake micropolitan area.

== History ==
Storm Lake&#x27;s first European settler, Abner Bell, arrived in 1856, and the city was officially incorporated in 1873. Though early settlers found no natives permanently occupying the land, the area around the lake was likely used for fishing and hunting by tribes traveling from the north. Centuries prior to European colonization, the area was home to the Mill Creek indigenous culture. Railroad magnate John Insley Blair platted out land in Storm Lake in the 1870s. During the same decade, the Illinois Central Railroad was constructed through the town. 

The city of Storm Lake is named for the lake where it is said a trapper experienced a severe storm. An alternate story claims the lake took its name after two star-crossed lovers from opposed Native American bands paddled out for a secret rendezvous, only to be drowned as a sudden storm blew in.

The 1920s and 1930s saw economic and industrial growth, with the town remaining relatively unaffected by the Great Depression. During the 1940s, a prisoner-of-war camp was temporarily established in Storm Lake. In 1956, the main building of the Buena Vista University campus burned down. The central brick archway was salvaged and remains standing.

Storm Lake was a landing place of Hmong and Tai Dam refugees following the Vietnam War. Meat packing jobs have drawn thousands of migrant workers, predominantly from Latin America. Work vouchers and other factors have also drawn immigration from Micronesia. Storm Lake is currently one of ten cities in the mainland United States to host a polling location for Micronesian elections. A 2017 &quot;New York Times&quot; profile analyzed the positive effects of immigration on the Storm Lake community. Also that year, journalist Katie Couric interviewed Storm Lake residents for a &quot;National Geographic&quot; story on the town’s diversity. A 2020 article in Fox News highlighted Storm Lake as an example of the positive economic impacts of immigration on rural communities.

<text>Aplington is a city in Butler County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,116 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
In the summer of 1857, the village of Aplington was laid out and platted by the proprietors, Thomas Nash, R. R. Parriott, Zenas Aplington and Theodore A. Wilson on Sec. 29 (of Monroe Township). At the time one house stood on the tract of land, which had been erected and occupied by Charles Savage, a New Englander, a settler of short duration. The town was incorporated in the 1880s and has grown to be a lively and thriving trading point of 500 people. No better soil or finer farms lie out of doors than those contributing to the wealth of the community and with the Iowa division of the Illinois Central Railroad good transportation facilities appreciably add to the desirability of Aplington as a place for business activity and easy communication with the outside world. The town was named by its promoters in honor of one of their number, Zenas Aplington, a resident of Illinois, who never lived here. He owned part of the land, however, and took a lively interest in the town&#x27;s welfare until his death, which occurred while serving his country in the American Civil War.

The first building erected in Aplington was built by Zenas Aplington in 1856. He also furnish a stock of general merchandise. The building stood on the south side of Parriott Street, and the first Aplington merchant, George W. Hunter, sold goods over the counters here about one year for Mr. Aplington. He was succeeded by Chester Stilson, who ran the store for eighteen months; then it closed its doors. However, in 1864, Isaac Hall opened a general store in this building. He sold his stock to C. S. Price, who a year later closed out at auction.

The father of Charles Savage was an early settler in this part of the county and set up a blacksmith forge in a roofless sod house. This was the first smithy in the southern part of Butler County. William Bisbee came here in 1857 and opened a blacksmith shop for Zenas Aplington and managed it one year that enterprising non-resident. He then engaged in the trade for himself and continued therein for many years.

Mrs. Rachel Quinn built and presided over the first hotel in 1858. E. Y. Royer bought the property in 1866 and sold it to Edward Bourns in 1867, who continued the hotel a few years. The building was then purchased by Henry Kers and used as a residence. The present hotel is an old frame structure showing the wear and tear of the elements. Yet the traveler is well taken care of and give a good, generous meal by the proprietor.

The first grain elevator in Aplington was built by Alonzo McKey, at the time of the coming of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1865. Among the several managers was C. M. Mead. The next was built by the firm of Wright Brothers and run by the firm until 1877. Several persons have been in charge of the business since then. The third elevator was built by S. L. Kemmerer in 1872. He sold the property to A. M. Whaley in 1876. In 1879, a fourth elevator was built. The firm of Chrystie &amp; Prince, proprietors, disposed of their interests to Mr. Willis.

Aplington was early noted for its mills and creamery. Edward Hiller would have built a mill in the 1860s, but being unable to secure on reasonable terms, the right of way for a tail race, he gave up the project. However, John Matthews &amp; Son, of Jackson county formed a stock company, with a capital of $14,000, in 1872. A mill was built, but before its completion certain of the stockholders refused to meet their obligations on stock issued them, which retarded the industry for a while. The Matthews finally turned over their interest to William Dobbins and the latter disposed of a controlling amount of the stock to A. L. Morris &amp; Son, who had the mill running in September 1877. After this the mill had several owners.

Spring Hill Creamery began operations in the spring of 1881, on section 20. The proprietors at that time, Markley &amp; Dodswell gave employment to a number of men and consumed vast quantities of milk which were delivered from the surrounding farms. One of the largest and most lucrative industries of this section of the county is dairying.

<text>Aredale is a city in Butler County, Iowa, United States. The population was 62 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town of Aredale owes its conception to cheese. The area surrounding the town had seen increasing settlement since the 1860s, and in 1890, the local dairy farmers pooled their resources to create a cheese making factory, which eventually helped the town develop enough to warrant the community its own post office and thus township rights.

The name Aredale is derived from a variation on the Pennsylvania town of Airville, from which several Aredale residents had emigrated. The plat was recorded on June 28, 1900, by the Iowa and Minnesota Town Site Company. June 28 later was observed as Field Day by residents, and featured a town celebration and a baseball game visited by hundreds of people from nearby towns.

Soon the town featured a number of competing lumberyards and stockyards, and the Aredale Savings and Loan was constructed in 1901. That same year, the First Methodist Church was organized, and purchased the Coldwater Methodist Church building, which was then moved in town. It was destroyed by fire in 1923 and replaced by a new building.

In 1953, a train wreck destroyed the town depot, and no new one is forthcoming.

In the race for mayor on November 8, 2011, the Butler County elections office results showed that a senior at Hampton–Dumont High School was elected. Jeremy Minnier, age 18, won with 24[write-in votes. Incumbent Mayor Virgil Homer received eight votes.

In April 2012. mayor Jeremy Minnier appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Minnier discussed life in the small town and displayed photos. Host Leno and show guest Mel Gibson presented Minnier with a new town sign.

This is the second confirmed EF5 tornado since the Enhanced Fujita scale was introduced, the other occurring in Greensburg, Kansas, on May 4, 2007. The town was prone to flooding until a levee was built around the town, which was raised and reinforced in 2009. In June 2008, only one week after being struck by a record EF5 tornado, the town experienced record flooding that forced all residents to evacuate. The flood damaged many homes and buildings in the town then incited relief efforts from FEMA and the American Red Cross. The Red Cross provided food assistance in the town, distributing grocery items at the town&#x27;s community building and fire station, as well as providing meals out of a food truck. Some affected residents temporarily lived in FEMA trailers. Many residents made efforts to repair their homes, while others relocated outside of the town.

<text>Parkersburg is a city in Butler County, Iowa, United States. The population was 2,015 in the 2020 census, an increase from 1,870 in the 2010 census. Parkersburg, although not the county seat, is the highest-populated city in Butler County.

==History==
The first known settlers of the Parkersburg area were John Connell and his son William, who built a log cabin in 1857. A railroad company surveyed the area in the early 1860s. A depot was erected in 1865 and two railroads, the Illinois Central and the Chicago North Western, were built through the town. The town was soon platted and recorded and given the name of &quot;Parkersburg&quot; in honor of Pascal P. Parker, a prominent settler and the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The first major business was a hotel built by Thomas Williams, called The Williams House. Later, it became known as the Commercial House. Parkersburg was incorporated on December 7, 1874.

The first &quot;School House&quot; was built in the 1860s. Parkersburg became an independent school district in the spring of 1871. A new school was built in 1872. This building burned beyond repair on October 9, 1893, in the &quot;great fire of Parkersburg&quot;, which also destroyed most of the business district. In 1894 a modern, three-story, brick structure was built. In 1930, the school added an auditorium and gymnasium.

The first electric power was furnished by the Parkersburg Electric Light &amp; Power Company, composed of local citizens who built the plant in 1898 at a cost of $10,000. Parkersburg&#x27;s roads were paved &quot;circa&quot; 1920. The first water tower only had a capacity of 40,000 gallons.

===2008 tornado===

Seven people died in Parkersburg and two in rural New Hartford from injuries sustained when a confirmed EF5 tornado struck the region on May 25, 2008. At least 70 individuals were injured and transported to nearby hospitals. The south side of Parkersburg was completely destroyed and turned into rubble. Over 400 homes were destroyed or damaged, the roof was taken off the high school and destroyed, and the elementary school was damaged as well. The surviving residents were evacuated while the rescue operation was in progress. Today, Parkersburg is considered to be a model of disaster recovery and resiliency in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

The local water utility called the Iowa Rural Water Association for assistance after the city went on a boiled water notice. Utility infrastructure was left largely intact, but the tornado and clean-up efforts damaged the connections in numerous homes.

The Southern Cal district subsequently merged into South Central Calhoun on July 1, 2014.

In 2012 the Southern Cal district closed the elementary school in Lohrville. The district board failed to find a suitable private buyer, the Lohrville community did not have enough funds to maintain the school, and there were already community and library buildings present. There were fears that if demolition were done later, it would cost more and that if a business acquired the lot, the building would be demolished anyway. In September 2013 the school district decided that the building should be demolished. In February 2014 the district took the bid of a demolition contractor to raze Lohrville School; it was to be demolished by July 2014.

<doc id="112823" wikidata="Q1928757" url="?curid=112823" title="Manson, Iowa">
<text>Manson is a city in Calhoun County, Iowa, United States. The population was 1,709 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Manson was platted in 1872 on the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad line.

===Tornado of June 28, 1979===
A destructive F4 tornado killed three people and destroyed a large part of Manson on June 28, 1979, at about 7:45 PM. The tornado slowly chewed its way from northwest to southeast through Manson. The tornado was on the southwest side of a large southeast-moving thunderstorm complex; thus, it was surrounded on three sides by clear skies (in fact, the sun was shining) and was highly visible. Severe damage was done to the central business district with 25 of the 35 business either destroyed or severely damaged. The middle school was also destroyed as were about 110 homes. Another 139 homes were damaged. The General Telephone Company exchange building for Manson was completely destroyed - the first time this had ever happened in Iowa. It was reported that the storm was like a lawn mower going through the city, and afterwards one could see from one end of the city to the other when looking up the damage track.

There was about 30 minutes warning and the tornado sirens were sounded well before the arrival of the tornado. The fact that it was still daylight also contributed to the relatively low death count from this destructive storm.

==Geography==
Manson is located at (42.530690, -94.534673). 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Manson impact crater===
Manson is located near the site of the Manson crater, formed by a meteorite collision that happened 74 million years ago. The crater&#x27;s existence was first discovered during an oil-drilling wildcatting expedition in the 1930s. At one time, it was thought to be the biggest impact by an object from outer space in North America, until subsequent studies revealed larger examples. The impact event was also once theorized to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, or contributed to it as a fragment of the Chicxulub meteor, until tests by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1991 and 1992 proved that it was too old by 9 million years.

Not much remains due to glacial till which has filled in the crater and has made it undetectable at ground level. However, due to this infilling it is one of the best preserved impact sites on Earth.

The impact crater measures approximately in diameter and the city of Manson is located near the center of the impact site.

Since 2009, Rockwell City has hosted the annual &quot;Sweet Corn Daze&quot; festival, which typically takes place on the first weekend in August and includes a parade, various events, and vendors.

Rockwell City also hosts the annual Calhoun County Expo, Calhoun County&#x27;s county fair. Rockwell City was selected as the location for the county fair in a county-wide election in 1980. Prior to that time, Calhoun County had two county fairs, one in Rockwell City and one in neighboring Manson. A 1979 state law, however, required counties to select a single county fair to be the &quot;Official State Fair&quot; which necessitated the vote and consolidation of county fairs in Calhoun County (among other Iowa counties).

=== Landmarks ===
&quot;Calhoun County Courthouse.&quot; The courthouse was constructed in 1914, with an architectural style of Neoclassical Revival and outer walls of limestone, with a red clay tile roof.

&quot;Calhoun County Historical Museum.&quot; Formerly the building of the Rockwell City High School, this building has been home to the Calhoun County Historical Museum since 1986. The museum traces its origins back to 1902 and seeks to preserve documents and artifacts related to the history and people of Calhoun County. As of January 2023, the museum is open on Sundays from 1-3pm from June to September or by appointment.

&quot;Rockwell City Bridge.&quot; One of two rainbow bridges in Calhoun County (the other being in Lake City), this bridge was built in 1915 and put into disuse with the realignment of U.S. Highway 20 in 1981. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. In 2020, the bridge and some adjacent land was turned into a local park.

==Pop culture==
On the December 18, 2003, episode of Jeopardy!, the $500 answer in the category &quot;U.S. City Nicknames&quot; was &quot;Rockwell City in this state calls itself the &#x27;Golden buckle on the Corn Belt.&#x27; &quot;
