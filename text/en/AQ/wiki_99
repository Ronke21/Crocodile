==History==
The first settlement in what is today St. John was made in 1875 when William Bickerton of the Church of Jesus Christ founded a religious colony named Zion Valley. By 1879, Zion Valley had grown into a small town, and the residents renamed it St. John, after then governor John P. St. John, in order to gain favor in winning the county seat of Stafford County.

In 2015, due to diligent work of local citizens and former local graduates, the official government listing of locations has been corrected to spell the town correctly as &quot;St. John&quot; instead of &quot;Saint John&quot; that was incorrectly changed by the United States Postal Service in the 1970s.

<text>Hugoton is a city in and the county seat of Stevens County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,747.

==History==

Settlers from McPherson, Kansas established a settlement in what was then west-central Seward County, Kansas in 1885. They originally named this settlement Hugo in honor of French writer Victor Hugo, but then changed its name to Hugoton to distinguish it from Hugo, Colorado. Hugoton&#x27;s first church, Hugoton United Methodist, was also the first in Stevens County and was founded in 1886; it is still active as of 2019. The first post office in Hugoton was established in April 1886.

In 1886, the Kansas Legislature reestablished the surrounding area as Stevens County, and Gov. John Martin designated Hugoton as the interim county seat. This set off a violent county seat war with nearby Woodsdale. Hugoton became the permanent county seat in 1887, but the conflict continued, culminating in the Hay Meadow Massacre of 1888. Woodsdale founder and attorney Samuel Newitt Wood, heavily invested in the conflict for the county seat, was assassinated by James Brennen, one of the men involved in the Hay Meadow Massacre, outside the Hugoton courthouse on June 23, 1891.

During the 1890s, economic decline drove many residents to leave for newly opened territories in the American Southwest, and the population declined significantly. The Santa Fe Railway reached Hugoton in 1913, which spurred growth. Natural gas was discovered southwest of the city in 1927, leading to the development of the Hugoton Natural Gas Area and the transformation of Hugoton into a major center of natural gas extraction.

Hugoton reportedly served as a temporary home for infamous criminals Bonnie and Clyde. They lived in the unincorporated areas near Hugoton, assuming the aliases of Jewell and Blackie Underwood. Jewell operated a cafe, Jewell&#x27;s Cafe, and Blackie reportedly worked on area farms. Locals believed they ran a bootlegging operation out of the cafe. Clyde was officially in prison during the time they are claimed to be in the Hugoton area, but locals still insist Jewell and Blackie were Bonnie and Clyde. Receipts from Jewel&#x27;s Cafe were found in the duo&#x27;s vehicle after their deaths in a 1934 shoot-out.

In the mid-1930s, Hugoton, along with much of Kansas and parts of other nearby states, suffered the effects of the Dust Bowl, which ravaged the Great Plains in waves between 1934 and 1940. Southwest Kansas was hit particularly hard between 1932 and 1936. The famous &quot;Black Sunday&quot; dust storm that marks the naming of the Dust Bowl as a geographic area encompassing most of the mid-United States and affecting the entire country, hit Hugoton and neighboring towns in multiple counties and in Oklahoma early on April 14, 1935.

==Geography==

<text>Moscow ( ) is a city in Stevens County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 272.

==History==
The settlement of Moscow was established in 1887.

One tradition says, the community was named for a member of de Soto&#x27;s expedition, the maestro de campo (field commander) Luis de Moscoso (the source mistakenly indicates Francisco Coronado southwest expedition, but at this time Moscoso was a member of de Soto&#x27;s expedition, furthermore he took command of the expedition after de Soto&#x27;s death). During the settlement name registration there were a series of mistakes. The residents, in their application for a post office, had shortened it to Mosco. A postal clerk in Washington, upon receipt of their petition, being in a helpful spirit, and thinking the hay-seeds in the west did not know their spelling, added a &quot;w&quot; to the name, changing it to Moscow.

The first post office in Moscow was established on April 28, 1888, when it was moved from Valparaiso (now ghost town), which was located approximately southeast of Moscow.

Moscow moved 8 miles to the north in 1913, where in 1912 the CVR railroad was built, so it was also called &quot;New Moscow&quot;.

For the first time in the US Census the placename &quot;Moscow&quot; in Stevens County appeared in 1890, though not as a city but as a township. The Census separated city of Moscow in 1930.

==Geography==

The town is located in southwest Kansas in the Rolling Cropland and Range region of the Great Plains. The town is in the shape of a right triangle.

The northwest border of the Moscow adjoins U.S. Route 56. The city part of the Route 56 is named &quot;Cimarron Avenue&quot;, named after the Cimarron River, which is located north of Moscow.

<text>Caldwell is a city in Sumner County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,025.

==History==

Near Caldwell is a precontact Plains Village period settlement called the Buresh site, which has yielded clues about Native American lifeways prior to the arrival of people of European and African descent.

Caldwell was founded in 1871. It is named for Senator Alexander Caldwell. Caldwell was incorporated as a city in 1879. The first post office in Caldwell was established in May 1871. The Chisholm Trail ran along the east side of the community from 1867 to 1871.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington to Caldwell. This branch line connected Herington, Lost Springs, Lincolnville, Antelope, Marion, Aulne, Peabody, Elbing, Whitewater, Furley, Kechi, Wichita, Peck, Corbin, Wellington, Caldwell. This branch line was extended to Pond Creek, Oklahoma in 1888, and connected Caldwell, Renfrow, Medford, Jefferson (the original Pond Creek). By 1893, it was incrementally built to Fort Worth, Texas. This railroad foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island.&quot;

In 1985 the Caldwell 6th grade class under the direction of their teacher Larry Miller started a successful campaign to have the ornate box turtle named the state reptile of Kansas. They gained support from around the country and on April 14, 1986, the governor of Kansas came to their school and signed the official bill adding a new official symbol to the state of Kansas.

During the annual Homecoming celebration in the fall of 1986 the Mayor of Caldwell signed a proclamation declaring that Caldwell would forever be known as the &quot;Ornate Box Turtle Capital of the World&quot; and a couple of years later a professional wildlife artist was hired to paint a portrait of an ornate box turtle on the side of a downtown building on Main Street.

<text>Hunnewell is a city in Sumner County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 44.

==History==
Hunnewell was founded in 1880. It was named for Boston financier and railway owner H. H. Hunnewell.

Hunnewell served as a shipping point for Texas cattle, and was a prosperous cowtown during the 1880s. The Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston Railroad provided quick access to the Kansas City, Kansas stockyards, and the Kansas and Southeastern Railroad was built south from Hunnewell into Oklahoma in 1898. The town in its heyday had one hotel, two general stores, one barber shop, two dance halls, and eight saloons. With little more than railroad workers and cowboys, violence was common. There were no lawmen to speak of during the 1880s in or around that area, and typically cattle rustling and other crimes were dealt with by the ranchers themselves. This culminated in the Hunnewell, Kansas Gunfight, on October 5, 1884.

A post office was opened in Hunnewell in 1880, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1960.

The railroads have still not abandoned Hunnewell; it continues to be served by the Blackwell Northern Gateway Railroad, which runs from Blackwell, Oklahoma through Hunnewell and on to connections with the BNSF at Wellington, Kansas and (via the BNSF) with the Union Pacific.

<text>Colby is a city in and the county seat of Thomas County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,570.

==History==
In 1882, a post office was established near the center of Thomas County. Area homesteaders lived under harsh conditions in sod houses, creating demand for a town to provide lumber and other provisions to incoming settlers. J.R. Colby, a local land assessor and preacher, obtained a patent to establish the town in April 1884, and land was acquired for the town site three miles north of the post office in March 1885. The following month, the Kansas Secretary of State issued the Town Charter. Kansas Gov. John Martin named Colby the county seat in 1885, and the city was incorporated in 1886. The Union Pacific Railroad reached the city in 1887, and the Rock Island Railroad followed the next year.

<text>Hanover is a city in Washington County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 690. It is located approximately south of the Nebraska-Kansas state line.

==History==
The &quot;Hollenberg Station&quot; became an important hub along the way for Pony Express travelers and Geret Hollenberg eventually established a grocery and stage depot on his farm in 1858. The Hollenberg farm housed nine boarding rooms, and the success of &quot;Hollenberg Station&quot; as a business attracted more people to the area and many settled alongside the Hollenbergs in the decade leading up to the establishment of Hanover.

Prior to the establishment of the town, in 1868 a school district was established in the area to satisfy the need to educate children of settlers who continued to arrive near the &quot;Hollenberg Station.&quot;

Hanover was laid out in 1869, and incorporated as a city in 1872. It is a German community named after Hanover, Germany. The founders Geret Hollenberg and Sophia Brockmeyer settled their farm originally called &quot;The Cottonwood Ranch&quot; and later the &quot;Hollenberg Station&quot; alongside the Little Blue River, which became a popular stop along the Pony Express. The popularity led to the establishment of Hanover. The Hollenberg Pony Express Station is the only remaining building along the two thousand mile route, and it continues to stand one mile northeast of Hanover. In the 1940s it was registered as a National Historic Landmark.

Hollenberg, who laid out the original plans for the town in 1869, decided to name it Hanover after his hometown in Germany. A contemporary of Hollenberg wrote at the time that Hanover represented &quot;just a little bit of Germany&quot; in Kansas Territory. Located at the junction of two railroads, it was an important shipping point. Access to the railroad was greatly contributed to the economic growth of Hanover, enabling the expansion of the local grain elevator. The success of the grain elevator, because of its close connection with the railroad contributed to the growth and initial success of the town. As the town continued to develop, a German Evangelical Society church, as well as a Catholic church to serve the town&#x27;s Czech residents were established in 1870. Additionally, following the movement of some Native groups to Oklahoma from the nearby Ottoe reservation, some land was annexed by the Hanover township, which allowed for further expansion as more white settlers moved into the area.

The local area had a significant Native American population. The Pawnee Indians resided west of Hanover, the Kansa and Kaw tribes lived to the south, and the Otoe Indians were located north. The Otoe Reservation resided north of Hanover on the Kansas-Nebraska border from 1854 to 1883. Their reservation was 160,000 acres large (250 mi2). When the Otoe tribal lands were sold in 1883, the land sold for a record-high average of $12.22 per acre. By comparison, most other Native American tribes in the central and northern Great Plains were only paid ten cents per acre. Some of the Otoe Indians were relocated to Red Rock, Oklahoma, while many of the mixed-race Otoe Indians were integrated with the local German settlers. Many people in Hanover today have a fraction of Native American ancestry.

The region was especially attractive to German speakers and settlers, and when the town was established Hollenberg continued to draw to settlers of German, as well as Czech origin. Until World War I many residents of Hanover and the surrounding continued to speak their native languages, and to this day many German traditions remain an important aspect of town identity. German settlers often encountered Native people groups such as the Pawnee, Kansa, and the Kaw. Contact between the German settlers and natives were mainly non-violent and few conflicts were reported between the various groups. In fact, a substantial amount of trade took place between the settlers and the native groups.

<text>Leoti () is a city in and the county seat of Wichita County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,475.

== History ==
Leoti was founded in 1885 by a company of men from Garden City, Kansas. Two years later, in 1887, it was involved in the bloodiest county seat fight in the history of the American West. The shoot-out was on February 27, 1887, when men—some say hired gunmen—from Leoti, went to the neighboring, rival town of Coronado and left several people dead and wounded. A small town called Farmer City which was located between Coronado and Leoti, was hoped by some to become the county seat—which would end the fighting. Leoti later won the right to become the county seat and now the two other towns consist mainly of farmland. 

The origin of the name Leoti is disputed: one tradition says the name is an Indian term for &quot;prairie flower&quot;; another says the community was named for settler Leoti Kibbee; a third says it was named for Leoti Gray, the daughter of a town founder.

<text>Fredonia is a city in and the county seat of Wilson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,151. The city was founded in 1868, and saw considerable expansion in the early 20th century, with a fossil fuel boom.

==History==
Fredonia was laid out in 1868 near a large hillock located along the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway in southeast Kansas. It was named after Fredonia, New York. The first building on the town site was a general store, erected in 1868, on the southwest corner of the town square, soon followed by a simple courthouse and hotel. The first post office was established in August 1868. The Gold Dust Hotel was completed in 1885.

It became a booming town with an emphasis on large industry. In May 1913, a large vein of semi-anthracite coal was discovered near the town. The coal that was found was “said to be of better quality than any other found in Kansas” at that time. With this discovery, it had the possibility of bringing in large amounts of money for the Wilson County area. A cement plant opened in Fredonia in 1907, supplying jobs to the community for more than 100 years, before it was closed in 2012. The economy in Fredonia was again boosted by the Archer Daniels Midland Company. The plant was obtained in 1928 and operated as a soybean processing facility and supplied many jobs for the growing industrial town. In March 2003 the plant announced it would close its Fredonia branch effective immediately. At one time, Fredonia was a hub for oil and natural gas development.

<text>Neodesha is a city in Wilson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,275. The name is derived from the Osage word, &quot;Ni-o-sho-de&quot;, and is translated as &quot;The-Water-Is-Smoky-With-Mud&quot;.

==History==

===19th century===
The first settlers in the area that would eventually become Neodesha established a trading post in October 1867 to the northwest of the present town. They were allowed by the Osage Native Americans to establish a trading post on the Osage Diminished Reserve because the nearest trading post was over thirty miles away. After the Drum Creek Treaty had been signed by the Osage tribe in September 1870 and the tribe moved to Indian Territory, it opened the way for settlers to move to the area. Neodesha was incorporated March 2, 1871 and the original plat was filed with the U.S. Land Office in July 1871. Neodesha is an Osage name meaning &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;.

The first railroad was built through Neodesha in 1879.

In October 1872, &quot;old&quot; Kansas City, Kansas, was incorporated.

The mayors of the city after its organization were James Boyle, C. A. Eidemiller, A. S. Orbison, Eli Teed, and Samuel McConnell. In June 1880, the Governor of Kansas, John St. John, proclaimed the city of Kansas City a city of the second class with Mayor McConnell present.

In March 1886, &quot;new&quot; Kansas City, Kansas, was formed through the consolidation of five municipalities: &quot;old&quot; Kansas City, Armstrong, Armourdale, Riverview, and Wyandotte.

Kansas City is situated on the edge of the &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains in Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring. A few areas of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area have had some severe outbreaks of tornadoes at different points in the past, including the Ruskin Heights tornado in 1957, the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence, and the Tornado Outbreak Sequence of May 2019. The region can also fall victim to sporadic ice storms during the winter months, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks. Kansas City and its outlying areas are also subject to flooding, including the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993.

==== Golubski scandal ====

Retired KCK police detective Roger Golubski had been accused of sexual assault, protecting organized crime, and obtaining convictions on falsified evidence and coerced perjury.

Lamonte McIntire was exonerated and released in October 2017 after 23 years in prison for a double murder. His mother claimed Golubski tried to force her into a sexual relationship. When she refused, Golubski framed her son. Detectives working the case refused to collect basic evidence. Former KCK Police Chief Terry Ziegler and other supervisors knew about this.

On September 15, 2022, Golubski was indicted by a federal grand jury in Topeka, Kansas, and arrested on six counts of sexual assault under color of law. Another three-count federal indictment was unsealed November 14, almost two months later: Golubski and three other men—Cecil Brooks, LeMark Roberson, and Richard Robinson—were charged with conspiring, decades ago, to keep young women as sex slaves. At the time of this indictment, Brooks was in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas; the locations of the others were unavailable.

Golubski did not face trial for the federal case regarding the alleged abuse and assault of women. He failed to show up to the beginning of his trial on December 2, 2024 and was found dead at his home, the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Forestdale Elementary School was once a big part of Kevil, Kentucky. Although it is not in service now, the building still stands in the middle of the city. It was built around 1950 at the same time as the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was built. This enhanced uranium power plant brought jobs to people all over the United States. When families moved here to work, there was not enough room in the already built public schools for the new kids to get an education. The outcome of the child to school ratio lead to the upbringing of a new school. Forestdale Elementary was continued to be used until the early 1980s when it later changed into a factory.

In 2021, there are many options when it comes to public schools. These include: Ballard County Memorial High School, Ballard County Middle School, Ballard County Elementary School, McCracken County High School, Heath Middle School, Concord Elementary, Lone Oak Elementary, Lone Oak Intermediate, Reidland Middle School, Reidland Elementary, Reidland Intermediate, Hendron-Lone Oak Elementary, and lastly McCracken County Pre-School. When It Comes to private schools, St. Mary School System is the only elementary, middle, and high school option.

== Major Powerplant and Effect On Migration ==
In 1950, a plant was built to enrich uranium for the military. The uranium was used for chemical warfare such as reactors and nuclear weapons. This plant played a huge part in the further development of Kevil. Many of the houses you see in this city and surrounding areas were pop-up homes for migrating workers. From 1993 to 2014, the plant was leased to the United States Enrichment Corporations(USEC) and then to present day owners(Department of Energy). Department of Energy(DOE) is responsible for the environmental cleanup of uranium at the site. Although DOE is not as big as the plant originally was, it still plays an important roll in the job, popularity, and importance aspect of this area.

Payne, may have suggested the name, claiming the new city to be the &quot;center of the universe,&quot; and possibly in the hopes that it would someday become the county seat.

It was abandoned in 1781 after a siege by the Chickasaw.

The site later served as a Union Army post during the Civil War. General Ulysses S. Grant directed a demonstration against the Confederate-held position at Columbus, Kentucky, in January 1862.

<text>Cave City is a home rule-class city in Barren County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 2,356 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Glasgow Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Cave City is located in the northwestern portion of Barren County at (37.137130, -85.956958). U.S. Route 31W (Dixie Highway) passes through the center of the city, and Interstate 65 passes to the west of downtown, with access from Exit 53 (Kentucky Route 70/Mammoth Cave Road). Elizabethtown is to the north, and Louisville is north via I-65. Bowling Green is to the southwest, and Nashville, Tennessee, is to the southwest via I-65. The center of Mammoth Cave National Park is to the west via Kentucky Route 70. Glasgow, the Barren County seat, is located to the southeast via Kentucky Route 90.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Cave City has a total area of , of which , or 0.46%, is water.

==History==
The site upon which Cave City stands was acquired in October 1853 by the Knob City Land Company, composed of Messrs. Graham, Quigly, Adams, and Hopson, all of whom were from Louisville and envisioned the place as a resort town due to its proximity to Mammoth Cave. The town was incorporated in 1866.

Originally, of what would become the town site was acquired by James Perry in a 1798 land grant. In 1811, Henry Roundtree (an assignee of James Perry) sold the land to John Owens for $190. Owens added to the tract. After his death, his executor sold his 342½ acres to Thomas T. Duke for $1,732.00. Duke, in turn, sold the entire tract to the Knob City Land Company. Duke received $6,850.00 for the land, or $20 per acre—a record amount for a land sale in Barren County at that time.

The Knob City Land Company surveyed and laid out the town, the main streets being wide, and began to sell lots about the same time as the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad came through Barren County. The first train arrived at Cave City in 1859. The town took its name from a cave within the town limits, not nearby Mammoth Cave. A small creek ran through the cave which the L&amp;N Railroad used as a source of water. The creek was called &quot;Sink Hole Spring&quot; and was the only water supply for the town at the time. The Cave City post office was established in January 1860 and Beverly Daniel Curd appointed the first post-master. He moved the post office established in 1850 at Woodland (about a mile north) to Cave City.

The first business in Cave City was built and operated by postmaster Curd and his brother, Havilah Price Curd. Their store was located at the corner of First and Kirtley (now Broadway) streets. The second person to open a business in Cave City and to build the first residence was Judge C. Roberts. The first woman business owner in Cave City was April Houchens, who opened &quot;Funny Hats and Bows&quot;, a boutique for the eccentric lady. This shop was open until 1985.

<text>Park City is a home rule-class city in Barren County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 614 at the 2020 census. It is the entrance to nearby Mammoth Cave National Park and to Diamond Caverns, a privately owned cave attraction. Exit 48 off I-65 is the only direct access exit to the Mammoth Cave National Park.

Park City is part of the Glasgow micropolitan area.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the site of the present city was the junction of the Louisville and Nashville Pike with spur roads to Glasgow and Bardstown. By 1827, a stagecoach relay station had developed into a settlement with a post office named Three Forks. The postmaster William Bell owned a plantation nearby, with a prominent tavern, which led to the community also being known as Bell&#x27;s Station. In 1859, the mainline of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad reached the plantation, and in 1863 the Glasgow spur was completed. The community was then known as Glasgow Junction after the L&amp;N Depot, which also served as the junction between the mainline and the Mammoth Cave Railroad. There was a close relationship between Mammoth Cave and Diamond Cave (Diamond Caverns) for years. Books and cave brochures would describe both caves. Beginning in 1880, the Mammoth Cave Railroad tracks were laid just west of Diamond Cave. When the line finally opened in 1886, Diamond was one of the primary stops on the railroad. Excursions were available to see Diamond and Mammoth Caves on the same day, and still return to Glasgow Junction in time to catch through trains to Louisville or Nashville. Mammoth Cave Railroad stops also served two nearby caves opened by Larkin Proctor, Long Cave, commercialized as Grand Avenue Caverns, and Proctor Cave. The city was platted and formally incorporated under that name in 1871.

In 1938, the name was changed to Park City to avoid confusion with Glasgow.

Part of the former Mammoth Cave Railroad was converted into a 9-mile hike and bike trail. The start of this trail can be accessed from Park City.

It is the county seat and is located roughly at the county&#x27;s center, at the junction of US 60 and Kentucky 36. It is part of the Mount Sterling micropolitan area.

==History==
In 1795, Colonel Thomas Dye Owings was sent from Maryland to Kentucky by his father to operate some of the first iron furnaces in the region. Within 15 years, Owings had amassed a good deal of wealth and land. Along with Colonel Richard H. Menefee, Owings founded the community that took his name, Owingsville.

Owings and Menefee each owned significant parcels of land in what would become Owingsville. To select whose name the community would take, the two men wagered that the man who built the finer home the quickest would be the namesake of the town. For the sum of $60,000, Owings won the contest. Owingsville was then founded in 1811.

<doc id="115025" wikidata="Q2206740" url="?curid=115025" title="Middlesboro, Kentucky">
<text>Middlesboro () is a home rule-class city in Bell County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 10,334 at the 2010 U.S. census, while its micropolitan area had a population of 69,060.

It is located west of the Cumberland Gap and is the largest city in southeastern Kentucky. It is located entirely between Pine Mountain and the Cumberland Mountains in the Middlesboro Basin, an enormous meteorite crater (one of three known astroblemes in the state).

==Name==
Originally funded by English businessmen, the town opened its first post office on September 14, 1888, under the name Middlesborough, presumably in honor of the English town of - at the time - the same name. The city was formally incorporated under that spelling on March 14 two years later, but the post office switched to &quot;Middlesboro&quot; in 1894 and that spelling has since been adopted by the city itself, the city&#x27;s school district, the Kentucky Land Office, and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

==History==
===Early history===
The area was originally inhabited by American Indians such as the Shawnee. The first European known to have visited the area was Gabriel Arthur in 1674. He was later followed by Thomas Walker in 1750 and Daniel Boone in 1769.

===Pittsburgh of the South===

John Turner of Virginia established the settlement of Yellow Creek nearby in 1810, but the town did not begin to develop until the Scottish-born and Canadian-raised engineer and entrepreneur Alexander Arthur took an interest in the Yellow Creek Valley. Having settled in Knoxville, Tennessee, he arranged development projects in the area as part of the post-war New South. Taking an interest in the iron deposits around the Cumberland Gap around 1886, Arthur was able to convince some of the wealthy scions of Gilded-Age Asheville, North Carolina, to talk to their families about funding a &quot;Pittsburgh of the South&quot;, but sufficient financing was not forthcoming. He then traveled to England, where he was able to find interested backers for his &quot;Magic City&quot; of 250,000 residents enjoying running water, electricity, a large sporting commons, and electric trams in the middle of Appalachia. Simultaneously, he funded and began construction on the Powell&#x27;s Valley Railroad, with the aim of connecting the Cumberland Gap region to Knoxville.

By 1888, the new town was platted and named &quot;Middlesborough&quot;, presumably after the English town, either after a local contest selected it as the best entry or after the hometown of the brothers who owned the local English Hotel. The Middlesboro Country Club was founded as part of Arthur&#x27;s original development. Its nine-hole course is one of the oldest in the United States and it claims to be the oldest continuously played course in the country. Pianist Ben Harney is also claimed to have originated ragtime music in Middlesboro, where he played in local saloons in the early 1890s. Boosters from Middlesborough petitioned to host the 1892 World&#x27;s Fair. Just south of the Cumberland Gap in the area of the present-day Lincoln Memorial University, a $1-million Four Seasons Hotel was built in 1892 with 500 rooms, a 200-room spa, and a sanitarium.

Arthur&#x27;s project failed by 1893. The Cumberland Gap had turned out to be too steep for locomotives and, in order to connect Middlesboro to the Tennessee line, an expensive tunnel needed to be constructed from 1888 to 1889, ultimately necessitating the dissolution of the Powell Valley Railroad and its recapitalization as the Knoxville, Cumberland Gap, &amp; Louisville. Rebuilding from a devastating fire in 1890 used up more capital and time and the poor quality of local ore meant that revenue from Arthur&#x27;s steel mills was insufficient to weather the Panic of 1893 on Wall Street. Arthur&#x27;s development of the area finished, the post office was renamed the following year after the already-prevalent local spelling &quot;Middlesboro&quot;. The Knoxville, Cumberland Pass, &amp; Louisville was bought out by the L&amp;N in 1896. The local newspaper, the &quot;Middlesboro Daily News&quot;, was established in 1911.

Despite being the largest city in the county, the development of Middlesboro came too late to avoid Pineville&#x27;s being the seat of the local courthouse. The two cities have remained friendly rivals since Middlesboro&#x27;s founding.

===Little Las Vegas===
Middlesboro installed the first electric street cars west of Washington, D.C., to help locals and tourists visiting the city which became known as &quot;Little Las Vegas&quot; in the 1930s. By this time, Middlesboro was full of slot machines, saloons, and brothels. During this period, shootouts in the streets were part of daily life. The town, under rule of the infamous Ball brothers, was featured in newspapers across the country as one of the deadliest, wildest cities in the United States.

===Athens of the Mountains===

By the 1950s, Middlesboro had a population of roughly 15,000 residents. Their strong support for the arts led to the city being called &quot;the Athens of the Mountains&quot;. It was one of the few cities in the Eastern Coal Fields to boast a grand opera house and it hosted one of the finest school districts in the state. The first shopping mall was built in the city during the 1960s. The city was named an &quot;All Kentucky City&quot; in 1964, &#x27;65, &#x27;66, &#x27;67, and &#x27;69, a huge honor for such a small city. The Cumberland Gap National Historical Park was also established during this time.

During the 1970s, the area&#x27;s coal industry revived and the city prospered again. A grand centennial celebration was held in 1990 that included a ball, air show, and beauty pageant, as well as the dedication of a new city park. The Cumberland Gap Tunnel was opened in 1996.

===Present-day===
Currently, Middlesboro is investing in downtown revitalization to help create new business and give the city a better image. In 2004, Discover Downtown Middlesboro, Inc. (DDM), was formed to promote and lead the revamping of the historic downtown area. Since its inception, Discover Downtown Middlesboro has helped numerous businesses receive a facelift and has restored the historic Fountain Square in downtown. The organization also helps to create awareness of the city&#x27;s grand and regal past. Numerous large-scaled sepia murals are placed throughout downtown, paying homage to the founder of Middlesboro, his wife, and other historic points in the history of Middlesboro. DDM also hosts numerous events for the community and the tri-state area that are free to the public, one of the most popular includes the Downtown Ducky Dash and Block Party. DDM oversees all projects that take place within the downtown area and has plans to create brick stamped crosswalks at Fountain Square. Ultimately, they plan to make the historic downtown area more pedestrian-friendly with more benches, bike racks, planters, and streetscape improvements in the works. Recently, the organization has applied for nearly $1 million in grant money for the purpose of preservation and development of the general downtown district. Currently, DDM has invested in a Preservation Plan, which should be unveiled in September 2013. This plan, once complete, will outline the plans for the revitalization of downtown Middlesboro, help create a brand for the downtown area, as well help lay a foundation to preserve the rich architectural details in the downtown historic district.

In June 2011 a severe flash flood damaged many homes and businesses in Middlesboro. Following a rainfall of in 48 hours, the waterways could not cope with the deluge. Two area residents perished in the flood, and dozens were left homeless. The downtown area was one of the hardest hit areas in the city. At one point during the rain event, enough water was present throughout the entire downtown area that vehicles were completely submerged. For many hours after the flood, travel in and around the city was very difficult due to large amounts of standing water in the basin that Middlesboro is built in. A few days afterwards, Governor Steve Beshear toured the area and formally declared it a disaster, permitting state funds to be used in rebuilding.

In April 2012, Middlesboro became the first city in the United States to have a community-wide organic garden, which features 60 raised-bed gardens that will be used to grow food for people in the community. Some beds are even disability accessible. The beds will be given out on a first come, first served basis. The food that is grown in the beds will help to reduce costs for families in need, and can be donated to people in need or sold to local restaurants. The community organic garden was made possible through the City of Middlesboro, Bell County Health Department, and several donors and volunteers. Middlesboro is currently working to become one of the first cities in Kentucky to be a certified Trail Town. The Mayor, along with the City Council, showed support and took initiative in becoming a certified Trail Town. This feat will be a collaboration between the Bell County Tourism Commission, Bell County Adventure Tourism, Discover Downtown Middlesboro, Bell County Chamber of Commerce, and the City of Middlesboro.

Middlesboro was featured on the History Channel&#x27;s television series &quot;How the States Got Their Shapes&quot; in the episode &quot;Forces of Nature&quot;. The city also featured in one of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Wonders of the Solar System&quot; episodes. ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; honored the Middlesboro-Bell County Library for participating in the &quot;52 Weeks of Giving&quot; program on May 27, 2013.

On September 15, 2015, Middlesboro held an election to allow alcohol production and retail in the city limits. Previously, all of Bell County had been dry except for the special circumstance of a state park in Pineville, Kentucky. Allowing alcohol in the city would make Bell County a Moist County. The vote passed 1,298-yes to 1,179-no. With such a close vote, tension arose around the topic of alcohol allowance in the small community.

Beginning in the summer of 2015, Discover Downtown Middlesboro is the recipient of a grant from the Levitt Foundation of California. This grant provides funding for a series of 10 outdoor music concerts each summer. The concert venue is a formerly abandoned lot near the main intersection of town at 20th &amp; Cumberland Ave. Middlesboro is one of 15 cities across the nation to be chosen for the Levitt AMP series.

==Transportation==

The city&#x27;s main thoroughfare is U.S. 25E. The U.S. 25E Tunnel (a.k.a. the Cumberland Gap Tunnel) is a tunnel that travels underneath the famous Cumberland Gap. The northern terminus is located in Middlesboro and the southern terminus is in Cumberland Gap, Tennessee. Middlesboro is one of the few cities in Kentucky that was not built on or near a significant waterway, so it is not reachable by water. The only major body of water near the city is Fern Lake, a small lake that sits on the Kentucky-Tennessee border. A man-made canal flows through the heart of the city. The canal channels Yellow Creek from the western part of the city through downtown and then heads north, northeast out of the city. The Middlesboro Canal was built by a large number of immigrants soon after the city was founded. The canal is home to numerous populations and species of ducks, all of which are considered to be honorary citizens of the city, despite the traffic headaches they may cause. Traffic and pedestrians must yield the right of way to the ducks at all times and anyone caught harming the ducks could face fines or jail time. Due to Middlesboro being known around the region for the large duck population, the canal serves as the &quot;raceway&quot; for the Downtown Ducky Dash rubber duck race held annually in August by Discover Downtown Middlesboro.

Middleboro&#x27;s main thoroughfare is named Cumberland Avenue, which runs through Middlesboro&#x27;s historic downtown district. Discover Downtown Middlesboro, Inc. (DDM) is a non-profit downtown revitalization effort charged with the restoration of the downtown area. DDM has been around since 2004 and since then, has restored Middlesboro&#x27;s famed Fountain Square, completed many historical murals in town, started and formed a farmer&#x27;s market, updated signage in the downtown area, and received grants for new plantings for the numerous planters that line Cumberland Avenue. Many of the streets which run parallel to Cumberland Avenue (east-west) are named for peerages and locales in Britain, while perpendicular (north-south) streets are named numerically. U.S. 25E is also known as 12th street, with higher numbers found as one moves west.

===Airport===
Middlesboro is served by the Middlesboro-Bell County Airport, which is a single runway, general aviation airport and is the second oldest airport still in use in Kentucky, ranking behind Bowman Field in Louisville.. The airport was established in 1944, however, the first recorded flight into the city was in 1912. It serves as the home for 26 aircraft and more than 18,000 operations annually. The Middlesboro-Bell County Airport was also the home of the famed P-38 Lightning, Glacier Girl. The aircraft was restored on site at the airport, where she made her first maiden flight in October 2002. The airport has recently undergone a major renovation, including the addition of a brand new terminal that features public restrooms, lounge, kitchen, and a radio room that can be used for up-to-date weather information. Other renovations/additions include a jet fuel tank, which will allow more air traffic to use the facility. In the near future, the airport plans to widen and expand the current runway and taxiway, plus add new hangars for aircraft, new runway lighting, and an Aircraft Weather Observation System (AWOS). The closest major airport to Middlesboro is the McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is away.

<text>Pineville () is a home rule-class city in Bell County, Kentucky, United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 1,732 as of the 2010 census. It is located on a small strip of land between the Cumberland River and Pine Mountain.

==History==
Pineville is one of the oldest settlements in Kentucky, located at the crossing of the Cumberland River by the Wilderness Road. It was established as Cumberland Ford in 1781 and formed part of Governor Isaac Shelby&#x27;s land tracts. When Bell County was formed in 1867, Cumberland Ford was formally laid off; local landowner J.J. Gibson&#x27;s 1869 land grant permitted it to be selected as the county seat, but the courthouse was not completed until 1871. The settlement was renamed &quot;Pineville&quot; in 1870 and formally incorporated in 1873.

One of the earliest branches of the Sojourner Truth Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in Pineville in 1906 with 15 members - at the time, it was affiliated with the white women&#x27;s branch of the Kentucky WCTU.

Its riverside location has made it subject to flooding, including a devastating incident on April 4, 1977, in which a floodwall built in 1952 was overwhelmed and 200 houses were destroyed or damaged. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgraded the floodwall in 1988.

The economy is dependent on the coal mining industry, local family owned businesses and on tourism. Many enjoy visiting Pine Mountain State Resort Park, where the popular attraction &quot;Chained Rock&quot; is located. Thanks to works done by the community organization Main Street Pineville, the town is working on revitalizing downtown Pineville to its historical roots.

Every Memorial Day weekend (from Wednesday to Sunday) the town of Pineville welcomes all to the Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival, named for the Mountain Laurel flower which grows wild on Pine Mountain. The first Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival was presented in 1931 at the suggestion of Annie Walker Burns, a descendant of Dr. Thomas Walker, the first European to enter Kentucky and who, along with a party of explorers, visited the present site of Pineville in 1750. Burns was captivated by the history and beauty surrounding Pineville and appealed to Governor Flem D. Sampson of Barbourville to initiate some type of event to honor Dr. Walker. She gained the support of other influential Bell Countians, and the 1931 Festival was staged at Clear Creek Springs on June 4.

The Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival includes a Concert, carnival, Appalachian crafts, local talent, a Gala Parade and a beauty pageant. Senior girls from local High Schools compete for the title of the Mountain Laurel Princess. Queen Candidates, young women chosen to represent their respective Universities in Kentucky are welcomed into the homes of Pineville citizens in the truest form of Southern Hospitality. Throughout the weekend, the women are judged secretly based on the standards of a Southern Lady.

On Saturday after the Parade, a Coronation begins in the Laurel Cove, a natural amphitheater in the Pine Mountain State Park. Each Queen candidate must curtsy before the Governor as the audience dressed in their absolute best, many wearing hats normally reserved for the Kentucky Derby claps and &#x27;ahhs&#x27; at the magnificent dresses. Then with a precession of the miniature and high school Courts, the Queen is named. She is then crowned by the Governor of Kentucky with a tiara made of live, delicate, pink Mountain Laurels. That night a &#x27;Grand March&#x27; occurs in true southern fashion, the Queens and their escorts elegantly dance together after recognizing their new Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival Queen.

<doc id="115028" wikidata="Q985560" url="?curid=115028" title="Florence, Kentucky">
<text>Florence is a city in Boone County, Kentucky, United States, part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The population was 31,946 at the 2020 census, making it the second-most populous city in Northern Kentucky, the eighth-most populous city in Kentucky and the state&#x27;s most populous that is not a county seat. Like all but the state&#x27;s two most populous cities, Florence is a home rule-class city under Kentucky state law. 

==History==
The Florence area was originally known as Crossroads, because of the convergence of several roads from Burlington and Union at Ridge Road (now U.S. 25). By 1821, the area was known as Maddentown for Thomas Madden, a Covington attorney who owned a farm on the Burlington Pike. When Madden moved away, the area became known as Connersville in 1828 for Jacob Conner, a settler who assumed responsibility for the growing town. The town was finally renamed Florence because there was another Connersville in Harrison County. The name presumably is for Florence, Italy, but the specific etymology is unclear.

Florence is well known in surrounding cities for a water tower visible from I-71/I-75 that reads &quot;Florence Y&#x27;all&quot;. Built in 1974, the tower originally advertised the up-and-coming Florence Mall, as part of an agreement with the mall developers who donated the land for the tower. But because the mall was not built yet, the tower violated highway regulations, and the city was forced to change it within a short deadline. Rather than repaint the entire tower, they simply painted over the two vertical lines of the &quot;M&quot; to create a &quot;Y&quot;. The intent was to change it back when the mall was built, but the local residents liked the tower&#x27;s new proclamation, so the city decided to leave it as it was.

==History==
Joseph Houston settled a station in the area in 1776, but was forced to relocate due to prior land grants. In 1786, Lawrence Protzman purchased the area of present-day Paris from its owners, platted for a town, and offered land for public buildings in exchange for the Virginia legislature making the settlement the seat of the newly formed Bourbon County. In 1789, the town was formally established as Hopewell after Hopewell, New Jersey, his hometown. The next year, it was renamed Paris after the French capital to match its county and honor the French assistance during the American Revolution.

Among the early settlers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were French refugees who had fled the excesses of their own revolution. One Frenchman was noted in a 19th-century state history as having come from Calcutta, via Bengal, and settled here as a schoolteacher.

The post office was briefly known as Bourbontown or Bourbonton in the early 19th century, but there is no evidence that this name was ever formally applied to the town itself. It was incorporated as Paris in 1839 and again in 1890.

The city&#x27;s early industrial growth was a result of the Ohio Valley&#x27;s pig iron industry and, particularly, the 1854 charter of the Kentucky Iron, Coal, and Manufacturing Company by the Kentucky General Assembly. The city was formally incorporated by the General Assembly two years later in 1856. Major industrial employers in the first half of the 20th century included Armco, Ashland Oil and Refining Company, the C&amp;O Railroad, Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Company&#x27;s Semet Solvay, and Mansbach Steel.

<text>Catlettsburg is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Boyd County, Kentucky, United States. The city population was 1,780 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early history===

Catlettsburg&#x27;s history begins in the decades directly following the American Revolution, as many frontiersmen passed through the area on their western trek along the Ohio River. Alexander Catlett, the first landowner of the area, came to the site in 1798. His son, Horatio Catlett, opened a post office on December 5, 1810, with himself being the postmaster. This was the first known use of the name Catlettsburg being used officially as it had been previously known as Mouth of Sandy. In 1849, James Wilson Fry, a landowner who purchased the site from the Catlett family in 1833, sold off town lots of what was soon to be the town of Catlettsburg. (The Kentucky Encyclopedia says the Catletts settled the area in 1798.) and Catletts resided at the location until 1847. After establishing this settlement, the Catletts operated a business that consisted of a tavern, post office, trading post, and inn, out of a log structure they built from virgin timber about 1811. Due to its location along the route of the American frontier, the Catletts provided hospitality to such notable patrons as General Stonewall Jackson, Henry Clay, Felix Grundy, and future U.S. President James Garfield. Catering to the ever-growing river traffic, the Catlett business flourished and the present-day town grew up around it.
Collis P. Huntington operated the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Its line to Cincinnati was built from Huntington in 1888. This required the construction of the railroad bridge that crosses the Big Sandy River at Catlettsburg, which carries an average of 80 trains daily.

The Catlett House is still standing two hundred years later and has long been used as the &quot;servants&#x27; quarters&quot; of Beechmoor Place, a large home located on Walnut Street (U.S. Routes 23 and 60). C.W. Culver bought the property from the Catlett heirs and built a large home of the Georgian style on the right of the Catletts&#x27; original dwelling. About 1868, Col. Laban T. Moore bought the estate from C.W. Culver for $10,000 ($171,000 in 2011). Col. Moore was noted as a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives and had previously served as a captain in the Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. He named his home Beechmoor, a portmanteau of his surname and that of a magnificent beech that stood on the fertile grounds at the time. Ownership of Beechmoor has remained in the Moore family since 1868. Beechmoor&#x27;s eastern wing, being 200 years old and built by the Catletts, is cited as the oldest known building in a 300-mile radius. Built of Kentucky&#x27;s virgin hemlock maple (now virtually extinct), the exterior walls are between 9 and 12 inches thick. The main portion has a stone foundation, and is held up by the same virgin timber, each in diameter, and running the entire width of the house. Beechmoor&#x27;s last full-time resident, Rebecca Patton, Col. L.T. Moore&#x27;s granddaughter, was dedicated to Beechmoor&#x27;s preservation during her lifetime. In 1973, she had her lifelong home listed on the National Register of Historic Places and made provisions to ensure the home would be maintained in the event of her demise. She died in 1986. Since then, it has been maintained by proceeds from a trust fund and rental property income. A paid caretaker lives on the property full-time as of 2011. Several attempts have been made by local civic groups to acquire the property as a museum or civic use property due to its historical significance to the area but have not been successful as of this time, due to the family&#x27;s desire to retain ownership.

The Catlett name is still used on a tributary to the Ohio River, Catlett&#x27;s Creek, which follows Kentucky Route 168 for many miles west of the city. Catlettsburg annexed two nearby communities on its borders in the late 19th century: Hampton City to the south side and Sandy City to the north.

The spelling of the city&#x27;s name was changed to Catlettsburg from the previous spelling of Catlett&#x27;s Burg .

Catlettsburg served as a Union Army supply depot during the Civil War. The First Presbyterian Church, 26th and Broadway, served as an army hospital during the war. The church building still serves the congregation of the Presbyterian church in Catlettsburg. The current church, built in 1875, is one of two truly gothic buildings still standing in the U.S. The church is of mid-to-late 19th century Grecian design, with most original fixtures in place, and is sometimes used for wedding ceremonies.

The Catlettsburg National Bank building used to sit at the corner of Center and Division/26th streets was listed on the National Register, but has been demolished due to the structure being unstable.

Beginning in the late 19th century and lasting until the early 1920s, Catlettsburg was the largest hardwood timber market in the world due to its location at the mouth of the Big Sandy River. Due to the profitability of harvesting such hardwoods, most all virgin timber that existed for several miles around Catlettsburg was felled during that period. Very few trees of desirable breeds such as oak were left standing once the boom was over, mostly to mark private property lines. One known exception to history&#x27;s hardwood harvest is the existence of a large oak, standing on a knob in the Hampton City section. With its origins dating to &quot;circa&quot; 1760, it measures in diameter. It is the oldest known living tree of any breed within the city limits and for many miles surrounding the city. There is also a hemlock maple tree (which measures over 350 inches in diameter) located on the same property, one of very few that remain in North America as they were all but extinct due to their heavy usage in home construction from 1750 to 1925.

Rail transportation began to slowly replace the river&#x27;s prominence as a mode of transportation as the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio (C&amp;O) railroad began construction of a bridge across the Big Sandy River linking Catlettsburg with Kenova, West Virginia in 1885. The bridge is still traversed by trains many times each day, as a part of CSX Transportation&#x27;s (formerly C &amp; O Railway) main operations. Known by railroad enthusiasts and historians from around the world, it is unique in design and historic value for its longevity. The bridge is also used by Amtrak&#x27;s Cardinal passenger train, train numbers 50 (eastbound, toward Huntington) and 51 (westbound, toward Ashland), which carries passengers from Chicago to New York City.
The Chatteroi railroad preceded the C &amp; O by a few years as the first rail line to travel through Catlettsburg&#x27;s city limits, as it followed the Big Sandy River north from the coal fields to Ashland.

The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway built a passenger depot in Catlettsburg in 1906 and operated the facility for over 52 years until 1958 when passenger service was transferred to nearby Ashland. After closing the facility, C &amp; O sold it to the city of Catlettsburg for $1. The city has maintained it and used it as a civic center since that time. In 2006, longtime Catlettsburg businessman and politician Russell Compton donated his own personal funds for the restoration of the train depot so it could be restored to its original appearance. Intensive restoration of the depot is now complete, featuring the original directional signage, etc. The facility was renamed the Russell Compton Community Center in 2007 in his honor. In 2010, Compton donated the necessary funds to restore an old C &amp; O caboose to its original appearance. It is now parked on the side of the depot facility.

After the merger, the Catlettsburg High School campus, which was built in 1965, became Catlettsburg Junior High, serving grades 7–9. Haney Elementary was closed and students then attended Yost Elementary. Hatfield Elementary remained open. At the close of the 1979–80 school year, Yost Elementary was closed and students were transferred to Hatfield, where a new school building replaced the former. It was then renamed Catlettsburg Elementary. At the time of its closing in 1980, Yost Elementary School was the oldest operating school building in the state of Kentucky and one of the oldest in the United States. It was first constructed in 1894 as the Catlettsburg Public School and served all twelve grades for many years before becoming a grade school. Students in grades 10-12 were transferred to Boyd County High School in 1974. At the end of the 1992–93 school year, the junior high was merged with Summit Junior High (now Boyd County Middle School). Since then, Catlettsburg Elementary has been the only school within the city limits, and uses the campus of the former high school/jr. high school at 3380 Court Street.
The gymnasium of Catlettsburg Elementary was built many years before the school buildings that surround it. Part of the New Deal, it was constructed by the Works Progress Administration in 1935. The Catlettsburg High School was added onto it in 1965, and now serves as the elementary school&#x27;s gymnasium, which hosts many civic events such as the Catlettsburg Miss Flame Pageant that feeds into the Miss Kentucky Pageant and Miss America system.
In 1991, Ponderosa Elementary School began educating students when it was constructed at Ponderosa Estates.

Catlettsburg has a public library, a branch of the Boyd County Public Library.

<doc id="115036" wikidata="Q3315898" url="?curid=115036" title="Westwood, Boyd County, Kentucky">
<text>Westwood is a census-designated place in Boyd County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 4,387 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Ashland, the two areas are closely affiliated, sharing a ZIP code and bus system. Westwood is located on a flat to hilly elevation just west of the Ohio River. The flat hilltop is unusual to eastern Kentucky and was created by the preglacial Teays River which existed in ancient times and flowed in the opposite direction of the Ohio River. Westwood is part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area.

==History==
Westwood was developed after 1920 as a planned residential addition to the city of Ashland, but due to its residents&#x27; independence, annexation into the city of Ashland has never occurred. Employees of nearby Armco Steel American Rolling Mill Company, now AK Steel employed the majority of homeowners in Westwood. Development took place from 1920 to 1950, although some additions have been made after that period. As the population of Westwood grew, the community was never incorporated as a city. According to U.S. Census Data, it is one of the largest unincorporated communities in the state of Kentucky.

==Geography==
Westwood is located at (38.482422, -82.678028).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.48%, is water.

Westwood is located mostly on a flat ridge west of the Ohio River. The southern boundary is the Ashland city limits, and the northern boundary is Hood&#x27;s Creek. The flat elevation in which Westwood is located was created by the ancient Teays River. The course of the river was altered due to glacial formations around two million years ago. It resulted in many flat hill tops that are commonly found in Boyd and Greenup counties which are evident on aerial satellite imagery. Outside of this ancient river bed, the terrain is &quot;ridge and valley&quot; as is typical in most of Eastern Kentucky.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 4,888 people, 2,004 households, and 1,468 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 2,191 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.20% White, 0.47% African American, 0.08% Native American, 0.37% Asian, 0.04% from other races, and 0.84% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.49% of the population.

There were 2,004 households, out of which 26.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.0% were married couples living together, 11.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.7% were non-families. 23.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 2.84.

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 20.9% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 27.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.8 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $29,394, and the median income for a family was $36,094. Males had a median income of $30,196 versus $19,938 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $18,455. About 9.1% of families and 14.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Danville is a home rule-class city and the county seat of Boyle County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 17,236 at the 2020 census. Danville is the principal city of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of the Boyle and Lincoln counties. In 2001, Danville received a Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In 2011, &quot;Money&quot; magazine placed Danville as the fourth-best place to retire in the United States. Centre College in Danville was selected to host U.S. vice-presidential debates in 2000 and 2012.

==History==
Within Kentucky, Danville is called the &quot;City of Firsts&quot;:
* It housed the first courthouse in Kentucky.
* The first Kentucky constitution was written and signed here.
* It was the first capital of Kentucky.
* It had the first U.S. post office west of the Allegheny Mountains.
* It hosts the first state-supported school for the deaf.
* Ephraim McDowell completed the first known successful laparotomy here in 1809, removing an ovarian tumor from a woman patient without anesthesia.
* It is the home of Centre College, housing the oldest college administration building and campus west of the Allegheny Mountains.
Danville was part of the Great Settlement Area around Fort Harrod (present-day Harrodsburg), which was first settled in 1774. The site was originally known as Crow&#x27;s Station for settler John Crow, but the town was surveyed and platted by Walker Daniel, Kentucky&#x27;s first district attorney, who bought near the Wilderness Road from Crow in 1783. The city was named for Daniel. The Virginia legislature officially established Danville on December 4, 1787.

Between 1784 and 1792, ten conventions were held in Danville to petition for better governance and ultimately to secure independence from Virginia. In 1786 the Danville Political Club was organized. It met each Saturday night at Grayson&#x27;s Tavern to discuss the political, economic, and social concerns of the day. After a state constitution was adopted and separation was confirmed in 1792, the town ceased to be of statewide importance. Its leading citizens moved elsewhere.

Transylvania University was founded in Danville in 1783. It moved to Lexington in 1789. Centre College was founded in 1819. Danville Theological Seminary was founded in 1853; in 1901 it became part of the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. The Caldwell Institute for Young Ladies was founded in 1860. It became Caldwell Female College in 1876, Caldwell College in 1904, Kentucky College for Women in 1913, and merged into Centre College in 1926.

In November 1806, Meriwether Lewis, co-leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, visited Danville while traveling the Wilderness Road to Washington, D.C., to report on the expedition, which had returned from the Pacific Coast. In December 1806, William Clark visited his nephews in school in Danville before following Lewis to Washington.

The first school in Danville for African-American children was founded around 1840 by Willis Russell, an emancipated slave of Robert Craddock, a Revolutionary War veteran. Craddock deeded a log house in Danville to Russell. He moved to the town after Craddock&#x27;s death and started a school for children. The house on Walnut Street no longer stands, though what was once believed to be his house is now the Willis Russell Memorial Cabin. Russell&#x27;s house stood across the street, opposite St. James African American Methodist Church.

In 1842, Boyle County was formed from southern Mercer County and northern Lincoln County. Danville became its county seat.

In 1850, Danville and Boyle County backed construction of the Lexington and Danville Railroad. Money ran out when the railroad reached Nicholasville. John A. Roebling had already built towers for a railroad suspension bridge over the Kentucky River. (Roebling lived in Danville during the construction.) Despite the railroad not being completed to Danville, the county still owed the company $150,000. It completed payment on time in 1884.

In 1860, a fire devastated the city, destroying 64 buildings and causing more than $300,000 in damages. Boyle County&#x27;s courthouse was destroyed; its replacement was completed in 1862.

After the Union Army won the Battle of Perryville in the Civil War on October 8, 1862, it appropriated many Danville buildings, including the courthouse, for use as hospitals. On October 11, a Union force drove Confederate forces from the county fairgrounds through Danville.

In May 1864, the group of 250 – mostly enslaved males but including some freedmen – marched from Danville to nearby Camp Nelson in Jessamine County, where Colonel Andrew Clark allowed them to enlist In the Union Army after some initial hesitation. Arriving with wounds inflicted upon them in route, this group was the first to enlist at this site, where 10,000 United States Colored Troops trained.

In 1775, Archibald McNeill planted Kentucky&#x27;s first recorded hemp crop at Clark&#x27;s Run Creek near Danville. By 1889 Boyle County was one of the ten Kentucky counties which together produced more than 90% of the US yield. It was the state&#x27;s largest cash crop until 1915, when it lost its market to imported jute.

From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, Danville was home to a thriving African-American business sector located on and around 2nd Street on the western edge of what is now Constitution Square Historic Site. The city demolished this business sector under urban renewal in the 1970s to provide for the expansion of Constitution Square Park.

On October 5, 2000, Dick Cheney and Senator Joe Lieberman, candidates for Vice President of the United States, debated at Centre College during the 2000 presidential election. On October 11, 2012, Centre College again hosted the Vice-Presidential debate, this time between Vice President Joe Biden and Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan.

Great-great-great-grandmother Nancy Belle Graves was born enslaved in 1808. Nancy&#x27;s daughter, Susan Davis, organized the Danville Domestic Economy Club for black women which encouraged voter participation and education. Susan and her husband, Sam, were both born enslaved. Fighting in the Civil War for the Union, Sam became emancipated upon his 1864 enlistment in the 114th United States Colored Troops at nearby Camp Nelson. After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Sam voted in the 1870 election.
