The city takes its name from Antoine LeClaire, a Métis trader of First Nations-French Canadian descent, who originally owned the land. Although the city&#x27;s official name is &quot;LeClaire&quot;, it is often spelled &quot;Le Claire&quot;, and has also been recorded as &quot;LeClare&quot;.

The town was incorporated in 1855, having been settled by European Americans as early as the 1830s.

A Canadian Pacific Railway train derailed on 3 January 2020 around 11:00 a.m. near the Buffalo Bill Museum in downtown LeClaire, just yards from the Mississippi River. At least a dozen rail cars and tankers toppled off their tracks, forcing police to send a hazardous materials team to the site. Officials say Canadian Pacific Railway had found no significant air or water contamination. No one was injured and no buildings were damaged in the derailment, although some vehicles in a nearby parking lot were damaged.

LeClaire is known as the site of the reality television series &quot;American Pickers&quot;, aired by the History Channel, and home to Antique Archaeology, an antiques store featured on the show. It is the birthplace of William Frederick Cody, aka Buffalo Bill Cody.

Alexander and James Brownlie came to the area in August 1838, having followed the Mississippi River to the mouth of the Wapsipinicon River, then west along its banks. The two purchased a nearby timber ridge from a man named coats, settling the claim for $160 plus timberland and all the prairie they wished to own. The first log cabin was built shortly thereafter, in a cluster of trees at the east edge of the timber, just south of the original town site.

A stage road, from Davenport to DeWitt and Dubuque passed through the village and a blacksmith shop and harness shop once lined the streets.

In the late 1860s, the railroad was extended from Davenport to Long Grove and stopped at what was originally known as Noel Station, in honor of John T. Noel, pioneer, township trustee and civil servant. The town, which had not been platted, was finally platted in the 1890s, though on a very loose basis.

A major incident in the city&#x27;s history took place in December 1921, with the robbery of the Stockman&#x27;s Savings Bank. Stories varied on what transpired, but what is known is that the two suspects were killed by a posse immediately after they attempted to hold up the bank.

Panorama Park exists due to a road maintenance controversy from the early 1950s. The city of Bettendorf ignored requests to maintain the thoroughfare known as Park Avenue, a dirt road which was often left icy or muddy. The neighborhood surrounding Park Avenue decided to incorporate the community as Panorama Park in an effort to pay for the road&#x27;s maintenance directly. Since its 1953 incorporation, the residents of Panorama Park have maintained their independence, paying lower taxes than residents of the surrounding Bettendorf.

==Iowa&#x27;s &quot;fastest growing city?&quot;==

In June 2006, a U.S. Census Bureau estimate stated that the town&#x27;s population had grown to 261, a 135% increase. This figure took into account a 2002 building permits report that stated 97 permits had been issued for dwellings. Obviously, this was a mistake, for as the City Clerk noted in conversation with a news reporter, &quot;I think we only have 54 houses in the whole town.&quot; The town is expected to appeal the estimate—the only way it will be revised—and if and when this happens, Panorama Park will have been nominally both the fastest-growing and the fastest-shrinking city in Iowa.

==History==

The first known settlers in Princeton Township were brothers Giles and Haswell Pineo, &quot;circa&quot; 1836. By 1838, Elizabeth City – the predecessor to Princeton – had its first store, ferry across the nearby Wapsipinicon River, mill and distillery were in operation.

The city now known as Princeton was platted and recorded in 1852, and the city was incorporated in 1860. Rail service to Chicago began in 1860.

The city&#x27;s mainstay businesses for many years were Farmers Savings Bank, chartered in 1908, and Boll&#x27;s General Store, founded by Henry &quot;Heinie&quot; Boll in 1922. Farmers Savings Bank is now part of Milan, Illinois-based Blackhawk Bank &amp; Trust, while Boll&#x27;s Store continued until 1997. Boll&#x27;s storefront is now the Community Center.

Education of the area&#x27;s children started in a log cabin, moved to a converted barn and then, in 1866, to a stone building. Princeton became part of the North Scott Community School District in 1956, and is now served by Virgil Grissom Elementary School, which opened in 1967.

The Methodist and the Presbyterian churches began to hold services in 1840, and the Lutherans first held services in a building known as &quot;Old Brick,&quot; located west of town, in 1852. Today, Zion Lutheran Church (part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Princeton Presbyterian Church, affiliated with Presbyterian Church USA&#x27;s Presbytery of East Iowa, are the city&#x27;s two churches, with Zion founded in 1898 and the Presbyterian church in 1854. Both churches are members of the Princeton, Pleasant Valley, Argo and LeClaire Pastors&#x27; Group, a coalition of clergy from churches serving those communities.

<text>Earling is a city in Shelby County, Iowa, United States. The population was 397 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Earling had its start 1881-1882 by the building of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway through that territory.

The town was platted in 1882 by the Milwaukee Land Company and was first known as Marthan. However, there was already a town called Marathon in Iowa, so the name of the town was soon changed to Earling, in honor of Albert J. Earling who in 1882 was division superintendent of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. (Earling became president of said Railroad on September 23, 1899.)

Earling is well known in paranormal circles for being the site of the 1928 exorcism of Anna Ecklund. Over 23 days in 1928, a Roman Catholic Capuchin named Theophilus Riesinger worked to exorcise demons from Emma Schmidt at the local Franciscan convent. One of the priests involved wrote an account several years later in which he made a variety of supernatural claims, including that Ecklund flew threw the air during the exorcism and clung to the wall over a door, that locals noticed strange noises and odors, and that the 23 day exorcism resulted in the expulsion of several demons from Ecklund.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The city straddles the boundary line between southeast Union Township and northeast Westphalia Township.

<text>Elk Horn is a city in Shelby County, Iowa, United States. The population was 601 at the time of the 2020 census. Elk Horn is known as an enclave of Danish ethnicity and is home to the Museum of Danish America.

==History==
Elk Horn was platted in 1901, and incorporated as a town in 1910. The city took its name from Elk Horn Creek.
Newspaper articles from the Atlantic, Iowa newspaper published in 1919 on the death of Mrs. Winters and 1939 on the history of Clay Township
In 1864 a colony of Wisconsin people with 3 or 4 covered wagons came to Iowa to establish a town and settled on a knoll two miles southwest of what is now Elk Horn. With the establishment of the post office, Mrs. Caroline Whitney Winters, wife of Theron W. Winters suggested the name of Elk Horn as so many elk shed their horns in the timber there. Mrs. Winters was the first post mistress as the post office was kept in the Winters cabin for a number of years. Her husband traversed the stage route along the ridge country between Grove City and Harlan, carrying the mail prior to the advent of the railroad. The site of the cabin was later occupied by Chris and Stena Jensen, and the Lawrence Nelson and Mrs. Peter M Petersen farms.

Elk Horn was also the site of the Elk Horn Højskole. This school, founded in 1878 by Danish immigrant Kristian Ostergaard, was the first Danish folk school in America. It served as a magnet for Danish immigrants, drawing them to Elk Horn in great numbers. In 1894, Pastor Kristian Anker, then owner and principal of the Elk Horn Højskole, sold it to the newly formed Danish Lutheran Church in North America for use as a seminary and college.

Dr. Henry Duitman directed the orchestra for the past 22 years and was recently hired as an Assistant Professor by Grand Valley State University in Allendale Charter Township, Michigan, leaving a conductor vacancy for the orchestra. In April 2011, it was announced that Christopher Stanichar, the Director of Orchestral Activities at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, would be taking the director&#x27;s position for the orchestra.

==Education==

===Schools===

Sioux Center is the home of Dordt University, formerly known as Dordt College. Dordt&#x27;s 1,500 students are drawn from the local area, Christian Reformed and Reformed communities across the United States and Canada, and other locations throughout the United States and worldwide. Dordt&#x27;s engineering, education, and agriculture programs are especially popular with students.

The Sioux Center Community School district educates 1,730 students as of October 2024. The school is one of the few non-consolidated schools in northwest Iowa. The kindergarten through 4th grade Kinsey Elementary School posted an all-time high enrollment of 477 in the fall of 2024. 596 students are enrolled in the intermediate &amp; middle schools, and 502 are at the high school. The elementary building and the middle school completed construction projects in 2010.

Sioux Center Christian School educates approximately 538 students grades pre-K through 8th. Most students who graduate from Sioux Center Christian continue to either Western Christian High School in Hull, Iowa or Unity Christian High School in Orange City, Iowa, although some go to the Sioux Center High School for their high school education.

The sports teams of Dordt University and Sioux Center Community Schools enjoy a friendly, yet heated, rivalry with the teams of Orange City. Dordt University and Northwestern College compete in a number of sports, including soccer, volleyball and basketball. Dordt University recently started a football program, fielding a Junior Varsity team in the fall of 2007 and a Varsity team in 2008. MOC-Floyd Valley Community School competes spiritedly with Sioux Center Community School in many school activities. Sioux Center is a large division 2A school.

===Library===
The Sioux Center Public Library began in 1927. Its location changed many times over the years due to expanding demand and resource materials. In 1967, the library opened in a new location one block northeast of the Centre Mall. On July 23, 2003, a fire started due to arson and destroyed the library and $600,000 worth of materials in it. The library was moved to the community center while plans were drawn up for construction of a new building. Completed in September 2008, the Sioux Center Library&#x27;s new location opened the door to many services – private meeting rooms, an art gallery, and many computers available for public use.

==Organizations==

===Boy Scouts of America===
Scouting began in Sioux Center back in 1923. The Sioux Center troop was charted as Troop 1 with Sioux City Area Council. After a number of years, Troop 1 was discontinued until 1935. Under the same council, Troop 94 was chartered by the American Legion Post #199. The Troop has continued since 1935. In 1943, the Sioux City Area Council transferred the troop to the Prairie Gold Area Council located in Fort Dodge, Iowa. At that time, Troop 94 was redesignated as Troop 211. The troop has had over 75 Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout in its history.

===Sioux Center Wreaths Across America===
The tradition of laying wreaths to honor veterans during the holiday season began in 1992, when Morrill Worcester of Worcester Wreath Company (Harrington, Maine) was stuck with a number of extra wreaths at the close of the holiday season. Remembering a boyhood trip to Arlington National Cemetery, he donated 5,000 wreaths to be placed at the headstones of an older section of the cemetery. Worcester&#x27;s action grew into a national movement. In 2006, Wreaths Across America was formed as a non-profit. Every year on a Saturday in December, more than 1,000 locations participate by laying wreaths out of remembrance and respect for America&#x27;s servicemen and women. Each wreath is sponsored by individuals, organizations, or businesses. Each sponsorship lays one wreath in Memory Gardens. Currently, Aaron Van Beek serves as director of the Sioux Center program.

== History ==
When the Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul railways made the decision to come to the junction of the Calamus and Indian Creek valleys, the people began moving to the railroad. J. W. Maxwell and F. M. Baldwin had purchased some land near the railroad, and gave the land upon which the first town of Maxwell was platted. The town was after the donor and because he was the first to move there. Soon, large buildings were moved from Iowa Center and Peoria City to what is now the site of the town of Maxwell. The first building was the railroad depot. Several new buildings were constructed, the largest of which was occupied by the Mercantile firm of Maxwell and Baldwin and is now occupied by Logsdon&#x27;s Grocery Store.

Because of the excessive wet season and heavy snow of the winter of 1881–1882, there was a considerable flood. Both creeks, surrounding the town, were out of their banks and formed one solid body of water just south of the depot, marooning many of the construction gangs who made their headquarters that winter in Maxwell. Because they could not work on account of the interference of the water, two saloons sprang up and did a flourishing business.

Before the close of 1882, there were twelve or more business houses in town, and more under construction. By 1887, there were 40 businesses located in Maxwell.

Maxwell became incorporated in 1883, and a town election was held. The town hall was located behind the Maxwell Baldwin building. It had a cupola with a bell to ring in case of emergencies. The first church met at the lumber yard owned by J. O. French. Planks were arranged as seats. Later, the Methodist and Presbyterian churches were built.

==Arts and culture==
The city celebrates Zearing Days Celebration festival during the last weekend in July. This celebration used to be held to commemorate Labor Day, but had not been put on since the 1980s, that was until 2000 when a group of Zearing residents decided to start the tradition again. Once started back up again, the first celebration – Just Horsin&#x27; Around – was titled in honor of the late Dick Sparrow&#x27;s 40-horse hitch. This celebration was a one-day event in July that has now grown into a three-day event.
Zearing has a long history of other horse trainers other than the Sparrow family as well who have been a significant part of the town&#x27;s culture and history. Individuals such as Verne Matson, Eric Brown, and Dean Johnston all successfully worked with large draft horse teams and claimed Zearing as home.

== Education ==
Zearing is served by the Colo–NESCO Community School District. The district was established on July 1, 1991, by the merger of the Colo and NESCO school districts, with the latter serving McCallsburg and Zearing; NESCO was an acronym for Northeast Story County.

Zearing&#x27;s facility houses the elementary learning center (grades K-4). The district&#x27;s central office is based in Colo, as well as the district&#x27;s high school (grades 5–12).

<text>Chelsea is a city in Tama County, Iowa, United States. The population was 229 at the 2020 census. The city is located in the Iowa River Valley and has suffered severe damage in several floods.

==History==

A post office was established as Chelsea in 1863. Chelsea was laid out in 1863, and it was incorporated in 1878. It was named after Chelsea, Massachusetts.

Chelsea was surveyed in the spring of 1863 by Charles Irish for Seneca C. Breese on the northwest quarter of section 17. A few years later, James Hunter added nine acres on section 7, and in 1870, the Iowa Railroad Land Company added nine acres on section 18. At the time, there was a log cabin on the northeast corner of section 18 and a warehouse built by J. R. Graham in 1862 on the northwest corner of section 17. 

The first frame building, built by E. E. Vickery, was used as a blacksmith shop, followed by a dwelling built by E. A. Southard. W. H. Graham opened the first store in 1863, though Peter Scoffish had a store before the village was platted. The railroad reached section 17 in 1861, where a small collection of buildings called Otter Creek served as the terminus for about a year before the village moved with the railroad. Chelsea&#x27;s first hotel was opened in 1863 by Mrs. Thompson, followed by Samuel Spence. A later two-story hotel burned down. E. A. Southard opened the first cabinet shop in 1864, operating for two years. The post office was established in 1863, with W. H. Graham as postmaster, succeeded by Martin Smith and then Fred Roach in January 1883.

===Railroad===
The Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was the first to reach Chelsea. The Iowa legislature, by an act approved on July 14, 1856, granted land to the Iowa Central Air Line Railroad Company for building a railroad, with certain conditions. The 1857 panic caused the company to collapse. In March 1860, the state reassigned the grant to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company, formed in 1859 by stockholders of the Chicago, Iowa, and Nebraska Railroad. The railroad progressed steadily: bridging the Cedar River and reaching Otter Creek by 1861 and Chelsea in 1862. 

The Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, under lease to the Chicago &amp; North Western was the first to actually cross Iowa and reach the Missouri River. Thomas C. Durant, vice president Railroad, held stock in multiple railroads and was accused of corruption in manipulating the railroads&#x27; stock prices in the race to traverse the state. 

===Flooding===
The entirety of Chelsea lies in the lowland terrace flood plains of the Iowa River and Otter Creek making the city very prone to recurring flooding. 

The largest floods in Chelsea history took place in the years 1918, 1944, 1947, 1960, 1969, 1993 and 2008. Frequent flooding in Chelsea and its associated costs have led to a population decline and a decrease in the overall standard of living in the community. 

==Geography==
Set in the floodplain of the Iowa River Valley, Chelsea is surrounded by hills that are partially forested.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Garwin is a city in Tama County, Iowa, United States. The population was 481 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Garwin was platted in 1880. A post office called Garwin has been in operation since 1880.

In 1879, the Toledo and Northwestern Railroad was sold to the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. After the sale, the railroad line was extended northwestward from Toledo. Various new towns were established along the tracks, but Garwin, Iowa, was the first railroad station beyond Toledo.

Giving the town a name proved to be a difficult process. At first, it was called “Maple,” or as some claim “Myrcle,” but neither name was particularly favorable. The next choice was “Marvin,” in honor of Marvin Hewitt, an official of the Northwestern railroad, but it was soon discovered that another town had already taken the name.

Several landowners, including George Rider and John Galvizer, wanted to sell their lands to establish the new town. After much controversy, these two men won out, and a message was sent to Toledo that read: “‘G’ (for Glavizer) and ‘R’ (for Rider) win.” Its recipients misconstrued the message, reading “Garwin” instead- and the city finally had a name.

==Geography==
Garwin is located at (42.094635, -92.676653).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Student-athletes can now compete in football, volleyball, cross country, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; track, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; golf, baseball, and softball. They share wrestling with East Marshall High School and swimming with Marshalltown High School.

GMG had a lot of success in the mid-1990s, winning back-to-back NICL West titles in boys&#x27; basketball and a district football title in 1999. Under coach Jay Freese, the 2007-08 girls&#x27; basketball team posted a record of 20-3 and made the program&#x27;s first-ever regional final.

In the 2010 football season, the team became the first to go 0-10 and lose each game by at least two touchdowns. The boys&#x27; basketball team also struggled, going 3–17.

According to town legend, a barrel of whiskey was placed on the grounds and lots sold for $10 to $20 - although none of the lots were paid for at the time.

The present Taylor County Courthouse was built in 1893.

Bedford was served by a branch of the Burlington Northern Railroad (formerly Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad or &quot;CB&amp;Q&quot;) that ran from Creston, Iowa to St. Joseph, Missouri This line was removed along with almost all the branches in southwestern Iowa and northwestern Missouri in the late 1970s to early 1980s

Bedford is also served by Iowa Highway 148 which runs north and south into Missouri, and Iowa Highway 2 runs east and west and connects most of the county seats in the southern tier of Iowa counties. There is an excellent series of farm to market road system, mostly paved, as well.

Michael Bentler, 53, his wife Sandra, 47, and their three daughters: Sheena, 17, Shelby, 15 and Shayne, 14, were pronounced dead at the scene. The family&#x27;s oldest and surviving child, Shawn Michael Bentler, 22, was arrested in Illinois on unrelated drug charges. The following Sunday afternoon, he was charged with five counts of first-degree murder, in what has been characterized by the media as one of the worst mass murders in Iowa history.

Douds was platted in 1866 by brothers Eliab and David Doud. It was originally called Doud&#x27;s Station. Douds was never officially incorporated as a town, but has a Post Office and its own zip code. On the southern bank of the Des Moines River lies Douds&#x27; &quot;Twin City&quot;, Leando. Leando is the elder, but smaller of the two towns. Leando was settled in the 1830s and was originally called Portland. In the original deed it was stipulated by the Doud brothers that there was to be no buying or selling of intoxicating liquors in the town.

This was upheld until the 1990s when Rob Moore began selling alcohol in his grocery store. Until the construction of the first iron bridge (1898) the towns of Douds and Portland saw much rivalry. Douds is home to Douds Stone Inc. which operates from one of the largest underground limestone mines in the state of Iowa. Farmers and Traders Savings Bank (founded 1910) is located in Douds, and is one of the few banks to survive the Great Depression. Now considered one community, (Douds and Leando) Douds hosts its annual Field Day on the last full weekend in June.

<text>Keosauqua ( ) is a city and the county seat of Van Buren County, Iowa, United States. The population was 936 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

Keosauqua was laid out in 1839. The word Keosauqua derives from the Meskwaki and Sauk name for the Des Moines River, &quot;Ke-o-saw-qua&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;Bend in the River&quot;.

The Hotel Manning, a three-story relic from the Des Moines River&#x27;s steamboat days, is Keosauqua&#x27;s most notable landmark. Its unique Steamboat Gothic architecture mimics riverboats of the mid-1800s. The hotel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1973. In 2017, community supporters, organized as Engage Keosauqua, purchased the hotel. Over the next couple of years, through contributions and grants, they made repairs and updated improvements to bring the hotel back to its former grandeur. The Hotel Manning today continues to be a centerpiece of southeastern Iowa culture and history.

Also located in Keosauqua are many other notable historic sites. The 1847 Pearson House was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The Van Buren County Courthouse, built in 1843 in the Greek Revival style, is the oldest in continuous use in the state, and second-oldest in the United States. It is also on the National Register of Historic Places. The courthouse was the scene for the murder trial of William McCauley. A guilty verdict led to his subsequent demise at, appropriately, Hangman&#x27;s Hollow. It was the first legal hanging in Iowa history.

When Brigham Young and his followers were exiled from their base at Nauvoo, Illinois in 1846, their caravan crossed the Des Moines River at Ely&#x27;s Ford, just upriver from Keosauqua on what is now known as the Mormon Trail.

Van Buren County native Voltaire Twombly received the Congressional Medal of Honor for actions taken at Ft. Donelson during the American Civil War. His post-war pursuits included a stint as mayor of Keosauqua and, as a businessman there, he built a stone building on the main street that remains to this day.

The 1839 Honey War, so named because three trees with beehives were cut down in the process, was fought south of Keosauqua in what is now Lacey-Keosauqua State Park. The event was a border disagreement between Iowa and Missouri. Before it was over, militias from both sides faced each other, though the dispute was ultimately resolved without a shot being fired.

Lacey-Keosauqua is one of the largest state parks in Iowa and was built by the Civil Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. The lake bathhouse and lodge stone work, from stone quarried within the park, remain outstanding testament to their work.

Keosauqua hosts its annual Fall Festival the second full weekend in October.

==Geography==
Keosauqua is in the Southern Iowa Drift Plain, formed by Pre-Illinoian glaciers approximately 300,000 years ago. The topography of the area is heavily forested rolling hills, interspersed with farmland, and has many tributaries flowing into the Des Moines River. The Des Moines was large enough to handle steamboat traffic in the 1800s and was the reason that Keosauqua was founded.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Mount Sterling is a census-designated place in Van Buren County, Iowa, United States. The population was 33 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Mount Sterling was first settled in the late 1830s when George and Horace Wood established a sawmill and corn-cracker to serve the small farms of southern Van Buren County and the northern portion of nearby Scotland County, Missouri. Within a decade the Woods were joined by several other businesses. At first, the small village had no official name and was often referred to as &quot;Dogtown&quot; by the early residents. This came from the fact that nearly every farmer who came to the mill brought at least two or three dogs along, and also from the fact that Horace Wood had three hounds who loved to devour the corn meal as it left the grinder.

Other early names for the village were Wood&#x27;s Mill and Union Corners until finally Mount Sterling was selected. A steam-powered flour mill was erected in 1855, but the lack of business forced ts closure and relocation to Keokuk, Iowa in 1861. Other industry and business included a distillery, a second sawmill, a barrel hoop factory, a blacksmith, several general mercantile stores, a shoemaker and a lumber yard. In addition to establishing the first sawmill, George Wood also built and operated the town&#x27;s first inn and served as the area&#x27;s first postmaster. The first child born in the town was to Dr Joel Knight, a purveyor of a patent medicine product known as &quot;Dr Joel Knight&#x27;s Celebrated Screw Auger Pills.&quot; The first school was built in the area in 1841.

Mount Sterling never exceeded more than 300 residents. After incorporation in 1907, the town reported a peak population of 232 souls in the 1910 U.S. Census. The population of the town and surrounding farms continued to dwindle throughout the 20th century, particularly after World War II, leading to business closures. Mount Sterling became something of a bedroom community with residents forced to find work in larger area towns like Keosauqua, Keokuk, and Fairfield Iowa. Current-day Mount Sterling has only two businesses, a bar &amp; grill and an auto repair shop, and a hunting lodge. The town made national news in 2003 after then-Mayor Jo Hamlett proposed an ordinance that would fine residents and visitors for lying. Although in made in jest, the proposal pointed out the chronic lack of cash in a town whose yearly budget never exceeded $5,000. The story of the ordinance was covered by news outlets as far away as Australia.

In April 2012 the Mount Sterling city council voted to disband the town, the first Iowa town to take such a step since 2005. No candidates filed to run for Mayor or city council in the November 2011 election, prompting the vote to become an unincorporated area of Van Buren County. The county government will take over all street maintenance and the towns street lights will be discontinued. The towns&#x27; sewer system will continue to be operated by the county. The city officially became unincorporated on November 11, 2012, when the Community Development Board of the Iowa Economic Development Authority voted unanimously to accept the city&#x27;s resolution of discontinuance.

Chillicothe was laid out in 1849 and was incorporated in 1881.

The word &quot;Chillicothe&quot; is derived from the ancient Shawnee Indian words meaning &quot;Principal Place.&quot; It was the name for one of their clans.

It was the capital city of the Shawnees until the death of the chief. Then, the capitol would move to the home village of the next main chief. That village would then become Chillicothe.

<text>Ottumwa ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Wapello County, Iowa, United States. The population was 25,529 at the time of the 2020 U.S. Census. Located in the state&#x27;s southeastern section, the city is split into northern and southern halves by the Des Moines River.

==History==

The city&#x27;s name derives from the Native American Meskwaki language, translating to &quot;tumbling waters&quot; in reference to the Appanoose Rapids on the Des Moines River.

In May 1843, several investors formed the Appanoose Rapids Company and staked claim to 467 acres of land in the present site of Ottumwa. Their colonization involved claiming land supporting three indigenous settlements. The first official cabin was built in May 1843 after the area was opened to settlement (an earlier cabin built in defiance of this date was destroyed by Army troops at that time). The original platt was titled Louis Ville. In 1844 the city was named as the county seat.

The town was severely damaged during the flood of 1851.

In 1857, coal was being mined from the McCready bank, a site along Bear Creek four miles west of Ottumwa. In 1868, Brown and Godfrey opened a drift mine four miles northwest of town. By 1872, Brown and Godfrey employed 300 men and had an annual production of 77,000 tons. In 1880, the Phillips Coal and Mining Company opened a mine two miles northwest of town. In subsequent years, they opened 5 more shafts in the Phillips and Rutledge neighborhoods, just north of Ottumwa. The Phillips number 5 shaft was deep, with a 375-HP steam hoist. By 1889, the state mine inspector&#x27;s report listed 15 mine shafts in Ottumwa. In 1914, the Phillips Fuel Company produced over 100,000 tons of coal, ranking among the top 24 coal producers in the state. Coal mining was so important to the local economy that, from 1890 to 1892, the Coal Palace was erected in Ottumwa as an exhibition center.

John Morrell &amp; Company and their meat packing comples played a significant role in the development of Ottumwa from 1877 to 1973.

When the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad arrived in Ottumwa in September 1859, it ran parallel to the river channel. The availability of rail transportation encouraged both commercial and industrial expansion along the northwest to southeast axis. Access to the south bank of the river at first was by ferry from the foot of Green Street. By 1875 this ferry had been replaced by a bridge, and a number of additions had been made to the city during the first thirty years, all located on the north side of the Des Moines River. As development (almost exclusively residential) climbed the bluffs, the streets on top of the hills were laid out to compass points, rather than parallel to the river. Although there was some development on the south side of the river, South Ottumwa was not brought into the city limits until the 1880s.

===Presidential visits===
Visits by a sitting U.S. president include:
* Benjamin Harrison in 1890; toured the Coal Palace and spoke to a crowd of over 40,000.
* Theodore Roosevelt in 1903; made a brief train stop while travelling the United States.
* Harry Truman in 1950; while on a 16-state train trip in support of his Fair Deal.
* Richard Nixon in 1971; arrived in Air Force One at the Ottumwa Industrial Airport to dedicate the nearby Rathbun Lake dam and reservoir. Nixon had been stationed at the Ottumwa airport while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II.
* Barack Obama in 2010; spoke at Indian Hills Community College.

==Geography==

Northeastern Wapello County contains large deposits of coal, and there are also large deposits of clay in the region, which played an important role in the industrial development of Ottumwa.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways====
Iowa Highway 92 runs east and west through the city and crosses US Highways 65 and 69 southeast of the central business district.

====Railroads====

Indianola no longer has railroad service. At one time, it served as a terminus for a branch line of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad which came off the CB&amp;Q mainline at Indianola Junction, which was four miles west of Chariton. There was a brick and stucco depot that stood across the tracks from the Rock Island depot. This line was abandoned in the early 1960s.

The other railroad was the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, which branched off a branch line from Carlisle, which is just southeast of Des Moines, to Summerset Junction, a few miles north of Indianola and on into Winterset. The Winterset to Summerset Junction portion of the line was discontinued in the early 1960s, leaving the Indianola to Carlisle line in place. There was a brick Rock Island depot just to the west of US Highway 65 &amp; 69 in the center of Indianola. This line maintained sporadic service until the Rock Island went bankrupt in 1980. The line was then operated by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad until the early 1990s, at which point the line was abandoned back to Carlisle. The line was converted to the Summerset Trail from Indianola to Carlisle after abandonment.

The Rock Island and CB&amp;Q lines both came in from the east and paralleled each other as they came into Indianola. They could interchange cars and there was at one point, first class Pullman passenger trains came down the Rock Island and then moved to the CB&amp;Q railroad to Chariton and on to St. Joseph, Missouri. The Rock Island purchased a portion of the CB&amp;Q after it was abandoned. Freight cars were sometimes stored there.

====Air service====
Scheduled passenger service and general aviation services are provided by Des Moines International Airport, which is 13 miles northwest of Indianola. There are two privately owned airports near Indianola: Nash Field is four miles south of Indianola and is open to the public. Laverty Field is three miles north of Indianola and requires prior permission to land.

<text>Norwalk is a city in Warren County, with some small portions extending into Polk County, in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 12,799 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is part of the Des Moines metropolitan area and is located just south of the Des Moines International Airport.

==History==

===Early history===

The first settlers came to Norwalk area about 1846. One of them, Samuel Crow, settled near the North River. The first construction on the site that is now Norwalk began with a log cabin built by Samuel Snyder. The following year more families settled in the little town known as Pyra. A post office was established in the town on June 18, 1856. George W. Swan laid out the town and erected a hotel. Mr. Swan, who was born in Norwalk, Connecticut and was associated with a newspaper in Norwalk, Ohio, changed the town&#x27;s name to Norwalk. The first railroad into town was constructed in 1882 a narrow gauge line from Des Moines to Cainsville, Missouri. In the 1890s the railroad was acquired by a subsidiary of the Burlington Railroad and was widened to standard gauge. Its primary use was for shipping the farmers’ livestock to various markets. The line was abandoned in 1947, after a flood had severely damaged the North River bridge.

===20th century===

Norwalk was incorporated in 1900 with Adam Stiffler serving as its first mayor. At the time, the town was one square mile in size. Phone service was introduced in Norwalk in 1903. Many additions and land acquisition have contributed to Norwalk&#x27;s growth. The first was the triangle formed by Highway 28, High Road and Cherry Parkway on November 11, 1969. The second was the development of a residential area in what is now the middle of town containing the Norwalk United Methodist Church and the Regency Nursing Home. Several farm annexations were made in the 70s and 80s that greatly expanded the city&#x27;s footprint. Further annexations continue to this day as the city seeks to maximize its economic growth potential. Norwalk is regionally notable as having three golf courses, two of which sit amidst residential developments, Echo Valley and the Legacy.

===21st century===
On March 5, 2022, an EF4 tornado struck the city (albeit at a slightly weaker strength), damaging multiple homes and facilities.

===Neighborhoods and development areas===

Lakewood

On April 1, 1989, the neighborhoods of Lakewood and Echo Valley Estates were annexed into Norwalk. The original Lakewood development was started in 1965 around the man-made Lake Colchester. The south shore of the lake is home to nearly 600 residences and the north side is being heavily marketed for its future development potential.

Echo Valley

The Echo Valley development began in the early 1970s, consisting primarily of residential properties intermixed with the Echo Valley Country Club golf course. Generally considered one of the more upscale areas of town, Echo Valley has emerged as the 2017 host of the Home Builders Association of Greater Des Moines&#x27; Home Show Expo, drawing thousands of visitors to Echo Valley.

The Legacy

The Legacy golf course community incorporating what used to be called the Colonial Meadows development, contains 18 PGA caliber golf holes, over 900 residences suitable to a wide range of housing budgets, and an increasing variety of commercial opportunities for what has become the geographic center of the city. The development incorporates commercial development along Iowa Highway 28 and a regionally unique circular central road which will be completed in 2018.

Rolling Green and Warrior Run

The southeast portion of the city contains the Warrior Run golf course as well as several residential developments that will add hundreds of housing units to the city. Rolling Green will consist of some 250 plus homes, and the Warrior Run Estates development area will add at least a further 100.

McAninch Sports Complex and Norwalk Business Center

A combined development proposal established the McAninch Sports Complex, host to softball, baseball, and soccer events, as well as the Norwalk Business Center, home to multiple industrial users such as meat processing, stone cutting, building materials wholesale, and electronics manufacturing. Windsor Windows is constructing a 160,000+ square foot manufacturing center in the southernmost portion of the business park. Recently, Michael Foods announced the construction of a distribution center which will add $85 million of investment in the city and will be the largest single-site taxpayer in Warren County.

<text>Brighton is a city in Washington County, Iowa, United States. It&#x27;s part of the Iowa City, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 600 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Brighton was laid out in 1840. During the 1840s and 1850 quickly developed into one of the largest centres of hog production west of the Mississippi. In 1851, David Powers discovered the fossil remains of a Mastodon. The fossil was three and a half feet long, fourteen inches wide at the larger end, and weighed eighty-three pounds. In 1854 Brighton was sorely afflicted by the Cholera.

In 1882, the Iowa Central Railway and the narrow-gauge Burlington and Western Railway battled for right-of-way as they built west from Coppock toward Brighton. At several points, crews for the rival railroads tore up tracks the other had put down. The line through Brighton was originally platted as a street, 3 blocks south of the business district. The B&amp;W reached Brighton in mid 1882 and claimed the entire street as its right-of way. After vandalism, arrests and court battles, the two lines built parallel tracks down the street (with the B&amp;W claiming the center line) to their crossing west of town. This has been described as the Brighton Railroad War. Both lines crossed the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad on the east side of town. The Burlington and Western was later widened and taken over by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy and the Iowa Central was taken over by the Minneapolis and St. Louis.

There were three railroad depots in town. The Burlington and Western (after 1902, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy) depot was on the east side of town, at the south end of Liberty St. The Iowa Central (after 1901, the Minneapolis and St. Louis) depot was on the west side, between Mechanic St. and Harrison St. The Rock Island depot was several blocks south, also between Mechanic and Harrison. The Rock Island had a stockyard west of its depot, while the Burlington and Western stockyard was east of its depot.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Brighton is located where Iowa State Road 78 and Iowa State Road 1 meet and is located near the Skunk River and near Lake Darling State Park.

<text>Amiga E is a programming language created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the Amiga computer. The work on the language started in 1991 and was first released in 1993. The original incarnation of Amiga E was being developed until 1997, when the popularity of the Amiga platform dropped significantly after the bankruptcy of Amiga intellectual property owner Escom AG.

According to Wouter van Oortmerssen:&quot;It is a general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga implementation is specifically targeted at programming system applications. [...]&quot;In his own words:&quot;Amiga E was a tremendous success, it became one of the most popular programming languages on the Amiga.&quot;

== Overview ==
Amiga E combines features from several languages but follows the original C programming language most closely in terms of basic concepts. Amiga E&#x27;s main benefits are fast compilation (allowing it to be used in place of a scripting language), very readable source code, flexible type system, powerful module system, exception handling (not C++ variant), and Object-oriented programming.

Amiga E was used to create the core of the popular Amiga graphics software Photogenics.

== &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example ==
A &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in Amiga E looks like this:
==History==

1993: The first public release of Amiga E; the first release on Aminet was in September, although the programming language source codes were published on the Amiga E mailing list at least since May.

1997: The last version of Amiga E is released (3.3a).

1999: Unlimited compiler executable of Amiga E is released.

1999: Source code of the Amiga E compiler in m68k assembler is released under the GPL.

==Implementations and derivatives==

=== Discontinued ===

==== Amiga E ====
The first compiler. It was written by Wouter van Oortmerssen in the m68k assembler. It supports tools that are written in E. The compiler generates 68000 machine code directly.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS and compatibles.
:*Targets: Originally AmigaOS with 68000 CPU, but has modules that can handle 68060 architecture.
:*Status: Stable, mature, discontinued, source available, freeware.

==== CreativE ====
It was created by Tomasz Wiszkowski. It is based on the GPL sources of Amiga E and adds many extensions to the compiler.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS and compatibles.
:*Targets: Like Amiga E, plus some limited support for the last generations of m68k CPUs.
:*Status: Stable, mature, discontinued in 2001, source available, freeware.

<text>Kalona is a city in Washington County, Iowa. It is part of the Iowa City metropolitan area. The population was 2,630 at the time of the 2020 census. Kalona is the second-largest city in Washington County.

==History==

Amish settlement in what is now the Kalona area began in the 1840s, placing the Amish among the first European settlers in the area. The split between Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites occurred in the 1860s in most places, but it was not until the 1880s that the formal split occurred in Iowa, even though a process of sorting out between conservatives and change-minded Amish had begun a decade earlier or so in Iowa. Most Amish Mennonites later assimilated and lost their Amish identity. The Beachy Amish broke away from the Old Orders in the 1920s.

The Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway built a 66-mile branch from Iowa City to What Cheer via Kalona in 1879.

Kalona was established by the railroad on August 6, 1879. The name was suggested to the railroad by a Mr. Myers, who owned a bull of that name. The town remained unincorporated until 1890.

Kalona is home to a burgeoning craft, antiques, and local products industry. Its proximity to both Iowa City, Iowa and a large Amish settlement have allowed growth in population and industry in recent years. The town is home to a variety of locally owned shops and restaurants. The city centers around the historic old town business section of Kalona, which features many local businesses that are popular with tourists.

==Geography==

Not far from Kalona is located one of the largest Amish settlements west of the Mississippi with eleven church districts and a population of roughly 1,200 people. It is the oldest in Iowa, founded in 1846. The Kalona New Order Amish affiliation is one of the most liberal concerning the use of technology, allowing even tractors for field work. Kalona is the home of the Iowa Mennonite Archives, located at the Kalona Historical Village. Noah Troyer (1831–1886), one of the two &quot;sleeping preachers&quot; among the Amish Mennonites, lived three miles north of Kalona. The Iowa Mennonite School is located a few miles northwest of Kalona.

==Star Trek==
Gene Roddenberry, the creator of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, asserts in his book &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; that the character of James Tiberius Kirk was born in the state of Iowa. In &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, Kirk himself tells Dr. Taylor he is from Iowa.
In March 1985, when the city was looking for a theme for its annual town festival, Steve Miller, a member of the Riverside City Council who had read Roddenberry&#x27;s book, suggested to the council that Riverside should proclaim itself to be the future birthplace of Kirk. Miller&#x27;s motion passed unanimously.

This birthplace was confirmed as Star Trek canon in season 2, episode 3 of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; as when asked, Kirk states he was born in Riverside, IA. Additionally, at least two &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels had material based in the real city of Riverside. &quot;Best Destiny&quot;, an immediate sequel to the events shown in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, depicted Kirk&#x27;s childhood in Riverside. The novel&#x27;s opening chapter depicts a pre-teen Kirk, playing with friends in fields, in rushes and river wetland along the English River. Another novel, &quot;Final Frontier&quot; by Diane Carey, not to be confused with &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, was written as a prequel novel to the original series. Depicting the space adventures of James T. Kirk&#x27;s father, Commander George Samuel Kirk Sr., the opening and closing passages of the novel depict Captain Kirk, now an adult, mulling over his Starfleet career options shortly after his first five-year mission. The younger Kirk was also depicted, walking around the farmhouse owned by his family in Riverside. Its wrap-around veranda had views of both the English River and the Iowa River to the east, which mirror the site of the real &quot;Kirk&#x27;s Birthstone&quot; marker.

The 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, set in an alternate reality from the main &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, shows that Kirk was born aboard a shuttlecraft in space and raised in Iowa. Nearby are the (fictional) Riverside Quarry, where young Jim Kirk destroys a 20th-century Chevy Corvette in an act of vandalism, and the Riverside Shipyards, identified by name by Captain Christopher Pike as the construction site of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701), and an embarkation point for Starfleet Academy recruits, including an older Jim Kirk.

During a September 28, 2004, town meeting, the city learned that its residents had become the unwitting stars of a Spike TV reality show called &quot;Invasion Iowa&quot; inspired by the Kirk connection. Over a week earlier, actor William Shatner had arrived in the city under the guise of filming a science fiction movie called &quot;Invasion Iowa&quot;.

===Voyage Home Riverside History Center===
The Voyage Home Riverside History Center is also colloquially referred to as the &quot;Star Trek Museum&quot;. It houses &quot;Star Trek&quot; themed exhibits and memorabilia, including a time capsule; a &quot;Star Trek&quot; themed bathroom; and an exhibit about the women of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The museum features a veterans display and a room dedicated to the history of Riverside. The museum also has displays featuring Leonard Nimoy, the various &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television shows, NASA, William Shatner&#x27;s visit to Riverside, and others. Walter Koenig, who played Pavel Chekov in the original series, visited the Museum when it first opened on June 27, 2008, where he participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony.
