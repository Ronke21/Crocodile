The population of the CDP was 16,882 at the 2020 census, up from 15,379 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Agriculture===
Former Virginia agriculturalist Eugene Halstead of San Diego planted a crop of tobacco in Bostonia in 1896 and said later that the tobacco was &quot;superior in some respects to that of the Cuban plantations,&quot; one &quot;serious drawback&quot; to cultivation being the scarcity of rain in the area.

===Civic events===

In 1898, David G. Gordon was appointed postmaster in Bostonia to replace Joseph Donald, who had resigned. C.O. Graves held the office in 1903. In 1914, William M. Wright was appointed postmaster to replace R.W. Foffland, who had resigned.

In 1928, Murray Wright was president of the Bostonia Chamber of Commerce.

In that same year, civic leaders in Bostonia planned to name a local observation as &quot;Grape Day&quot; which led some in neighboring Escondido to complain that their city already had an event under the same name. They were mollified when Bostonians said they would call their event &quot;Home Products Day&quot; instead.

===Crime===
&quot;Firebugs&quot; believed by Sheriff Conklin to have been members of the Industrial Workers of the World, &quot;German sympathizers&quot; or &quot;disgruntled employees,&quot; torched the Meridian School building, a large packing house and two stables of the Bostonia Fruit Growers and Packers Association on October 6, 1917. Waste soaked in oil or phosphorus was found in what remained of the buildings, which burned to the ground.

====Shoot-out====

Sheriff&#x27;s deputies engaged in a short gun battle in Bostonia and captured a suicidal man who had threatened a bank in Lakeside, California, with ten pounds of dynamite and fled with his loot.

===Annexation===
In May 1953 residents of the southern portion of Bostonia approved annexation to the city of El Cajon, California, by a vote of 315 to 271.

===Swap meet===
In 1981 a group of Bostonia residents organized to complain about the disruption caused by historic El Cajon Swap Meet, reputedly the &quot;granddaddy of all the nation&#x27;s swap meets. They said the weekend operation had grown beyond the &quot;small-time affair it once was,&quot; turning the usually quiet area into a &quot;mob scene.&quot;

===Fire district and fires===
A petition was submitted in 1977 by owners of 112 acres within the 480-acre Bostonia Fire Protection District to secede and join the Santee district. It was denied by the Local Agency Formation Commission.

In 1986, a fire in nearby El Cajon killed two and injured five residents at a home for the aged despite the fact that it broke out only a hundred yards from a station within the Bostonia Fire Protection District.

The Bostonia firefighters were prevented from battling the blaze because the district had no mutual-aid agreement with El Cajon, whose firefighters arrived three minutes after the fire was reported. El Cajon Fire Chief Art Melbourne said that Bostonia firefighters did give help but declined to say exactly what it was.

El Cajon Fire Chief Roger House said that Bostonia was not part of any agreement because it did not meet the requirements for belonging, including round-the-clock staffing and a certain kind of equipment.

== Geography ==
The center of the community is near the intersection of North 2nd Street and Broadway in the city of El Cajon. Bostonia Street, the Bostonia Post Office, the former Bostonia Ballroom, Bostonia Elementary School and the Bostonia Fire Station are all within of this location and all, except the fire station, are within the city of El Cajon. This is the area identified on most maps as Bostonia. However, the census-designated place of Bostonia is entirely outside the city limits of El Cajon, in an unincorporated area of County. The CDP comprises most of unincorporated El Cajon north of Broadway and east of State Route 67, and a small area west of State Route 67. Mail sent to all parts of Bostonia is addressed to El Cajon.

According to the United States Census Bureau Bostonia is located at (32.821612, -116.949905). This is approximately one mile northwest of where the USGS places Bostonia, near the geographic center of the CDP. The CDP has a total area of , all land.

=== Ecology ===
Bostonia was home to numerous populations of &quot;Ambrosia pumila&quot;, a rare, clonal plant narrowly distributed in southern California and Baja California. Most populations of &quot;Ambrosia pumila&quot; in Bostonia grew on vacant lots, backyard strips, and gravel roads, and many since have been extirpated by development. Additionally, &quot;Artemisia palmeri&quot;, a sagebrush nearly endemic to San Diego County, was once found in the neighborhood. Other plants historically collected from Bostonia include &quot;Primula clevelandii,&quot; &quot;Sidalcea malviflora, Sisyrinchium bellum&quot; and &quot;Viola pedunculata&quot;.

<text>Carlsbad is a beach city in the North County area of San Diego County, California, United States. The city is north of downtown San Diego and south of downtown Los Angeles. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 114,746. Carlsbad is a popular tourist destination and home to many businesses in the golf industry.

==History==
Carlsbad&#x27;s history began with the Luiseño people (the Spanish name given to them because of their proximity to Mission San Luis Rey), as well as some Kumeyaay in the La Costa area. Nearly every reliable fresh water creek had at least one native village, including one called Palamai. The site is located just south of today&#x27;s Buena Vista Lagoon.

The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition of 1769, met native villagers while camped on Buena Vista Creek. Another Luiseño villages within today&#x27;s city of Carlsbad was a village at the mouth of the San Marcos Creek that the Kumeyaay called &#x27;Ajopunquile&#x27;. A Kumeyaay village that was visited by Portolá was Hakutl, in the Rancho Ponderosa area.

During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern portion of Carlsbad was granted as Rancho Agua Hedionda to Juan María Marrón.

In the 1880s, a former sailor named John A. Frazier dug a well in the area. He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier&#x27;s Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic).

To take advantage of the find, the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company was formed by a German-born merchant from the Midwest named Gerhard Schutte together with Samuel Church Smith, D. D. Wadsworth and Henry Nelson. The naming of the town followed soon after, along with a major marketing campaign to attract visitors. The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of citrus fruits, avocados and olives soon changed the landscape. By the end of 1887, land prices fell throughout San Diego County. However, the community survived on the back of its fertile agricultural lands.

The site of John Frazier&#x27;s original well can still be found at &quot;Alt Karlsbad,&quot; a replica of a German Hanseatic house, located on Carlsbad Boulevard.

In 1952, Carlsbad was incorporated to avoid annexation by its neighbor, Oceanside.

The single-runway Palomar Airport opened in 1959 after County of San Diego officials decided to replace the Del Mar Airport. The airport was annexed to the City of Carlsbad in 1978 and renamed McClellan-Palomar Airport in 1982 after a local civic leader, Gerald McClellan.

The first modern skateboard park, Carlsbad Skatepark, was built in March 1976. It was located on the grounds of Carlsbad Raceway and was designed and built by inventors Jack Graham and John O&#x27;Malley. The skatepark was closed in 1979, leaving Del Mar Skate Ranch, approximately 20 minutes away, as the nearest skatepark for residents such as Tony Hawk. The site of the original Carlsbad Skatepark and Carlsbad Raceway was demolished in 2005 and is now an industrial park. However, two skateparks have since been developed.

In March 1999, Legoland California was opened. It was the first Legoland theme park outside of Europe and is currently operated by Merlin Entertainments. Merlin Entertainments owns 70 percent of the shares, and the remaining 30 percent is owned by the LEGO group and Kirkbi A/S.

Carlsbad is home to the nation&#x27;s largest desalination plant. Construction of the Carlsbad Desalination Plant at Encina Power Station was completed in December 2015. Encina Power Station was demolished, despite efforts to preserve it as a historical landmark.

==Geography==

Frost is rare along the coast, but sometimes occurs in inland valleys in December and January. Summer is almost rain free, but overcast and cool with fog off the Pacific. While most days have mild and pleasant temperatures, hot dry Santa Ana winds bring high temperatures on a few days each year, mostly in the fall.

===Neighborhoods===
For city planning and growth management purposes, Carlsbad is divided into four distinct quadrants.

====Northwest quadrant====
The northwest quadrant of Carlsbad (ZIP code 92008) includes the downtown &quot;Village&quot;, &quot;The Barrio&quot;, and &quot;Olde Carlsbad.&quot; It was the first part of Carlsbad to be settled. Homes range from 1950s cottages and bungalows, 1960s ranch style houses, to elegant mansions on hills overlooking the ocean. It is also home to Hosp Grove Park, a grove of eucalyptus trees relatively untouched by development and now designated by the city for recreational use, in addition to the Buena Vista and Agua Hedionda Lagoons. It is located west of El Camino Real and north of Palomar Airport Road.

&quot;The Barrio&quot; area is near downtown Carlsbad bordered by Carlsbad Village Drive to the north, Tamarack Avenue to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the railroad tracks to the west. It was settled by Latinos in the early 20th century. It is the site of the Centro de Aprendizaje, a Spanish division of the Carlsbad City Library.

====Northeast quadrant====
This quadrant (ZIP code 92010) is located east of El Camino Real and north of Palomar Airport Road and consists mostly of single-family homes, with larger lots found in the older area known as Chestnut Hills and the newer developments around Calavera Hills.

The Northeast quadrant also contains the Lake Calavera Nature Preserve, a 110-acre space containing a 513-foot extinct volcano known as Mount Calavera. The preserve — notable for its small lake, wide dam, and mountain — was officially set aside in the 1990s as the surrounding land was being developed. The preserve is bordered on three sides by suburban single-family homes, and on one side by small farms and rural compounds. In 2012, Sage Creek High School was developed in the southwest corner of the preserve amid some controversy. Nature experts challenged the decision to construct the school on the preserve, but Carlsbad High School was reaching its capacity and there were few undeveloped areas that had sufficient space for an additional high school. Despite missing one of its original corners, the preserve still offers miles of hiking trails with ocean views.

====Southeast quadrant====
The southeast quadrant (ZIP code 92009) is located east of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road and features several newer expensive master-planned communities set among hillsides, golf courses, Alga Norte Community Park and permanent open spaces. It includes Bressi Ranch and the La Costa neighborhoods of Rancho La Costa, La Costa Ridge, La Costa Oaks, La Costa Greens, La Costa Valley, and Rancho Carillo. In 1965, La Costa gave its name to the Gold Medal Golf Resort, La Costa Resort and Spa, now known as Omni La Costa Resort &amp; Spa. Residents here are served by the Carlsbad Unified School District, San Marcos Unified School District and the Encinitas Union School District.

====Southwest quadrant====
This quadrant (ZIP code 92011) extends along the Pacific Ocean to the south of the center of Carlsbad. It includes the Aviara neighborhood, which is home to the Park Hyatt Aviara Resort. It is located west of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road.

<text>Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is a census-designated place (CDP) in the East County region of San Diego County, California.

The CDP encompasses several unincorporated neighborhoods near the cities of El Cajon and La Mesa and the CDP of Spring Valley. Locations in the northern (Mount Helix) part of the CDP use La Mesa addresses, while locations in the southern (Casa de Oro) part use Spring Valley addresses. Informally, Casa de Oro is often considered to be a part of Spring Valley.

==History==
In 1872, after a scientist discovered a European snail (&quot;Cornu aspersum,&quot; formerly &quot;Helix aspersa&quot;) living on a small mountain, Rufus King Porter, the founder of what is now unincorporated Spring Valley, California, named the peak Mt. Helix. Then in 1885, the United States Postal Service rejected the use of two words for a post office name, so Rufus submitted just the name Helix and also became the first postmaster in Spring Valley; the Helix Post Office was operated out of his home.

Around this same time, Hubert Howe Bancroft came to the area. He bought the Porters&#x27; ranch and also acquired neighboring properties, accumulating about . He began calling his property &quot;Helix Farms.&quot; Bancroft hired workers to help develop Helix Farms, planting orchards and building structures for his ranch. By the early 1900s, Helix Farms was home to the largest olive ranch in southern California; some of the original olive trees can still be found today. Bancroft died in 1918, and eventually his family sold the property.

<text>Chula Vista ( ; , ) is a city in San Diego County, California, United States. It is the second-most populous city in the San Diego metropolitan area, the seventh-most populous city in Southern California, the 15th-most populous city in the state of California, and the 82nd-most populous city in the United States. The population was 275,487 as of the 2020 census, up from 243,916 as of the 2010 census. It is located in the South Bay, about halfway——between the two downtowns of the San Diego–Tijuana region. Chula Vista is named for its scenic location between San Diego Bay and coastal mountain foothills.

The area, along with San Diego, was inhabited by the Kumeyaay before contact from the Spanish, who later claimed the area. In 1821, Chula Vista became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the United States in 1848 as a result of the Mexican–American War, and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.

Founded in the early 19th century and incorporated in October 1911, fast population growth has recently been observed in the city. The city is home to the Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center, Sesame Place San Diego, North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre, Chula Vista Marina, and the Living Coast Discovery Center.

==History==

===Early history===
Fossils of aquatic life, in the form of a belemnitida from the Jurassic, have been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista. It is not until the Oligocene epoch that land life fossils have been found; although Eocene epoch fossils have been found in nearby Bonita. It is not until 10,000 years ago that human activity has been found within the modern borders of Chula Vista, primarily in Otay Valley of the San Dieguito people. The oldest site of human settlement within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista, was named Otai by the Spanish in 1769, and had been occupied as far back as 7,980 years ago. Another place where humans first settled within the modern boundaries of Chula Vista was at the Rolling Hills Site, which dates back to 7,000 years ago.

In 3000 BC, people speaking the Yuman (Quechan) language began moving into the region from the Lower Colorado River Valley and southwestern Arizona portions of the Sonoran Desert. Later the Kumeyaay tribe came to populate the land, on which the city sits today, and lived in the area for hundreds of years. The Kumeyaay built a village known as &quot;Chiap&quot; (or &quot;Chyap)&quot; which was located by mudflats at the southern end of South Bay.
In 1542 AD, a fleet of three Spanish Empire ships commanded by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, sailed into San Diego Harbor. Early explorations by Spanish conquistadors, such as these, led to Spanish claims of the land. The village of Chiap (known to the Spanish as La Punta) became a center of a Kumeyaay revolt against the Spanish in 1775, which was later abandoned by 1776. The historic land on which Chula Vista sits became part of the 1795 land grant known as Rancho del Rey or The King&#x27;s Ranch. The land eventually was renamed Rancho de la Nación.

After Mexico became independent from Spain, what is now Chula Vista became part of Alta California. Beginning in 1829, the land that is now Chula Vista was divided among Rancho Janal, Rancho Otay, Rancho de la Nación and Rancho La Punta; these were owned by José María Estudillo, José&#x27;s sister Maria, John (Don Juan) Forster, and Santiago E. Argüello respectively.

During the Mexican–American War, California was claimed by the United States, regardless of the California independence movement that had briefly swept the state. Though California was now under the jurisdiction of the United States, land grants were allowed to continue in the form of private property. In 1873, the United States Army built a telegraph line between San Diego and Fort Yuma which ran through Telegraph Canyon in Chula Vista; its construction was under the command of Captain George F. Price of the 5th Cavalry Regiment out of Camp McDowell. In the 1870s and 1880s mining was done on Rancho Janal.

The San Diego Land and Town Company developed lands of the Rancho de la Nación for new settlement. The town began as a five thousand acre development, with the first house being erected in 1887; by 1889, ten houses had been completed. Around this time, the lemon was introduced to the city, by a retired professor from the University of Wisconsin. Chula Vista can be roughly translated from Spanish as &quot;beautiful view&quot;; the name was suggested by Sweetwater Dam designer James D. Schulyer.

The 1888 completion of the dam allowed for irrigation of Chula Vista farming lands. Chula Vista eventually became the largest lemon-growing center in the world for a period of time. , the oldest surviving buildings in Chula Vista originate from around this time, including the Barber house, and the Cordrey house. In 1889, the city became home to the first watch factory west of the Mississippi River. Additionally, the Coronado Belt Line Railroad was built through Chula Vista, connecting Hotel Del Coronado with National City, where Southern California Railroad terminated. Another railroad built through Chula Vista, was the National City and Otay Railroad, which was routed down Third Avenue. During the depression at the end of the century, industrial employment in Chula Vista was limited to the La Punta Salt Works and packing houses.

===20th century===
In 1911, Chula Vista had of agricultural lands, of which were lemon groves. The citizens of Chula Vista voted to incorporate on October 17, 1911. The State approved the city&#x27;s incorporation in November. One of its first city council members was a former Clevelandite Greg Rogers, who was also a leader of the Chula Vista Yacht Club. The yacht club would the first on the West Coast to build race specific boats, which resulted in a uniquely designed sloop. In 1915, a Carnegie Library was built on F Street. In the 1910s, Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican farm laborers worked the fields within the city, with most commuting in from downtown San Diego and Logan Heights.

In January 1916, Chula Vista was impacted by the Hatfield Flood, which was named after Charles Hatfield, when the Lower Otay Dam collapsed flooding the valley surrounding the Otay River; up to fifty people died in the flood. Later in 1916, the Hercules Powder Company opened a 30-acre bayfront site, now known as Gunpowder point, which produced substances used to make cordite, a gun propellant used extensively by the British Armed Forces during World War I. In 1920, San Diego Country Club opened in Chula Vista, with its clubhouse designed by Richard Requa who had previously worked on the California Pacific International Exposition. In 1925, aviation began in Chula Vista, with the Tyce School of Aviation, operating the Chula Vista Airport. In 1926, the salt works purchased Rancho Janal and grew barley and lima beans.

Although the Great Depression affected Chula Vista significantly, agriculture still provided considerable income for the residents. In 1931, the lemon orchards produced $1 million in revenue and the celery fields contributed $600,000. Japanese American farms played a significant role in developing new crops outside of lemons, especially celery. In the 1930s, led by Chris Mensalvas, Filipino and Mexican farm workers went on strike against the celery farms. To the east, on land formerly known as Rancho Janal, dairy farming and cattle farming was done on over . By the end of the 1930s, the city&#x27;s population of over 4,000 residents was mostly Caucasian, with small populations of Japanese and Mexican Americans. Prior to World War II, anti-Japanese sentiment had existed in Chula Vista, due to competition between Japanese farmers and White farmers, however an association was formed which decreased those sentiments.

In November 1940, the city purchased the Chula Vista Airport for Rohr Aircraft. The relocation of Rohr Aircraft Corporation to Chula Vista in early 1941, just months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, changed Chula Vista. The land never returned to being orchard groves again. At the Rohr factory, the 11,000 employees worked on power units for the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In 1945, The Vogue Theater opened.

Due to Executive Order 9066, the Japanese Americans who lived in Chula Vista were sent to Santa Anita Racetrack and then to the Poston War Relocation Center. One of those Japanese Americans from Chula Vista was Joseph K. Sano, who was an air corps veteran of World War I, and a member of the American Legion; during World War II, Sano served in the Military Intelligence Service Language School at the University of Michigan. In 1944, the state of California attempted to seize land in Chula Vista owned by Kajiro Oyama, a legal Japanese resident who was then interned in Utah. Oyama was correctly charged with putting the property in his son Fred&#x27;s name with the intent to evade the Alien Land Law because Fred was a native-born citizen. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court as &quot;Oyama v. California&quot;, where the court found that Kajiro&#x27;s equal protection rights had been violated.

The population of post–World War II Chula Vista tripled from 5,000 residents in 1940 to more than 16,000 in 1950. After the war, many of the factory workers and thousands of servicemen stayed in the area, resulting in the huge growth in population. The last of the citrus groves and produce fields disappeared as Chula Vista became one of the largest communities in San Diego County. In 1949, the city limits of Chula Vista expanded for the first time. Due to the construction of the Montgomery Freeway, the Arguello Adobe of Rancho La Punta was demolished. In 1955, the Big Ski Drive-In opened; until it closed in 1980, it was one of the largest drive-in theaters in the nation. By the 1960s, Chula Vista continued its expansion with the annexation of part of Bonita. That same decade, Filipinos and Mexicans began to move into Chula Vista in significant numbers; these included Filipino navy veterans. In 1963, Chula Vista became the 2nd-most populous city in San Diego County. From 1960 to 2013, the South Bay Power Plant, a 700-megawatt, four-boiler plant, occupied of the Chula Vista waterfront.
In 1985, Chula Vista made the largest annexation in California history, which included the neighborhoods of Castle Park and Otay. In January 1986, Chula Vista annexed the unincorporated community of Montgomery, which had previously rejected annexation in 1979 and 1982. At the time of the annexation the community was virtually surrounded by its larger neighbor. Later, San Diego gave way, allowing Chula Vista to annex the Otay River Valley, which was opposed by residents in Otay Mesa and Nestor. Over the next few decades, Chula Vista continued to expand eastward. Plans called for a variety of housing developments such as the Eastlake, Rancho del Rey, and Otay Ranch neighborhoods. During this expansion a walrus fossil was found, of an extinct species of toothless &quot;Valenictus&quot;, after the species was named for the city. The quick expansion east of Interstate 805 was not embraced by all of the cities residents, leading to advocacy that new housing developments be built with parks, schools, and emergency services. In 1991, Chula Vista elected its first female mayor, Gayle McCandliss, who died from cancer a few weeks after being elected. In 1995, the United States Olympic Committee opened an Olympic Training Center in Eastlake on donated land; it is the USOC&#x27;s first master-planned facility and is adjacent to Lower Otay Reservoir. In the last decade of the century, a desalinization plant opened to process water from wells along the Sweetwater River; it was expanded less than two decades later, which included a pumping station built in Bonita.

====Camp Otay/Weber====
During World War I and II, the army maintained a base on the present-day corner of Main Street and Albany Avenue. It initially served as a border post during World War I, and was reestablished in December 1942. It was home to the 140th Infantry Regiment, 35th Infantry Division. The regiment conducted war games against the Camp Lockett–based 10th Cavalry, and were defeated. The base was closed in February 1944, and the division went on to see combat in the European theater. All traces of the post have since been removed.

===21st century===
In 2003, Chula Vista had 200,000 residents and was the second-largest city in San Diego County. That year, Chula Vista was the seventh fastest growing city in the nation, growing at a rate of 5.5%, due to the communities of Eastlake and Otay Ranch. Chula Vista is growing at a fast pace, with major developments taking place in the Otay Valley near the U.S. Olympic Training Center and Otay Lake Reservoir. Thousands of new homes have been built in the Otay Ranch, Lomas Verdes, Rancho Del Rey, Eastlake and Otay Mesa areas. In mid-2006, officials from Chula Vista and the San Diego Chargers met to discuss the potential construction of a new stadium that would serve as the home for the team; however, in June 2009, the Chargers removed Chula Vista as a possible location for a new stadium. The South Bay Expressway, a toll-road extension of State Route 125, opened on November 19, 2007.

As a result of the Mexican Drug War, many Mexicans from Tijuana began to immigrate to Chula Vista. Being in close proximity to Tijuana, however, has led to some drug war activity within Chula Vista.

In 2014, a survey conducted at the request of the city found that the majority of San Diegans surveyed had a negative perception of the city. By 2015, there were over 31,000 Filipino Americans living in Chula Vista; they make up the majority of the 48,840 Asian Americans who live in Chula Vista. In 2017, Chula Vista purchased the Olympic Training Center and renamed it to Elite Athlete Training Center; the United States Olympic Committee plans to continue to use the facility and pay rent to the city. That same year, a post office in the Eastlake neighborhood was renamed Jonathan &quot;J.D.&quot; De Guzman Post Office Building, in honor of a city resident who died while a San Diego Police Department officer in 2016; having immigrated from the Philippines in 2000, De Guzman was active in his community in Chula Vista, and went on to serve as a police officer for 16 years until his death.

The number of reported calls to the Chula Vista Police about issues regarding homeless individuals have increased from 2004 to 2014, with Chula Vista having the largest population of homeless individuals in the South Bay. In 2016, it was estimated that there were about 500 homeless individuals in Chula Vista. Due to the increase in homeless population, Chula Vista, and other neighboring cities began to pass ordinances on recreational vehicles, and other large vehicles, resulting in the number of homeless individuals within the city. By 2018, the number of homeless individuals in Chula Vista was down to 367.

In 2018, a proposal was made to develop Rohr Park into something similar to Griffith Park in Los Angeles. A development plan is to develop the bayfront.

In 2019, Chula Vista was the first city in California to be certified as a sanctuary city by the national non-profit &quot;Welcoming America.&quot; In December 2022, the &quot;Welcoming City&quot; designation was revoked due to concerns about its surveillance program. The Chula Vista Police Department was sharing license plate reader data with ICE and CBP.

==Geography==
Owning up to its Spanish name origins - &quot;beautiful view&quot; - Chula Vista is located in the South Bay region of San Diego County, between the foothills of the Jamul and San Ysidro Mountains (including Lower Otay Reservoir) and San Diego Bay on its east and west extremes, and the Sweetwater River and Otay River at its north and south extremes. The geography of Chula Vista is impacted by the La Nacion and Rose Canyon Fault zones; it has moved rocks from Pleistocene and younger eras. Yet, as late as 13,000 years ago, soils in the Rancho del Rey area have been unaffected by fault activity.

Chula Vista is the second largest city, by area, within San Diego County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers an area of , of it land, and or 4.73% of it water.

===Ecological preserves===
Chula Vista has within its city limits the Sweetwater Marsh unit of the San Diego Bay NWR. It also maintains several city maintained open space areas.

===Neighborhoods===

====West Chula Vista====
The original Chula Vista encompasses the area west of Hilltop Drive and north of L Street. The community of Montgomery was annexed by the city, after several failed attempts, in 1986; The community consists of most of the area south of L Street, west of Hilltop Drive and north of San Diego&#x27;s city limit. Unlike East Chula Vista, West Chula Vista does not have Mello-Roos, which has been suggested to have led to those not living in West Chula Vista to develop a separate civic identity.

====East Chula Vista====

Beginning in the late 1980s the planned communities of Eastlake, Otay Ranch, Millenia, and Rancho del Rey began to develop in the annexed areas east of Interstate 805 and California State Route 125. These communities expanded upon the eastern annexations of the 1970s, including the area around Southwestern College. In 1986, Eastlake began to be built. In 1989, Rancho del Rey was established. In 1999, Otay Ranch began to be built on .

Although &quot;Eastlake&quot; properly refers only to one planned community in east Chula Vista built around an artificial pond, the name is often used to encompass a much broader suburban region along the SR 125 corridor. This is in part due to the misconception that the lake which the name &quot;Eastlake&quot; refers to is the much larger Lower Otay Reservoir. Many businesses and institutions throughout east Chula Vista use &quot;Eastlake&quot; in their names.

In the years around 2008 thousands of Tijuana&#x27;s elite bought houses in and moved to east Chula Vista escaping violence, kidnapping and other crime taking place during that period in the Mexican metropolis only a few miles away. The Los Angeles Times wrote, &quot;So many upper-class Mexican families live in… Eastlake… and Bonita… that… the area is becoming a gilded colony of Mexicans, where speaking English is optional and people can breathe easy cruising around in their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.&quot; In late 2018, a new Rapid bus route was created, taking passengers from the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, through eastern Chula Vista, and then into downtown San Diego.

===Climate===
Like the rest of lowland San Diego County, Chula Vista has a semi-arid climate (BSk), with mediterranean characteristics, though the winter rainfall is too low and erratic to qualify as an actual Mediterranean climate.

With a moderate climate where the annual averages seldom oscillate much, there has still been a high and a low recorded since the station&#x27;s inception in 1918. In 1949, the maximum daytime temperature was just once, the lowest on record. Thanks to the maritime moderation, on average the coldest day is at a very mild . Summer nights are warmer than in coastal climates further north, but cooler than in the hot interior. The warmest low on record is in 2016, while the warmest average night between 1991 and 2020 stood at .

<doc id="108033" wikidata="Q828753" url="?curid=108033" title="Coronado, California">
<text>Coronado (Spanish for &quot;Crowned&quot;) is a resort city in San Diego County, California, United States, across San Diego Bay from downtown San Diego. It was founded in the 1880s and incorporated in 1890. Its population was 20,192 in 2020, down from 24,697 in 2010.

Coronado is a tied island which is connected to the mainland by a tombolo (a sandy isthmus) called Silver Strand. Along the coast of Southern California lie four islands that were spotted by Sebastian Vizcaino and his crew. They named them &quot;Los Coronados&quot;. In the mid-1880s, businessmen bought the peninsula near Los Coronados with hopes to turn it into a resort. Later in 1886, the owners of this peninsula hosted a naming contest with the people resulting in the name &quot;Miramar&quot; winning, which was soon overturned due to the public not being satisfied with the name, so they borrowed from their cousin islands &quot;Los Coronados&quot; and named it &quot;Coronado&quot;. The explorer Sebastian Vizcaino drew its first map in 1602. Coronado is the Spanish term for &quot;crowned&quot; and thus it is nicknamed &quot;The Crown City&quot;. Its name is derived from the Coronado Islands, an offshore Mexican archipelago. Three ships of the United States Navy have been named after the city, including .

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Coronado was inhabited by the Kumeyaay, who sustained fishing villages on the peninsula in North Island and on the Coronado Cays. As American settlers moved into the area, the Kumeyaay were pushed out of Coronado, with the last six Kumeyaay families deported to Mesa Grande Reservation in 1902.

Coronado was incorporated as a town on December 11, 1890. The community&#x27;s first post office predates Coronado&#x27;s incorporation, established on February 8, 1887, with Norbert Moser assigned as the first postmaster. The land was purchased by Elisha Spurr Babcock, Hampton L. Story, and Jacob Gruendike. Their intention was to create a resort community, and in 1886, the Coronado Beach Company was organized. By 1888, they had built Hotel del Coronado, and the city became a major resort destination. They also built a schoolhouse and formed athletic, boating, and baseball clubs.

In 1900, a tourist/vacation area just south of Hotel del Coronado was established by John D. Spreckels and named Tent City. Spreckels also became the hotel&#x27;s owner. Over the years, the tents gave way to cottages, the last of which was torn down in late 1940 or early 1941.

In the 1910s, Coronado had streetcars running on Orange Avenue. These streetcars became a fixture of the city until their retirement in 1939.

What is now the Naval Air Station North Island was the first US flying school, founded in 1911 by Glenn Curtiss. Curtiss was known for his
engines, which set records in distance and speed. He started with motorcycle engines, which led him to aviation. Coronado&#x27;s weather and protected bay were attractive and he gained a three-year lease to train military pilots. During this time he created a new type of ship-launched seaplane and an amphibious aircraft.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1937, during the Great Depression, the gambling ship SS &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;, known for &quot;drinks, dice, and dolls&quot;, was shipwrecked on the beach about a quarter mile (400 m) south of Hotel del Coronado.

In 1946, an African-American man from Coronado named Alton Collier was forced off of a San Diego and Coronado ferry by white sailors. The case was ruled a suicide until 2024, when the Equal Justice Initiative declared a lynching.

In 1969, the San Diego–Coronado Bridge was opened, allowing much faster transit between the cities than bay ferries or driving via State Route 75 along the Silver Strand. The bridge is made up of five lanes, one of which is controlled by a moveable barrier that allows for better traffic flow during rush hours. In the morning, the lane is moved to create three lanes going southbound towards Coronado, and in the evening it is moved again to create three lanes going northbound towards downtown San Diego.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; 7.9 square miles (20.5 km2) of the city is land and of it (75.72%) is water.

Geographically, Coronado is a tied island connected to the mainland by a tombolo known as the Silver Strand. The Silver Strand, Coronado and North Island, form San Diego Bay. Since recorded history, Coronado was mostly separated from North Island by a shallow inlet of water called the Spanish Bight. The development of North Island by the United States Navy prior to and during World War II led to the filling of the bight by July 1944, combining the land areas into a single body. The Navy still operates Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI or &quot;North Island&quot;) on Coronado. On the southern side of the town is Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, a training center for Navy SEALs and Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (SWCC). Both facilities are part of the larger Naval Base Coronado complex. Coronado has increased in size due to dredge material being dumped on its shoreline and through the natural accumulation of sand. The &quot;Country Club&quot; area on the northwest side of Coronado, the &quot;Glorietta&quot; area and golf course on the southeast side of Coronado, most of the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, most of the Strand Naval Housing, and most of the Coronado Cays (all on the south side of Coronado) were built on dirt dredged from San Diego Bay.

==Tourism==

Tourism is an essential component of Coronado&#x27;s economy. This city is home to three major resorts (Hotel del Coronado, Coronado Island Marriott, and Loews Coronado Bay Resort), as well as several other hotels and inns. The downtown district along Orange Avenue, with its many shops, restaurants and theaters, is also a key part of the local economy. Many of the restaurants are highly rated and provide a wide variety of cuisine choices.
Golf on Coronado started in 1897 with a nine hole golf course hosting the 1905 Southern California Open. Later, golf on Coronado migrated to a new site in the Southern portion of the island with 18 holes designed by Jack Daray Sr.. Golf is a popular diversion on the island, entertaining 90,000 golf rounds annually. 

In 2008, the Travel Channel rated Coronado Beach as the sixth-best beach in America.

==Hotel del Coronado==

Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft, as well as Muhammad Ali, Jack Dempsey, Thomas Edison, Magic Johnson, Charles Lindbergh, Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, Oprah Winfrey, and Robert Downey. Actresses Mary Pickford and Marilyn Monroe also stayed here.


&quot;The Del&quot; has appeared in numerous works of popular culture and was said to have inspired the Emerald City in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. It is rumored that the city&#x27;s main street, Orange Avenue, was Baum&#x27;s inspiration for the yellow brick road. Other sources say Oz was inspired by the &quot;White City&quot; of the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1893. Author L. Frank Baum would have been able to see the hotel from his front porch overlooking Star Park. Baum designed the crown chandeliers in the hotel&#x27;s dining room.

Once owned locally, Hotel Del Coronado is now owned by Blackstone (60%), Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (34.5%), and KSL Resorts (5.5%).

<text>Del Mar (; Spanish for &quot;Of the Sea&quot;) is a beach city in San Diego County, California, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Established in 1885 as a seaside resort, the city incorporated in 1959. The population was 3,954 at the 2020 census, down from 4,161 at the 2010 census.

The San Diego County Fair is an annual fair held at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. Horse racing is hosted at the Del Mar Racetrack every summer.

==History==

Del Mar was first settled in the early 1880s by Theodore M. Loop, a railroad official, and his wife Ella. Ella gave the site its name, inspired by Bayard Taylor&#x27;s poem &quot;The Fight of Paso del Mar&quot;. In 1885, Colonel Jacob Taylor purchased from Enoch Talbert, with visions of building a seaside resort for the rich and famous.

The United States Navy operated a Naval Auxiliary Air Facility for blimps at Del Mar during World War II.

Much of the population is on the coast and nearby bluff which are vulnerable to sea level rise caused by climate change. In 2019, the city refused to develop a managed retreat strategy for moving infrastructure and population centers from the water. This decision was made against the recommendation of the California Coastal Commission. Instead the city is planning on using other climate change adaptation strategies, such as seawalls and beach nourishment.

The Surf Line railroad tracks are adjacent to coastal bluffs some above the beach for . Coastal erosion eats away at the bluffs each year. The North County Transit District drove steel beams into the beach at the base of the bluffs in September 2020 to stabilize the face of the bluffs for 20 or 30 years. The city wanted to require the transit agency to cover the shotcrete wall on the bluff with natural soil and native plantings. The city council, the California Coastal Commission, and residents have opposed the district&#x27;s plans to install a chain-link fence that would stop pedestrians from crossing the tracks to get to the beach. The district considered this to be a safety issue as trespassers along the right-of-way have been hit by trains. This mile-and-a-half stretch (2.4 km) along the southern half of the city does not have legal access to the beach. Due to offshore reefs and wave patterns, this section has some of the best surfing in San Diego County.

In 2023, the city was out of compliance with the state Housing Element Law. They submitted a housing plan to the state that did not meet guidelines for future housing. They were working with the state to get in compliance, but until they did, they couldn&#x27;t block new housing projects based on city zoning laws alone.

==Geography==

Del Mar is one of only two locations where the Torrey pine tree naturally occurs. The Torrey pine is the rarest pine in the United States; only two populations of this endangered species exist, in Del Mar and on Santa Rosa Island. The Soledad Valley at the south of Del Mar severs two colony segments.

At the southern edge of Del Mar is the Los Peñasquitos Lagoon. To the north is the San Dieguito Lagoon and the San Dieguito River, which empties into the Pacific Ocean at Del Mar.

The bluffs along Del Mar&#x27;s south beach are subject to collapse. Properties on the bluffs are subject to the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and coastal erosion. The transportation infrastructure is under threat. The city has a climate change adaptation plan which excludes the option of a managed retreat, the strategy was recommended by the California Coastal Commission in 2019.

==Transportation==
The North County Transit District operates their BREEZE bus service. The historic Del Mar station once served passengers on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Surf Line and the Amtrak San Diegan intercity service between the early 1900s until its closure in 1995, due to the opening of the new Solana Beach Transit Center two miles north. That station provides Coaster commuter rail and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; service. This trainline is the second busiest passenger rail corridor in the United States.

The railroad tracks were built adjacent to coastal bluffs some above the beach. San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is conducting a $3 million study on relocating the rail line farther inland through the city. On August 16, 2020, the California Coastal Commission emphasized the need to move the railroad tracks inland due to the persistent coastal erosion which eats away at the bluff each year. The accelerating rate of sea level rise due to global warming adds urgency to the issue. A tunnel under Del Mar which would cost more than $3 billion is being considered.

<text>El Cajon ( , ; Spanish: El Cajón, meaning &quot;the box&quot;) is a city in San Diego County, California, United States, east of downtown San Diego. The city takes its name from Rancho El Cajón, which was named for the box-like shape of the valley that surrounds the city, and the origin of the city&#x27;s common nickname &quot;the Box&quot;.

==Name==

&quot;El Cajón,&quot; Spanish for &quot;the box&quot;, was first recorded on September 10, 1821, as an alternative name for &quot;sitio rancho Santa Mónica&quot; to describe the &quot;boxed-in&quot; nature of the valley in which it sat. The name appeared on maps in 1873 and 1875, shortened to &quot;Cajon&quot;, until the modern town developed, in which the post office was named &quot;El Cajon&quot;.

In 1905, the name was once again expanded to &quot;El Cajon&quot; under the insistence of California banker and historian Zoeth Skinner Eldredge.

==History==
During Spanish rule (1769–1821), the government encouraged settlement of territory now known as California by the establishment of large land grants called &quot;ranchos&quot;, from which the English word &quot;ranch&quot; is derived. Land grants were made to the Roman Catholic Church, which set up numerous missions throughout the region. In the early 19th century, mission &quot;padres&#x27; &quot;search for pastureland led them to the El Cajon Valley. Surrounding foothills served as a barrier to straying cattle and a watershed to gather the sparse rainfall. For years, the pasturelands of El Cajon supported the cattle herds of the mission and its native Indian converts.

Titles to plots of land were not granted to individuals until the Mexican era (1821–1846). The original intent of the 1834 secularization legislation was to have church property divided among the former mission Indians, but most of the grants were actually made to rich &quot;Californios&quot; of Spanish background who had long been casting envious eyes on the vast holdings of the Roman Catholic missions. In 1845, California Governor Pio Pico confiscated the lands of Mission San Diego de Alcala. He granted 11 square leagues (about ) of the El Cajon Valley to Dona Maria Antonio Estudillo, daughter of José Antonio Estudillo, &quot;alcalde&quot; of San Diego, to repay a $500 government obligation. The grant was originally called Rancho Santa Monica and encompassed present-day El Cajon, Bostonia, Santee, Lakeside, Flinn Springs, and the eastern part of La Mesa. It also contained the Rancho Cañada de los Coches grant. Maria Estudillo was the wife of Don Miguel Pedrorena (1808–1850), a native of Madrid, Spain, who had come to California from Peru in 1838 to operate a trading business.

With the cession of California to the United States after the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho El Cajon was filed by Thomas W. Sutherland, guardian of Pedrorena&#x27;s heirs (his son, Miguel, and his three daughters, Victoria, Ysabel, and Elenain) with the Public Land Commission in 1852, confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the grant was patented in 1876. In 1868, Los Angeles land developer Isaac Lankershim bought the bulk of the Pedrorena&#x27;s Rancho El Cajon holdings and employed Major Levi Chase, a former Union Army officer, as his agent. Chase received from Lankershim known as the Chase Ranch. Lankershim hired Amaziah Lord Knox (1833–1918), a New Englander whom he had met in San Francisco, to manage Rancho El Cajon. In 1876, Knox established a hotel there to serve the growing number of people traveling between San Diego and Julian, where gold had been discovered in 1869. Room and board for a guest and horse cost $1 a night. The area became known as Knox&#x27;s Corners but was later renamed. By 1878 there were 25 families living in the valley, and a portion of the hotel lobby became the valley post office with Knox as the first postmaster. The San Diego, Cuyamaca and Eastern Railway reached El Cajon in the 1880s.

El Cajon was incorporated as a city in 1912. For the first half of the 20th century, El Cajon was known for its grape, avocado, and citrus agriculture.

<text>Escondido (Spanish for &quot;Hidden&quot;) is a city in San Diego County, California, United States. Located in the North County region, it was incorporated in 1888, and is one of the oldest cities in San Diego County. It has a population of 151,038 as of the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
&quot;Escondido&quot; is a Spanish word meaning &quot;hidden&quot;. One source says the name originally referred to &quot;agua escondida&quot; or hidden water or valley; another says it meant &quot;hidden treasure&quot;.

==History==
The Escondido area was first settled by the Luiseño, who established campsites and villages along the creek running through the area. They named the place Mixéelum Pompáwvo or &quot;Mehel-om-pom-pavo.&quot; The Luiseno also had another village north of Mixéelum Pompáwvo called Panakare. The Kumeyaay migrated from areas near the Colorado River, settling both in San Pasqual Valley and near the San Dieguito River in the southwestern and western portions of what is now Escondido. Most of the villages and campsites today have been destroyed by development and agriculture.

===Spanish and Mexican eras===

Spain controlled the land from the late 18th century to the early 19th century, and established many missions in California to convert the indigenous people. When Mexico gained its independence from Spain, the local land was divided into large ranchos. Most of what is now Escondido occupies the former Rancho Rincon del Diablo (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Corner&quot;), a Mexican land grant given to Juan Bautista Alvarado (not the governor of the same name) in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena. Alvarado was a regidor of Los Angeles at the time, and the first Regidor of Pueblo San Diego. The southern part of Escondido occupies the former Rancho San Bernardo, granted in 1842 and 1845.

In 1846, during the Mexican–American War, the Battle of San Pasqual was fought southeast of Escondido. This battle pitted Mexican forces under Andrés Pico (brother of then-California-governor Pío Pico) against Americans under Stephen W. Kearny, Archibald Gillespie, and Kit Carson. A park in Escondido is named for Carson.

===American era===

The city was home to a largely Spanish-speaking population in the first census, taken in 1850 when California became a state. After statehood, non-Hispanic settlers came to Southern California in increasing numbers, many of them from the Midwestern states. The decade of the 1880s is known as the &quot;Southern California Land Boom&quot; because so many people moved to the state.

In 1853, pro-Southern Copperheads proposed dividing the state of California to create a new Territory of Colorado (at this time the territory that would become the state of Colorado was named &quot;Jefferson&quot;). San Diego Judge Oliver S. Witherby suggested placing the capitol of the new territory in Rancho Rincon del Diablo. He envisioned a railroad connecting San Diego to Fort Yuma through an area about two miles (3 km) south of the current Escondido site, heading east through San Pasqual. With a series of deeds in 1855 and 1856, the rancho was transferred from the heirs of Juan Bautista Alvarado to Witherby. He planned to profit from the town that he believed would be established from the dividing point on the railroad below the eastern hills. The proposal for splitting the state and creating the new territory passed in the California legislature, but died in Congress in the run-up to the Civil War. It was effectively killed in 1861 when Congress organized the Territory of Colorado in the area previously occupied by the Jefferson Territory. With Witherby&#x27;s vision of owning a bustling state capitol unrealized, he set up a mining operation on the rancho instead.

In 1868, Witherby sold the rancho for $8,000 to Edward McGeary and John, Josiah, and Matthew Wolfskill. McGeary owned half the rancho, while the three Wolfskill brothers each owned an equal share of the other half. John Wolfskill farmed sheep, horses, and cattle on the rancho for a number of years. Wolfskill had frequent conflicts with the Couts family, owners of the neighboring Guajome, Buena Vista, and San Marcos ranchos, over grazing lands and watering holes.

In October 1883, a group of Los Angeles investors purchased Rancho Rincon del Diablo. This group sold the land to the newly formed Escondido Company in 1884. On December 18, 1885, investors incorporated the Escondido Land and Town Company, and in 1886 this company purchased the area for approximately $100,000. Two years later, in 1888, Escondido was incorporated as a city; the vote was 64 in favor of cityhood with 12 votes against. The Santa Fe rail line was laid in the 1880s. The opening of U.S. Route 395 in 1930 boosted economic growth in Escondido.

Escondido was primarily an agricultural community, growing muscat grapes initially. After a dam was built in 1894–1895 to form what is known today as Lake Wohlford, orange and lemon trees were planted in large numbers, as were olive and walnut trees. By the 1960s, avocados became the largest local crop. Since the 1970s, Escondido has lost most of its agricultural land to housing developments, but still retains a significant agricultural presence in the San Pasqual Valley, including vineyards, citrus orchards, and avocado orchards.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it is water. The total area is 0.48% water.

Escondido is also bordered by San Marcos to the west and northern San Diego to the south.

The city contains several neighborhoods, including:
* Downtown Escondido centers on Grand Avenue between Centre City Parkway and the site of the old Palomar Hospital. The city&#x27;s general plan defines the Downtown Specific Plan Area as approximately bounded by Centre City Parkway on the west, Hickory and Ivy Streets on the east, Washington Avenue on the north, and Fifth Avenue on the south, with an additional narrow section extending west along Valley Parkway to Interstate 15. Downtown Escondido includes a mix of coffee shops, restaurants, assorted retail, art galleries, bakeries, a comedy club, and the newly renovated historic Ritz Theater.
*Old Escondido Historic District is bounded by Escondido Boulevard on the west, Chestnut Street on the east, Fifth Avenue on the north, and Thirteenth Avenue on the south. This area is made up of mostly single-family residential housing built in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the Victorian and Craftsman styles and is a 5- to 10-minute walk to Grand Avenue in Downtown Escondido.

The Escondido Creek bisects the city. It originates at the in the northeast, passes through downtown and leaves the city through the Harmony Grove area in the southwest before eventually emptying into the San Elijo Lagoon. The creek path through the city was developed into a concrete flood control channel in the 1960s. A Class I bicycle path runs along most of the channel&#x27;s length.

The community of Valley Center is located just northeast of Escondido. Valley View Casino, owned by the San Pasqual Band of Diegueno Mission Indians, is located in Valley Center.

===Dixon Lake===

Dixon Lake is located in the north of Escondido. It is a popular place for picnics, camping, and fishing. Dixon Lake has been granted an Aquaculture Permit by the State of California Department of Fish and Wildlife, so that fishing licenses are no longer required. However, all anglers eight years and older will need daily lake fishing permits, which are available at the concession stand. Throughout the year, the city keeps stocking different types of fish, which include bass, bluegill, carp, catfish, crappie, and trout. Each year the Trout Derby event is also hosted at Dixon Lake.

==Government==
===Local===

Escondido is governed by a council-manager system. The city council consists of a mayor and four City Council members. Along with the City Treasurer, they are elected at large to four-year terms. The current mayor is Dane White. Current City Council members are Consuelo Martinez, Jose M. Garcia, and Michael Morasco. The current City Manager is Sean McGlynn. The current City Treasurer is Douglas Shultz. The most recent election was held on November 8, 2022.

The city is particularly known for its positions on illegal immigration. Approximately half of the population is Hispanic, and then-council member Sam Abed estimated in 2006 that 35,000 people, or 25% of the city population, are undocumented. Since 2010 federal immigration officials have worked out of the Escondido police station in an unprecedented city-federal partnership. In 2006 the city council proposed and then abandoned an ordinance to punish landlords who rent to illegal immigrants. Due to a public outcry and legal challenges to that proposed housing ordinance, as well as the election of Diaz to the City Council, the council has ceased any overt measures against illegal immigrants. Council policies now focus on &quot;quality of life&quot; issues instead. Periodic police checkpoints are set up which randomly stop drivers to check drivers licenses, registration, and insurance. An overnight parking ordinance has been proposed that would limit the number of cars each household can legally park on city streets. The city is estimated to have lost as much as a quarter of its non-citizen population between 2006 and 2007; Latino activists attribute this to a perception of the city as hostile to immigrants.

The City of Escondido is a member of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG).

<doc id="108038" wikidata="Q823067" url="?curid=108038" title="New Jersey Route 54">
<text>Route 54 (known locally as 12th Street for much of its length) is a state highway located in Atlantic County in New Jersey, United States. It is considered to be a southern extension of U.S. Route 206 (US 206), running from an intersection with US 206 and US 30 in Hammonton south to an intersection with US 40 in Buena Vista Township. The road passes through the center of Hammonton before running into rural areas. It intersects US 322 and Route 73 in Folsom and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hammonton.

What is now Route 54 was originally legislated on March 30, 1938, to run from US 30/US 206 in Hammonton south to Main Road in Landis Township (part of present-day Vineland). The only part taken over as a state highway and designated Route 54 was north of US 40 in Buena, the proposed route south of this point remained as county-maintained Wheat Road. In 1953, Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment. A freeway was proposed along the Route 54 corridor in the late 1960s to connect the southern terminus of US 206 in Hammonton to Route 55 in the Vineland/Millville area; it was eventually canceled.

==Route description==

Route 54 begins at an intersection with US 40/County Route 557 (CR 557) and CR 619 on the border of Buena and Buena Vista Township. Known as Buena Hammonton Road, it proceeds north-northeast as a two-lane undivided road through agricultural areas, forming the border between Buena to the west and Buena Vista Township to the east. After fully entering Buena Vista Township and becoming 12th Street, the road reaches an intersection with CR 690 and makes a turn more to the northeast. At this point, Route 54 enters forested areas, with a few breaks for residences. Upon entering Folsom, the route passes over the Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line operated by the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad before coming to a cloverleaf interchange with US 322 (Black Horse Pike). After this interchange, the road comes to a crossroads with Route 73, which is signed as CR 561 Spur. Following this intersection, Route 54 heads through a mix of woods and farm fields as it enters Hammonton and reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway. In the area of this interchange, the route is a four-lane divided highway.
Past the Atlantic City Expressway, the two-lane undivided road comes to an intersection with CR 559. From this point, Route 54 is lined with residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton. The road crosses NJ Transit’s Atlantic City Line at-grade immediately before a junction with CR 561. After CR 561, the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of CR 542. As the road leaves the downtown area, the surroundings become more residential. Route 54 ends at an intersection with US 30 and US 206, where the road continues north as US 206.

==History==
By 1927, what is now Route 54 was an unnumbered, unpaved road connecting Buena to Hammonton. Route 54 was legislated on March 30, 1938, to run from US 30/Route 43 and US 206/Route 39 in Hammonton south along Lincoln Avenue to an intersection with Main Road in Landis Township, Cumberland County (now a part of Vineland). The only portion of Route 54 that was taken over as a state highway was north of the US 40/Route 48 intersection in Buena. The portion of Lincoln Avenue south of US 40 remained a county route called CR 25 in Cumberland County and CR 55 and CR 19 in Atlantic County. This road is presently both Cumberland and Atlantic CRs 655 and a part of Atlantic CR 619. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment between US 40 in Buena Vista and US 30/US 206 in Hammonton. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for the US 206/Route 54 corridor, running from US 30 in Hammonton south to Route 55 and the proposed Route 60 near Vineland and Millville. The freeway between Vineland/Millville and Hammonton was to cost $47 million and was intended to provide a better route between the two areas than the existing two-lane roads. This proposed freeway was never built due to environmental and financial issues.

<doc id="108040" wikidata="Q1279784" url="?curid=108040" title="Fallbrook, California">
<text>Fallbrook is a census-designated place in northern San Diego County, California. It had a population of 32,267 at the 2020 census. Fallbrook is immediately east of the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Camp Pendleton. It is known for its avocado groves and calls itself the &quot;Avocado Capital of the World&quot;.

==History==
The community of Fallbrook was first settled by the Payomkawichum people, later called Luiseños by the Spanish missionaries who were present in the area in the late 1700s. Large village sites and oak groves were established by the Luiseños. One site in particular became the area known today as Live Oak County Park.

The first permanent recorded settlement was during the Mexican period in 1846, when Ysidro Alvarado was granted Rancho Monserate by then governor of Mexican California, Pio Pico, who was residing to the west of Fallbrook where Camp Pendleton is currently located. Alvarado and Pico were second-generation Californians and San Diegans and were citizens of Mexico and the United States.

Rancho Monserate, a 13,323-acre grant stretched from the San Luis Rey River and Bonsall to the south to Stagecoach Lane and the Palomares house to the North to Mission Road to the west to Monserate Mountain to the east.

Pio&#x27;s nephew and local vaquero, Jose Maria Pico, had been residing in the area now known as the Fallbrook High School during the 1860 census and his family had registered to vote in October 1868, in time for the November presidential election, the first election after the Civil War ended.

The first known image of the area was an oil painting done by James Walker in 1870 called &quot;Roping the Bear at Santa Margarita Rancho&quot;, which depicts Mexican vaqueros capturing a grizzly bear.

Later, Canadian immigrant Vital Reche settled here with his family just north of Alvarado&#x27;s ranch at the site now known as Live Oak Park. They named the new community Fall Brook after their former homestead in Pennsylvania.

Oak trees were the original primary trees in Fallbrook. Furthermore, olives became a major crop by the 1920s and continued through World War II, but were eventually phased out in favor of the present avocado and floral industry.

Prior to 1949, Fallbrook was served by U.S. Route 395 until it was rerouted out of Fallbrook and onto an alignment near present-day I-15, which lasted until 1969. 

Incorporation votes occurred in 1981 and 1987, but both votes failed.

On October 21, 2007, wildfires broke out across San Diego county and other parts of Southern California. By October 23, the Rice Canyon Fire had crossed Interstate 15 and spread into the east area of Fallbrook along Reche Road, prompting a mandatory evacuation order for all residents. As of October 23, 206 homes, two commercial properties, and forty outbuildings had burned. These figures include over one hundred homes that burned in the Valley Oaks Mobile Home Park and Pala Mesa Village condos.

== History ==
===John Stewart Harbison===
John Stewart Harbison was born the third child of William and Margaret (Curry) Harbison, on a farm near Freedom, Pennsylvania, on September 29, 1826. 
He became a beekeeper in the tradition of his father, and later migrated to the west coast of the United States. After spending some years in other California locations, he eventually arrived in San Diego aboard the ship &quot;Orizaba&quot; with one hundred and ten colonies of bees on November 28, 1869. In the spring of 1874 he moved with his wife and daughter to a homestead near the Sweetwater River twenty-three miles east of San Diego in a small valley now known as &quot;Harbison Canyon&quot;. Within seven years time, he was the largest producer of honey in the world, operating two thousand to three thousand hives. At that time, having several hundred hives was considered a large operation.

His success in capitalizing on the vast honey potential of San Diego County, along with his extensive campaign of selling bees to the residents of the county was the major force in making San Diego County the greatest honey-producing county in the State of California by 1874, which in turn made California the leading honey producing state of the Union. John Harbison was a major contributor to the theory of bee culture with his development of new tools and methods that characterized the remarkable advances made in nineteenth century apicultural science. Harbison and his brother William were both important 19th century American authors on bee keeping science. Furthermore, he opened up the great retail markets east of the Mississippi River needed to absorb the tremendous honey crops produced in California. Harbison, known as the &quot;King of the Beekeepers&quot; died on October 12, 1912, in San Diego at the age of eighty-six.

===Fires===
Harbison Canyon was twice devastated by wildfires, first by the Laguna Fire in 1970 then again by the Cedar Fire on October 26, 2003, the worst firestorm in California history. The town lost 370 homes out of 420 in the community. Homes were still being rebuilt as recently as 2007. The community was bestowed considerable attention by the news media, which led to a visit within weeks by Governor Gray Davis, Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger, his wife Maria (Kennedy-Schriver) Schwarzenegger and President George W. Bush. The president arrived by helicopter which landed on the grounds of the Shadow Hills Elementary School.

The community received help in rebuilding from many organizations, most notably from the New York Says Thank You Foundation which was created in response to the tremendous support given to New Yorkers from people all over the United States after the September 11 attacks. Since 2003, the Harbison Canyon Lions Club has participated in numerous post-disaster rebuilding projects around the U.S. sponsored by the NYSTY Foundation.

== Attractions ==
Harbison Canyon, apart from its unfortunate encounters with wildfires, is best known amongst locals for Old Ironsides County Park, a 3.6-acre, shaded grove of trees maintained by the San Diego County Parks and Recreation Department. The park is located at 326 Harbison Canyon Road, El Cajon, CA 92020. Park hours are sunrise to sunset. The park has a playground, basketball court, picnic tables (some covered), restrooms, and a municipal hall for different community and civic groups to meet.

Ancient Kumeyaay relics have occasionally been found near the stream that runs through the park and canyon.

<doc id="108044" wikidata="Q917531" url="?curid=108044" title="Imperial Beach, California">
<text>Imperial Beach is a beach city in San Diego County, California, with a population of 26,137 as of the 2020 United States census. It is in the South Bay area of San Diego County, south of downtown San Diego and northwest of downtown Tijuana, Mexico. Imperial Beach is the southernmost city in California and the West Coast of the United States.

== History ==

Imperial Beach sits on the traditional territory of the Kumeyaay people, who had established the village of Alyshuwii. Founded in June 1887, the city takes its name from Imperial County, California, a desert climate east. Farmers and land owners from the Imperial Valley came to the area in the late 1880s seeking cooler weather during summer months. In March 1887, over 2,000 laborers descended upon nearby Coronado, California to construct the Hotel del Coronado, the largest resort in the world at the time. A large number of the workers stayed in Imperial Beach and some would later make it their permanent homestead. The city would incorporate in 1956, operating its own mayor–council government providing city fire department service and policing by the formation of its own police department but eventually, years later, through the contracting of services through the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

Imperial Beach has undergone a makeover to become more visitor-friendly and commercially viable. In 2004, the city began implementing a community redevelopment plan to improve the commercial corridor along Palm Avenue and Seacoast Drive. Aside from a few smaller hotels, Imperial Beach remains a highly residential city with little hotel or motel accommodation for visitors. On September 13, 2010, after many years of planning, demolition officially began on the old Seacoast Inn located off Seacoast Drive. Construction of a $22 million hotel called Pier South Resort was completed in the former Seacoast Inn&#x27;s place in December 2013, with the new facility offering 78-rooms across four stories plus a restaurant, bar, spa and conference facilities.

==Geography==
Imperial Beach is the most southwesterly located city in the continental United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (7.22%) is water. The city occupies the extreme southwest corner of the continental United States: bordered by Playas de Tijuana and Tijuana to the south, Coronado, California, and San Diego Bay to the north, San Diego to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Imperial Beach is located in San Diego County, the fifth most-populous county in the United States and part of the San Diego metropolitan area, the 17th largest metropolitan area in the United States with over 3 million people. It is also part of the San Diego–Tijuana region, the largest bi-national metropolitan area shared between the United States and Mexico with over 5 million people.
===Climate===

The city has a warm semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with summer temperatures often in the upper 70s °F (mid-20s °C) and winter temperatures in the 60s °F (15 to 20 °C). Because of the comfortable year-round temperatures, many homes in Imperial Beach are built without air conditioning. Imperial Beach often remains 10 degrees °F (5 degrees °C) cooler than inland areas of San Diego County in the summer, and 10 degrees warmer in the winter. The city is mostly or partly sunny 323 days of the year, with the wettest months in winter. As of 2006, the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; consistently ranked the area within the Top 10 Best Weather Cities in America. Scripps Institution of Oceanography operates a weather reporting station at the middle of the Imperial Beach Pier for sky condition, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind and water temperature data.

===Environment===


Imperial Beach marks the terminus of the Tijuana River watershed and is subject to changes that occur upriver. There have been numerous instances of beach closures and pollutant aerosolization within Imperial Beach as caused by untreated sewage or spills. Beaches have been closed since December 8, 2021.

According to Udasin, the water quality has degraded due to five hundred illegal discharges from the South Bay plant, which has leaked a billion gallons of raw sewage flowing into the Pacific Ocean. This has been causing businesses to lose money and negatively affecting inhabitants&#x27; health. Mexico is doing a poor job maintaining sewage from the Tijuana River valley. This sewage flows across the border into Imperial Beach. Taxpayers have been pleading for action but government officials refuse proper action. Imperial Beach pollution is ruining the livelihood of Imperial Beach residents.

<text>Julian is a census-designated place (CDP) in San Diego County, California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,768, up from 1,502 at the time of the 2010 census.

Julian is an official California Historical Landmark (No. 412). The Julian townsite and surrounding area is defined by the San Diego County Zoning Ordinance Section 5749 as the Julian Historic District. This designation requires that development adhere to certain guidelines that are administered by the Architectural Review Board of the Julian Historic District, which is appointed by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.

Julian was named an International Dark Sky Community by the International Dark-Sky Association in May 2021. It was the 30th such designation and the second in California.

The town is known for its apple pie and its annual Julian Apple Days Festival, which began in 1949.

==History==
===19th century: Initial European settlement and the gold rush===

The first European settlers were &quot;Cockney Bill&quot; Williams from England and John Wesley Horrell, who arrived in the area in 1850 or 1851. The town itself was first settled by Drury, Frank, and J.O. Bailey, all brothers; and their cousins, Mike and Webb Julian. They passed through the region in 1869 from San Bernardino en route to Arizona, in the wake of the American Civil War. Taken by the beauty of the Julian area, Drury Bailey interrupted the group’s travel plans and chose instead to settle here; he chose to name the settlement “Julian” after Mike Julian because “Mike was better looking” than any other member of the Bailey family. Julian was also a former Confederate soldier who was later elected San Diego County Assessor. Shortly afterwards gold was discovered in the Julian region. A tent city initially formed in the boomtown, followed by more permanent structures as it became apparent that gold mining in Julian would persist for some time. Victorian-style structures were constructed in the latest stage of Julian’s early settlement, including the Hoskins House.

After the American Civil War, in 1869, A.E. &quot;Fred&quot; Coleman, a former slave, crossed over what is now known as Coleman Creek just west of Julian. Seeing a glint of gold in the stream bed, he climbed down from his horse to investigate. Having had previous experience in the gold fields, he retrieved his frying pan and began panning the sands of the creek. Soon thereafter, Coleman established the Coleman Mining District and was its recorder and also began the mining camp called Emily City, later renamed Coleman City. Learning of the find, others rushed to the district and tried to trace the gold to its source. On February 22, 1870, the first &quot;lode&quot;, or hard rock, mining claim was filed in the Julian area. Since February 22 was President George Washington&#x27;s birthday, the mine was named the Washington mine. Soon hundreds of anxious men and families rushed to Julian to stake their claims. Julian experienced a gold rush and became a tent city overnight. In April 1870, the area&#x27;s first sawmill was set up and Julian began to take on a more permanent structure. Attempts to build rival mining towns at Coleman City, Branson City and Eastwood were defeated. Owners of the Cuyamaca rancho Land Grant claimed (the Cuyamaca Land Float) Julian, and its mines were within the Rancho boundaries. In 1873, the courts ruled that the Rancho did not include Julian and the mines. While the miners tried to wrestle the gold from deep within the earth, James Madison brought a wagon load of young apple trees into the mountains. The fruit trees flourished in the clear, fresh air. Apples are still a big product in Julian, many of which are used for making the world-famous Julian apple pies. Local historians have variably suggested that the Julian of 1873 rivaled San Diego in population and they unsuccessfully attempted to shift the county seat to the city.

According to a bronze historical plaque appearing in the town, in the early days of Julian, the majority of San Diego County&#x27;s Black population resided in or near the town, including the founders of the Robinson Hotel and a noted resident, America Newton, a freed slave who laundered miners&#x27; clothing. Of the 55 Black people living in San Diego County during the 1880 census, 33 lived in the Julian area.

===20th century===

In 1976, Julian approved a plan that required the exteriors of any buildings on Main Street be no younger in age than 1913. Many structures bear a Victorian architecture that predates this cutoff. In the 1970s, as many of 25,000 visitors visited the settlement per annum.

Julian had four or five wells in the 1970s. A county planner surveyed the water capacity for Julian and indicated that it was unlikely that Julian would ever have enough inexpensive water to sustain large-scale development. During a period of drought, the community of Julian was compelled by the San Diego County supervisors to obey a moratorium on development until a 30,000 gallon waste treatment plant could reduce the risk that a developing Julian’s sewage output might pollute the San Diego River. Julian’s water supply became largely dependent on a single well owned by a local property owner named Jerry Zweig, as the community’s water board-owned resources were depleted in a drought in the 1990s and were severely limited by contamination as a defunct Chevron station contaminated three of the eight publicly owned water wells into the late 1980s.

On May 29, 1989, Benjamin Haimes of Encino and Gustav Oran Hudson of El Cajon) disputed a claim to land to the Ready Relief and Hubbard Mines in Julian’s Chariot Canyon (historically owned by the Bureau of Land Management) over rights to an area where both had intentions to prospect for gold. Hudson and his family arrived at the property at a time when Haimes’ appointed caretaker (Chris Zerbe) and the caretaker’s friend (Joe Lopes) of Julian. The resulting escalation involved the replacement of a padlock at the Hubbard Mine by the Hudsons, conflicting accounts of alcohol use and escalative behavior by Zerbe, and a shootout in which Zerbe and Lopes (who did not fire) were ultimately killed. No charges were filed. Nicknamed the “Chariot Canyon Massacre,” these killings are understood to be the first gold prospecting-related killing in Julian since the gold rush of the late 1800s.

A controversy erupted in Julian in 1991 as the community lost its bid to resist the construction of fast food restaurants. Dairy Queen and Subway were the first to relocate into the town during this time. Zweig circumvented a community moratorium on new development (induced due to the town’s longstanding drought), agreeing to continue to sell 30,000 gallons of water a day in return for the waiver to build. Zweig, also the owner of the largest well in the community, allegedly threatened to cut off the community’s water supply unless they acquiesced. Neither business was supported by the community and both have since closed.

====Railroad====
In the 1960s, motion picture animator Ollie Johnston acquired and restored a full-size Porter steam locomotive originally built in 1901, named the &quot;Marie E.&quot; He then built the Deer Lake Park &amp; Julian Railroad (DLP&amp;J) at his vacation estate in Julian to run the locomotive with a small gondola and caboose pulling behind it, utilizing railroad ties from the defunct Viewliner Train of Tomorrow attraction in Disneyland. The &quot;Marie E.&quot; first ran in 1968. Johnston sold the vacation estate and the narrow gauge train in 1993, and the engine and its consist were sold, running one last time on the Disneyland Railroad during a private event.

===21st century===

The region around Julian was hit by a multi-year drought starting in 1999, leading up and into the catastrophic Cedar Fire of 2003 following an extremely wet 1997–1998 El Niño cycle. Residents of Julian reported drilling wells up to to strike water during this period, well over twice as deep as they have had to drill in the town’s history. This has also been controversially attributed to stressors from the development of weekend and holiday housing in the town by outsiders. Drought conditions were noted to have allowed the rise of beetle pests to consume Coulter pines in and around the community, as the pines do not have access to enough water to protect their trunks with sap. The drought-induced devastation of the Coulter pines due to the beetles has allowed some landowners in the Volcan Mountains to the immediate north of Julian to obtain exemptions from filing timber-harvest plans. These plans are normally required under the California Environmental Quality Act and effectively allow the state to regulate the logging practices exercised on a parcel of land, raising fears in Julian that overlogging might be technically permissible in light of the Coulter pine disaster.

In recent decades Julian has become a quaint mountain resort, with most businesses oriented toward tourism and not local services. The main area of town narrowly escaped destruction in the 2003 Cedar Fire that burned much of the surrounding area.

In 2004, an interviewing journalist noted that up to a third of Julian’s population had been affected by property losses associated with fire. The local fire district had recently removed property-tax benefit fees, making reconstruction more difficult for residents devastated by fires. Drought and infestation of the local forests by pine bark beetles was observed to exacerbate the fire season’s stressing effect on the community.

Fire disruptions as of 2004 were observed in Julian to have caused the disappearance of populations of red-winged blackbirds, acorn woodpeckers, white-crowned sparrows, lesser goldfinches, scrub jays, Steller’s jays, nuthatches, or black-headed grosbeaks.

Luxury home developments expanded the community of Julian into the early 2010s. These developments (such as the New England-themed Hoskings Ranch development), which often exceed $1 million in listing prices, are predominantly owned as vacation homes by individuals who principally live in La Jolla, with significant concentrations from Del Mar and Coronado in metropolitan San Diego.

In 2017, the Julian Arts Guild opened an art gallery in downtown Julian, Julian Arts Guild Gallery, where local artists and artisans display their works.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

Soils in and around Julian are mostly dark brown, slightly to moderately acidic sandy loams which are well drained and of variable stoniness. Less stony areas, which underlie most of the townsite, are in the Holland series. The hills around town have rocky soils of the Crouch series. Somewhat poorly drained alluvial loam occurs along Coleman Creek.

===Climate===
Julian experiences more extreme temperatures and greater precipitation than much of southern California. It also receives snow annually, which accumulates the most in February and March. This attracts people from San Diego and other coastal cities, where snow is a once-in-a-lifetime event. As is typical in southern California, the summer has the driest months, but with a number of monsoonal storms from the southeast. Average yearly snowfall from 1991 to 2020 has been .

<text>La Mesa () is a city in San Diego County, California, United States, located east of downtown San Diego in Southern California. The population was 61,121 at the 2020 census, up from 57,065 at the 2010 census. Its civic motto is &quot;the Jewel of the Hills.&quot;

==History==

Before European colonization, the area that is now La Mesa was home to the Kumeyaay. The Kumeyaay were a Yuman-speaking people who practiced horticulture and hunting and gathering. The Kumeyaay organized themselves into a federation of self-governed bands, or clans. Beginning in 1769, the Kumeyaay of La Mesa and the larger San Diego County region were enslaved by Spanish colonists or later forcibly relocated to reservations.

La Mesa in Spanish means &quot;the table&quot;, or alternately &quot;the plateau&quot;, relating to its geography. La Mesa was part of a larger tract, Mission San Diego de Alcalá, and was used by Spanish missionaries.

Through the years, the Spanish, Mexican, and American settlers valued La Mesa for its natural springs. In 1868, stockman Robert Allison moved to the area and purchased 4,000 acres of land from the heirs of Santiago Arguello, commandant of the Presidio of San Diego. This land became La Mesa, and the &quot;Allison&quot; natural springs were renamed the &quot;La Mesa Springs.&quot; The importance of the springs is still reflected today in the name of the prominent &quot;Spring Street,&quot; which passes through downtown La Mesa, and with the preservation of the spring house in Collier Park.

La Mesa was founded in 1869 and The City of La Mesa was incorporated on February 16, 1912. Its official flower is the bougainvillea.

In 2020, La Mesa was the site of civil unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Two days after Floyd&#x27;s murder, an unarmed black man was grabbed and shoved by a white La Mesa Police officer and arrested at Grossmont Transit Center. The video of the incident went viral and led to more than 1000 protesters converging on the city. An African-American grandmother was shot in the face with a bean bag round from police. Businesses were looted and several structures were set on fire, including two banks that burned to the ground. The officer in the trolley station incident was charged with falsifying a police report in connection with the reason for the arrest but acquitted in December 2021.

==Geography==
La Mesa is bordered by the city of San Diego on the west and north, Spring Valley and Lemon Grove on the south, and El Cajon on the east. It includes the neighborhood of Grossmont.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (0.44%) is water.

=== Climate ===

La Mesa is approximately east of the Pacific Ocean. Because of this, La Mesa typically experiences more extreme temperatures than San Diego, most of which lies closer to the Pacific Ocean.

The city has dry weather with around of annual precipitation. Summer temperatures are generally hot, with average highs of and lows of . Winter temperatures are warm, with average high temperatures of and lows of .

The climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances, resulting in micro-climates. In San Diego&#x27;s case, this is mainly due to the city&#x27;s topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the &quot;May gray/June gloom&quot; period, a thick &quot;marine layer&quot; cloud cover will keep the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but will yield to bright cloudless sunshine approximately inland. This happens every year in May and June. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas tend to experience higher temperatures than areas closer to the coast.

Lakeside was founded in 1886 when 6,600 acres of land surrounding the naturally occurring Lindo Lake were purchased by the El Cajon Valley Land Company, who immediately began to promote the new land as a town and built an 80-room Victorian-style inn, the Lakeside Hotel, at a cost of $50,000 (approximately $1,220,000 today). Three years later, in 1889, Lakeside became connected to the railroad system, and small businesses began to spring up, firmly establishing Lakeside as a bustling community. In 1904, John H. Gay bought the Lakeside Hotel and fenced off the park surrounding Lindo Lake, claiming both as part of his estate. He then proceeded to construct an automobile and horse racetrack around the lake, which became famous when Barney Oldfield set a new land speed record when visiting for the track&#x27;s opening in 1907. The inn and racetrack became a popular gathering place for millionaires and celebrities and consistently drew large crowds by train to watch the races held there, but both were demolished per Gay&#x27;s wishes at his death in 1920.

Lakeside has long held a reputation as a &quot;cowboy town&quot; and &quot;rodeo town,&quot; due to the rural setting, the prevalence of ranches and the abundant horse ownership in the area, as well as hosting an permanent rodeo facility, the Lakeside Rodeo Grounds. The venue is manned and maintained by the El Capitan Stadium Association, an all-volunteer group who aims to assist and support the youth of Lakeside by donating all proceeds from facility rentals to local sports and service, as well as education grants. Notable rodeos include the PRCA-sanctioned Lakeside Rodeo, part of their California circuit and usually occurring on the last weekend in April, regularly drawing over 20,000 observers to the arena, as well as the Lakeside Optimists&#x27; Bulls Only Rodeo in July.

During the middle of the 20th century, Lakeside was home to significant Native American, Spanish-speaking and Filipino populations.

Many social and service groups are very active in Lakeside including Youth Venture Teen Centers, VFW, Kiwanis International, Elks, Optimist, Soroptimist, 4-H, FFA, Boys and Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, youth soccer, baseball and football leagues, and the Cactus Park BMX track. The U.S. Navy maintains two large housing sites for military dependents in the town.

Today, protection of the town&#x27;s history falls to the Lakeside Historical Society, which works primarily to retain and preserve the buildings in the historic former downtown along Maine Avenue, now removed from the central business hub.

==Recreation==
While Lakeside was first named for the presence of the small, natural lake it was founded around, it is now home to a trio of large reservoirs: Lake Jennings, El Capitan Reservoir and San Vicente Reservoir. All three are kept stocked by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife with various types of fish ranging from largemouth bass to catfish and rainbow trout, and are popular fishing destinations for local and county residents. The latter two are also open to recreational water activities such as wakeboarding and jetskiing;.

There are a number of parks with outdoor trails for hiking, biking and equestrian riding, most notably the River Park situated along the bank and riverbed of the San Diego River, the park surrounding Lindo Lake and Stelzer and El Monte County Parks. Also located in Lakeside is the trailhead for the climb to the summit of El Cajon Mountain, nicknamed locally as &quot;El Capitan&quot; for its resemblance to the famous Yosemite cliff, which dominates the view of the mountains northeast of Lakeside.

As well as hosting outdoor recreational opportunities, the town is also in close proximity to a number of Native American casino operations, the most notable of which is Barona Resort and Casino a few miles to the north. A full resort featuring hotel, casino, and golfing facilities, Barona is notable for having a gambling age restriction lower than most California casinos at 18 years old. Other Native American casinos nearby include Viejas Casino, located to the east of Lakeside on Interstate 8, as well as the Golden Acorn casino further out along the interstate.

<text>Lemon Grove is a city in San Diego County, California, United States. The population was 27,627 at the 2020 census, up from 25,320 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The area that eventually became Lemon Grove was part of Mission San Diego de Alcalá, one of the Spanish missions in California. After Mexico became independent from Spain, the Californios (residents of Alta California) ranched on various land grants. The area that now includes Lemon Grove was granted to Santiago Argüello, who received more than 59,000 acres.

The first proprietor of Lemon Grove, Robert Allison, arrived in the region in 1850, coming from Sacramento. He purchased thousands of acres from Santiago Argüello&#x27;s heirs; this land eventually became Lemon Grove, La Mesa, Encanto, and part of Spring Valley. Allison became a director and stockholder of the San Diego and Cuyamaca Railroad in 1886 and built the Allison Flume. Allison&#x27;s son Joseph filed subdivision maps for &quot;Lemon Grove&quot; in 1892. The name is attributed to Joseph&#x27;s mother, Tempa Waterman Allison. The climate was suitable for the cultivation of subtropical fruits and vegetables, and farmers from the East and Midwest flocked to the region. The Lemon Grove Fruit Growers Association was formed in 1893; in 1894, the &quot;San Diego Union&quot; newspaper referred to Lemon Grove as &quot;a sea of lemon trees.&quot;

Joseph and Anton Sonka, immigrants from Bohemia, moved to Lemon Grove after stints in Seguin, Texas, and San Diego. The brothers opened a well-known general store, A. Sonka and Son. In 2023, the historical building that was once Sonka&#x27;s general store became Lemon Grove Bistro.

Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; F. Sonka, the eldest son of Anton Sonka and his German American wife Anna Klein Sonka, was also a local notable. He was a key supporter of the huge lemon that became the town&#x27;s symbol and landmark. Sonka and a committee of local ranchers hired local architect Alberto Treganza to build the huge lemon to &quot;make the ultimate statement about the town&#x27;s purpose, prosperity, and optimism.&quot;

In the Lemon Grove Incident in 1931, Mexican American parents in Lemon Grove pursued a successful judicial challenge against the decision of the local school board to build a separate school for Mexican American pupils. The decision of the Superior Court for San Diego County in &quot;Alvarez v. Lemon Grove&quot; was the first successful lawsuit against school segregation.

By World War II, most of the citrus groves had disappeared and suburbanization had begun. There had been four elections on incorporation from the 1950s to the 1970s; the issue caused heated debate in the town. The city was finally incorporated on July 1, 1977, becoming California&#x27;s 414th city. Lemon Grove was incorporated as a general-law city; however, it continues to receive law enforcement services, via contract, from the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

== &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Lemon&quot; ==
Weighing some 3000 pounds, and approximately 10 feet long and six feet wide, the lemon sculpture—affectionately known as the World&#x27;s Biggest Lemon—sits on a concrete base at the corner of Broadway and Lemon Grove Avenue, adjacent to 3361 Main Street. It lies before a small lemon grove beside the Orange Line Trolley tracks near the local trolley station and downtown bus stop. Written across the base of this monument are the words &quot;Best Climate On Earth&quot;. Designed by Lemon Grove architect Alberto O Treganza, the lemon was originally built as a parade float for the 1928 Fourth of July Fiesta de San Diego parade, carrying the town&#x27;s first Miss Lemon Grove, Amorita Treganza, Alberto&#x27;s 16-year-old daughter. In 1930, the float was plastered to create a permanent sculpture and displayed near its current location.

<text>National City is a city in the South Bay region of southwestern San Diego County, California. The population was 56,173 at the 2020 United States census, down from 58,582 at the 2010 census. National City is the second-oldest city in San Diego County, having been incorporated in 1887.

==History==

Human presence within the modern city limits of National City may have begun as early as 130,000 years ago, as allegedly evidenced at the Cerutti Mastodon site. Later in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century there was a Kumeyaay village, north of the modern National City boundaries, on Chollas Creek.

The Spanish named the of land &quot;El Rancho del Rey&quot; (the Ranch of the King), used by Spanish soldiers to graze horses. After independence from Spain, in 1810, the Mexican government renamed it Rancho de la Nación (Ranch of the Nation). Governor Pío Pico granted Rancho de la Nación to his brother-in-law John (Don Juan) Forster in 1845. President Andrew Johnson, in issuing the land patent, listed the name as simply &quot;The National Ranch&quot;, the English translation of the land grant name, &quot;Rancho de la Nación&quot;.

In 1868, Frank Kimball and his brothers Warren and Levi, contractors and builders from San Francisco, purchased the entire rancho and thus began the foundation of the city, retaining the National name.

Frank Kimball first brought novelty and change to the area by building his personal residence. His home included a bathtub as well as hot running water, making it the first modern house in the entire county. However, it was more than his personal innovative endeavors that allowed the region to flourish. By constructing the first roads and railroad in what is now National City, Frank and his brothers most notably were responsible for introducing modern transportation to the residents of the community. The brothers also implemented the area&#x27;s first post office and a wharf for sea-bound imports and exports. These large ventures, coupled with smaller personal missions, both contributed to the overall goal of creating a community unparalleled to the times. A lasting mark of the Kimballs was the trees they imported and planted from Europe and Asia, accomplished via a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These trees can be found dotted throughout the city to this very day. It was the passion and influence of the Kimballs as well as other early pioneers that made way for the city&#x27;s incorporation on September 17, 1887.

In the mid-20th century, businesses on National Avenue catered to the entertainment of sailors stationed at Naval Base San Diego, and became known as the &quot;Mile of Bars&quot;. In the late 20th century, the city, seeking to end the association of the street with drinking culture, urged the growth of automobile dealerships, transforming the area to be known as the &quot;Mile of Cars&quot;. One of the defining features of National City&#x27;s past is the Victorian-style homes, many of which were built in the late 1800s. Brick Row is a prime example of how National City has preserved and brought old architecture into the modern world. Constructed by Frank Kimball in 1887, it was created to accommodate the railroad workers and lack of housing. In the 1970s Malcolm C. Greshler pitched the idea of creating Heritage Square in the heart of the city to showcase National City’s tourist attractions, it also acted as a way for people to visit National City&#x27;s history, in the forms of museums, shops, and other ways these buildings could be repurposed. The National City general plan had listed around 66 historical sites that could be restored and preserved, Frank Kimball&#x27;s interest in making National City in a western terminus for the Santa Fe Rail Way, was overlooked. So to commemorate Frank Kimball, they preserved his house and the Brick Row. Having a Heritage Square shows how National City has an important History that has to be shown to the public, along with the stories of the creators of these vintage buildings. In the end, Brick Row and Frank Kimball were major factors that impacted how National City has grown into the City it is today.

=== Sanctuary city debate ===
As of 2017, National City was home to an estimated 25,000 immigrants and refugees, or two out of every five residents.

Former Mayor Nick Inzunza declared National City a sanctuary city, meaning that it limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, in a proclamation which he presented to immigrants&#x27; rights activists on September 30, 2006, during dueling rallies that brought about 400 people to City Hall. This was the result of a statement Mayor Inzunza made on National Public Radio on September 8, 2006. This proclamation divided the city between the stance of the ex-mayor and the federal and state regulations regarding this matter.

On November 7, 2006, Ron Morrison was elected mayor of National City. On November 28, 2006, Mayor Morrison appeared on the KPBS program &quot;Full Focus&quot; with Gloria Penner and was asked if National City will continue to be a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. Morrison responded &quot;absolutely not.&quot;

More recently, on June 19, 2017, the National City Council voted unanimously to adopt a &quot;Compassionate City resolution&quot; in support of immigrants, a partial reversal of former Mayor Morrison&#x27;s stance.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (20.17%) is water. National City is bounded by San Diego to the north and northeast, Bonita to the southeast, and Chula Vista to the south across the Sweetwater River. San Diego Bay lies to the immediate west of the city. Also, within the boundaries of National City on the eastern side of town is the unincorporated area of San Diego County known as Lincoln Acres. National City is 15 minutes away from the US–Mexico Border (Tijuana).

National City has road access by the Interstate 5, Interstate 805, and California State Route 54, in addition to surface streets. National City Blvd, which once served as part of the historic U.S. Route 101, still serves as a north–south arterial street parallel to Highland Ave. Plaza Blvd and 30th Street/Sweetwater Road serve as east–west arterial routes. It has rail access through the San Diego Trolley&#x27;s Blue Line. The nearest commercial airport is San Diego International Airport.

In 2012, National City was honored as the most walkable city in San Diego County. It currently holds a walk score of 71, among the highest scores for cities of similar size. However, its current score also puts National City among bigger cities like Seattle, Washington (74) and Portland, Oregon (66). San Diego&#x27;s current walk score is 56.

===Communities===
Although there are no specific communities identified by the city of National City, certain areas have self-identified as communities. The Old Town community is bordered by McKinley Ave. (to the west) and National City Blvd. (to the east), and 24th Street (to the south) and 8th Street (to the north). While Lincoln Acres is an unincorporated area of San Diego County, it is located wholly within the boundaries of the incorporated city of National City and both share the postal code (91950). The South Port Business Center, an industrial park in which many businesses operate, is bordered by I-5 to the west, National City Blvd. to the east Mile of Cars Way (24th St.) to the north, and W. 28th St. to the south. The residents near Las Palmas and El Toyon Parks have neighborhood councils where they can voice their concerns with the city&#x27;s elected officials.

The Neighborhood Council Program was developed in an effort to improve communication with the community and to bring services directly to National City residents. The program helps to unify neighbors to further enhance the image of the city, instilling civic pride into neighborhoods. Regular monthly meetings are held in each of the three Neighborhood Councils. Agenda topics are driven by resident requests, current events, and a desire by city officials to keep residents abreast of new programs and upcoming developments. Meetings are usually attended by police and fire officials, as well as members of the City Council.

Besides attending regular meetings, Neighborhood Council participants assist the city in improving their neighborhoods by volunteering during clean-up and beautification events and by helping to reduce crime. Residents also participate in family events sponsored by the Neighborhood Council Program such as National Night Out and Movies in the Park, as well as other city-sponsored events.

===Climate===
National City&#x27;s climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters, with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. The city has a mild climate year-round, with an average of 201 days above and low rainfall ( annually).

===Ecology===
Like most of Southern California and the San Diego County region, the majority of National City&#x27;s current area was originally occupied by chaparral, a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. National City&#x27;s broad city limits encompass the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge and the most northern area of the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. The Sweetwater River runs from the Cuyamaca Mountains, through National City and Chula Vista via a flood control channel (natural route as opposed to a canal) and empties into San Diego Bay. Most of west National City is flat with an average elevation of , which made it historically desirable and well suited for the Spanish to graze their horses. The eastern areas of National City tend to have canyons and ridges with an existing wildlife.

National City had, at some point through the 1980s, one of the highest homicide rates in all of Southern California. In 1993, the city had the second-highest violent crime rate in all of California. Crime was, in large part, one reason the city earned the moniker &quot;Nasty City&quot; and, through the late 1980s and early 1990s, it averaged roughly one homicide per month, which was significant, for a city of barely 50,000.

Although crime has dropped dramatically since the 1980s and 1990s, National City still has significant gang and drug activity, and has led San Diego County in crime through the 2000s. In a recent study among California cities with the highest violent and property crime rates over 2014–2016, National City ranked 9th, with a violent crime rate of 299.0 over that three-year period. More recent data from 2016 to 2020 shows that National City was at or near the top in overall crime, and at the top in violent crime per FBI index crime rate data by jurisdiction in San Diego County.

==Tourism==

* National City Depot - The National City California Southern Railroad Depot, built in 1882, served as the first Pacific Coast terminus station of the Santa Fe Railway system&#x27;s transcontinental railroad. The station was the West Coast general office and figured prominently in Santa Fe&#x27;s effort to break the economic and transportation monopoly of California held by the Central/Southern Pacific Railroads. The first transcontinental trains arrived in November 1885, resulting in one of the largest land booms in the history of California. Of the original five transcontinental railroad terminus stations, this unique Italianate designed station is the lone survivor. Location: 900 West 23rd St, National City. Listed as California Historical Landmark no. 1023.

* Highland Avenue: Car cruising route.
* Olivewood Gardens, the old Victorian style house that John T. Walton lived in.
* Brick Row on Heritage Square, 909 A Avenue: Designed by San Diego architect R. C. Ball (who designed Folsom Prison), it was constructed by Frank Kimball in 1887 for $30,000. These 10 individual row houses were to be used by the executives of the Santa Fe Railroad. This architectural style is unique to this region and was molded after the row houses of Philadelphia and similar eastern cities. It was hoped that the railroad VIPs would not only feel at home surrounded by familiar architecture, but also be impressed by the cosmopolitan appearance of the young city. All the apartments have a formal dining room with fireplace, a kitchen, a parlor with fireplace, a butler&#x27;s pantry, and four bedrooms upstairs. Twelve-inch-thick () interlocking brick walls divide the units. The brickwork on the row houses was laid with an artistic eye to break the severe lines of the long walls. The bricks above the second story are set upright at an angle. A one-story wooden porch runs the length of the building. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it now is an integral part of National City&#x27;s Heritage Square. Each of the 10 units is privately owned and maintained; however, there is a protective covenant on the facade, so the exterior will always be in keeping with the Victorian surroundings.

Oceanside&#x27;s origins date to 1798, when the Spanish founded the village of San Luis Rey with the establishment of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia by Fermín de Lasuén. During the Spanish period, Mission San Luis Rey grew to be the largest of all the Californian missions, but following the Mexican secularization act of 1833 the mission and its community declined. Following the U.S. conquest of California, the former mission lands were developed into an oceanfront resort and the community&#x27;s name gradually changed to Oceanside.

==History==
Originally inhabited by Native Americans, Oceanside was first settled by the Luiseño peoples, or the Payomkawichum. The city of Oceanside sits on the locality on the San Luis Rey River that the Luiseño called Tacayme, which contained the villages of Qée&#x27;ish (Keish) and &#x27;ikáymay (Ikamal), in the San Luis Rey Mission area, Wiyóoya (Wiawio) at the mouth of the river, and Wi&#x27;áasamay (Wiasamai) and Waxáwmay (Wahaumai) at Guajome.

===Spanish era===
The first European explorers arrived in 1769. Spanish missionaries under Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Luis Rey de Francia on a former site of a Luiseño Indian village on the banks of the San Luis Rey River called Keish according to the Portolà expedition who visited in the 1769.

In the early 19th century, the introduction of farming and grazing changed the landscape of what would become Oceanside.

===Mexican era===

Following the Mexican secularization act of 1833, the Californian missions were nationalized, transferring their ownership from the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church to the Mexican Government. A mission administrator was appointed to each mission to oversee the process of secularization, the removal of the priests, and the selling or granting of the mission lands to private citizens.

At Mission San Luis Rey, Padre Antonio Peyrí had presided over the mission for 34 years when soldiers forced his removal in late 1833. Captain Pablo de la Portillà was appointed as administrator of San Luis Rey. Following the departure of Padre Peyrí, relations between the Luiseños and the new civilian administration hugely deteriorated, resulting in their famed refusal to work for Captain Portillà in 1835.

===American era===
In the late 1850s, Andrew Jackson Myers, an emigrant from Illinois, lived in San Joaquin County, but he returned in the late 1880s and lived in San Luis Rey. In 1882 Myers moved on the land that was the original townsite for Oceanside. A patent for the land was issued in 1883 by the federal government. It was incorporated on July 3, 1888. The city hall as of the early 21st century stands on the former Myers homestead.

The town post office contains an oil-on-canvas mural, &quot;Air Mail&quot;, painted in 1937 by Elsie Seeds. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

Oceanside continues to be known as a vacation home market.

In the 2010s, several mid-rise and high-rise housing and lodging projects were completed in the downtown area, with more to come. In 2021, two large Hyatt resorts were completed, bringing more tourists to the city.

<text>Poway () is a city in San Diego County, California, United States. Poway&#x27;s rural roots influenced its motto &quot;The City in the Country&quot;. The city had a population of 48,841 as of the 2020 United States census.

Poway is part of San Diego&#x27;s East County.

==History==
The Kumeyaay people lived in the area for centuries before the Spanish colonization of the region. Artifacts such as arrowheads, spear points, metates, grinding stones, and pottery found along the bed of Poway Creek all indicate an early Kumeyaay presence. Various pictographs adorn many of Poway&#x27;s boulders, and modern dating techniques suggest these paintings date to the 16th century and earlier.

===European settlement===
In the late 18th century, Mission San Diego de Alcalá kept cattle in the valley. Documents of Mission San Diego de Alcala record the name of the valley as &quot;Paguay&quot; as early as 1828. The name &quot;Poway&quot; is likely derived from a Kumeyaay term meaning &quot;arrowhead&quot; (pawii) or &quot;watering hole&quot; (paguay). Other sources suggest that &quot;Paguay&quot; means &quot;the meeting of little valleys&quot; or &quot;end of the valley&quot;. Some controversy also surrounds the proper spelling; historically it has also been written by the Mexican authorities as Paguai. It has also been written as Paui, Pauai, Pauy, and Powaii.

For approximately a century, Poway served as a stock range for the mission and local ranchos. In September 1839, Corporal Rosario Aguilar was granted Rancho Paguai a ranch in the valley and it was confirmed on May 22, 1840, but he refused it, becoming juez de paz in 1841 and moving instead to San Juan Capistrano.

===American settlement===
American settlers began to come to the valley for farming purposes in the late antebellum period. Few records of this time have survived, and not until 1894 and the inception of the &quot;Poway Progress&quot; was the town&#x27;s history regularly recorded. In 1887, about 800 people lived and farmed in Poway. Around the start of the 20th century, Poway farmers had moderate success in the production and vending of fruit, grain, and dairy products. The expansion, however, failed to follow agricultural success.

Poway has a creek and fertile soil, but the lack of easily available water prevented the settlement from attracting large-scale farmers and the accompanying population growth. In 1954 the Poway Municipal Water District was established to utilize water from the Colorado River Aqueduct. In 1957, following the sewer system&#x27;s completion, developers built housing tracts.

It became a city on December 1, 1980. It was nicknamed &quot;the City in the Country&quot;. Poway no longer relies on agriculture for its primary source of income and has instead transitioned into a residential community for those who work for employers in and around the San Diego area. According to a recent state government estimate, the population of Poway has grown since that last census to 50,542. It has been designated a &quot;Tree City&quot; for the last decade.

Major portions of the town were evacuated during both the 2003 Cedar Fire and 2007 Witch Creek Fire.

In 2004, the City of Poway adopted the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, based out of nearby Camp Pendleton. The Fred L. Kent Post 7907 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars has been the official go-between with the battalion, which has been redeployed at least once to Iraq since its adoption.

The pop-punk bands Blink-182, Unwritten Law, Pivit and the Frights originated in Poway, California.

===Agriculture===
The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged Westward migration, and many of Poway&#x27;s first white settlers came to farm. The fecund soil proved well-suited to a variety of crops, including peaches, Muscat grapes, apricots, pears, hay, and alfalfa. Some farmers captured swarms of wild bees and cultivated honey. Dairying also proved lucrative. Most families kept a cow for milk and butter, chickens for eggs and meat, and perhaps a hog to sustain them while they farmed. Crops sold well around the San Diego area. Between the seasons of 1894 and 1896, the &quot;Poway Progress&quot; reported agricultural information:

Muscat grapes are beginning to ripen, and the San Diego market is getting a supply of the fine article Poway always produces. ... The season has been a prolific one for bees, thirty of forty stands the present season from a single captured swarm a year or two ago. ... The peach is a good article, and Poway produces it to perfection. Poway pears will compare with any grown in the state.

The success of these crops depended on the annual winter rainfall, and remained subject to variations in precipitation until the establishment of the Poway Municipal Water District in 1954. With water readily available, the town&#x27;s farming interest shifted to two principal crops: avocados and citrus fruits. With water came new residents, and the former farm town transformed into a locale full of small commercial businesses and shopping centers.

===Religion===
The Community Church of Poway, the town&#x27;s first church, has remained in operation since 1887, making it the house of worship with the longest continual operation in San Diego County. Living Way Church, a non-denominational Protestant church, through Berean Bible College, is the only church currently in Poway that offers Bible college classes. There are two Catholic churches in Poway: St. Michael&#x27;s and St. Gabriel&#x27;s.

There is a Jewish community, with a Reform synagogue, a Conservative synagogue, and an Orthodox synagogue. On April 27, 2019, the Orthodox synagogue, Chabad of Poway, was the site of an attack in which four people were shot—one of whom was killed—during Passover services.

A Sikh temple, one of several in San Diego County, is found in Poway. Two Kingdom Halls of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are located in Poway. There are nine congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints located in Poway that meet in three meetinghouses.

===Education===
Poway established its school district in 1871, but did not have a schoolhouse until 1885, when a one-room school was built at Midland Road about a 2–3-minute walk south of the Templar&#x27;s Hall. The site is still in use today as an elementary school (Kindergarten through 5th grade), though it was torn down and rebuilt in 1945, and renovated again in 2004–2006. First through eighth graders were included in one classroom. Children learned to read and write using slates, and eventually progressed to study subjects such as arithmetic, spelling, English, language (German or Latin), grammar, history, and geography. Students did not usually attend high school, and had to travel to Escondido if they wished to do so. In 1909, only three students from Poway graduated from high school. Women who went on to more school from there usually had teaching ambitions. Education, while compulsory and considered a worthwhile pastime, had few far-reaching applications for Poway&#x27;s farmers&#x27; children. Enrollment in the Poway School 1st–8th grades did not reach 100 until 1932.

===Transportation===
Poway&#x27;s transportation history parallels that of the rest of early California. In 1888, the first stagecoach began to serve the towns from San Diego to Escondido, including Poway. The stage made one stop in town, at the Poway Post Office, and also delivered mail to the farmers who would wait along the road for its arrival. The men would trot alongside the coach and inquire as to the state of the mail and thus receive letters without requiring it to stop. Eight to ten passengers could accompany the stagecoach on its three-day journey for a modest $1.00 fee, or purchase a round trip for the bargain price of $1.50. The route itself, though not treacherous when passing through Poway, did pose a significant challenge to the team and driver at various points. Windy mountain trails often caused the stage to turn over, spilling both mail and passengers onto the rocky turf. The city of San Diego discontinued the stage line in 1912, when the advent of the automobile facilitated an easier and less time-consuming method of mail delivery. Poway established a County Road Station in 1920 to oil and maintain the roads so that automobiles could use them with ease. The road station remained in operation until 1961, when Poway achieved an 80% paved road rate. To this day, though, the town still boasts a number of dirt roads, for use by cars, horses, bikes, and pedestrians. Portions of what is currently Pomerado Road, a major north–south artery, were once U.S. Route 395 in California.

===Water===
Poway&#x27;s greatest change started in the 1950s when water came to the valley. On January 29, 1954, an election was held on the formation of the Poway Municipal Water District, which passed with an overwhelming majority of 210 ayes to 32 nays. At the second election on March 25, 1954, the citizens voted to annex to the San Diego County Water Authority. At a third election held April 22, 1954, the citizens voted to incur bonded debt of $600,000 to build a water system. The first water delivery was made in July 1954 to Gordon&#x27;s Grocery on Garden Road. In 1972 Poway Dam was built to provide a dependable supply of water.

In 1957, the Pomerado County Water District was organized to provide sewer service to along Pomerado Road. In 1959 the first subdivision homes were built and sold as Poway Valley Homes and Poway&#x27;s population began to climb. On December 1, 1980, the City of Poway incorporated and the two districts, Poway Municipal Water and Pomerado County Water, became part of the City structure. The district issued a restriction for watering lawns. It allowed people to water their lawns three days a week. After a short time, restrictions were lifted.

==Geography==
Poway is east of the city of San Diego and south of the city of Escondido. Nearby communities include Rancho Bernardo, Sabre Springs, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Ramona to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers an area of , 99.78% of it land, and 0.22% of it water. The confluence of the 33rd parallel north and 117th meridian west is located on a hillside in a private property.

===Climate===
Poway has a borderline semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;Bsh&quot;) and hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot summers and cool, wet winters.

The name &quot;Ramona&quot; also refers to an unincorporated community of San Diego (with some plans to incorporate) that includes both the Ramona CDP and the adjacent CDP of San Diego Country Estates. The population of the two CDPs, which does not include the fringe areas surrounding the CDPs, was 30,301 at the 2010 census, up from 25,223 at the 2000 census. The Ramona Community Planning Area had a population of 33,404 at the 2000 census. The January 1, 2006, population of the Ramona Community Planning Area is estimated to be 36,405 by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). USDA Hardiness Zones are 9b and 10a.

==History==

===Early times===
Before it was permanently settled, the Ramona area was inhabited by the Kumeyaay Nation of Native Americans (Diegueño), a semi-nomadic people, who established annual settlements there as they moved between coastal and inland grounds. Their presence is indicated by archeological evidence such as rock paintings, etchings, and grinding stones used to grind acorns into meal for bread.

During Mexican governance of California, Rancho Valle de Pamo (also called Rancho Santa María) was a Mexican land grant that occupied the Santa Maria Valley and was centered on present-day Ramona.

The first post office was called Nuevo. The town took the name Ramona in 1886, when a land speculation syndicate, headed by Milton Santee, &quot;organized the Santa Maria Land &amp; Water Company and acquired for a townsite in the Santa Maria Valley and named it Ramona&quot; after Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s recent novel &quot;Ramona,&quot; which had stirred a nationwide interest in a romanticized vision of Southern California. The next year the town reverted to Nuevo because there was another town, in Los Angeles County, called Ramona. However, the other town did not flourish, and Nuevo permanently retook the name Ramona in 1894. Today in Ramona, there stands a Mexican restaurant named &quot;Nuevo Grill&quot; in remembrance of the town&#x27;s original name. The restaurant even features a few old pictures that date back to when the town was still called Nuevo.

In 1886, Theophile Verlaque built the town&#x27;s first house next to Amos&#x27; store. The Verlaque house, located at 645 Main Street in Ramona, is now home to the Ramona Pioneer Historical Society and its Guy B. Woodward Museum, and in 1991 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Ramona Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It has also been known as Town Hall of Nuevo, and Barnett Hall. The Hall was built on two lots donated by Milton Santee, who as noted above headed up the Santa Maria Land &amp; Water Company syndicate. Augustus and Martha Barnett donated the $17,000 &quot;to the towns people of Nuevo, on Washington&#x27;s Birthday, February 22, 1894.&quot; Ramona Town Hall was designed by architect William S. Hebbard, who later, with his partner, Irving Gill, produced San Diego&#x27;s best architecture until its breakup in 1907. The building is one of the largest, and oldest, adobe structures in southern California. Photographs of William Hebbard and Ramona Town Hall may be viewed on this San Diego Historical Society page, and on the Ramona Town Hall website.

As noted in a &quot;Ramona Home Journal&quot; article:
In the past, the Town Hall was home to Ramona’s first high school. Classes met upstairs from 1894 to 1898. The town’s first bank and first library also started in the building, and several religious groups met there before their churches were built.

Other organizations that met in the Town Hall included Ramona Grange, Santa Maria Masonic Lodge, Ramona Pioneer Historical Society, Ramona Chamber of Commerce, Ramona Art Guild, Town Hall Players and Ramona Council of Arts, Unlimited.

The Town Hall was used as a theater in the 1940s, with Harry Miles running the movie projector. It also was known as the community dance hall and the site of costume balls.
===Recent history===
In the 1960s, boxer Archie Moore held a training camp called &quot;Salt Mine&quot; which trained George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. Moore fought from 1936 until 1963 and battled the top names in boxing at the time, including Rocky Marciano, Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali. He won 185 of his 219 bouts before retiring at 49 years old after losing to Ali. Moore&#x27;s connection to San Diego was his retreat, the Salt Mine Training Camp in Ramona. He called it “Salt Mine” because he said he worked as hard there to get ready for fights as anyone did in a salt mine. The property, at the foot of Mt. Woodson, included with five homes, a boxing ring, a sweatbox (steam room) and miles of winding country roads and trails that Moore used for road work. Moore often encountered rattlesnakes and even mountain lions on his runs.

On Mother&#x27;s Day, May 13, 1973, Ramona entered the national spotlight. 55-year-old former-tennis-great-turned-hustler, Bobby Riggs, challenged the then 30-year-old women&#x27;s world number-one player, Margaret Court, to a match. The match was staged at Ramona&#x27;s San Diego Country Estates. Riggs won easily, 6–2, 6–1. He later lost to Billie Jean King in The Battle of the Sexes at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, on September 20, 1973.

The Cedar Fire began in Ramona approximately east of the San Diego Country Estates area, on October 25, 2003. The fire would eventually consume approximately , burn 2,820 buildings (including 2,232 homes), and take 15 lives. The Cedar Fire was the largest fire in California history at the time. In her book, &quot;A Canyon Trilogy,&quot; author Chi Varnado, a longtime Ramona resident, described many of the hardships the victims faced in the aftermath of the fire.

The Witch Fire began near Ramona near the area called Witch Creek on October 21, 2007. By three days later it had burned approximately in San Diego County with over 640 homes destroyed, 250 damaged, and 12 firefighters injured according to the San Diego Union Tribune. Roads into the town were closed. On October 24 the Witch Fire merged with another fire called the Poomacha which had originated in the area of the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Along with more than 10 other fires burning in San Diego County at the same time, the Witch-Poomacha fire helped cause the largest mandatory evacuations in U.S. history, with over 500,000 people displaced as of October 24.

In January 2006, Ramona Valley was designated the country&#x27;s 162nd American Viticultural Area (AVA) by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which recognized the area for its distinctive microclimate, elevation, and soil attributes.

In May 2009, a grade 6 student at Mt. Woodson Elementary, Natalie Jones, was forbidden from delivering a class presentation on assassinated gay San Francisco city councilor Harvey Milk because her principal, and later the school district, declared it a &quot;sensitive&quot; issue that not all parents might want their children to learn about. The American Civil Liberties Union labeled the school district&#x27;s actions as censorship and stepped in to give the school district five days to reverse its decision, and promise never to do anything like it again, or they would launch a lawsuit on Natalie&#x27;s behalf. The school district did not immediately respond.

==Government==

===Local===
As an unincorporated town, Ramona&#x27;s plenary local governing body is the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. However, many governmental functions operate at the local level in Ramona.

The Ramona Municipal Water District (RMWD) is Ramona&#x27;s local agency (within its boundaries) for water and sewer service, fire protection, paramedic services, and parks. The RMWD contracts with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to operate the Ramona Fire Department. The RMWD is governed by a five-member elected board of directors.

In the area of Ramona outside and east of the Ramona Municipal Water District, fire protection and paramedic service is provided by the InterMountain Fire - Rescue Department. It operates as a California 501c(3) non-profit corporation, and up to 9 people sit on its board of directors. Portions of Ramona, notably the Barona Mesa area adjacent to San Diego Country Estates, are under the jurisdiction of the San Diego Rural Fire Protection District (View its District map).

With one exception, public schools in Ramona are operated by the Ramona Unified School District, which is governed by an elected five-person board of trustees. The exception was Sun Valley Charter High School. Although its charter was approved by the RUSD, it was governed by its own board. The charter school failed after a few years from a decline in the number of students and political friction from the RUSD.

Ramona Adult School was established in 1993 by the Ramona Unified School District. Ramona Adult School is a provider of adult education services in Ramona, California and serves the communities of Ballena, Santa Ysabel, San Diego Country Estates, Four Corners, Barona Reservation, Fernbrook, San Pasqual Valley, and Wynola. At an elevation of 1,430 ft, the adult school campus is located on the grounds of Montecito high school which is nestled in beautiful and historic foothills of the noteworthy Cuyamaca Mountains. Ramona Adult School offers adult education courses for adults in the areas of: high school diploma, GED, HISET, and adult basic education. Ramona Adult School works collaboratively with Palomar College and other local adult schools to connect students with post-secondary education and training. Ramona Adult School is a member of the Education to Career Network of North San Diego County. ETCN is one of 71 Consortiums in the State of California and is funded by the California Adult Education Program.

The Nuevo Gardens Memorial Cemetery is a public cemetery located at 532 Ash Street, Ramona, CA 92065, and governed by a three-person Board of Trustees, who are appointed by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.

==Geography==
According to the United States Geological Survey Ramona is located at within the Santa Maria Valley. This is near the intersection of State Route 67 and State Route 78 and near the economic center of Ramona. The elevation is above sea level (at Ramona Airport).

Because Ramona is not an incorporated city, there are no city limits by which to measure its area. There are primarily three geographic areas by which the land area of Ramona is measured: 1. The boundaries of the Ramona Municipal Water District (approximately ); 2. The boundaries of the Ramona Unified School District (approximately ), and; 3. The boundaries of the Ramona Community Planning Area. The last is the primary area utilized by San Diego County&#x27;s regional planning agency, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG).

The Ramona Community Planning Area encompasses more than (over ) in central San Diego County. The RCPA includes the unincorporated town of Ramona, California, and is located in the foothills of the Laguna Mountains. It is located east northeast of the City of Poway (with which it shares a boundary), east southeast of the City of Escondido, north of Lakeside, California, and west southwest of Santa Ysabel, California.

The RCPA consists primarily of the Santa Maria Valley and the San Vicente Valley, and the steep or mountainous terrain surrounding them. It also includes the Ballena Valley east of town, and Bandy Canyon and a small portion of the southern edge of the San Pasqual Valley. In the San Pasqual Valley, the RCPA abuts the City of San Diego.

The historical town center of Ramona is located in the Santa Maria Valley. This valley was the Rancho Santa Maria, a Mexican land grant. The San Vicente Valley was formerly part of the Rancho Cañada de San Vicente y Mesa del Padre Barona Mexican land grant. The San Diego Country Estates subdivision in Ramona is located in the San Vicente Valley.

==Agriculture==
At one time Ramona was known as the &quot;Turkey Capital of the World.&quot; Turkey production flourished during the 1930s, and the industry was featured with popular annual Turkey Days celebrations. Turkey production went into sharp decline following World War II, and ended completely by 1959.

The decline of the turkey industry was followed by rapid growth in the chicken egg business. Egg production, which began in the 1920s, thrived into the 1970s. In 1970, there were about 50 egg ranches in Ramona. Today, most of the chicken ranches are gone. By 2003, only four remained. A notable exception to the decline is the Pine Hills Egg Ranch, which at 1,100,000 birds is the 58th largest nationally, and the 5th largest in the state of California. The demise of the egg industry was, in part, due to population growth and increased land values. It was also caused by an outbreak of deadly exotic Newcastle&#x27;s Disease in 1971, which took three years to stem, and another outbreak in late 2002.

Dairies used to be common in Ramona, particularly along contiguous Dye Road, Ramona Street and Warnock Road. Today, one dairy remains on Dye Road.

Notable among current agricultural pursuits in Ramona is rapidly growing wine grape production. The Ramona Valley American Viticultural Area surrounds the town. An aerial photograph depicting the Ramona Valley Viticultural Area may be viewed at the https://ramonavalleyvineyards.com Ramona Valley Vineyard Association&#x27;s website].

Although the cost of imported water has been a negative issue in recent years, avocado and citrus orchards are also prominent.

Perhaps Ramona&#x27;s greatest recent claim to fame comes from Thoroughbred horse breeding. The Golden Eagle Farm in eastern Ramona&#x27;s Ballena Valley was the home of Best Pal, the second-place finisher of the 1991 Kentucky Derby. No California bred race horse has earned more than the US$5.6 million in purses he won. Best Pal is buried on the Golden Eagle Farm.

==Culture==
Ramona is the filming location for the films &quot;South of 8&quot; (2016), &quot;The Samuel Project&quot; (2018), &quot;Why the Nativity?&quot; (2022), and &quot;Hemet, or the Landlady Don&#x27;t Drink Tea&quot; (2023).

==History==
In 1841, Rancho San Dieguito, as it was originally named, was a Mexican land grant of from Governor Pío Pico of Alta California to Juan Maria Osuna, the first &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) of the Pueblo of San Diego.

In 1906, the Santa Fe Railway, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, purchased the entire land grant to plant a Blue gum eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) tree plantation for use as railroad ties, but the wood proved too soft to hold railroad spikes. The railroad then formed the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company to develop a planned community of country estates, and developed from the original Rancho San Dieguito land grant were renamed &quot;Rancho Santa Fe&quot; in 1922.

In 1921, architect Lilian Rice, working under Requa and Jackson, was chosen to develop the community&#x27;s master plan. Rice worked through to 1927, designing, supervising, and constructing the village center, as well as several homes. The basics of the original Lilian Rice land plan are in effect to this day, and the resulting low density high green space community is unique in Southern California.

In 1923, the Santa Fe Land Company constructed a guest house called &quot;La Morada&quot; to house potential land purchasers. It was renamed in 1941, as &quot;The Inn&quot;, when it was purchased by a private owner.

From 1937 to 1947, Bing Crosby hosted a golf tournament known as the &quot;Bing Crosby Clambake&quot; at the Rancho Santa Fe Country Club. Crosby&#x27;s golf tournaments, which included Hollywood celebrities matched against professionals, drew great crowds to the area. After 1947, the tournament was moved to the Monterey Peninsula, not far from San Francisco.

In 1989, &quot;The Covenant&quot; of Rancho Santa Fe was registered as California Historical Landmark #982 for its status as a historic planned community.

<text>San Diego Country Estates, commonly referred to as The Estates, is a valley resort populace composed of several neighborhoods associated with the unincorporated community of Ramona, California. The Estates is a census-designated place in North County, a region of San Diego County. The Estates is just east of the North County city of Poway and southeast of Ramona; northeast of San Diego and from the regional center of Carlsbad. San Diego Country Estates had a population of 10,395 at the 2020 census, up from 10,109 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Early history===
Before the development of the Estates, the area was inhabited by the northern Ipai, a semi-nomadic people and a group of the Kumeyaay. These people are known by many names, some of which include the Digueno, Tipai-Ipai, or Kamia. The San Vicente Valley was home to the temporary settlements of these people who traveled the region between Escondido and Lake Henshaw. Grinding stones, commonly found in large boulders throughout the valley alongside creeks and used to create acorn meal for bread, are testament to their historic presence in the area.

In the 1700s the valley in which San Diego Country Estates is located received its name when Father Mariner of Mission San Diego de Alcalá discovered the location, proclaiming it a constant and beautiful valley, and named it in honor of Saint Vincent. As the area became colonized by the Spanish and later fell under Mexican jurisdiction, the land of the San Vicente Valley became a part of the Mexican land-grant known as Rancho Cañada de San Vicente y Mesa del Padre Barona in 1846. Under the grant prominent persons such as William Augustus Barnett and families, the Dukes, settled the region.

In 1970 Raymond A. Watt, a national award-winning builder, purchased 3,250 acres in the San Vicente Valley with the intent of building a new community that became San Diego Country Estates.

===Contemporary history===
San Diego Country Estates, on May 13, 1973, hosted former 55-year-old tennis player Bobby Riggs and then 30-year-old women&#x27;s world number one player, Margaret Court. Court was challenged to a tennis match by Riggs and the game was held at the San Vicente Country Club and Golf Course Resort. Riggs won the match 6-2, 6-1.

The area is well known for its history with Southern California wildfires. Several fires including the Witch Fire and Cedar Fire have begun near the Estates. On October 23, 2003, the Cedar Fire began approximately 3 miles east of the Estates in Cleveland National Forest.

Also beginning near the Estates, the Witch Fire began October 21, 2007 and was part of a series of fires that ravaged Southern California. The Witch Creek fire caused the evacuation of the thousands of residents of the Estates area and evacuating cars were bottlenecked on the San Vicente Highway, a main artery leading to San Diego Country Estates from Ramona. It was feared that the fire would sweep west from the ridge separating the Estates and Ramona, catching vehicles evacuating west through North County, however, the wind changed the course of the fire. The Witch Creek fire was initially feared to be larger than the Cedar Fire but instead resulted in becoming the second largest fire in California history. Ultimately the Witch Creek burned 197,990 acres (801 km2) and forced the evacuation of an estimated 1,000,000 people in the San Diego metropolitan area, the largest evacuation in California history.

<doc id="108060" wikidata="Q506411" url="?curid=108060" title="San Marcos, California">
<text>San Marcos ( ; Spanish for &quot;St. Mark&quot;) is a city in the North County region of San Diego County, California. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 94,833. It is the site of California State University San Marcos and Palomar College. The city is bordered by Escondido to the east, Encinitas to the southwest, Carlsbad to the west, and Vista to the northwest. Lake San Marcos is an enclave, or county island, within the southwestern part of the city and its sphere of influence but is an unincorporated community.

==History==
According to historical legends, the San Luis Rey Mission flocks were robbed by a small band of Native Americans in the late 18th century. Fleeing the Spanish troops, the Native Americans escaped to the hills. While pursuing the Native Americans in 1797 the Spaniards came upon a fertile valley, which was named Los Vallecitos de San Marcos (Little Valleys of Saint Mark) to honor the day of discovery: April 25, St. Mark’s Day. On April 22, 1840, Governor Juan B. Alvarado granted Rancho Vallecitos de San Marcos to his relative, Jose María Alvarado. Jose Alvarado was killed at the Pauma Massacre in 1846, and the land was left to his wife; she then sold the land to Lorenzo Soto. In the late 1850s, Soto sold part of his land to Cave Couts, and his family was soon raising livestock. Although Cave Couts owned the land, Major Gustavus French Merriam from Topeka, Kansas, made the first permanent settlement. Merriam homesteaded in the north Twin Oaks Valley and began wine and honey production.

German and Dutch immigrants began moving into the area in the early 1880s. In 1883, a few miles south of the settlement, John H. Barham (for whom the present-day Barham Drive is named) founded the first town in the area, originally situated on the southeast corner of what are now Rancho Santa Fe Road and San Marcos Boulevard. By 1884, the town of Barham had a post office, blacksmith, feed store and weekly newspaper. In 1887, the San Marcos Land Company bought almost all of the San Marcos land formerly owned by the Couts family and promptly divided the land into tracts. Soon the hills began attracting home-seekers.

The original town of San Marcos was about a mile north of Barham, at the intersection of what is now Grand Avenue and Rancho Santa Fe Road. In 1887, the Santa Fe Railroad announced that it was going to lay tracks going through the valley, but to the disappointment of the citizens, the tracks were laid from the center of the town. By 1896, San Marcos was a community with its own stores, post office, blacksmith, and railroad depot. The first school in the area, which was started in Barham in 1886, had been moved to San Marcos three years later, as Barham was fading due to its distance from the railroad. To prevent San Marcos from suffering a similar fate, in 1903 the people of the town picked up their homes and moved a couple miles east along the railroad tracks to what now are Mission Road and Pico Avenue. By 1905, the town had every convenience, including rural mail delivery and telephone service. Later that same year, the Richland School (now a wedding chapel on Woodland Parkway) was built, becoming the second school in San Marcos. The main business in San Marcos in the 19th and early 20th centuries was farming. In the mid-20th century, dairies and poultry production became a big part of the business in the town.

San Marcos experienced a period of growth from 1956 onward, when the first water from the Colorado River arrived. Several small businesses were founded and the population rapidly increased to 2,500. San Marcos became an incorporated city on January 28, 1963. In the 1970s, San Marcos was flourishing as the third fastest-growing city in the state, and had a population of 17,479 by 1980. The population continued to boom during succeeding decades, surpassing 30,000 in 1990 and nearing 100,000 by 2020.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (0.08%) is water. Due to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific, temperatures rarely fall below freezing in winter and above 100 degrees F. in summer. Like most of coastal San Diego County, cool overcast from the Pacific is common in May and June (&quot;May gray&quot;, &quot;June gloom&quot;). July through September are usually the warmest months, although hot and dry Santa Ana winds can strike any month (most commonly August) and raise risks of severe wildfires. Most of the rain falls between November and March, averaging about 13 inches per year, with up to 20 inches falling in the San Marcos Hills.

==Parks and recreation==

=== Parks ===
There are nine parks in the City of Santee:

* Big Rock Park
* Deputy Ken Collier Park
* Mast Park
* Shadow Hill Park
* Sky Ranch Park
* Town Center Community Park 
* West Hills Park
* Woodglen Vista Park
* Weston Park

Town Center Community Park hosts many of Santee&#x27;s community events including the Santee Summer Concert series and the Santee Brews and Bites Festival. The park is located along the San Diego River and is split by Wooglen Vista Creek. The east side of the park features two synthetic turf fields, two grass fields, a concession stand, a performance stage, and a paved trail that surrounds the fields. The west side of the park holds five youth softball fields and a batting cage. The park also includes the Cameron Family YMCA, the City of Santee Aquatics Center, and Sportsplex USA Santee. The Sportsplex hosts over 350,000 people per year for sports leagues and tournaments across their three baseball/softball fields and two indoor soccer fields.

In December 2018, Mast Park underwent a roughly $12M renovation that brought extensive upgrades to many of the park&#x27;s amenities as well as enhancements to its public safety. The park reopened for public use on February 1, 2020, after nearly 14 months of construction. The park features 2 miles of lighted trails, a concession stand, a 9-hole disc golf course, a nature discovery area, play equipment, a lighted basketball court, and a dog park.

=== Trails ===
Walker Preserve Trail is a trail that runs east along the San Diego River. The trail opened in April 2015 and runs to the Lakeside Baseball Park where it continues beyond Santee&#x27;s city limits into Lakeside. The trail features a decomposed granite path lined by wooden fence posts and allows fishing access to the San Diego River. It is one of several trails throughout San Diego County that is part of the San Diego River Park Foundation&#x27;s vision to create a greenbelt from the mountains to the ocean along the long San Diego River.

Mast Park West Trail is a trail located between Carlton Oaks Boulevard and the Carlton Oaks Golf Course. The trail connects to Mast Park underneath Carlton Oaks Boulevard. The trail officially ends at the golf course but connecting it through the golf course to West Hills Parkway and Mission Trails Regional Park is one of the San Diego River Park Foundation&#x27;s priority projects. SANDAG is leading the project and has completed the required environmental work but has made no further progress.

=== Recreation ===
Santee Lakes Recreation Preserve is a park for fishing, camping, bird watching, and picnicking. The park features seven recycled water lakes stocked with sports fish year-round and 300 full-hook-up campsites. The park is owned and operated by Padre Dam Municipal Water District.

Carlton Oaks Golf Course and Lodge features an 18-hole championship course designed by golf course design legend Pete Dye as well as a 51-room resort. The course hosted the NCAA Western Region Finals and NCAA Championship in 1974.

 San Diego Christian College moved to Santee from El Cajon in early 2013. The college, which offers 15 degree programs, is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The college has approximately 475 students and 28 faculty members, but hopes to expand to as many as 1,200 students.

Santee is served by two school districts: Santee School District and Grossmont Union High School District. The two high schools in Santee, West Hills High School and Santana High School, are both part of the Grossmont Union High School District. Elementary and middle schools are part of the Santee School District. Other than Sycamore Canyon (only K-6), each school campus serves kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8). The schools are divided into elementary (K-6) and junior high (7–8), with each using different parts of the campus and having different ending times. This is different from the traditional practice of smaller elementary schools that feed students into consolidated middle schools.

<text>Solana Beach (&quot;Solana&quot;, Spanish for &quot;sunny side&quot;) is a beach city in San Diego County, California, on the South Coast. Its population was at 12,940 at the 2020 U.S. census, up from 12,867 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The area was first settled by the San Dieguitos, early Holocene inhabitants of the area. The area was later inhabited by the Kumeyaay, who set up a village they called &quot;Kulaumai&quot;, on the southern banks of San Elijo Lagoon. During the Spanish colonial era, trails heading north near Solana Beach crossed inland to avoid the marshes and inlets of the area.

The George H. Jones family were the first European settlers in the area, arriving in 1886. Until 1923, the area had been called Lockwood Mesa. When Lake Hodges Dam was built in 1917–1918, the area began to develop rapidly. The creation of the Santa Fe Irrigation District in 1918 ensured that the area from Rancho Santa Fe through Solana Beach would prosper and expand. The coastline from Solana Beach to Oceanside began to boom in the early 1920s. In 1922 Colonel Ed Fletcher, an early community leader and developer, purchased at $20 per acre from farmer George H. Jones to develop the town of Solana Beach, with the help of his brother-in-law Eugene Batchelder. To provide access to the beach for the development, hydraulic water pressure was used to erode away tons of earth and create the Fletcher Cove entry and beach. This took one man three months with a fire hose, using water that was coming over the spillway at Lake Hodges Dam. The beach was opened with great fanfare including horse races on the beach on July 4, 1925.

The community grew slowly, but steadily throughout the rest of the century, with particular booms occurring in the decade after World War II and a real estate boom in the last quarter of the 20th century. In 1986 the community incorporated as the city of Solana Beach. That year, the city hosted the funeral services for Desi Arnaz, who had died in Del Mar. Arnaz&#x27;s funeral was held at St. James Roman Catholic Church, part of the Diocese of San Diego.

The city received national news coverage in 2003 upon becoming the first city in the continental United States to enact a smoking ban on its public beaches, a trend which has continued as many other coastal California towns have followed suit in banning smoking on their beaches. Solana Beach was the last coastal community in North San Diego County to ban alcohol on the beach, doing so for at least a year in an action unanimously approved by the City Council.

On April 25, 2008, retired veterinarian and 38-year resident Dr. David Martin, 66 years old, suffered a fatal injury from an extremely rare great white shark bite while swimming with a group approximately off shore near Solana Beach&#x27;s Fletcher Cove. The group of swimmers reportedly began their swim at Tide Beach Park to the north. Surfers in the area of Fletcher Cover noted harbor seals in the water and a wounded seal on the beach at Fletcher Cove just before the attack, the latter being a typical sign of sharks feeding in the area. Recent increases in the seal population along the Southern California coast — and the seals&#x27; tendency to swim in close proximity to human swimmers — are suspected to be contributing factors in the attack.

=== Eden Gardens ===

The neighborhood of La Colonia de Eden Gardens, also known as La Colonia and Eden Gardens, is one of the oldest residential areas of Solana Beach. The community was formed in the 1920s by Mexican farmers who were hired by the owners of large ranches in adjacent Rancho Santa Fe. These farmers wanted their families nearby, hence the formation of &quot;La Colonia&quot; (the colony). The name Eden Gardens came later from a land developer as a marketing tool. Many residents still refer to the area as La Colonia. Famous residents include Chicano rapper Lil Rob, who was born and raised in the community.

==Geography and climate==

Before the city incorporated, the county allowed highly concentrated development of large condominiums atop the sandstone bluffs. Geologists studying erosion in period between 1947 and 1977 found little change in the face of the bluffs. It turned out this was a time of very few storms with very little erosion along the coast. The city has had to deal with bluffs collapsing onto the beach and damaging the improvements above. Owners threatened by wave and storm damage to the cliffs have few options.

The Pacific Ocean is to the west; the community of Cardiff-by-the-Sea to the north, and the City of Del Mar to the south. The unincorporated village of Rancho Santa Fe is located on the east side.

Solana Beach is located at (32.992937,-117.271135).

<text>Vista (; Spanish for &quot;view&quot;) is a city in San Diego County, California. It is a medium-sized city within the San Diego-Carlsbad, CA metropolitan statistical area. As of the 2020 census, Vista had a population of 98,381. Current data estimates a 2023 population of 99,835. Vista&#x27;s sphere of influence also includes portions of unincorporated San Diego County to the north and east, with a county island in the central west. Located just inland from the Pacific Ocean, it has a Mediterranean climate.

Much of Vista&#x27;s current territory was once part the Mexican land grants Rancho Buena Vista and Rancho Guajome. A post office was established on October 9, 1882, and Vista was incorporated as a city on January 28, 1963, later becoming a charter city on June 13, 2007.

==History==
The Vista area was originally inhabited by the Luiseño Indians, who established a village in today&#x27;s Vista called &quot;Tovalum.&quot;

The prosperity of the mission-era declined by the 1830s with the independence of Mexico from Spain. The Mexican government began to grant land ownerships to a variety of people, thus beginning the Rancho era of California. Three ranchos were granted in the Vista area: Rancho Guajome, Rancho Buena Vista, and Agua Hedionda Y los Manos.

In the 1850s the ranchos began to fade due to changing political conditions and the scarcity of water. A growing number of settlers came to the area after California became a state in 1850 and began to create smaller agricultural holdings. One settler in the Vista area, John A. Frazier, applied to open the first post office and after several attempts to name the city (Frazier and Buena Vista were already taken), Frazier finally chose the name &quot;Vista&quot;; the post office was opened in 1882.

In 1870, Bernard Delpy arrived from France to build what eventually became known as &quot;Delpy Corners&quot; at the intersection of today&#x27;s East Vista Way and Foothill Drive. His nephew, Jules Jacques Delpy, joined him in 1879 and together they planted several hundred acres of grapes. In 1886, they built the first successful winery in the country. The winery was shut down by the Prohibition era.

Inhibited by the lack of water, Vista grew slowly through the early 1910s to less than 1,000 people. With a 1923, however, the Vista Irrigation District had the necessary funding to construct a new water supply from Lake Henshaw. Agriculture began to flourish in the area, including citrus fruits, tomatoes, celery, and most prominently avocados. Vista became home to multiple avocado packing facilities, and by the late 1940s was promoted as &quot;the avocado capital of the world&quot; The rise in agriculture led in turn to further commercial development.

Following World War II, agriculture declined with an influx of population and housing. The City of Vista was incorporated on January 23, 1963. The frequent housing booms of the 1970s through early 2000s greatly increased the population of Vista, and the city limits have grown as well. Many light manufacturing businesses moved into Vista beginning in the 1980s, and with the founding of several breweries in the 21st century Vista has become a significant element in the San Diego craft beer industry.
Since the 1990s, the downtown area has received about $12 million in investments from Vista for improvements. The City of Vista released a plan in 2015 for the further development of downtown, aiming to make it the main commercial, social, and cultural hub in Vista. In 2020, Vista finished the Paseo Santa Fe corridor project, which transformed almost a mile of Santa Fe Avenue into a pedestrian-friendly street with a number of restaurants and housing complexes.

The mild weather led to the city&#x27;s promotional motto &quot;America&#x27;s Climatic Wonderland&quot;, which was in use for many years.

<text>Escalon (Spanish: &quot;Escalón&quot;, meaning &quot;Step&quot;) is a city in San Joaquin County, California, United States. The population was 7,472 at the 2020 census, up from 7,132 at the 2010 census and 5,963 at the 2000 census. Escalon is a Spanish word meaning &quot;stepping stones.&quot; Founder John Wheeler Jones is said to have come upon the name in a book in the Stockton Free Library and liked it so much that he gave it to the town.

==History==
Before the advent of the railroad, the traveler in riding over the French Camp road to the Stanislaus River would notice far out on the plains a large two-story brick house. It was surrounded by trees and shrubs, barns, granaries, and was the only house for miles around. It was the home of &quot;Johnny&quot; Jones, who crossed the plains in 1852 and pitched his tent where Escalon now stands, the country at that time being Government land covered with sage brush. He acquired the amount of land allotted to settlers and started to farm it, planting the first grain ever grown in the Escalon country. He seeded it by broadcast and dragged it in with brush. The yield was heavy and sold for five cents a pound. 

He began raising cattle for market and purchased more land until he owned 8,000 acres, a tract more than three miles square. Six to twelve-horse teams were used to plow the fields where Escalon was later developed. In 1867 Jones built his brick house on the prairie, at a cost of $12,000. His brother Richard made the bricks from a field east of Sexton station. In those days all freight carried from Stockton to the mines above Sonora went via the French Camp road, and many of the teamsters boarded and lodged at his farm. The plains were the homes of many antelope, which Jones often served on his table.

Escalon is a Spanish word meaning stepping stones. James W. Jones, the founder of the town, is said to have seen the name in a book in the Stockton Free Library and gave it to the town because he liked it. His father died in 1893, leaving quite a fortune. He willed the old home place to James W., together with the adjoining 1,000 acres. The land was not of any great value, but became more valuable the following year with the construction of the Valley Railroad, whose owners planned to cross Jones&#x27;s land. Jones engaged a surveyor and laid off the town. The boundary lines run nearly north, south, east and west, but the streets run diagonally, so some blocks are square, others oblong, some are rectangular and several blocks are triangular in shape.

John McGinnis, in recording some of the first events in Escalon says, &quot;In the month of August, 1894, I was accosted, in Stockton, by a promoter of the townsite, Mr. Harlon, and was prevailed upon to make the trip to Escalon. The four-horse stage was brought forward by the hostler and James Jones, popularly called &#x27;Jim, &#x27;took the ribbons. Leaving there about 9:00 o&#x27;clock A. M., driving out the old French Camp Road, we arrived at the Jones home place, the brick house, about noon. With hospitality, an attribute of the Jones family, we sat down to a feast, fit for a king, and did full justice to it. We afterwards walked over and viewed the townsite, east of the then only graded roadbed. It was graded by a railroad company called the &#x27;Valley Road.&#x27; We then passed, through a thrifty vineyard, the very first vines to be propagated by Johnny Jones — &#x27;Jim&#x27;s&#x27; father. We then passed the Jones&#x27; blacksmith shop just east, across the road from where the Tidewater depot used to be located. I again visited Escalon in 1900. There was then a depot, a store had been built but had not opened for business, the pioneer saloon, and. a temporary hotel on the Jackson property, also used as a dwelling and post office, Mrs. Jackson being postmistress.&quot;

As soon as the town was surveyed, Jones built a good-sized hotel to accommodate the prospective buyers who came by stage from Stockton, which was located about where the Presbyterian Church now stands. The first Santa Fe train rolled into Escalon in the spring of 1896. The post office and the first store were started by Mrs. Charles Jordan, wife of the station agent, on ground now occupied by the Tuolumne Lumber Company. The second store was built by merchant Nelson Leighton; it was a large two-story building facing the railroad. The hall on the second floor was used for social functions. Leighton&#x27;s store had the first telephone switchboard in Escalon. The first warehouse was built by David L. Jones and John A. Coley in 1897, and another was built later by Haslacher &amp; Kahn, of Oakdale. The first long-distance telephone was installed in John Coley&#x27;s residence. He was the first real estate agent and grain dealer in the town, and built many of the dwellings for rent and sale.

The Escalon Commercial Club, formerly known as the Escalon Board of Trade, was organized March 11, 1911, with the following officers: A. St. John, president; C. H. Sheldon, vice-president ; H. L. MacPherson, secretary ; and R. N. Haines, treasurer. They carried out successfully a Fourth of July celebration in 1913, were active in the formation of the irrigation district, saw the Union high school erected, installed a lighting system; succeeded in getting the supervisors to lay some splendid streets, the town not being incorporated, and held a successful community fair in 1917. The following are the past officers of the club elected in June 1912: H. L. MacPherson, president; S. J. Irvin, vice-president; O. A. Fish, secretary ; and W. F. Searcy, treasurer ; September 8, 1914, H. L. MacPherson, president; J. H. Martin, vice-president; E. AV. Bidwell, secretary; A. Kerr, treasurer; October 16, 1916, H. L. MacPherson, president; E. W. Bidwell, vice-president; H. L. Morgensen, secretary; and Dr. J. M. Carr, treasurer; March 10, 1917, John R. Martin, president; S. R. King, vice-president; H. A. Bierschal, secretary; and C. Moorehead, treasurer.

The school was first opened near the celebrated lone tree as early as 1878. It was in session six months of the year, with an enrollment of 31 boys and girls, with an average attendance of 15 pupils. After the founding of Escalon, the school district was divided, and a new district school started in the new town. The trustees of the new district, two of them, AV. A. Owens and J. A. Coley, succeeded in getting the people to bond the district for a small sum and the money was used in purchasing a lot in 1903 and erecting a two-room schoolhouse. The first teacher, Miss Stella Reynolds, had formerly taught at the Lone Tree school. The school has had a steady and substantial growth during its first decade and in 1914 it was found necessary to provide larger accommodations for the pupils. The citizens voted for more bonds, the present grammar school grounds were purchased and a handsome building was constructed of hollow tile. The number of students continued to increase and last year an additional four class rooms were built&#x27; at a cost of $18,000. The entire building was then covered with mastic. One, of the features of the additional rooms was an assembly hall seating about 400 persons which can be used as a public auditorium. Mrs. Grace Taylor Pearce has been principal for the past nine years and under her administration the school has been placed on the accredited list of the county.

In 1916, residents decided they wanted a high school; this was a relatively new addition to public schools. says Prof. Oliver E. Irons, that the citizens realized the necessity of a high school. The Escalon Commercial Club led the campaign to approve bonds for funding. The proposition was defeated by three votes, but in 1919 a second bond campaign was passed. A five-member school board was quickly elected: AV. L. Cooms, C. A. Smith, H. L. Morgansen, Otto Peterson, and H. H. McKinney.

The Jones club house was secured and school started in September with Mr. F. AA. Denny and Mrs. A. Cowan as instructors. Mrs. Cowan resigned in mid-year and her place was taken by Miss Orr. The total enrollment the first year was thirty-five. In the second year the enrollment of seventy-five pupils overtaxed the seating capacity of the club house. Citizens of the district voted for a bond of $85,000 for suitable high school rooms. The building was completed early this year with the following teachers in charge : Oliver E. Irons, principal ; Paul B. Boehnecke, Miss Nydia Jensen, Miss Minnie Smith, Miss Ruth Williams, and Miss Stella Barnett, under whose able instructions all classes are progressing rapidly.

The Methodist Church was the first church in Escalon. The church was organized in the Lone Tree section in 1893, during the pastorate of the Rev. John Stevens, later for five years pastor of the Central Methodist church of Stockton. While the church was at Lone Tree Corners, it was on a circuit with Farmington, Atlanta, Riverbank and Oakdale. It remained at Lone Tree Corners until September 1908, when the building was moved to Escalon. This building stood until being replaced by a new structure, completed and dedicated on Sunday, April 10, 1921. Since then, the following pastors have been appointed here: U. L. Walker, L. H. Sanborn, Luther Speers, Smith, McWilliams, A. Z. Bose, S. L. Lee, G. W. Grannis, L. H. Jenkins and C. G. Zierk.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church was organized November 15, 1909, by the Rev. Phillip Andreen of San Francisco, assisted by David Magunson of Stockton. Subscriptions were obtained in November 1911 and a building was erected, just west of the old school house in 1913. It was dedicated in the summer of the following year, 1914. The following pastors have been in charge, the Rev. W. X. Magnuson, 1912, Dr. P. E. Berg. 1913; Rev: C. Anderson, 1916; Rev. N. P. Anseen, 1921 : Rev. O. W. Westhng-, 1922.

The Presbyterian Church was organized November 10, 1913, with the following charter members : Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Campbell, Miss Margaret Campbell, Miss Helen Campbell, Mr. S. H. Irwin, Mrs. Minerva H. Erwin, Mr. and Mrs. E. W. Bidwell, Mrs. O. A. Fisk, Miss Leona Kelley, Miss Hazel Delley, Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Clough, Mrs. J. G. Voorhies. Of the original members, ten remain and are living in and around Escalon, three have moved away, and one is deceased. Services were first held in the Community hall, but in 1915 the trustees purchased the pioneer gram- mar school building and fitted it up for church purposes. The first pastor. Rev. E. B. David- son, served until October 1, 1915, and during the succeeding two months the pulpit was occupied by the Rev. A. M. Wood, then the Rev. I. B. Surface was pastor until December 1, 1916. In March 1917, the Rev. A. L. Bone took charge and was installed the following year.
Escalon came into being in the late 1800s because of the agricultural production in the immediate area and the need to get the products of that agriculture to market by railroad. John Wheeler Jones settled here with his family in the 1850s, and his son, James Wesley Jones, laid out the community of Escalon 40-plus years later. Although Escalon was incorporated in 1957, and celebrated its 50-year anniversary in 2007 by proclamation of Escalon&#x27;s city council, 1994 was officially acknowledged as the year to celebrate the Escalon centennial.

In 1898, the Santa Fe Depot was constructed (along the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad line) and operated until 1970. It was located alongside the Santa Fe Railroad Tracks that bisect the heart of Escalon near Main Street&#x27;s intersections with Second Street.

In 1909, Oliver A. Fisk began construction on the Fisk Building, completing it in 1911. This building is still located at the corner of Main and First Streets in its modified form. The first business to occupy this building was the Escalon State Bank, the first bank in town, in 1912. The bank was established by S.J. Irwin, the owner of the Irwin Lumber Company.

==Transportation==

===Railroads===

Escalon has two railways through town. The former Tidewater Southern Railway comes west from Manteca parallel to Highway 120 until it hits McHenry Avenue and heads south out of town. This railway is owned and operated by Union Pacific Railroad and is still in use today, though the tracks end at the city limits of Jones Avenue.

BNSF Railway Stockton Subdivision is the second railway; it has two tracks, dividing the town in a northwest to southeast direction. Two trains will meet and pass on opposing rails through town, often backing up traffic along Highway 120 for over 20–30 mins.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, French Camp has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
French Camp was the southernmost regular camp site of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company southern fur brigades sent from Fort Vancouver (now Vancouver, Washington), established by Michel Laframboise in 1832. Its Spanish name was preserved in a land grant dated January 13, 1844 as Rancho Campo de los Franceses. It is commemorated as California State Historic Landmark 668:
Here was the terminus of the Oregon-California trail used by the French-Canadian trappers employed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company from about 1832 to 1845. Michel Laframboise, among others, met fur hunters here annually, where they camped with their families. In 1844 Charles Maria Weber and William Gulnac promoted the first white settlers&#x27; colony on &quot;Rancho del Campo de Los Franceses&quot; which included French Camp and the site of Stockton.
French Camp was also known as Castoria, the Latin word for &quot;beaver&quot; being &quot;castor&quot;, reflecting its central role in the California Fur Rush.

French Camp was strategically sited at the southern end of the southernmost slough (which became known as French Camp Slough) of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, maximizing the use of the waterway for ease of transportation. A trail led off from the site to the southeast into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It was subsequently used as an alternate route for the Mariposa Road, part of the Stockton-Los Angeles Road, especially favored during the rainy season because of its exceptional drainage. The route was eventually paved and exists to this day as &quot;French Camp Road&quot;.

During WWII, Japanese Americans that lived in French Camp were relocated to civilian assembly centers and relocation centers overseen by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) in accordance with Executive Order 9066. Japanese Americans from French Camp were sent to the Turlock Assembly Center at the Stanislaus County Fair, Manzanar War Relocation Center, and the Gila River War Relocation Center. Accounts of the relocation and life in the camps are detailed through letters from former students of the French Camp Grammar School.

<text>Lathrop (, ) is a city located south of Stockton in San Joaquin County, California, United States. The 2020 census reported that Lathrop&#x27;s population was 28,701. The city is located in Northern California at the intersection of Interstate 5 and California State Route 120, in the San Joaquin Valley.

==History==
Lathrop was developed around railroad interests. The town was founded around 1868 when the first transcontinental railroad was extended to the area after a dispute between the president of the Central Pacific Railroad, Leland Stanford, and the City of Stockton. The two parties had struck a right-of-way agreement to build a railroad through Stockton, but when city officials delayed in deciding where the alignment should go, Stanford decided to instead build the railroad around Stockton and set up a new town along the route.

The new town was platted into 16 subdivisions around the site of a train depot named Wilson&#x27;s Station at a wye built for switching train cars. A merchant store and schoolhouse were built soon after. In 1869, the area was renamed in honor of the family of Leland Stanford&#x27;s wife, Jane Stanford (née Lathrop), and her brother, Charles Lathrop, who worked for Leland as an engineer at Central Pacific.

On September 6, 1869, four months after the golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, the San Joaquin Railroad Bridge at Mossdale Crossing in Lathrop was finished by Western Pacific. This completed the last westbound link of the transcontinental railroad to the Pacific coast, with the first through train arriving that evening, making Lathrop an important division point and rail stop. In 1871, a post office opened in Lathrop. That same year, the railroad built a hotel for $50,000 called Hotel Lathrop, said to be one of the largest in the state of California at the time.

Throughout the 1870s, Lathrop was an important rail stop for the transcontinental railroad. This generated steady growth in the area, with the population increasing to about 600 by 1879.

In February 1886, the railroad&#x27;s hotel caught fire and was destroyed. That, along with the railroad deciding to move its roundhouse and machine shops to nearby Tracy, California around the same time, caused Lathrop to enter into a period of economic and population decline until World War I.
On August 14, 1889, former Chief Justice of California David S. Terry assaulted United States Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field, at the train station in Lathrop. Field&#x27;s bodyguard, United States Marshal David Neagle (formerly assigned to Tombstone, Arizona), shot and killed Terry. The events led to the United States Supreme Court decision &quot;In re Neagle&quot;, which granted immunity from state prosecution to federal officers acting within the scope of their federal authority.

During the 1940s, Lathrop expanded from its original townsite to an area of about five square miles. Following World War II, housing tracts were built and several large industrial employers moved there. Residential growth slowed during the 1950s and 1960s, but picked up again in the subsequent decades, doubling in population to 2,137 in 1970 and reaching 6,841 by 1990.

Lathrop was incorporated in 1989, and its first General Plan adopted in 1991.

<text>Lodi ( ) is a city located in San Joaquin County, California, United States, in the center portion of California&#x27;s Central Valley. The population was 66,348 at the 2020 census.

==History==
When a group of local families decided to establish a school in 1859, they settled on a site near present-day Cherokee Lane and Turner Road. In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad was in the process of creating a new route, and pioneer settlers Ezekiel Lawrence, Reuben Wardrobe, A. C. Ayers, and John Magley offered a townsite of to the railroad as an incentive to build a station there. The railroad received a &quot;railroad reserve&quot; of in the middle of town, and surveyors began laying out streets in the area between Washington to Church and Locust to Walnut. Settlers flocked from nearby Woodbridge, Liberty City, and Galt including town founders John M. Burt and Dan Crist.

Initially called Mokelumne and Mokelumne Station after the nearby Mokelumne River, confusion with other nearby towns prompted a name change, which was officially endorsed in Sacramento by an assembly bill. Several stories have been offered about the origins of the town&#x27;s name change. One refers to a locally stabled trotting horse that had set a four-mile (6 km) record, but as the horse reached the peak of its fame in 1869, it is unlikely that its notoriety would still have been evident in 1873. Alternatively, Lodi is a city in northern Italy where Napoleon defeated the Austrians in 1796 and won his first military victory. More than likely, some of the earliest settler families were from Lodi, Illinois, and they chose to use the same name as their hometown.

In 1906, the city was officially incorporated by voters, passing by a margin of 2 to 1. The fire department was established in 1911, and the city purchased the Bay City Gas and Water Works in 1919. Additional public buildings constructed during this period include the Lodi Opera House in 1905, a Carnegie library in 1909, and a hospital in 1915.

==Economy==

Early industries in Lodi included a sawmill, flour mill, vineyards, orchards, and cattle ranching.

The Lodi Land and Lumber Company sawmill was built on the south bank of the Mokelumne River in 1877, and relied on logs floated down from the Sierra during the rainy season. The mill was powered by a steam engine and had a capacity of {{convert|40000|board feet|m3}} per day.{{r|Hillman 1985|page=32}}

The early 20th century saw the establishment of several large manufacturers and general service providers with national distribution capabilities, such as Supermold, the Pinkerton Foundry, Lodi Truck Service, the Lodi Iron Works, Pacific Coast Producers, Holz Rubber Company, Valley Industries, General Mills, and Goehring Meat Company.{{r|Hillman 1985|page=35–36}} Lodi is the birthplace of A&amp;W Root Beer and A&amp;W Restaurants, established in 1919, which subsequently became one of the first franchised fast food restaurants.

According to the city&#x27;s 2021 comprehensive annual financial report, the top employers in the city were:
==Arts and culture==

===A&amp;W Root Beer===
Lodi is the birthplace of A&amp;W Root Beer, the first batch of which was made in 1919 on a hot dog cart during a parade. The spot where Roy W. Allen sold his root beer is now marked with a plaque. It is now sold in cans and bottles throughout the US, as well as in a chain of American restaurants. Lodi&#x27;s A&amp;W restaurant features a vast collection of A&amp;W novelties.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

===Farmers market===
The Farmers Market is held every Thursday evening from May 18 through September 1 (as of 2016) on School Street in Downtown Lodi. It is hosted and run by the Lodi Chamber of Commerce. It offers a large collection of fresh produce as well as baked goods, crafts, food vendors, and live entertainment.

===Grapes and wine===

Lodi and its surroundings are well known for the cultivation of grapes and production of wine. There are many vineyards in Lodi with century-old grapevines, some going into California wines like Bedrock and Turley. Starting in the early 20th century, and right up to the early 1980s, Lodi promoted itself as the &quot;Tokay Capital of the World&quot; due to the abundance of the Flame Tokay variety in the area. Nowadays there are over 100 different grape varieties planted in the Lodi AVA in over {{convert|113,000|acres}} of vineyards. The town is surrounded by grapevines and the police cars have grape bunches painted on the sides of them. Winegrape culture pervades the town, with many business, street, and school names relating to the industry.

The &quot;Flame Tokay&quot; grape was introduced from Algeria in 1857 and was a central feature of the vineyards that gradually rose to prominence because of the sandy loam soil and the location directly east of the Suisun Pass. Local Marvin Nies used old flame tokay vines located on property farmed by Malcolm Lea to create, in conjunction with U.C. Davis plant breeding specialists, the seedless Tokay. Malcolm Lea, a co-founder of Guild Winery and East-Side Winery, sold substantial quantities of crushed grapes to Inglenook and other older Napa wineries, as well as truckloads of crushed grapes to San Francisco restaurants that made their own &quot;house&quot; wines. For a brief period during the late 19th century, the vines were usurped in favor of watermelons and wheat, but price cuts and labeling problems encouraged farmers to plant more vines.{{Clarify|reason=What does this statement mean that watermelons/wheat could not be properly labelled or wines and how does that reflect in planting more vines when if there is a market glut because sales are unpredictable then why plant more vines?|date=February 2019}}{{r|Hillman 1985|page=35}}

In 1991, Lodi winegrape growers decided to self-impose a tax{{clarify|date=November 2024|reason=A tax or a voluntary levy?}} on their grapes to fund the Lodi Winegrape Commission. In 1992, the commission launched an integrated pest management program, known as Lodi Rules. In 2014, the commission was awarded a Governor&#x27;s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award for the Lodi Rules program. In 2015, Lodi was named Wine Region of the Year by &quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot; magazine. The Wine Bloggers Conference of 2016 brought over 300 wine bloggers to the area, where attendees filled the Internet with compliments about the small-town hospitality of Lodi&#x27;s approachable, authentic winegrowing community.

Every September the Lodi Grape Festival is held and includes rides, food, and wine tasting. The Wine &amp; Food Festival (formerly known as the Spring Wine Show, held in late March/early April, so as not to coincide with Easter every year) also showcases the area&#x27;s 50-plus wineries. Beginning in 2016 there will also be a Beer Fest showcasing IPA and other types of beer along with food and music.

Conceived in 2005 by the Lodi Winegrape Commission, the Zinfest wine event is held at Lodi Lake and features Zinfandel wines. Usually held on the third weekend of May, this event includes a Friday-night dinner called &quot;Vintner&#x27;s Grille&quot;. As of 2020, Zinfest was renamed to RowXRow, but the 2020 festival was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Museums===

The Hill House Museum, a restored Queen Anne Victorian built around 1901 for an early, skilled jeweler/watchmaking Lodian, George Hill, contains historical exhibits relating to the history of the town, including the house&#x27;s original furniture.

The San Joaquin County Historical Society and Museum, the largest museum complex in the county, is just south of Lodi, at the Micke Grove Regional Park, and traces the history of the area through many exhibits and interactive displays.

World of Wonders, a downtown science museum, features interactive science exhibits, classrooms, and a retail store. The museum first opened on January 4, 2009.

===Theater===
Changing Faces Theater Company is a non-profit, student-run organization that is supported by the Lodi Arts Commission. An annual two-week production occurs each summer and is cast with mostly local children ranging from age six up to college students and, sometimes, a few adults. The production is normally staged at Jessie&#x27;s Grove Winery, where a number of additional activities are typically held at the same time.

Lodi Musical Theater Company is also prominent in the Lodi theater community, staging shows at Hutchins Street Square such as &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;.

From the 1970s to the late 1990s, Lodi was also home to the &quot;Tokay Players,&quot; a group of local actors, directors, set builders etc. who had no professional experience, but put on dozens of productions over the period.

==Transportation==

The City of Lodi operates the Lodi GrapeLine local bus service.

Lodi Transit Station is served by Amtrak &quot;San Joaquins&quot; train service on the Sacramento line. It became a regular stop in 2002. The station is also served by Greyhound Lines, San Joaquin Regional Transit District, and South County Transit. The Amtrak Thruway 3 bus line provides additional daily connections from the Lodi Transit Station to/from Sacramento and Stockton

==Emergency services== 
Law enforcement services in Lodi are provided by the Lodi Police Department. Fire department services are provided by the Lodi Fire Department. Emergency medical services are provided by American Medical Response, who have been operating in both Lodi and Stockton since 1992.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

==In popular culture==
A Creedence Clearwater Revival song, &quot;Lodi&quot;, was named for Lodi, California, although the songwriter John Fogerty admits he had never actually visited the city and simply thought it was &quot;the coolest sounding name.&quot;

The opening scene from the film, &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, where Paul Newman was cutting the parking meters, was shot in Lodi.

Lodi was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;Road Trip&quot; Episode 144. Lodi is also often mentioned in the FX show, &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;. The show takes place in the fictional town of &quot;Charming&quot;, which is said to neighbor Lodi.

<text>Manteca is a city in San Joaquin County, California. The city had a population of 83,498 as of the 2020 Census. It is part of the Stockton-Lodi, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Manteca is a city in the Central Valley of California, located east of San Francisco and 18 miles (29 kilometers) northwest of Modesto. The Manteca area was first inhabited by Yokuts. Manteca was formally established in 1861 by Joshua Cowell. Cowell claimed around and built houses on what is now the corner of Main and Yosemite, where Bank of America now stands. In 1873, the Central Pacific Railroad laid track directly through the area. The residents wanted to refer to their new train station as &quot;Cowell Station&quot;, but there was already a Cowell Station near Tracy. The residents agreed to change the name of the community, choosing &quot;Monteca&quot; as the new name. This was misprinted as &quot;Manteca&quot; (Spanish for lard) by the railroad, and the misspelled version was eventually accepted as the name of the town. In 1918, Manteca was incorporated as a city, and Joshua Cowell became its first mayor.

In 1935, photojournalist Dorothea Lange took photos of William &amp; Mary Dimotakis (immigrants from the Greek island of Crete), and their youngest child, son George, on the family farm in Manteca for the Farm Security Administration. The farm, near the industrial park area, is still owned by the Dimotakis family. The images can be found in the Library of Congress.

Manteca fashions itself the &quot;Family City&quot;, and it lies at a crossroads of major highways and railroads. As recently as the 1970s, Manteca existed primarily on agriculture and was still barely a stop between two freeways, Interstate 5 and State Route 99. The continuing rise in Bay Area housing prices caused Bay Area families to look further eastward for more affordable places to live. Since the construction of the 120 bypass portion of State Route 120, Manteca has become a popular choice for these commuters. The 1990s saw an increase in the city&#x27;s population and the construction of its third high school (Sierra High School), joining Manteca High School and East Union High School. The population of Manteca continues to increase, with some housing being constructed on what was once farmland to the north and southeast. Manteca has more than tripled in population since 1980.

Manteca is the home base for the &quot;Not Forgotten Memorial Day Event&quot;, the largest commemoration for veterans on the West Coast. The event is held annually on the Sunday before Memorial Day. The event draws over 20,000 attendees.
