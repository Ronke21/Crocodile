<text>North Palm Beach is an incorporated village in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The village won an award from the National Association of Home Builders as best planned community of 1956. The North Palm Beach Country Club is home to a Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course.

==History==
In 1954 for $5.5 million John D. MacArthur bought of land in northern Palm Beach County that had been owned originally by Harry Seymour Kelsey and later by Sir Harry Oakes. The land included most of today&#x27;s North Palm Beach as well as Lake Park, Palm Beach Gardens and Palm Beach Shores. MacArthur then began developing what is now North Palm Beach, which sat on former mangrove swamps and farm land. The area was punctuated only by Monet Road and Johnson Dairy Road to the north and south and US 1 and Prosperity Farms Road to the east and west.

Full-scale development and incorporation as a village occurred nearly simultaneously in 1956, with extensive dredging creating waterfront cul-de-sacs, and the development of a new east-west artery, Lighthouse Drive, connecting Old Dixie Highway and the newly aligned US 1. US 1 was widened and became the main office and civic corridor. Sir Harry Oakes&#x27; castle-like home on US 1 became the clubhouse for the North Palm Beach Country Club, which is located on the village island surrounded by the Intracoastal Waterway reached by three bridges Lighthouse Drive bridge to the West, the Earmon River bridge to the south, and the Parker drawbridge to the north.

In 1960–1961, North Palm Beach elected Walter E. Thomas, Jr. as its fourth Mayor. Walter and his wife Jackie and four children (Ted, Larry, Jim, and Pam) were the 55th family to move into the Village, arriving in 1957.

Lake Park West Road was also extended from Old Dixie Highway to US 1 and was renamed Northlake Boulevard, becoming the village&#x27;s main commercial corridor.

The North Palm Beach Country Club is publicly owned by the Village of North Palm Beach and is open to the general public seven days a week. It first opened in 1963. The original mid-century modernism club house was demolished in 2018 and a new clubhouse tagged as Anglo-Caribbean was built in its place in 2019.

<text>Ocean Ridge is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 1,830 at the 2020 US census.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the Town of Ocean Ridge is located in South Florida at .

Ocean Ridge is a small coastal community along Florida State Road A1A. It lies 1.6 miles north of Briny Breezes, 1.3 miles east of Boynton Beach and 4.3 miles south of South Palm Beach. To the east lies the Atlantic Ocean.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (57.00%) is water.

==Climate==
The Town of Ocean Ridge has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is part of the only region in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;), bordering a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Am&quot;).

==History==
The Town of Ocean Ridge was founded in 1931 as the Town of Boynton Beach, which was originally part of the Town of Boynton. Major Nathan S. Boynton toured the area in 1894, and established the Boynton Beach Hotel in 1897. The Town of Boynton was incorporated in 1920. In 1925 Addison Mizner drew plans for a 2,000 room hotel in Boynton. The hotel, said to cost between $8,000,000 and $10,000,000 was touted as &quot;one of the largest and most magnificent hotel in south Florida.&quot; Some local disagreements and the 1926 and 1928 hurricanes along with the bush following the boom squashed the dream. Mizners property, &quot;Mizner Mile&quot; was sold to Col. Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune in 1930 who turned the property into his private estate. It was the largest transaction in Palm Beach County real estate history.

In 1931, due to disputes over beach area property taxes and the Town of Boynton&#x27;s rising debt load, twelve homes created the &quot;Town of Boynton Beach&quot;. But in 1937, the Town Commission called a special emergency meeting over changing Boynton Beach&#x27;s name, because mail was being missent to Daytona Beach due to the similarities in name. Marion White Bird, the daughter of then Mayor Michael White, suggested the name &quot;Ocean Ridge&quot; and won a contest for choosing a new name. The name was officially changed to &quot;Ocean Ridge&quot; in 1939. Two years later, the Town of Boynton itself changed its name, to &quot;Boynton Beach&quot;.

<text>Pahokee is a city located on the shore of Lake Okeechobee in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida. The population was 5,524 in the 2020 census.

According to the 2020 U.S. Census, 57% of the residents of Pahokee were African American and 33% were Hispanic or Latino. In 2018, the Mayor, Kenneth W. Babb, as well as the four members of the City Commission were all African American.

==History==

Pahokee was incorporated in 1922. The name &quot;Pahokee&quot; means &quot;grassy waters&quot; in the Creek language. Local residents refer to Pahokee as &quot;The Muck&quot;, which signifies the mineral-rich dark soil in which sugar cane, citrus fruits, and corn are grown by agribusinesses. In the 1930s, it was known as the &quot;Winter Vegetable Capital of the World&quot;.

The city was severely affected, as were the other communities to the south of the lake, by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Hurricane Wilma, in 2005, destroyed a newly built marina.

==Economy==

Pahokee was founded on the produce grown in the muck, the fertile bottom of the Everglades after part of it was drained in the early 20th century. In 1939, the Federal Writers&#x27; Project guide said of Pahokee: &quot;From Christmas until April, Pahokee is a 24-hour town; long trains of refrigerated cars roll out for northern markets day and night.&quot; &quot;The streets are noisy and crowded; bars, restaurants and gambling places are never closed.&quot;

In 1963, with access to Cuban sugar restricted, a sugar plant was built, and agriculture shifted to the mechanized crop of sugar cane. The plant closed in 2009.

As a result, it is one of two Palm Beach County cities—the other is South Bay—on a list of 13 Florida municipalities in &quot;a state of financial emergency.&quot; Records suggest it has been on the list continually since 1994. Unemployment exceeds 25%. Taxable property values dropped from about $99 million in 2007 to $66 million in 2014. A fifth of the population has migrated in the past 15 years. Dissolution of the city has been proposed.

On November 15, 1996, the old Pahokee High School building, built in 1928, was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

=== Everglades Regional Medical Center ===
Everglades Regional Medical Center, at 200 S. Barfield Highway was founded in 1936 as Everglades General Hospital; the current building opened in 1950. The 63-bed general hospital, financially nonviable, closed in 1998 after years of contention, a change from public to private ownership, and three lawsuits.

=== Glades Health Care Center ===

Adjacent to the former hospital, at 230 S. Barfield Highway, is Glades Health Care Center, a 120-bed skilled nursing facility, with about 70 full-time employees.

:Pahokee High School is best known for its football program that consistently ranks among the state&#x27;s best. Pahokee, together with nearby rival Belle Glade, with whom it competes each year in the &quot;Muck Bowl&quot;, has &quot;sent at least 60 players to the National Football League&quot;. &quot;In Muck City, football is salvation, an escape from the likelihood of prison or early death.&quot; &quot;Football is the chief subject taught at Pahokee High,&quot; a town historian wrote in 1963.

== Miracle Village ==

Miracle Village, founded by a minister, offers a small residential community for registered sex offenders, who sometimes have great difficulty in finding housing, or are homeless (see Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony), because of Florida&#x27;s strict regulations limiting where sex offenders can live. It is located about three miles east of Pahokee, on Muck City Road, in a former migrant worker facility, surrounded by sugar cane fields. This helps the offenders better integrate into society and not be a burden or commit further crimes in order to survive after serving their time mandated by the state and being released with little or no assistance from the Department of Corrections.

== Pahokee in the media ==
On December 18, 2009, Damien Cave, Miami Bureau Chief of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, wrote an article describing Pahokee&#x27;s economic plight and the town&#x27;s hopes that a new marina project might help rejuvenate business. In 2014, Governor Rick Scott pledged $1.3 million towards the restoration of Pahokee&#x27;s infrastructure, in addition to $200,000 pledged by Senator Abruzzo.

== Creative arts about Pahokee ==

===Movies===

====&quot;Chasing Rabbits&quot; (2008)====
A short by Aaron Kyle. Rabbit hunting as running training for would-be football players. Famous Florida State football coach Bobby Bowden makes a cameo appearance. Days after its release, it was shown on ESPN, and an Adidas commercial was made using footage from it.

====&quot;Murder of a Small Town&quot; (2015)====
* James Patterson asks &quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; in the PBS documentary &quot;Murder of a Small Town&quot;, which examines unemployment, crime, drugs and high school football. The documentary deals with Belle Glade as well as Pahokee.

====&quot;The Send-Off&quot; (2016)====
* &quot;The Send-Off&quot;, a 12-minute short by Patrick Bresnan and Yvette Lucas, called an &quot;intimate portrait&quot; of Pahokee, was shown at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. &quot;Emboldened by a giant block party on the evening of their high school prom, a group of students enter the night with the hope of transcending their rural town and the industrial landscape that surrounds them.&quot; Along with others it was nominated for, it won three awards in 2016: the Golden Gate Award for Best Documentary Short at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the Grand Jury Prize – Special Mention, Live Action Short at the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI Fest, and the Grand Jury Award at the South by Southwest Film Festival.

====&quot;The Rabbit Hunt&quot; (2017)====

* &quot;The Rabbit Hunt&quot;, another short by Patrick Bresnan and Yvette Lucas. It differs from &quot;Chasing Rabbits&quot; in its approach to the topic, although the action scenes are similar. The rabbits are driven out of the sugar cane fields by the harvesting machinery, or by smoky, slow-moving fires (humidity is high) deliberately set after harvest to clean up leaves and other waste. The emerging rabbits are killed with clubs, gutted, skinned, cooked, and eaten, or sold to others as meat. Rabbits are a food source for a very poor community; the atmosphere has been called &quot;primitive&quot;. &quot;In the Florida Everglades rabbit hunting is a rite of passage for young men, practiced since the early 1900s. The Rabbit Hunt follows a family as they hunt in the fields of an industrial sugar farm.&quot; Everyone who appears in the film is African-American. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017, and won the award of Outstanding Non-fiction Short in the Cinema Eye awards of the Museum of the Moving Image.

====&quot;Pahokee&quot; (2019)====
* &quot;Pahokee&quot; is a full-length (110 min.) feature from Bresnan and Lucas. It was shown at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The description of its content is: &quot;In the rural town of Pahokee, four teenagers experience the joys and heartbreaks of their last year in high school. This tightly knit community in the Florida everglades struggles with financial insecurity and pin their hopes for the future on their graduating seniors.&quot;
** The film was shown on PBS on February 16, 2021, in the series &quot;America ReFramed&quot;.

====&quot;Outta The Muck&quot; (2023)====
* &quot;Outta The Muck&quot; is a full-length (125 min.) feature from Ira McKinley, Bhawin Suchak, and Tracy Rector. The description of its content is: &quot;Wade into the rich soil of Pahokee, Florida, a town on the banks of Lake Okeechobee. Beyond its football legacy, including sending over a dozen players to the NFL (like Anquan Boldin, Fred Taylor, and Rickey Jackson), the fiercely self-determined community tells their stories of Black achievement and resilience in the face of tragic storms and personal trauma.&quot;
** The film was shown on PBS on February 6, 2023, in the series &quot;Independent Lens&quot;.

<text>Palm Beach is an incorporated town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. Located on a barrier island in east-central Palm Beach County, the town is separated from West Palm Beach and Lake Worth Beach by the Intracoastal Waterway to its west and a small section of the Intracoastal Waterway and South Palm Beach to its south. It is part of the South Florida metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, Palm Beach had a year-round population of 9,245.

The Jaega arrived on the modern-day island of Palm Beach approximately 3,000 years ago. Between 1816 and 1858, the Seminoles were expelled from the area. Americans settlers began to inhabit the area as early as 1872, and opened a post office about five years later. Elisha Newton &quot;Cap&quot; Dimick, later the town&#x27;s first mayor, established Palm Beach&#x27;s first hotel, the Cocoanut Grove House, in 1880, but Standard Oil tycoon Henry Flagler became instrumental in transforming the island of jungles and swamps into a winter resort for the wealthy. Flagler and his workers constructed the Royal Poinciana Hotel in 1894, The Breakers in 1896, and Whitehall in 1902; extended the Florida East Coast Railway southward to the area by 1894; and developed a separate city to house the hotel workers and other laborers. This later became West Palm Beach. The town of Palm Beach was incorporated on April 17, 1911. Addison Mizner also contributed significantly to the town&#x27;s history, designing 67 structures between 1919 and 1924, including El Mirasol, the Everglades Club, La Querida, the William Gray Warden House, and Via Mizner, which is a section of Worth Avenue.

&quot;Forbes&quot; reported in 2017 that Palm Beach had at least 30 billionaires, with the town ranking as the 27th-wealthiest place in the United States in 2016, according to &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;. Many famous and wealthy individuals have resided in the town, including United States presidents John F. Kennedy and Donald Trump. Palm Beach is known for upscale shopping districts, such as Worth Avenue, Royal Poinciana Plaza, and the Royal Poinciana Way Historic District.

== History ==

=== Native beginnings ===
Native Americans previously inhabited the island of Palm Beach, with the Jaega people arriving at least 3,000 years ago. Evidence for their inhabitation of the island are three pre-Columbian archaeological complexes. These complexes include a burial mound, six unmarked Native American cemeteries, and a more recent burial site which suggested interaction between indigenous people and Europeans.

=== 1872–1900 ===
White settlers began arriving in modern-day Palm Beach by 1872. Hiram F. Hammon made the first homestead claim in 1873 along Lake Worth. At the time, the lake area had fewer than 12 people. By 1877, the Tustenegee Post Office was established in modern-day Palm Beach, becoming the lake area&#x27;s first post office. Along the coast of Palm Beach, the &quot;Providencia&quot; wrecked in 1878 with a cargo of 20,000 coconuts, which were quickly planted. In 1880, Elisha Newton &quot;Cap&quot; Dimick converted his private residence to a hotel known as the Cocoanut Grove House. At the time of its opening, the Cocoanut Grove House was the only hotel along Florida&#x27;s east coast between Titusville and Key West. A fire destroyed the hotel in October 1893. The Star Route, also known as the Barefoot Mailman route, began serving the area in 1885. Carriers delivered mail by foot or boat from Palm Beach and other nearby communities to as far south as Miami, a round trip of . The first schoolhouse in southeast Florida (also known as the Little Red Schoolhouse) opened in Palm Beach in 1886.

Henry Flagler, a Standard Oil tycoon, made his first visit to Palm Beach in 1893, and described the area as a &quot;veritable paradise&quot;. That same year, Flagler hired George W. Potter to plot 48 blocks for West Palm Beach, a city to house workers at his hotels, and construction began on the Royal Poinciana Hotel. The Royal Poinciana Hotel opened for business on February 11, 1894. Flagler, also the owner of the Florida East Coast Railway, extended the railroad southward to West Palm Beach by the following month. In 1896, Flagler opened a second hotel originally known as Wayside Inn, before being renamed Palm Beach Inn, and later becoming The Breakers. Fires later burned down the hotel in 1903 and 1925, but it was rebuilt each time. The &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot; began publication in 1897 originally under the name &quot;Daily Lake Worth News&quot;.

=== 1900–1940 ===
The first pedestrian bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway opened near the modern-day Flagler Bridge in 1901, replacing the original railroad spur. Flagler&#x27;s house lots were bought by the beneficiaries of the Gilded Age, and in 1902, Flagler himself built a Beaux-Arts mansion, Whitehall, designed by the New York-based firm Carrère and Hastings and helped establish the Palm Beach &quot;winter season&quot;. Telephone service was established in Palm Beach in 1908, with 18 customers initially. Prior to the 1910s, many African Americans in the area lived in a segregated section of Palm Beach called the &quot;Styx&quot;, with an estimated population of 2,000 at its peak. Between 1910 and 1912, though, African Americans were evicted from the Styx. Most of the displaced residents relocated to the northern West Palm Beach neighborhoods of Freshwater, Northwest, and Pleasant City.

In January 1911, it became known West Palm Beach intended to annex the island of Palm Beach in the upcoming Florida legislative session. Residents objected and hired an attorney from Miami to officially become incorporated. Dimick, Louis Semple Clarke, and 31 other male property owners met at Clarke&#x27;s house and signed a charter to officially incorporate the town of Palm Beach on April 17, 1911. Dimick became the first mayor, John McKenna became town clerk, and Joseph Borman became town marshal, while J. B. Donnelly, William Fremd, John Doe, Enoch Root, and J.J. Ryman served as the first council members. Also in 1911, Dimick built the Royal Park Bridge, with its first incarnation being a wooden structure. Passage from West Palm Beach to Palm Beach on the bridge originally required a toll – 25 cents per vehicle and 5 cents per pedestrian.

Between 1919 and 1924, American resort architect Addison Mizner designed 67 structures in Palm Beach. Some of Mizner&#x27;s clients included Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr., Paul Moore Sr., Gurnee Munn, John Shaffer Phipps, Edward Shearson, Eva Stotesbury, Rodman Wanamaker, and Barclay Harding Warburton II. His designed works included the Costa Bella, El Mirasol, Everglades Club (in collaboration with Paris Singer), El Solano, La Bellucia, La Querida, Via Mizner, Villa Flora, and William Gray Warden House. Via Mizner was the first shopping complex along Worth Avenue, which was then a mostly residential street.

In February 1924, the town council allotted $100,000 to construct a new municipal building. Harvey and Clarke architectural firm designed the building, while Newlon and Stephens built the structure after bidding $160,200 for the contract. The Palm Beach Town Hall opened on December 18, 1925, and is still used for town council meetings. Before its completion, the council meetings took place in a one-story wooden building on Royal Poinciana Way. Also in 1925, citywide construction revenue reached $14 million, attributed to the Florida land boom.

The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane made landfall in the town of Palm Beach, with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h). High winds and storm surge damaged 610 businesses, 60 homes, and 10 hotels, as well as to the Public Service Corporation and Ocean Boulevard. Damage in 1928 dollars totaled $10 million in Palm Beach.

=== 1940–1960 ===

Palm Beach&#x27;s population grew from 1,707 in 1930 to 3,747 in 1940, a 119.5% increase. The Royal Poinciana Hotel, damaged heavily in the 1928 hurricane, also suffered greatly during the Great Depression, and was demolished in 1935. Around 4,000 people purchased the salvageable remains of the hotel. &quot;The Palm Beach-Post Times&quot; estimated some 500 homes could be built from the scraps of the hotel. Residents of Palm Beach established the Society of the Four Arts on January 14, 1936, with Hugh Dillman as the first president. The 1930s decade also saw the construction of the Flagler Memorial Bridge, the northernmost bridge linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach, completed on July 1, 1938. Palm Beach mayor James M. Owens acted as master of ceremonies for the bridge&#x27;s opening, while then–U.S. senator Charles O. Andrews and former U.S. senator Scott Loftin gave speeches during the event.

Early in World War II, the United States Army established a Ranger camp at the northern tip of the island, which could accommodate 200 men. The Palm Beach Civilian Defense Council ordered blackouts in Palm Beach beginning on April 11, 1942. Throughout the war, German U-boats sank 24 ships off Florida, with eight capsized off Palm Beach County between February and May 1942. The Army converted The Breakers into the Ream General Army Hospital, while the Navy converted the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel into a U.S. Naval Special Hospital. The Biltmore Hotel would also become a training school for SPARS, the United States Coast Guard Women&#x27;s Reserve.

On September 15, 1950, the Southern Boulevard Bridge opened, the third and southernmost bridge linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. Palm Beach residents elected Claude Dimick Reese (son of former mayor T.T. Reese and grandson of Dimick) as mayor in 1953. He became the only native-born mayor of Palm Beach in its history. In the 1950s, the town&#x27;s population grew around 56%, from 3,866 in 1950 to 6,055 in 1960.

=== 1960–1990 ===
John F. Kennedy was elected President of the United States in 1960, and selected as his Winter White House La Querida, which his father bought in 1933. In December 1960, police in Palm Beach averted a retired postal worker&#x27;s attempt to assassinate then president-elect Kennedy. The president also spent the last weekend of his life in Palm Beach, several days before his assassination in November 1963. Yvelyne &quot;Deedy&quot; Marix became the first woman elected to the town council in February 1970, and later became the first woman elected mayor of Palm Beach in 1983. Between 1971 and 1977, Earl E.T. Smith served as mayor of Palm Beach. He was previously an Ambassador of the United States to Cuba.

Preservationist Barbara Hoffstot published a book titled &quot;Landmark Architecture in Palm Beach&quot; in 1974. She personally photographed and summarized many older buildings in the town. The book also called for more awareness of and improvements to a system for protecting historic landmarks. The town council responded in 1979 by approving an ordinance establishing the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which identifies and works to protect historic structures.

General Foods and Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post bequeathed Mar-a-Lago to the United States upon her death in 1973, hoping it would be used as a Winter White House. The residence was returned to the Post family in 1981, before being purchased by Donald Trump in 1985 for roughly $10 million. He converted the estate into a club by 1995 and would later use Mar-a-Lago as a Winter White House during his presidency from 2017 to 2021. A nor&#x27;easter in November 1984 caused the &quot;Mercedes I&quot; to crash into the seawall of Mollie Wilmot&#x27;s estate. Wilmot&#x27;s staff served the 10 sailors sandwiches and freshly brewed coffee in her gazebo and offered martinis to journalists reporting on the incident.

=== 1990–2010 ===
On October 31, 1991, the Perfect Storm produced waves in height in Palm Beach. About of seawall at Worth Avenue were destroyed, while some parts of the town experienced coastal flooding, especially along Ocean Boulevard. By that afternoon, police allowed only residents to enter the town. The trial of William Kennedy Smith, a member of the Kennedy family, drew international media attention in 1991. Smith had been accused of committing rape at La Querida, but a trial at the Palm Beach County Court resulted in his acquittal on December 11, 1991. Another notable mayor, Paul Ilyinsky, son of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia and heiress Audrey Emery, was elected to the office in February 1993. The town&#x27;s population peaked at 10,468 people in the 2000 census. In March 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department – under the guidance of Police Chief Michael Reiter – began the first inquiry into the crimes committed by sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, leading to his arrest and indictment in July 2006. Despite an FBI investigation discovering at least 40 victims, the state attorney of Palm Beach County only charged Epstein with soliciting a prostitute and soliciting a minor for prostitution in June 2008. He pleaded guilty on both counts and received a controversial plea deal.

=== 2010–present ===
The town had a population of 8,348 people in 2010, a decrease of 20.3% from the previous census. Palm Beach celebrated its centennial on April 17, 2011. About 1,200 people attended a parade that began at the Flagler Museum (Whitehall). Between February and December 2015, the Town Square, which includes the Addison Mizner Memorial Fountain and the town hall, underwent a $5.7 million restoration. The fountain&#x27;s restoration was named &quot;project of the year&quot; by the American Public Works Association&#x27;s Florida chapter.

The FBI conducted a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022, approved by Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart after a criminal referral by the National Archives and Records Administration relating to classified documents. Although former president Donald Trump surrendered 235 classified documents by June 2022, the search at Mar-a-Lago yielded another 102 such documents. This discovery, along with allegations that Trump transported documents to his golf club in New Jersey and showed them to some guests there, led a grand jury at the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to indict him on 37 felony counts relating to the mishandling of classified documents on June 8, 2023.

===Name===
The January 1878 wreck of the &quot;Providencia&quot; is credited with giving Palm Beach its name. The &quot;Providencia&quot; was traveling from Havana to Cádiz, Spain, with a cargo of coconuts harvested in the Crown Colony of Trinidad and Tobago in the British West Indies, when the ship wrecked near Palm Beach. Many of the coconuts naturalized or were planted along the Palm Beach coast. A lush grove of palm trees soon grew on what was later named Palm Beach.

== Geography ==

Palm Beach is one of the easternmost towns in Florida, though the state&#x27;s easternmost point is in Palm Beach Shores, just north of Lake Worth Inlet. The town is on an long barrier island between the Intracoastal Waterway (locally known as the Lake Worth Lagoon) on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. At no point is the island wider than three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km), and in places it is only 500 feet (150 m) wide. The northern boundary of Palm Beach is the Lake Worth Inlet, though it adjoined with Singer Island until the permanent dredging of the inlet in 1918. To the south, a section of Lake Worth Beach occupies the island in the vicinity of State Road 802, though an exclave of Palm Beach extends farther southward until the northern limits of South Palm Beach. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has an area of , with land accounting for and water covering the remaining . The average elevation of the town is ; the highest point is above sea level on the golf course at the Palm Beach Country Club.

Geologically, the island is a sand-covered ridge of coquina rock. Before settlement, the island was a pronounced coastal ridge bordering the Atlantic Ocean. The Intracoastal Waterway coast was primarily low-lying and swampy; marshy sloughs generally lay between the two features, though an oolitic limestone ridge stood along some parts of the island&#x27;s westward side. Since 1883, the environment has been significantly altered by developing land, the filling of the sloughs, and a receding coastline due to erosion, but the Atlantic ridge is still the dominating topographical feature of the island and acts as a seaward barrier. The former slough areas are flood-prone.

The town and entire barrier island are within Evacuation Zone B, and evacuations are often ordered if a hurricane is forecast to impact the area, most recently in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Palm Beach town officials may deploy law enforcement officers to strategically place roadblocks to limit access to the island during unsafe conditions.

As of 2016, land use of the town is 60% residential, 13% rights-of-way, 10% private group uses, 3% recreational, 3% commercial, 2% public uses, 1% hotels (not including The Breakers), and less than 1% conservation, while The Breakers is a planned unit development accounting for 6% of land use. The remaining 2% of land was vacant. Palm Beach does not have any land dedicated to agricultural or industrial purposes. The town is essentially built out and cannot extend its boundaries.

Conservation is mainly confined to Bingham Island, Fishermen&#x27;s Island, and Hunter&#x27;s Island. Functioning as bird sanctuaries and rookeries, the islands are leased by the National Audubon Society, though state trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund and the Blossom Estate hold the titles to the islands. A part of Blossom Estate Subdivision just south of Southern Boulevard is also designated a conservation area.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Palm Beach has a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) with hot, humid summers and warm, drier winters. The annual average precipitation is , most of which occurs from May through October. In the wet summer season, short-lived heavy afternoon thunderstorms are common. Palm Beach reports more than 2,900 hours of sunshine annually. Although tropical cyclones can impact Palm Beach, strikes are rare, with the last direct hit in 1928.
The wet season is from May to October, when convective thunderstorms and downpours are common. Average high temperatures in Palm Beach are with lows of , though low temperatures at or above are not uncommon. During this period, more than half of the summer days bring occasional afternoon thunderstorms and seabreezes that somewhat cool the rest of the day. The dry season (winter) brings dryer, sunny, and much less humid weather. Between December and March, average high temperatures range from and low temperatures average between . High temperatures occasionally drop below , while at other times highs occasionally reach in mid-winter. The highest recorded temperature, , occurred on July 21, 1941, while the lowest observed temperature, , occurred on December 29, 1894, during the Great Freeze. In some years, the dry season can become quite dry, and water restrictions are imposed.
==Demographics==

The town&#x27;s population peaked at 10,468 people in the 2000 census but fell by 20.3% to 8,348 people in 2010. However, during the &quot;winter season&quot;, defined as November through April, the population of Palm Beach swells to around 25,000. The town&#x27;s affluence and its recreational facilities, shops, restaurants, social scene, and &quot;community-oriented sensibility&quot; were cited when it was selected in June 2003 as America&#x27;s &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; by &quot;Robb Report&quot; magazine.

Palm Beach ranked as the 27th-wealthiest place in the United States in 2016 according to &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;. In the following year, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported the town had 30-plus billionaires.

Palm Beach had the 40th-highest percentage of Russian residents in the United States in 2000, with 10.30% of the populace – tied with Pomona, New York, and the township of Lower Merion, Pennsylvania. It also had the 26th highest percentage of Austrian residents in the United States, at 2.10% of the town&#x27;s population, tied with 19 other municipalities in the United States.

In 2000, the town&#x27;s household income was $109,219. Males had a median income of $71,685 versus $42,875 for females; 5.3% of the population and 2.4% of families were below the poverty line. About 4.6% of those under the age of 18 and 2.9% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. Palm Beach had a median household income of $124,562 and a median family income of $137,867.

==Economy==

In 2018, the town of Palm Beach had an estimated labor force of 2,788 people. Palm Beach had an unemployment rate of just 2.3%, although 66% of the town&#x27;s population was not in the labor force. The most common professions among the town&#x27;s labor force are finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing (24.1%); professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services (23.6%); retail (12.2%); and educational services, health care, and social assistance (10.5%). However, as of 2017, only 4.1% of jobs in Palm Beach were held by residents of the town, with the most common other home destinations being West Palm Beach (15.4%), Palm Beach Gardens (3.9%), Lake Worth Beach (3.7%), Wellington (3.3%), and Greenacres (3.1%).

Tourism is a major industry in the town, bringing in around $5 billion in annual revenue. Palm Beach has several historical and luxurious hotels and lodgings, most notably The Brazilian Court, The Breakers, the Palm Beach Hotel (now the Palm Beach Hotel Condominium), the Tideline Ocean Resort &amp; Spa, and the Vineta Hotel. The Breakers alone employs more than 2,200 people from around the world. The town of Palm Beach also contains Worth Avenue, an upscale shopping and dining district. Known for selling high-quality merchandise since the 1920s, Worth Avenue includes about 250 high-end shops, boutiques, restaurants, and art galleries. Other commercial districts of note include Royal Poinciana Plaza and Royal Poinciana Way Historic District, with the latter being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015 due to its status as &quot;the town&#x27;s original Main Street&quot;, as noted by the &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot;.

==Arts and events==

The Society of the Four Arts is a nonprofit charity organization established in 1936. Located on the north side of Royal Palm Way near the Royal Park Bridge, the Four Arts Plaza has an art gallery, a concert hall auditorium, two libraries, a botanical garden, and a sculpture garden. The two libraries serve as public libraries for the town of Palm Beach, one a children&#x27;s library and the other a general public library. Officially named the Gioconda and Joseph King Library, the town&#x27;s general public library has more than 70,000 items, including books, audiobooks, DVDs, and periodicals. The Dixon Education Building features art studio and classrooms, as well as an apartment for an artist visiting the Society of the Four Arts.

Royal Poinciana Playhouse, near Cocoanut Row and Royal Poinciana Way, formerly hosted ballets, Broadway plays, opera, and other cultural events. Although the venue has been closed since 2004, it remains structurally sound. Up Markets acquired control of the playhouse in 2014 via a long-term lease. In December 2022, extensive renovations began on the building&#x27;s interior, which will have a capacity of about 400 people upon its expected completion in 2024. 

Worth Avenue and its vicinity also has several art galleries, including DTR Modern Galleries, Evey Fine Art Gallery, Galeria of Sculpture, Gallerie Y, and the John H. Surovek Gallery. Additionally, the Norton Museum of Art and its sculpture gardens are just across the Intracoastal Waterway in West Palm Beach.

The Hope for Depression Research Foundation hosts an annual 5K run/walk known as the Race of Hope to Defeat Depression. In 2020, the event raised about $400,000 for depression research. The Palm Beach International Film Festival had been hosted in the town in the months of March and April since 1996. However, the festival has been on hiatus since 2018, following the resignation of CEO Jeff Davis. Various events are hosted on Worth Avenue, including historical walking tours held year-round. Once a year, the &quot;Palm Beach Charity Register&quot; magazine publishes a guide to charitable events held in the town and other nearby localities. The magazine promoted 186 charity galas, luncheons, and parties scheduled between the fall of 2019 and summer of 2020.

==Attractions==

Whitehall reopened as the Flagler Museum on February 6, 1960, after Henry Flagler&#x27;s granddaughter, Jean Flagler Matthews, purchased the property in 1959 to prevent its demolition. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and the National Historic Landmark list in 2000, the museum replicates the original appearance of the house and has exhibits about Flagler himself, Flagler&#x27;s personal railcar (built in 1886), the Florida East Coast Railway, life in the Gilded Age, and the early history of Palm Beach. Almost 100,000 people visit the museum annually. Adjacent to the Flagler Museum and behind the Royal Poinciana Chapel is a giant, almost 200-year old kapok tree, which also attracts visitors.

The Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach established Pan&#x27;s Garden in 1994 along Hibiscus Avenue between Chilean Avenue and Peruvian Avenue. The garden has a statue of Pan (originally designed in 1890 by Frederick William MacMonnies), the ancient Greek god who protects and guards flocks. Another significant feature is the Casa Apava wall, a 1920s tile wall from the remnants of the Casa Apava estate. Encompassing approximately , the garden also features many endangered species of native vegetation.

Bethesda-by-the-Sea, originally a mostly wooden structure built from lumber from the beach in April 1889, is the oldest church in Palm Beach. The church opened at its current location by Christmas 1926. Bethesda-by-the-Sea has hosted the weddings of a few notable individuals, including Donald and Melania Trump in 2005 and Michael Jordan and Yvette Prieto in 2013.

=== Other points of interest ===
The Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce identifies several other points of interest in the town, including:
* Major Alley - Located on Peruvian Avenue just one block north of the western terminus of Worth Avenue, Major Alley (named after architect Howard Major) has six Georgian revival-style cottages built in the 1920s.
* Royal Poinciana Chapel - Built in 1897 by Henry Flagler, he intended for the interdenominational chapel to be used by guests at his hotels. The chapel expanded to 400 seats about a year later. It is adjacent to the Whitehall property.
* Seagull Cottage - Situated between the Royal Poinciana Chapel and Whitehall, Seagull Cottage is the oldest surviving home in the Palm Beach, constructed in 1886 by R.R. McCormick, a railroad and land developer from Denver. Flagler purchased Seagull Cottage from McCormick in 1893 for $75,000, and it remained his winter residence until 1902, when Whitehall was completed. 
* Phipps Plaza Historic District - Described by the &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot; as a &quot;picturesque ensemble&quot; of buildings, the Phipps Plaza Historic District is a tight ring of structures built between the 1920s and the 1940s. Located just north of the intersection of Royal Palm Way and South County Road, the buildings at Phipps Plaza were mostly constructed by the Palm Beach Company, with the assistance of Addison Mizner and Marion Sims Wyeth.
* The Colony Hotel Palm Beach - A British Colonial-style hotel at South County Road and Hammond Avenue, just one block south of Worth Avenue. Opened in 1947, the six floor hotel has eighty-nine rooms and three penthouses.
* Addison Mizner Memorial Fountain - Erected by Mizner himself in 1929, the fountain is in the middle of South County Road directly north of the town hall and to the west of the police department headquarters. The fountain is constructed of double-bowl cast stone. In 2017, the restoration of the fountain was named the project of the year by the American Public Works Association&#x27;s Florida chapter.

==Parks and recreation==

The Recreation Department of Palm Beach oversees several public recreation facilities, including the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center, Palm Beach Docks, Par 3 Golf Course, and many tennis centers. The only public marina in the town, the Palm Beach Docks opened in the 1940s and is along the Intracoastal Waterway between the Royal Palm Bridge and Worth Avenue. Palm Beach Docks has three main docks and eighty-eight boat slips, along with many accommodations for boaters.

There are three public beaches in the town, the Palm Beach Municipal Beach, Phipps Ocean Park, and R. G. Kreusler Park. The former, also known as Midtown Beach, has metered parking spots along South Ocean Boulevard from Royal Palm Way southward to Hammon Avenue. Phipps Ocean Park includes the Little Red Schoolhouse, the first school building in southeast Florida (built in 1886), restored and moved from its original location near where the Flagler Memorial Bridge stands today. The town also has many private beaches, while R. G. Kreusler Park (owned and operated by Palm Beach County) lies directly north of the Lake Worth Municipal Beach. In addition to Pan&#x27;s Garden, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach also owns the Ambassador Earl T. Smith Memorial Park and Fountain, a small, 0.24 acre (0.097 ha) park near the town hall.

The town has three bicycling and pedestrian paths. The Lake Trail is a 4.7 mile (7.6 km) path along the Intracoastal Waterway from Worth Avenue to near the Lake Worth Inlet. Another trail, the County Road Pedestrian Path/Bicycle Lane is around in length from Kawama Lane to Bahama Lane along North County Road. The third path is the Southern Pedestrian/Bicycle Path, running from Sloan&#x27;s Curve to the town&#x27;s southern boundaries along State Road A1A, a distance of roughly .

Palm Beach has several social and golf clubs, most notably the Everglades Club and Mar-a-Lago. The former, built by Addison Mizner and Paris Singer in 1918, had the original purpose of being a hospital for soldiers injured in World War I. However, the war soon ended and the facilities were restructured into a private club which opened in January 1919. Some of the amenities include a golf course, tennis courts, and reception halls. Everglades Club has nearly 1,000 members. The club, which is very exclusive, does not have a website and prohibits cellphones. Mar-a-Lago is 126-room, 62,500-square-foot (5,810 m2) mansion that features many hotel-style amenities. Built between 1924 and 1927, General Foods and Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post originally owned the estate, but willed it to the United States government prior to her death in 1973 in hopes the residence would be used as a Winter White House. Mar-a-Lago was returned to the Post family in 1981, before being sold to future United States president Donald Trump in 1985 for approximately $10 million.

==Government==

Palm Beach operates under a council–manager form of government. The town&#x27;s legislative body, the town council, is composed of five members, who serve two-year terms and seek office in staggered, at-large, non-partisan elections. Once a month, the town council meets at the Palm Beach Town Hall, though special meetings may be conducted as needed. The mayor, also elected to two year terms, acts as ombudsman and an intergovernmental figure. Danielle Moore, a former three-term member of the town council, has served as mayor since April 13, 2021. Additionally, a town manager has the authority to appoint and supervise the senior management team, including the deputy town manager and department directors. The officeholder of town manager is appointed annually by the town council. Kirk Blouin, a former Palm Beach chief of police and later Director of Public Safety, has served as town manager since February 13, 2018.

Palm Beach is part of Florida&#x27;s 22nd congressional district, which has been represented by Democrat Lois Frankel since 2023. The town at the state level is part of the 89th district of the Florida House of Representatives, which covers many of the immediate coastal cities in Palm Beach County from Palm Beach Shores southward. Palm Beach is also part of the 30th district of the Florida Senate, which includes northeastern and some of east-central Palm Beach County. Two districts represent the town at the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners. The town north of Worth Avenue is part of the 1st district, while the 7th district covers areas south of Worth Avenue. Palm Beach is a generally Republican town. In 2016, Donald Trump received 3,231 votes and Hillary Clinton received 2,612 votes.

==Education==
The School District of Palm Beach County operates one school in the town, Palm Beach Public Elementary School, on Cocoanut Row between Seaview Avenue and Royal Palm Beach and directly east of the Society of the Four Arts. Opened in 1929, Palm Beach Public Elementary School has a school grade of A and an attendance of 362. Palm Beach Day Academy is a private school in the area. It was formed in 2006 from a merger between Palm Beach Day School and the Academy of the Palm Beaches. The school has one campus in Palm Beach and another in West Palm Beach. Most public middle school students attend Conniston Community Middle School in West Palm Beach, while students who live in the southern portions of the town attend Lake Worth Middle School. Public high school students in northern Palm Beach attend Palm Beach Gardens Community High School and students residing elsewhere in the town attend Forest Hill Community High School. Palm Beach is also near Dreyfoos School of the Arts, though that school has no attendance boundaries.

There are no colleges or universities in Palm Beach. However, the nearby cities of Lake Worth Beach and West Palm Beach have a few public and private higher education institutes, including Keiser University, Palm Beach Atlantic University, and Palm Beach State College.

==Media==

The town is served by the &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot;, with a daily circulation of approximately 4,500. The &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot; began publishing in 1897 under the name &quot;Daily Lake Worth News&quot;. Between 1925 and 1974, the newspaper was published in a building that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. Owned by Cox Enterprises since 1969, GateHouse Media purchased the newspaper and &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; in May 2018. The &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot; is also known as &quot;The Shiny Sheet&quot; due to its former heavy, slick newsprint stock.

Residents of the town are also served by &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, which is actually published in West Palm Beach. &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; had the 5th largest circulation for a newspaper in Florida as of November 2017 and is served to subscribers throughout Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.

Palm Beach is part of the West Palm Beach–Fort Pierce television market, ranked as the 38th largest in the United States by Nielsen Media Research. The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks including WPTV-TV/5 (NBC), WPEC/12 (CBS), WPBF/25 (ABC), WFLX/29 (FOX), WTVX/34 (CW), WXEL-TV/42 (PBS), WTCN-CD/43 (MYTV), WWHB-CD/48 (TBD), WHDT/59 (Court TV), WFGC/61 (CTN), WPXP-TV/67 (ION), as well as local channel WBWP-LD/57 (Ind.). Since 2017, the Palm Beach Civic Association has produced weekly video newscasts, known as Palm Beach TV, which have a weekly viewership of approximately 12,000.

Many radio stations are within range of the town. Radio stations WRMF (97.9 FM) and WPBV-LP (98.3 FM) are both based in the town of Palm Beach.

==Historic preservation==
The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), established by an ordinance approved by the town council in 1979, studies and protects historic structures in Palm Beach. The LPC has a list of 328 properties, sites, and vistas it works to protect under the 1979 ordinance. Similarly, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach is &quot;dedicated to preserving the architectural and cultural heritage and the unique scenic quality of the Town of Palm Beach&quot;, according to its mission statement. The town of Palm Beach also conducts historic sites surveys in collaboration with preservation organizations, historians, and local officials, with the most recent survey completed in December 2020. The 2010 survey identified 50 structures that had been demolished since the previous survey in 2004 and others that had been altered significantly.

Federally, thirteen structures and one historic district have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, two of the designated buildings have since been destroyed. A fire and subsequent burglaries at the Bingham-Blossom House likely contributed to the owner&#x27;s decision to have it demolished in 1974, while construction crews razed the Brelsford House in 1975 after trustees at the Royal Poinciana Chapel (the property where the building was located) believed &quot;the aging structure was more of a liability than an asset&quot; and also cited its high costs of renovation for public use, according to &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;.

== Transportation ==

Three bridges traverse the Intracoastal Waterway, linking Palm Beach and West Palm Beach by roadway. The northernmost bridge, the Flagler Memorial Bridge, is along State Road A1A, which is locally known as Royal Poinciana Way in Palm Beach and Quadrille Boulevard in West Palm Beach. First opening in 1938, the bridge underwent a 5-year reconstruction and renovation between 2012 and 2017 at a cost of $106 million. State Road 704, also known as Royal Palm Way in Palm Beach and Lakeview Avenue and Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach is the location of the middle bridge. Named the Royal Park Bridge, it first opened in 1911 and was most recently replaced in 2005. The Southern Boulevard Bridge at the conjunction of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 80 (locally known as Southern Boulevard) is the southernmost bridge. First completed in 1950, the bridge underwent a $97 million replacement project between April 2017 and September 2022.

State Road A1A also runs northward through much of Palm Beach, beginning at the southern limits of the town as South Ocean Boulevard until being redirected onto South County Road, which later becomes North County Road. At Royal Poinciana Way, A1A turns westward onto that road and across the Flagler Memorial Bridge. State Roads 80 and 704 and U.S. Route 98 all terminate shortly after entering the town after intersecting with A1A. The town has no interstate highways, though Interstate 95 passes through the nearby city of West Palm Beach. Private vehicles and taxis are the predominant means of transport in Palm Beach. Incidents of profiling of lower-cost cars and minorities have occurred, sometimes resulting in tense relations between visitors and the town.

The nearby city of West Palm Beach has two train stations. Tri-Rail and Amtrak serve the Tamarind Avenue station, while the higher speed Brightline serves the Evernia Street station. Palm Beach is about east of the Palm Beach International Airport. The northern and central portions of Palm Beach are served by Palm Tran Route 41, which travels to places in the town such as the Lake Worth Inlet, North County Road and Wells Road, Publix (Bradley Place and Sunrise Avenue), Royal Palm Way (State Road 704) and South County Road (State Road A1A), and various points between. The route returns to the Intermodal Transit Center in West Palm Beach, which connects to several other bus routes and is adjacent to the train station on Tamarind Avenue.

==Emergency services==

===Police===
The town has its own police department, established on October 17, 1922. Prior to then, town marshal Joseph Borman served in the capacity of chief law enforcer as outlined in the 1911 charter. The department employed 61 officers in 2018. With a population of 8,295 people in 2018 according to the Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research, this translated to 7.35 officers per 1,000 people, compared to the Florida average of 2.49 officers per 1,000 people. In the same year, the department made 2,039 arrests – equal to about 24,581 arrests per 100,000 people, the highest arrest rate in Florida and over sevenfold the state average. However, many arrests were in relation to non-violent crimes, such as those involving auto theft, criminal traffic citations, fraud, and scams. The police department reported no rapes or homicides in Palm Beach in 2018.

===Firefighting===
In its early days, the town of Palm Beach depended heavily on the city of West Palm Beach for firefighting efforts. The Flagler Alerts, a volunteer firefighting group which later became the West Palm Beach Fire Department, responded to fires in Palm Beach by traversing the Intracoastal Waterway via ferry or railroad. Delayed response times and high insurance rates eventually led Palm Beach to establish its own fire-rescue department in December 1921. Today, the Palm Beach Fire Rescue has three stations, retains 82 employees – 75 full-time and 7 part-time, and annually responds to approximately 2,600 calls.

==Utilities==
Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) provides electricity to the town of Palm Beach, along with much of the state&#x27;s east coast. As of December 31, 2019, FPL serves 5 million customers statewide, which is approximately 10 million people. Much of the electricity supplied by FPL is sourced from natural gas, followed by nuclear energy. The nearest FPL power plant is in Riviera Beach, while the closest nuclear power station is the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant, on Hutchinson Island. Palm Beach officials have considered undergrounding at least since commissioning a 2006 study on the burial of electrical lines. In the subsequent years, undergrounding projects were initially performed by neighborhood on a &quot;as requested&quot; basis. However, following a 2014 town council meeting with FPL workers and a related voter-approved ballot question in 2016, it was decided a town-wide undergrounding project would be undertaken at a cost of approximately $90 million. The project is ongoing as of March 2020.

The town government provides and oversees sewage systems and wastewater treatment. Sewage is collected via of mainline pipes at the more than 40 pumping stations, which are capable of transporting over of water each minute. The sewage is then pumped into a regional wastewater treatment facility in West Palm Beach. Tap water has been supplied by the city of West Palm Beach since 1955, when the city purchased Palm Beach&#x27;s water system, then owned by the Flagler Water Company. West Palm Beach provided tap water services to the town at no cost until the beginning of 1995.

Recycling and garbage collection services are also provided by the town of Palm Beach. The former is taken to a transfer station, where the Palm Beach County Solid Waste Authority transports the garbage to a landfill in West Palm Beach. Vegetative yard trash is taken to two different sites in West Palm Beach.

== Notable people ==
The town of Palm Beach is also known for its many famous part-time and full-time residents. Prior to the arrival of Henry Flagler in the 1890s, a few wealthy or otherwise notable people already resided in Palm Beach, including businessman and Autocar Company founder Louis Semple Clarke and scientist Thomas Adams, a pioneer of the chewing gum industry. Earl E. T. Smith and Paul Ilyinsky, both of whom formerly held the office of Mayor of Palm Beach, were notable for other reasons. Smith previously served as an Ambassador of the United States to Cuba, while Ilyinsky was the son of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia and heiress Audrey Emery.

Two United States Presidents have been part-time residents, John F. Kennedy and Donald Trump, with both designating their respective Palm Beach properties as a Winter White House. Kennedy&#x27;s Winter White House, La Querida, was built by Addison Mizner in 1923 and previously owned by department store magnate Rodman Wanamaker of Philadelphia before Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. purchased the property in 1933. Trump has owned Mar-a-Lago since 1985, purchasing the property from the family of the late Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress of Post cereal. In October 2019, Trump and first lady Melania Trump filed to switch their primary domicile from New York City to Mar-a-Lago, officially establishing residency in Palm Beach. Following the conclusion of his first term as president in January 2021, Donald and Melania Trump resided at Mar-a-Lago amidst a dispute from some neighbors about the legality of them taking up permanent residence at the club. Donald Trump used Mar-a-Lago as a Winter White House again when his second, non-consecutive term as President of the United States began in January 2025. Additionally, former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney was a resident of Palm Beach from 1997 until his death in 2024.

== In popular culture ==
The 2024 American television miniseries &quot;Palm Royale&quot;, a period comedy-drama, portrays the upscale society of Palm Beach in 1969 as insulated from the Vietnam War and the counterculture of the 1960s.

<text>Palm Beach Gardens is a city in Palm Beach County in the U.S. state of Florida, north of Miami. Palm Beach Gardens is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area. , the population was 59,182.

==History==
===Early history to 1970===
Prior to development, the land that became Palm Beach Gardens was primarily cattle ranches and pine forests, as well as swampland farther west. The first settlers in the 1890s were residents of Juno, what is now Juno Beach, near what is now the Oakbrook Square Shopping Center near US Highway 1 and PGA Boulevard. By the early 1900s, two other areas in what is now considered Palm Beach Gardens were settled—Prairie Siding, a railroad station and timber mill located at the present-day intersection of RCA Boulevard and Alternate A1A; and Kelsey City, named after magnate Harry Kelsey, who purchased 100,000 acres of land that would become North Palm Beach, Palm Beach Gardens, and Lake Park. In 1959, wealthy landowner and insurance magnate John D. MacArthur announced plans to develop and build homes for 55,000 people. He chose the name Palm Beach Gardens after his initial choice, Palm Beach City, was denied by the Florida Legislature, because of the similarity of the name to the nearby Palm Beach. MacArthur planned to build a &quot;garden city&quot; so he altered the name slightly. The city was incorporated as a &quot;paper town&quot; (meaning that it existed only on paper) in 1959. The 1960 Census recorded that the city officially had a population of one inhabitant: 71-year old Charles Cooper, who lived in a shack without running water or electricity. According to Cooper, MacArthur had made a deal with him that &quot;If he set fire to the old shack, I would fix him... in a house that would have running water, a toilet, and septic tank to let him live decently.&quot; Cooper&#x27;s shack burned down in 1960; by 1970 he was living in a frame house provided by MacArthur. 

Rapid development took place in the late 1950s into the 1960s. On August 13, 1958, the Beeline Highway was opened to the public connecting Indiantown with West Palm Beach; its construction included the laying of sod and hay on the swale of the highway by Seminole Indians. In 1959, the main entrance to Palm Beach Gardens was located at Northlake and Garden (now MacArthur) Boulevards; to mark the location, in 1961 MacArthur purchased and transplanted an 80-year-old banyan tree located in nearby Lake Park, that was to be cut down to enlarge a dentist&#x27;s office. The tree was 60 feet high and weighed about 75 tons, and cost $30,000 and 1,008 hours of manpower to move it. A second banyan was moved the following year. While moving the first banyan tree over the Florida East Coast Railway, the massive tree shifted and disconnected the Western Union telephone and telegraph lines running adjacent to the railroad, cutting off most communications between Miami, to the south, and the outside world until the damage could be repaired. When questioned about the time and expense of moving the older trees instead of planting new ones, MacArthur responded &quot;I can buy anything but age. This tree will be the centerpiece of the city&#x27;s entrance, and while we could plant a little one, I wouldn&#x27;t be around 80 years from now to see it as it should be.&quot; These trees still remain at the center of MacArthur Boulevard near Northlake Boulevard and are still featured on the city shield. In January 2007, the great-grandson of impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alexandre Renoir, presented a painting to the city which depicts the Gardens banyan tree. It is currently on display at the city hall on North Military Trail. The banyan tree became a symbol of MacArthur&#x27;s efforts to build a &quot;garden city&quot;, with MacArthur claiming &quot;I built Palm Beach Gardens without knocking one tree down. There are some bearded jerks and little old ladies who call me a despoiler of the environment. But I believe I have more concern than the average person.&quot; In 1968, the Bonnette Hunt Club Lodge was built on Hood Road, and became famous for having some of the best quail hunting in Florida; it remains in operation today though its hunting grounds have since become developed into the golf courses for Mirasol Country Club. Named after retired Navy warrant officer William A. Bonnette, the club attracted famous guests and members including King Hussein of Jordan, Bing Crosby, Peter Pulitzer, and others.

The city&#x27;s governmental, infrastructure, and public safety facilities grew significantly throughout the 1960s. The Palm Beach Gardens Fire Department was chartered on October 9, 1963, operating from a garage at the present-day location of the fire station at Burns Road and Military Trail, and utilizing an old pickup truck with hose donated by MacArthur. In 1965, a volunteer police reserve force was created, and the following year Herbert A. Pecht was appointed first chief of police. The department had three air-conditioned patrol cars, and was connected to other South Florida cities by a then-advanced teletype network system. On April 26, 1965, a new exit interchange of the Sunshine State Parkway (later renamed the Florida Turnpike in 1968) was dedicated in the city at PGA Boulevard; MacArthur financed the project and was instrumental in lobbying for it. In 1966, the first two-lane drawbridge spanning the Intracoastal Waterway was also completed at PGA Boulevard, linking US-1 and Juno Beach to Palm Beach Gardens. Due to its many closings and construction delays during its subsequent expansion to four lanes (completed in 1982), the PGA bridge became known to locals as the &quot;Please Go Around bridge&quot;. 

Commercial growth also came rapidly to the region. The city&#x27;s first commercial building permit was issued to RCA in 1960, for the construction of a factory. On May 25, 1961, RCA opened a $4 million plant for manufacturing personal computers at the western end of Monet Road (now RCA Boulevard). At its peak in the 1960s, the plant would employ over 3,400 workers before closing in 1972. . Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aerospace technology corporation, would also build facilities along a 7,000 acre site located in the drained Everglades swamplands west of the Beeline Highway. Opening on June 15, 1958, the Pratt &amp; Whitney plant developed rocket and jet engines for the U.S. military and would eventually employ nearly 9,000 workers at its peak, making it the largest employer in the county until the mid-1990s. To support the development of its nascent commercial growth, the city provided homes for many of the employees. 

===1970-1990: City facilities expansion===

By 1970 the city had a population approaching 7,000 people. City growth was slow but steady throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as the population had still not reached the predicted 55,000 people envisioned by MacArthur. The 1970s saw the first hotel (a Holiday Inn, now the site of the Doubletree Hotel), first supermarket, first apartment rental community, first shopping center, first multistory office building (The Admiralty Building) and the construction of the North County Courthouse Complex. Governmental and services structure continued to grow, with councils throughout the 1970s focusing on city facilities expansion. In 1970, construction began on the City of Palm Beach Gardens Municipal Complex. In recognition of his patronage of the city, MacArthur was made honorary mayor by the city council in 1972. Garden Boulevard, the location of his transplanted banyan trees, was renamed MacArthur Boulevard in his honor on July 4, 1972, over MacArthur&#x27;s temporary opposition (having stated in a letter to Mayor Walter Wiley just two days prior, &quot;I had no interest in having a street named after me, or I would have done so when I named all the streets.&quot;). It would become the city&#x27;s first historical district. By 1980, the city council had elected its first woman councilmember, Linda Monroe, who would later go on to serve as the city&#x27;s first female mayor.

On July 3, 1976, the expansion of I-95 to connect Palm Beach Gardens with Miami was completed and opened to the public. Ending at PGA Boulevard, it would not be until Dec. 19, 1987 that the final 44-mile &quot;missing link&quot; between PGA Boulevard and Ft. Pierce would be finished—completing the final gap in the 1,919 miles of the interstate highway between Miami and Maine. In 1979, Sikorsky Aircraft opened a facility at the Pratt &amp; Whitney site along the Beeline Highway, where it would make, improve, and test helicopters including the UH-60 Black Hawk, S-92, and the RAH-66 Comanche. In 1978 ground broke on the construction of the PGA National Resort Community, under developer E. Llwyd Ecclestone on 2340 acres of land acquired from MacArthur. The master-planned community was estimated to cost $500 million at the time, with a target of 6900 homes to construct over a 15-year period, as well as an office park, shopping center, light industrial zone, and golf courses. The community would become the new permanent home of the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America. 

In 1983, the city&#x27;s first community recreation center was built on Burns Road. The opening of the Gardens of the Palm Beaches (subsequently shortened to The Gardens Mall) in 1988—then Florida&#x27;s largest mall with 150 stores anchored by Burdines, Sears and Macy&#x27;s—initiated a new wave of development; as did the sell off in 1999 of approximately in the city by the MacArthur Foundation. Development of this property happened quickly and led to much new growth in the city, particularly with further improvement of roads, additional parks, and the expansion of the north campus of Palm Beach Junior College into Palm Beach Community College. As a condition for approval of development on the Gardens Mall, the developers were required to build a second fire station (now Fire Station No. 2) at Campus Drive and RCA Boulevard. On January 1, 1995, the Palm Beach Gardens Fire Department became the provider of emergency medical services in the city. By 1989, growth was so rapid that there were five hotels under construction or completed that year alone. Thousands of homes and commercial properties were developed during this time by a small handful of developers with close associations to MacArthur, including Otto &quot;Buz&quot; DiVosta, Vince Pappalardo, and Seymour A. &quot;Sy&quot; Fine. The city adopted an Art in Public Places ordinance in 1989 and has amassed an eclectic collection of works. The city suffered much damage to its tropical landscaping in the hard freezes of 1985 and 1989, but has experienced no freezing temperatures since then.

===1990-present===
The city was hit by Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Jeanne, and Hurricane Wilma in 2004 and 2005. Much of the city lost power for days at a time after each storm, and many traffic signals and directional signs in the city were destroyed. Many homes and businesses were severely damaged during the first two storms and contractors and construction materials were at a premium. Hundreds of homes were only nearing final repair when Hurricane Wilma hit the following year damaging or destroying many of those completed or ongoing repairs. In 1993, the Palm Beach Gardens Police SWAT team was formed to execute high-risk warrants, barricaded suspects, and hostage situations. On June 7, 2011, the city dedicated a new Emergency Operations and Communications Center to provide emergency response services for Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter, and Juno Beach. 

The Gardens Mall, PGA Commons, Midtown, Legacy Place, and Downtown at the Gardens are the center of the city&#x27;s retail market. They are located on the municipality&#x27;s main stretch on PGA Boulevard.

In 2000, construction was completed on a renovation of the city&#x27;s municipal complex.

<text>Palm Springs is a village in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States, situated approximately north of Miami. The village&#x27;s name was likely derived from the resort city of Palm Springs, California. Located in the east-central part of the county, Palm Springs is situated north of Atlantis, east of Greenacres, west of Lake Clarke Shores and Lake Worth Beach, and southwest of West Palm Beach. The 2010 United States census recorded the village&#x27;s population at 18,928, which increased to 26,890 in the 2020 census. Palm Springs is also located within the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida, which had a population of approximately 6,138,333 people as of 2020.

William A. Boutwell operated a dairy farm on of land in modern-day Palm Springs beginning in 1927, which expanded to about prior to his retirement in 1956. One year later, the Florida Legislature approved a charter establishing the village of Palm Springs as Palm Beach County&#x27;s 30th municipality on May 31, 1957. At the time of incorporation, the village consisted only of farmland, a dairy barn, and no permanent residents. Within two years, around 800 homes had been built, and four schools were constructed in or near Palm Springs between 1959 and 1970. The first village hall was erected in 1960.

Palm Springs has been expanding through annexation since 1998, more than doubling the village&#x27;s land area and population within a few decades. Also around that time, the village government began planning for a new municipal complex, which opened in the mid-2000s. By 2010, Palm Springs became the first municipality in Palm Beach County in which a majority of its residents are of Hispanic or Latino ancestry. The village is also the home of the Fulton-Holland Educational Services Center, the headquarters of the School District of Palm Beach County.

Residents of Lake Worth (now the city of Lake Worth Beach) proposed to town commissioners in May 1922 that a municipal country club and golf course be constructed to attract winter tourists. According to &quot;The Lake Worth Herald&quot;, the facility would be located west of the town at &quot;Section 19, Township 44 South, Range 43 East&quot;, an area that is now part of Palm Springs. However, a referendum held in the following month rejected the proposal by a narrow margin. Instead, Lake Worth&#x27;s municipal golf course opened along the Intracoastal Waterway in November 1926. Commissioners nonetheless approved an ordinance that month to annex of land west of the city&#x27;s boundaries, extending as far as west of Military Trail; this included parts of modern-day Palm Springs.

In 1927, then-Lake Worth vice mayor William A. Boutwell, who moved to the area from Massachusetts earlier in the 1920s and owned a grocery store and masonry supply company in the city, began dairy farming on of land in modern-day Palm Springs – in addition to the farmland he owned in Lake Worth. Over time, his dairy farm expanded to occupy approximately , while the Boutwell Dairy herd increased to more than 1,000 Guernsey cattle in the vicinity of Congress Avenue and Forest Hill Boulevard (then named Selby Road) at its peak, becoming one of the largest dairy farms in Florida. Additionally, William A. Boutwell invented half-and-half creamer in Lake Worth. He retired in 1956, while his family sold the remaining farmland and livestock by 1965.

By 1957, Moore Associates Development Group of Miami created a plan to develop a new community west of Lake Worth on the land formerly used by the Boutwell dairy farm, at a townsite consisting of about of farmland and only one structure, a large dairy barn. Consequently, Florida House of Representatives member Ralph Blank Jr. of Palm Beach County introduced legislation that same year to establish the village of Palm Springs. The bill passed unanimously and Palm Springs was chartered on May 31, 1957. The village was likely named after the resort city of Palm Springs, California. Moore Associates Development Group founder James E. Moore became the first mayor of Palm Springs, while other first officeholders included tax collector Bernard Jaffe, town counsel Rome Amari, and village council members Robert Levinson, William R. Moore, Buck Wentz, and Sid Zwirn.

To transform the pastures into land suitable for development, work crews shifted millions of tons of muck and sand to enhance both drainage and landscape appearances. Another early project was the creation of a water and sewage system, which cost approximately $1.5 million. By August 1958, about 800 homes had been built. Rapid population growth necessitated the construction of four schools in and near Palm Springs between 1959 and 1970, beginning with Palm Springs Elementary School in September 1959. Palm Springs was a 1959 recipient of the &quot;Florida Illustrated Magazine&quot;&#x27;s community builders award. In the first few years of its existence, the village government functioned in the remodeled dairy barn, located at 153 Henthorne Drive, briefly sharing the building with Christ Community Church. However, construction soon began on a nearly village hall, which opened in February 1960. The 1960 census, the first conducted since the establishment of Palm Springs, recorded a population of 2,503 people. A 1962 profile in &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; reported that the village had 38 paved roads, while about 1,300 building permits had been approved over the past five years.

The population of the village increased significantly in the 1970s, nearly doubling from 4,340 in the 1970 census to 8,166 in the 1980 census. On November 11, 1978, the Jeanette J. Guerty Palm Springs Library opened. Originally in size, the building has since been enlarged, first in the mid-1980s. The village&#x27;s original boundaries remained mostly unchanged for about four decades. However, in 1997, the village council adopted a plan for expanding Palm Springs. Under the plan, future annexation included all areas west to Military Trail from its boundaries at the time, between Lake Worth Road and north of Forest Hill Boulevard; and all areas east of the present boundaries to Florida Mango Road. The annexation plan was expected to increase the population of Palm Springs by another 10,000 residents, roughly twice the population in 1997. Also in the late 1990s, the village council began planning to renovate the original municipal complex after residents approved a bond referendum in 1999.

Consequently, a new village hall opened in July 2003 – a two-story, structure, approximately thrice as large as the original village hall. Thereafter, the newly expanded library and public safety building opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Also in 2005, Hurricane Wilma destroyed 5 homes and damaged 2,462 others to some extent in Palm Springs, including substantial impact to 460 multi-family residences, more than in any other municipality in Palm Beach County. However, damage from Wilma totaled only $6.1 million, including $3 million to businesses, $2.5 million to residences, and $600,000 to government properties. In 2007, Palm Springs observed its 50th anniversary of incorporation alongside Independence Day celebrations. Beginning with the 2010 census, a majority of residents of the village identified as Hispanic or Latino.

The 96-unit Lakewood apartment community was built of Lego-style blocks designed by RENCO USA and created from recycled glass and plastic, resins and limestone.

===Utilities===
Two electrical providers serve Palm Springs, Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) and the city of Lake Worth Beach. The split in service between two providers stems from an agreement between the village and Lake Worth Beach back in August 1957. As of December 31, 2019, FPL serves approximately 5 million customers throughout Florida, equivalent to about 10 million people. Much of the electricity supplied by FPL is sourced from natural gas, followed by nuclear energy. The nearest FPL power plant is in Riviera Beach, while the closest nuclear power station is the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant, on Hutchinson Island. Lake Worth Beach Electric Utility, based in nearby Lake Worth Beach, serves approximately 7,200 customers in Palm Springs and unincorporated Palm Beach County as of August 2019. The company has been providing electricity through nuclear and solar energy increasingly since 2017, accounting for more than 38% of power generated by Lake Worth Beach Electric Utility as of May 2021.

Since its founding in 1957, Palm Springs has had its own water utility service, with the water treatment plant originally constructed and owned by the F&amp;F Construction Company. The village government purchased the water plant from the F&amp;F Construction Company in 1966 and later implemented significant improvements to it in 1976 and 1978. Today, the plant includes nine water supply wells and the water has been treated regularly since February 1999.

== Government ==
Riviera Beach has a mayor–council–manager form of government. Ronnie Felder was elected to a second three-year term as its mayor in 2022. Jonathan Evans, who was fired as city manager by three city council members in 2017 &quot;for cause, for misfeasance&quot; but without further explanation, returned to that position in 2019, and was in negotiations for a contract renewal. The city is divided into five districts, each with a council member; the mayor does not vote.
The Riviera Beach City Council has received national attention for its repeated clashes with local activist Fane Lozman, starting with his successful lawsuit, brought under Florida&#x27;s open-meetings law, to prevent them from seizing the marina under eminent domain and selling it to private developers. In 2013, Lozman won against the city at the United States Supreme Court in an admiralty case after the city seized his floating home. In 2018, Lozman won a rare second victory at the court, this one arising from his arrest during a city council meeting in November 2006.

<text>Royal Palm Beach is a village in southeast Florida, located within Palm Beach County. Despite its name, the village is located approximately fifteen miles from the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area. The population was at 38,932 residents in the 2020 US census.

Royal Palm Beach is known for its many parks and general mission to protect green space, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of to create a master central park and the development of preserved into a passive bird watching and nature park. The village offers a variety of activities for the outdoor and sports enthusiast including soccer, basketball, tennis, Pop Warner youth football and cheerleading, senior activities, and year-round golf programs. The public schools within the Village consist of &quot;A&quot;-rated elementary and middle schools and there are numerous private schools offering classes from pre-kindergarten through high school.

==History==

Incorporated on June 18, 1959, Royal Palm Beach has grown from a primarily uninhabited swamp and natural preserve and former Seminole hunting ground into a thriving village.

It was not until the 1950s, when Philadelphia supermarket magnates of Food Fair, Sam and Hattie Friedland, purchased for approximately $1.25 million in what is now the Royal Palm Beach village and The Acreage areas, that the natural wilderness landed on national fastest growing community lists (in its size category) in the 1980s. The Friedlands subsequently sold their land to Miami developer Arthur Desser, founder of Lefcourt Realty Group. About were earmarked for Desser&#x27;s Royal Palm Beach development.

It was Desser&#x27;s vision that spurred the initial development of the Village of Royal Palm Beach. A massive drainage project ensued and in 1959, the state legislature granted a charter which named the development Royal Palm Beach.

According to a former Lefcourt engineer living in nearby Wellington, Desser wanted the name &quot;Palm Beach&quot; to be included in the new community&#x27;s name, so it was decided that since Desser also liked the stately royal palms of Palm Beach, he would dub his development &quot;Royal Palm Beach.&quot;

On June 30, 1959, with Seminole tribe officials on hand for the festivities (and to renounce all former claims to the land), a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Engineering began for the village&#x27;s myriad waterways and a basic system of roads. A sales/recreational center was built with a motel facility in the area now occupied by the Royal Inn and two bedroom, one-bath model homes were erected starting at $8,250.

Village government—initially in the form of a developer-appointed council—later became popularly elected in 1964. Not until 1977 did the Village Council find a permanent home in the present Village Hall complex. To date, there have been 15 mayors who have served the village—some as single-term and part-term mayors—others, like Sam Lamstein (1982–1990), formal County Commissioner Tony Masilotti (1992–1998), and current Mayor David Lodwick (since 1998) have won voter approval for multi-terms.

Arthur Desser&#x27;s dream of a &quot;nouveau&quot; Palm Beach were short-lived, however, with the bankruptcy of Lefcourt in 1961. His interest was bought out by Friedland who then established Royal Palm Beach Colony Inc. to continue village development. A grocery store magnate with no experience in the housing market, Friedland nonetheless was a savvy businessman who put together a team of professionals who set up a comprehensive land sales/development/building enterprise. With the late Herbert Kaplan as RPB Colony CEO, the company and the town grew slowly from 1960-67 — first in the original &quot;Colony&quot; section of floral-named streets east and west of the southern end of Royal Palm Beach Blvd., and then expanded with vigor into the Willows and LaMancha subdivisions (east of RPB Blvd.).

A marketing push began in 1979 to offer to builders tracts of land. With this growth phase the Village ballooned over the next 15 years. In 1983, Crestwood Middle School opened as the first community school followed in 1985 and 1989, respectively, by H.L. Johnson and Cypress Trails Elementary schools. Royal Palm Beach High School opened its doors to 1,100 students in 1997. Schools in the western communities continue to open in rapid succession — often with student bodies at or near capacity the first year. The 2002–2003 school year included the opening of the village&#x27;s third elementary school on Okeechobee Blvd., just west of the Madison Green residential development.

In 1986, both Palms West Hospital and Wellington Regional Medical Center opened with 117 and 120 beds, respectively, and both are continuing with major expansion projects to meet the health care needs of local residents. With the hospitals came a building boom of medical office complexes on the campuses of both hospitals, as well as a Royal Palm Beach health center built by West Palm Beach&#x27;s Good Samaritan Medical Center.

Since the village&#x27;s inception, public safety has been foremost in the minds of residents and village officials. In June 1960, Joseph Klopp became the first Royal Palm Beach police chief. That first year, &quot;Klopp the Cop&quot; was the sole full-time officer with several auxiliary part-timers. Today, the accredited department counts nearly 50 sworn officers in addition to dispatchers, school crossing guards, detectives, a captain, and the chief based in a modern, computerized department in a building within the Village Hall complex. In 2007 the policing duties were contracted out to the Palm Beach County Sheriff&#x27;s department with a significant savings to the Village taxpayers.

Royal Palm Beach residents have also appreciated the security of a local fire department since a volunteer force of eight individuals was recruited in a construction trailer in January 1963. In 1969, the department moved its headquarters to a maintenance building in the present Commerce Park, which featured three bays and two trucks. A final move in 1976 to the department&#x27;s building on Royal Palm Beach Blvd. enabled the department to expand its manpower and equipment. At that time, the department shared the building with the police department.

Village firefighters weren&#x27;t paid until 1972 and the two full-timers on staff made about $6,000 a year. The following year, three more full-time firefighters were hired, and in 1975, Karl Combs became the first full-time chief at a salary of $13,500 a year. With a growing population, and thankfully few structural fires, the focus of the department expanded to include emergency medical treatment. Combs and a department lieutenant were enrolled in the county&#x27;s first paramedic-rescue course and, less than a week later, answered a cardiac arrest call for a village resident who would have died had Combs not taken the course. Within the next four years, the department hired 18 additional paramedic/EMT trained firefighters. A second station opened in 1994 at the entrance of the Counterpoint Estates to cut response times to residents living in the State Road 7 area. In March 1999, following a council-authorized study by consultants, a controversial and much-debated decision was made to curtail an independent village fire department and instead merge equipment and personnel with Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue.

Village recreation needs were not overlooked during the booming growth period and since 1974. Under the department&#x27;s purview are approximately of parks and green space as well as the village&#x27;s Cultural Center which opened in 1993.

Since 1990, Royal Palm Beach has been named as a Tree City USA. Its entire area is designated as a bird sanctuary.

<doc id="109629" wikidata="Q2152234" url="?curid=109629" title="South Palm Beach, Florida">
<text>South Palm Beach is a town located in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. The town is part of the Miami metropolitan area of South Florida and situated on a barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. The entire town is approximately long along South Ocean Boulevard (Florida State Road A1A), its only street. It is between the Town of Palm Beach to the north and the Town of Lantana and its public beach to the south.

The town was incorporated in 1955 with several condominium buildings and four single-family homes. Many condominiums were constructed, contributing to the town&#x27;s growth in the early 1970s. The fire station served for town meetings until 1993 when a town hall was built. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,471.

==Geography==

The approximate coordinates for the Town of South Palm Beach is located at (26.591746, –80.037525).

South Palm Beach is bordered to the north by the Town of Palm Beach; to the east by the Atlantic Ocean; to the west by the Intracoastal waterway (known locally as the Lake Worth Lagoon); and on the south by the town of Manalapan as well as Lantana&#x27;s public beach.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (60.61%) is water.

===Shore stabilization===
Development in the southern part of Palm Beach Island and storm impacts on the coastal system have irreparably transformed the native beach and dune system in areas R-132 to R-138 with an average shoreline recession of .

From 2003 to 2016, there have been six shoreline and dune restoration projects for the town&#x27;s beach. However, there was nothing to hold the shoreline and dunes in place, and with a nearly wholly armored shoreline, a more long-term solution was needed.

Since 2007, Palm Beach County has completed several engineering studies to evaluate long-term erosion control alternatives, including doing nothing.

The Town of Palm Beach completed its beach nourishment projects in 2016, pronouncing its &quot;coastline is in pretty good shape.&quot; No shore stabilization work was performed in South Palm Beach. Plans called for a $5.6 million &quot;Southern Palm Beach Island Comprehensive Shore Stabilization Project&quot; during 2019 and 2020 that was designed to rebuild about 0.67 miles of the town&#x27;s shoreline. In early 2019, the County determined that the project was &quot;cost prohibitive&quot; and officially withdrew a request for the needed permits from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

With assistance from the Town of Palm Beach, a smaller beach nourishment option by trucking sand to feed the eroding town&#x27;s beachfront may be possible in early 2019. After more than ten years and a devastated shoreline - with several properties only having seawalls remaining against the ocean waves - rather than a beach stabilization project, a restoration of the beach by trucking in sand was conducted in 2021.

A feasibility study and extensive engineering analysis indicated a series of seven low-profile groins with beach dune fill components providing a more stable shoreline with less frequent sand placement. Nevertheless, the trend is at a breaking point for historic coastal development with continuing extensive coastal armoring of existing structures.

==Climate==
The Town of South Palm Beach has a tropical climate, similar to the climate found in much of the Caribbean. It is part of the only region in the 48 contiguous states that falls under that category. More specifically, it generally has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;), bordering a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Am&quot;).

==Demographics==
===2010 and 2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, 1,471 people, 1,028 households, and 420 families reside in the town.

As of the 2010 United States census, 1,171 people, 763 households, and 385 families residing in the town.

===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,531 residents in 453 households and 196 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 872 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 99.28% White (97% were Non-Hispanic White), 0.14% Native American, and 0.57% Asian. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.29% of the population.

In 2000, there were 453 households out of which 2.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.6% were married couples living together, 3.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 56.7% were non-families. Households consisting of individuals were 52.1%, and 28.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.54, and the average family size was 2.14.

In 2000, in the town, the population was spread out with 2.6% under the age of 18, 1.4% from 18 to 24, 11.3% from 25 to 44, 30.5% from 45 to 64, and 54.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 67 years. For every 100 females there were 75.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.0 males.

As of 2000, the median income for a household in the town was US$39,375, and the median income for a family was $47,250. Males had a median income of $41,591 versus $30,536 for females. The per capita income for the town was $38,456. About 15.3% of families and 15.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 15.9% of those age 65 or over.

As of 2000, English was the first language spoken by 92.96% of residents, Finnish by 3.90%, and French as a mother tongue made up 3.12% of the population.

==Economy==
===Business===
Initially built in 1964, the Polynesian-inspired, 58-room Palm Beach Oceanfront Inn and its ocean-front restaurant Tides Bar and Grille, located at 3550 South Ocean Boulevard, made up the only commercial business establishment within the town of South Palm Beach. It was described as &quot;one of the last vestiges of old Florida along A1A.&quot;

Kosova Realty bought the inn for $3.3 million in 2002. It named it Palm Beach Oceanfront Inn. Known to locals by its former name, the Hawaiian Inn, the two-story motel lost most of its beach during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and was not being maintained.

A proposal by the Paloka family-owned-and-operated realty company to replace the inn with a luxury resort-style 12-story condominium-hotel built over two stories of parking was unanimously rejected by the South Palm Beach Town Council in October 2007. The established comprehensive plan limits new buildings to six-stories over one-level of parking.

On September 18, 2009, the Treasure Coast Regional Planning Council meeting expressed concerns about the redevelopment. It recommended that the Town of Palm Beach respond to citizens&#x27; negative opinions before adopting the amendments and ensure that development approval conditions address problems with the use, height limits, and negative impacts on the beaches.

The Paloka family tried to change the town codes to allow a bigger building such as a 14-story condominium and &quot;were willing to build the town a public safety building and new town hall to sweeten the deal.&quot; They increased business at the property during 2011 and were planning capital improvements, but foreclosure proceedings began. Kosova Realty filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2012.

In November 2012, the operation was purchased by Paragon Acquisition Group of Boca Raton, a distressed property development company, with plans to improve and revive the facility and &quot;possibility of a development project in the future.&quot; DDG then partnered with investor Gary Cohen of Paragon on the development. According to the CEO of developer DDG, Joseph A. McMillan, Jr., in 2012 a DDG affiliate paid $8.25 million for the site. Although the property has received minor renovations and is being managed as a hotel and restaurant, the long-term prospects for it are for condominiums according to the CEO of Paragon.

The current zoning for oceanfront property in the town allows 33 units per acre, while a more dense project would require a referendum. Plans by DDG were announced for 30 residential units to be built above a one-story parking garage. The old motel and restaurant on the site were demolished in April 2016. Marketing for the new 30-unit building featured amenities such as a concierge service, a dog park, and a private jet service. In June 2018, the building &quot;officially topped out, reaching its full height of seven stories.&quot; September 2019 marked the completion of the building.

<text>Wellington is a village west of West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County and north of Miami. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area and the fifth largest municipality in Palm Beach County by population. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 61,637 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making it the most populous village in the state.

== History ==
In the 1950s, Charles Oliver Wellington, an accountant from Massachusetts, purchased about of central Palm Beach County swampland located south of Florida State Road 80 (locally known as Southern Boulevard) and west of U.S. Route 441. Wellington named the property Flying Cow Ranch, due to his other occupation as an aviator and his initials spelling the word &quot;cow&quot;. The ranch became protected against floodwaters from the Everglades after the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed a levee to the south of the property between 1952 and 1953. Following his death in 1959, his son Roger inherited the property. The family sold at $300 per acre to Arthur William &quot;Bink&quot; Glisson, Charles&#x27; agent. Glisson sold the land for $1,000 per acre within the following several months. Many other farmers began purchasing or leasing portions of the Flying Cow Ranch in the 1960s. About were used for growing strawberries at one point, which was claimed to be the largest strawberry patch in the world.

After Roger Wellington sold of land to developer Jim Nall of Fort Lauderdale in 1972, the Palm Beach County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a proposal by the Acme Drainage District for the area to become a planned unit development. Among the first projects included the development of 150 acre (0.61 km2) Lake Wellington and the construction of a golf course, a country club, and residential neighborhoods. Following acquisition of the project in the late 1970s by Gould Florida Inc., the company built the International Polo Club Palm Beach and the Aero Club, a neighborhood with a private airpark. The area&#x27;s first official population count occurred during the 1980 Census, when Wellington was defined as a Census-designated place. A total of 4,622 people lived there at the time. Wellington functioned as a sprawling bedroom community with few shopping centers or restaurants until the 1990s.

A vote for incorporation of the village of Wellington was held on November 7, 1995, with 3,851 votes in support and 3,713 votes in opposition, a margin of just 138 votes. Wellington officially became a village on December 31, 1995, as a state revenue sharing program required it to exist in 1995 in order to be eligible for funding in 1996. The village became Palm Beach County&#x27;s 38th municipality and the ninth most populous city in the county at the time, with approximately 28,000 residents. The first village council elections were held on March 12, 1996. None of the candidates for any of the five seats secured a majority of the votes, forcing runoffs to be held on March 26. The first elected village council members were Paul Adams, Michael McDonough, Tom Wenham, Carmine Priore, and Kathy Foster. Two days later, the council held its first meeting and selected Foster for mayor, Priore for vice mayor, and Colin Baenziger for village manager.

It has now become known as an international center for equestrian sports.

<text>West Palm Beach is a city in and the county seat of Palm Beach County, Florida, United States. It is located immediately to the west of the adjacent Palm Beach, which is situated on a barrier island across the Lake Worth Lagoon.

It is the largest city in Palm Beach County, and at the time of the 2020 census, its population was 117,415. West Palm Beach is a principal city of the Miami metropolitan area, which was home to 6.14 million people in 2020. It is the oldest incorporated municipality in the South Florida area, incorporated as a city two years before Miami in November 1894. West Palm Beach is located approximately north of Downtown Miami.

==History==



The beginning of the historic period in south Florida is marked by Juan Ponce de León&#x27;s first contact with native people in 1513. Europeans found a thriving native population, which they categorized into separate tribes: the Mayaimi in the Lake Okeechobee Basin and the Jaega and Ais people in the East Okeechobee area and o the east coast north of the Tequesta. When the Spanish arrived, there were around 20,000 Native Americans in south Florida. By 1763, by the time the English gained control of Florida, the native peoples had been all but wiped out through war, enslavement, or European diseases.

Other native peoples from Alabama and Georgia moved into Florida in the early 18th century. They were of varied ancestry, but Europeans called them all Creeks. In Florida, they were known as the Seminole and Miccosukee Indians. The Seminoles clashed with American settlers over land and over escaped slaves who found refuge among them. They resisted the government&#x27;s efforts to move them to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Between 1818 and 1858, three wars were fought between Seminoles and the United States government. By 1858, there were very few Seminoles remaining in Florida.

The area that was to become West Palm Beach was settled in the late 1870s and 1880s by a few hundred settlers who called the vicinity Lake Worth Country. These settlers were a diverse community from different parts of the United States and the rest of the world. They included founding families such as the Potters and the Lainharts, who would go on to become leading members of the business community in the fledgling city. The first white settlers in Palm Beach County lived around Lake Worth, which at the time was an enclosed freshwater lake, named after Colonel William Jenkins Worth, who fought in the Second Seminole War in Florida in 1842. Most settlers engaged in the growing of tropical fruits and vegetables for shipment to the north via Lake Worth and the Indian River. By 1890, the U.S. Census counted over 200 people settled along Lake Worth in the vicinity of what would become West Palm Beach. The area at this time also boasted a hotel, the &quot;Cocoanut House&quot;, a church, and a post office. The city was platted by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth in 1893, coinciding with the arrival of the Florida East Coast railroad. Flagler paid two area settlers, Captain Porter and Louie Hillhouse, a combined sum of $45,000 for the original town&#x27;s site, stretching from Clear Lake to Lake Worth.

On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the &quot;Calaboose&quot; (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.), and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the first incorporated municipality in Dade County and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes, and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew steadily during the 1890s and the first two decades of the 20th century, most residents were engaged in the tourist industry and related services or winter vegetable market and tropical fruit trade. In 1909, Palm Beach County was formed by the Florida State Legislature and West Palm Beach became the county seat. In 1916, a new neoclassical courthouse was opened. It has been painstakingly restored to its original condition and is now used as a local history museum.

The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. The population of West Palm Beach quadrupled from 1920 to 1927, and all kinds of businesses and public services grew along with it. Many of the city&#x27;s landmark structures and preserved neighborhoods were constructed during this period. Originally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to have its terminus in West Palm, but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead.

The land boom was already faltering when the city was devastated by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. The Depression years of the 1930s were a quiet time for the area, which saw slight population growth and property values lower than during the 1920s. The city only recovered with the onset of World War II, which saw the construction of Palm Beach Air Force Base, which brought thousands of military personnel to the city. The base was vital to the allied war effort, as it provided an excellent training facility and had unparalleled access to North Africa for a North American city. Also during World War II, German U-boats sank two dozen merchant ships and oil tankers just off the coast of West Palm Beach. Nearby Palm Beach was under blackout conditions to minimize night visibility to German U-boats.

The 1950s saw another boom in population, partly due to the return of many soldiers and airmen who had served in the vicinity during the war. Also, the advent of air conditioning encouraged growth, as year-round living in a tropical climate became more acceptable to northerners. West Palm Beach became one of the nation&#x27;s fastest-growing metropolitan areas during the 1950s; the city&#x27;s borders spread west of Military Trail and south to Lake Clarke Shores. However, many of the city&#x27;s residents still lived within a narrow six-block wide strip from the south to north end. The neighborhoods were strictly segregated between White and African-American populations, a legacy that the city still struggles with today. The primary shopping district remained downtown, centered around Clematis Street.

In the 1960s, Palm Beach County&#x27;s first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. These projects led to a brief revival for the city, but in the 1970s and 1980s crime continued to be a serious issue and suburban sprawl continued to drain resources and business away from the old downtown area. By the early 1990s there were very high vacancy rates downtown, and serious levels of urban blight.

Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and the preservation and renovation of 1920s architecture in the nightlife hub of Clematis Street have seen a downtown resurgence in the entertainment and shopping district. The city has also placed emphasis on neighborhood development and revitalization, in historic districts such as Northwood, Flamingo Park, and El Cid. Some neighborhoods still struggle with blight and crime, as well as lowered property values caused by the Great Recession, which hit the region particularly hard. Since the recovery, multiple new developments have been completed. The Palm Beach Mall, located at the Interstate 95/Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard interchange became abandoned as downtown revitalized - the very mall that initiated the original abandonment of the downtown. The mall was then redeveloped into the Palm Beach Fashion Outlets in February 2014. The West Palm Beach station for Brightline, a high speed passenger rail service serving Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, was opened in 2018.

===West Palm Beach Canal (C51)===
According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the West Palm Beach Canal (C-51)/Stormwater Treatment Area (STA)1 East project was authorized by the U.S. Congress under the Flood Control Acts of 1948, 1954, 1962, 1968, and the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1996. The project is located in Palm Beach County and runs east to west from West Palm Beach at Lake Worth to Water Conservation Area (WCA) No. 1 (Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge). The authorized project will provide 30-year flood protection to the urbanized eastern basin and 10-year flood protection to the western basin. All eastern basin features have been completed.

During mediation of the Everglades water quality litigation, a technical plan was developed for resolution of the litigation. The technical plan included a substantially modified C-51 project. The modified plan expands the original 1,600-acre floodwater detention area into a 6,500-acre stormwater detention area. In addition to the flood damage reduction benefits provided by the original project, the modified plan provides water treatment, reduction of damaging freshwater discharges to Lake Worth, and increased water supply for the Everglades and other users.

According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the total estimated cost of the West Palm Beach Canal (C51) is $375.47 million, with an estimated $345.04 million as the Federal Government&#x27;s cost share. A total of $1.05 million was appropriated for this project by the U.S. Congress in Fiscal Year 2015. The Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Request from the U.S. President to the U.S. Congress was for $1 million.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, this city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.26%) is water.

Due to vast areas of wetland immediately to the west of the city&#x27;s downtown, growth took place to the north and south in a linear fashion. Until the 1960s, the city was no more than several blocks wide but over 100 blocks in length. Large scale development finally expanded to the west of the city with improved access and drainage in the 1960s. However, the city boundaries were not expanded much with the exception of the &quot;Water Catchment Area&quot;, an uninhabited area in the northwest part of the city. Known as Grassy Waters, it now serves as a reservoir for the city drinking water as well as a nature preserve.

===Places===
====Historic neighborhoods and communities====


Bel Air Historic District: Developed from 1925 to 1935 as a neighborhood for tradesmen and real estate salesmen who helped develop Palm Beach County, some of Belair was originally a pineapple plantation owned by Richard Hone. Hones&#x27;s frame vernacular house, built around 1895, still stands at 211 Plymouth Road. After Hone was murdered in 1902, his property was sold to George Currie, who created Currie Development Co. But before it was developed, the land was sold to William Ohlhaber, who raised coconut palms and ferns. Eventually, Ohlhaber platted the subdivision and sold off lots. The first house built in the subdivision was Ohlhaber&#x27;s mission-style home at 205 Pilgrim. Ohlhaber&#x27;s grandson said Ohlhaber bought the tract to provide dockage for his yacht, but the yacht ran aground in the Gulf of Mexico and never reached Lake Worth. In 1947 Hone&#x27;s house was bought by Max Brombacher, Henry Flagler&#x27;s chief engineer, and it remains in the Brombacher family today. Belair became West Palm Beach&#x27;s fourth historic district in August 1993.

Central Park: Central Park is a collective name for several subdivisions north of Southern Boulevard. It originally was part of the Estates of South Palm Beach (which went from Wenonah Place to Pilgrim Road east of Dixie Highway). Like other West Palm Beach neighborhoods, the Estates of South Palm Beach boomed after Henry Flagler&#x27;s descent on Palm Beach. In 1884, James W. Copp, a bachelor in the boating business, borrowed $367.20 from Valentine Jones to buy the land. The ownership of what is now known as Central Park changed hands many times before being developed. Around 1919, the tropical wilderness was transformed into an exclusive neighborhood with curbed roads, sidewalks and a pier (at the foot of what is now Southern Boulevard). The neighborhood became part of West Palm Beach in 1926, and was named a city historic district in December 1993. In 1999 the neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

El Cid: Noted for its Mediterranean revival and mission-style homes, El Cid developed in the height of Florida&#x27;s real estate boom. In the late 19th century, most of the land north of Sunset Road was pineapple fields, but the crop dwindled in the early 20th century. Pittsburgh socialite Jay Phipps subdivided the old pineapple fields in the 1920s. He named it El Cid, after the celebrated Spanish hero, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, who conquered Valencia in 1094. He was called &quot;Cid&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;. El Cid became a city historic district in June 1993. In 1995 the neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Flamingo Park: Originally a pineapple plantation, Flamingo Park was established by local contractors and developers, who saw the potential in this area—one of the highest coastal ridge sections from downtown West Palm Beach to Miami. Some ridge houses even had ocean views from upper floors. Houses cost about $10,000 to $18,000 in the boom era, and many buyers were owners of shops and businesses on fashionable Dixie Highway nearby. Recently, residents rallied to have stop signs installed throughout the neighborhood and have banded together to ward off commercial and industrial zoning. Property values are rising as residents renovate and restore Spanish-style houses. Most of the homes in the neighborhood, developed from 1921 to 1930, are mission style, but nearly every style is represented. There are many Mediterranean revival-style houses along the high ridge line. Only two buildings in the historic district are known to have been designed by architects: 701 Flamingo Drive designed by Harvey and Clarke, and the Armory Arts Center designed by William Manly King. The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in January 1993 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Grandview Heights: One of the city&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods still intact, Grandview Heights was built as an extension of Palm Beach Heights from around 1910 to 1925. Almost all of Palm Beach Heights and half of Grandview Heights was demolished in 1989 to make way for the proposed Downtown/Uptown project, which became CityPlace. Grandview Heights originally attracted construction workers who helped build the luxury hotels, ministers and store owners. The neighborhood has one of the city&#x27;s best collection of early craftsman-style bungalows, as well as some modest, Mediterranean revival-style homes. The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1995 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

Mango Promenade: Mango Promenade became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1995 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Lies just south of Palm Beach Atlantic University.

Northboro Park: An expansion of Old Northwood, Northboro Park was mostly custom houses for upper-middle-class professionals. Most of the houses are Mediterranean revival, mission and frame vernacular. Developed from 1923 to 1940, the neighborhood became the city&#x27;s second historic district (November 1992) and the historic designation may soon expand north to 45th Street. The oldest building in the neighborhood is Northboro Elementary School at 36th Street and Spruce, built in 1925 by DaCamara and Chace. The demolition of Northboro Elementary School began in late 2009. The first home in Northboro Park is 418 36th St., built in 1923.

Northwest: West Palm Beach&#x27;s first historic district to be included on the National Register of Historic Places (February 1992), the Northwest neighborhood was first settled in 1894, when the black community was moved from the Styx in Palm Beach to West Palm Beach. It also served as the city&#x27;s segregated black community from 1929 to 1960 (along with Pleasant City). Northwest remains a predominantly black community but according to the city planning department, most middle- and upper-class blacks moved to other neighborhoods after desegregation. Tamarind and Rosemary Avenues were the commercial centers for blacks by 1915, but most commercial buildings have been demolished or remodeled so the architecture is no longer significant. There are still good examples of late 19th- and early 20th-century American bungalow/craftsman-style homes in this neighborhood, which also has mission, shotgun, Bahamian vernacular and American Foursquare styles. The Alice Frederick Mickens house, at 801 Fourth St., is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mickens was a philanthropist and humanitarian who promoted education for black youth. Another notable house is the Gwen Cherry house at 625 Division Ave. Cherry, Florida&#x27;s first Black woman legislator and a resident of Miami, inherited the house from relative Mollie Holt, who built the house in 1926. Now it is the Palm Beach County Black Historical Society. The Northwest neighborhood was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The next year the neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1993.

Old Northwood Historic District: Old Northwood was developed from 1920 to 1927—the height of the city&#x27;s real estate boom. The Pinewood Development Co., platted and developed the area. Old Northwood became a neighborhood of what was considered extravagant Mediterranean revival, mission and frame vernacular houses, at $30,000 to $36,000. The buyers were professionals, entrepreneurs and tradesmen. Among them was David F. Dunkle, who was mayor of West Palm Beach. There are houses here designed by notable architects John Volk (best known for his Palm Beach houses), William Manly King (who designed Palm Beach High School and the Armory Arts Center) and Henry Steven Harvey (whose Seaboard Railroad Passenger Station on Tamarind Avenue is listed in the National Register of Historic Places). The neighborhood became a West Palm Beach historic district in 1991 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places in June 1994.

Northwood Hills Historic District: On August 4, 2003, the City Commission designated the Northwood Hills neighborhood as the 13th Historic District in the City of West Palm Beach. Northwood Hills comprises the area from 29th Street on the South to 39th Court on the North. The east side of Windsor is the Western boundary, and Greenwood Avenue is the Eastern boundary. The Neighborhood Association has worked several years to achieve the distinction of historic designation. This is the first district to be designated since 1996. Northwood Hills has a number of Mission Revival houses, a significant collection of Post-World War II architecture, a unique street layout, and one of the highest elevations in the city. The Northwood Hills neighborhood has also elected to allow the establishment of Bed and Breakfast establishments within the neighborhood.

Prospect Park: Promoted as a high-end neighborhood patterned after the prominent Prospect Park district in Brooklyn, this area consisted of mostly smaller estates for prominent businesspeople and northern investors. The neighborhood has a high concentration of Mediterranean revival and Mission revival houses. It was developed from 1920 to 1935 and became a city historic district in November 1993.

West Northwood Historic District: Cashing in on the real estate boom, developers of West Northwood built speculative and custom houses for upper-middle-class professionals from 1925 to &#x27;27. Dominant architectural styles are Mediterranean revival and mission. Although the area was declining, that has reversed in recent years, as more investors buy and restore the houses. West Northwood became a city historic district in August 1993.

CityPlace: Opened in 2000 on re-developed land where dilapidated single family homes and apartments once stood, CityPlace houses night clubs, restaurants, clothing and home-decor retail outlets, and multi-story town houses and apartments.

Palm Beach Outlets: Opened in 2014, it was developed on the site of the former Palm Beach Mall. Palm Beach Outlets features over 130 stores and is located directly off Interstate 95 on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard.

Antique Row: is a shopping district on the south side of the city along Dixie Highway. Architectural Digest, The New York Times, Art &amp; Antiques, and House Beautiful have all noted Antique Row as one of the east coast&#x27;s premier antique districts, considered the &quot;antique design center&quot; of Florida.

Northwood Village: is an historic commercial district north of downtown. The city invested money in rebuilding the streetscape and promoting the area as an arts district.

==Transportation==

Air: The city is served by Palm Beach International Airport, located in unincorporated Palm Beach County. The airport attracts people from all over the county as well as from the Treasure Coast and Space Coast counties to the north. In 2014 there were over 6.5 million passengers who passed through the gates of PBIA making it the 52nd busiest airport in the nation.

Bicycle The city&#x27;s flat terrain, early paved streets, and year-round climate quickly earned it the designation as the &quot;bicyclingest town in the U.S.A.&quot;. The historic core consists of a dense grid of narrower streets, laid out by Henry Flagler. Clematis Street was one-lane each direction with a speed limit of 12 mph, and the middle of the street between lanes was used to park bicycles. The popularity of bicycling declined during the later half of the 20th century, but has undergone a renewed increase in popularity. In addition, a bike share program, SkyBike, was introduced in 2015, and the city&#x27;s mobility plan calls for protected bike lanes on most downtown streets.

Highways: U.S. 1 passes through the city&#x27;s downtown, commercial, and industrial districts. Interstate 95 bisects the city from north to south with multiple interchanges serving West Palm Beach, including an entrance to Palm Beach International Airport. Florida&#x27;s Turnpike passes through West Palm Beach further west, connecting with the western suburbs of Royal Palm Beach and Wellington. State Road 80, running east–west, is a partial expressway, that runs from Interstate 95 to State Road 7.

Rail: Amtrak has daily long-distance trains, &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star,&quot; arriving and departing to points north and Miami to the south as well. Tri-Rail commuter rail system serves the city from a historical station located on the west side of Tamarind Avenue, just east of I-95. Tri-Rail provides commuter rides north to Mangonia Park and south to Miami. All Aboard Florida began track upgrades in 2015 in preparation for higher-speed passenger service serving Miami, Florida through Orlando, FL. Service on All Aboard Florida&#x27;s Brightline service from West Palm Beach to Fort Lauderdale began on January 12, 2018. Service was extended from Fort Lauderdale to Miami on May 19, 2018. The freight rail companies, CSX Transportation and the Florida East Coast Railway also serve the city.

Trolley: There is a free downtown trolley that provides transportation around downtown including Clematis, City Place, Tri Rail Station, Palm Beach Outlets, and Waterfront districts of the city.

Bus: Greyhound Lines operates scheduled intercity bus service out of the train station on the west side of Tamarind Avenue. Palm Tran, the Palm Beach County municipal bus service, operates scheduled service throughout the city and the suburban areas of Palm Beach County.

Port: The Port of Palm Beach is located on the northern edge of the city limits. It is the fourth busiest container port in Florida and the 18th busiest in the continental United States. In addition to intermodal capacity, the Port is a major modal point for the shipment of various goods as well as being the home to several small passenger cruise lines.

Water Taxi: As a waterfront city there is specific need for water transportation between points in the city and surrounding areas. Waterway transportation is available to and from the downtown Clematis Street District, Sailfish Marina Resort, waterfront attractions, Peanut Island, and special events.

==Media==

It serves Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, the area north of Palm Beach County that includes Martin and St. Lucie Counties.

The &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot;, another publication owned by Gannett, serves the town of Palm Beach. It frequently covers issues and affairs of the Palm Beach city council. It also extends coverage to events taking place in West Palm Beach.

==Crime==
Violent crime: According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) statistics, West Palm Beach is experiencing a steep drop in major crimes. In the past decade, crime has dropped more in West Palm Beach than in any other major city (approximately 100,000 residents or more) in the state of Florida. In 1993, West Palm Beach was featured in a 60 Minutes segment on urban decay. At the time, 80% of downtown properties were vacant. Since then, the city has done much to improve its image, at least in the physical sense. Occupancy is high, and housing prices have risen rapidly. FDLE stats show that the total crime rate per 100,000 residents has dropped by more than 50% since 2000, from 13,880 that year to 6,571 in 2008. In 2008 alone, there was a 17.9% drop in crime. Annual crime rates are always more than three times the national average. However, as of 2006, the city&#x27;s crime average has been gradually decreasing while robbery was up 17 percent. West Palm Beach&#x27;s northern neighbor, Riviera Beach, has an even higher violent crime rate.

The following are the crime rates, per 100,000 people, for West Palm Beach as of 2005.

<text>Dade City, officially the City of Dade City, is a city in and the county seat of Pasco County, Florida, United States. It is located in the Tampa Bay Area, northeast of Tampa and southwest of Orlando. The population was 7,275 as of the 2020 census. The current Mayor of Dade City is Scott Black.

The city was named after U.S. Army Major Francis L. Dade who was killed alongside most of the men he led from Fort Brooke (present-day Tampa) to Fort King (present-day Ocala) in the Dade Battle, which marked the beginning of the Second Seminole War.

The gently rolling hills of eastern Pasco County give way to this quintessential Southern small town that is known and beloved by many for its slow-paced, &quot;Old Florida&quot; ambience.

==History==

An earlier community known as Fort Dade existed nearby in the 1870s and 1880s. The railroad was constructed a few miles to the east of Fort Dade, so business owners chose to relocate in order to be nearer to it. The newer settlement became known as Dade City. The name became official when the Hatton post office was changed to the Dade City post office on December 18, 1884.

After being initially incorporated as a town in either 1884 or 1885, Dade City was subsequently reincorporated as a city following the official approval of the state legislature on June 5, 1889. When Pasco County was formed from the southern section of a much larger Hernando County (Citrus County was formed from the northern section) in 1887, Dade City became the county seat of the new county, first temporarily and later permanently, by popular vote.

The Pioneer Florida Museum (located just outside city limits), which opened on Labor Day of 1975, showcases the life of European-American pioneers in Central Florida. Its artifacts and exhibits include a 1913 locomotive, a Methodist church, a house built before the American Civil War, an old school, and an old train depot from Trilby, Florida.

The Hugh Embry Library, currently located on 4th Street in downtown Dade City, was opened in 1904 when its namesake, then 25 years old, was recovering from an illness. Embry had a strong desire to read, but at that time there was no public library located in Dade City. He solicited donations of books from local households, and developed a small library in the Embry home on Church Street (now the site of the U.S. Post Office).

His efforts helped generate great enthusiasm in the community for a much more extensive library, culminating in the development of the Pasco County Library Association in 1905. After Embry&#x27;s death at the age of 28 due to tuberculosis, the library initially faltered. Efforts of active community members and civic organizations such as the Dade City Woman&#x27;s Club kept the library open. The library was relocated several times over the next five decades, finally reaching its current location in 1963. The library underwent a complete renovation in the late 1980s, with the current building opening in 1991. More recently, the library underwent renovations in 2021. The library reopened on May 30, 2023.

The Crescent Theatre was Dade City&#x27;s main movie theater from its opening in 1926 until it closed in 1950. It was located on the northeast corner of South 5th Street and Florida Avenue. The facade of the original building was preserved while other renovations were made for adaptive reuse. A metal structure was added in the 1990s. Today the building is used as a non-profit Seniors&#x27; Services center.

The Pasco Theater, built as a movie theater on South 7th Street, operated from 1948 until 1999 and has since been demolished.

Lawrence Puckett (1906–1985) settled in Dade City in 1925. He later became involved in politics and served as mayor of Dade City from 1981–1983 and as a member of the Dade City Commission from 1976 until his death in 1985. His recollections of the city were published by the Pasco County Centennial Committee. They date from his arrival as a young man of 19. Puckett describes Dade City before and after the Florida land boom as &quot;a typical southern agriculture area, where the few well-to-do controlled the economy and the poor white folks and Negroes did the work for minimal pay. In other words, folks here were either quite well-to-do or very damn poor&quot;. Puckett described Dade City as it existed during the Florida boom, with its various shops, streets, and buildings. Most of these had changed significantly by the time he was writing.

With the Florida land boom, people were streaming into the state, usually sticking to the Eastern Coast. The overall economic effect was to drive up property prices all across the state. For Dade City, Puckett estimated that the top money-making ventures were either real estate, business related to real estate, or the production of moonshine.

He said that the increase of people and capital into Dade City had a profound effect on its culture:

&quot;Country clubs and golf courses were being constructed with country folks playing golf and dancing the Charleston. Wood lands and grazing lands were developed into subdivisions with sidewalk &amp;: streets built 9 miles in the woods, which in most cases was about all that happened.&quot;

During World War II, the government established a prisoner-of-war camp in Dade City. The prisoners were German soldiers from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps, who were captured in battles in North Africa in 1942-1943. They were put to work, producing limestone bricks, building warehouses, and making boxes. The POW camp operated from approximately 1942 to the spring of 1946. The site has been redeveloped as the Pyracantha Park Civic Center.

In 1878, Isaac Hudson moved his family to the uninhabited brush of coastal Pasco County and allowed a post office to be established in his home. The town grew in the early twentieth century when the Fivay Company began cutting lumber and shipping it by rail to Tampa. Hudson stagnated when the Fivay Company went out of business in 1912 and people turned to the sea or moved away; shrimping and fishing employed about half of the working men in the 1930s to 1950s.

W.L. Hendry came with his sons from Tampa and began digging inlets from the coast around Hudson Springs, using the fill to create a higher ground to put a few houses on in 1950. This was to become the Port of Hudson neighborhood. In the 1980s, people began building larger homes (most of which were mobile homes) along the canals. Now, while its older waterfront is reviving, large residential developments are spreading inland.

<text>New Port Richey is a city in Pasco County, Florida, United States. It is a suburban city included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was counted at 16,728 in the 2020 census.

==History==
By 1914 the area around Orange Lake was being called &quot;New Port Richey&quot; and the older part of Port Richey was called &quot;Old Port Richey.&quot; In 1915 a separate post office was established for the residents of the southern part of Port Richey. The post office was named New Port Richey, and the name became official. The first postmaster was Gerben DeVries. The growth of the city came about after George Sims purchased the Port Richey Land Company. He built a home in New Port Richey in 1916.

The first Chasco Fiesta was held in 1922 to raise money for the local library. The event was revived in 1947 and has been held annually since then. It includes a large street parade and a boat parade on successive Saturdays.

In 1924 New Port Richey was incorporated. The first mayor was Dr. Elroy M. Avery, an educator, historian, and prolific author who came to New Port Richey from Cleveland after he retired in 1919.

The first act of the city council was to accept Enchantment Park as a gift from George Sims. The park was renamed Sims Park. The main attractions of the city were the park, the Pithlachascotee River, and Orange Lake.

In the mid-1920s the city hoped to become a winter home for Hollywood stars. In fact, Thomas Meighan, a leading actor in silent movies, built a large home on the river in 1928 and spent the winters there. He hoped to make movies in New Port Richey. Gene Sarazen, one of the top golfers in the 1920s, also built a home in New Port Richey. He invented the modern sand wedge in a garage in New Port Richey. Other Hollywood figures such as Ed Wynn visited New Port Richey. Songwriter Irving Berlin and bandleader Paul Whiteman made down payments on property, but did not build homes. In 1926, a new theater named for Thomas Meighan opened, and in 1927, the Hacienda Hotel, a 55-room Spanish-style luxury hotel, was completed. Moon Lake Gardens and Dude Ranch, which featured a private game preserve of 7,000 acres, opened in the 1930s.

The end of the 1920s Florida land boom ended the aspirations of New Port Richey to become a haven for Hollywood celebrities, and the Great Depression had a devastating effect on the town. By 1938 the town had lost its Tarpon Springs Branch passenger train connection to the Seaboard Air Line Railway network, a significant loss in the era before Interstates and jet airplanes.

Beginning in the late 1960s, western Pasco County began a decades-long period of rapid population growth, although the population of New Port Richey has not increased much because of the small area which makes up the city. Most of the population of western Pasco County is in unincorporated areas. Pasco-Hernando State College began offering classes in New Port Richey in 1972, and completed construction of a campus in 1976. Gulf View Square shopping mall opened in 1980. In 1995, New Port Richey became sister cities with Cavalaire-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. Cavalaire Square in downtown was named in honor of that relationship. In 2004 President George W. Bush, campaigning for re-election, spoke to supporters in Sims Park.

<text>Odessa is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pasco County, Florida, United States. The population was 3,173 at the 2000 census and more than doubled to 7,267 in 2010. Northwest of Tampa, Odessa had been an area of open spaces, ranching, and horse properties. More recently it has seen many suburban property developments as Tampa&#x27;s population expands.

== History ==
The Odessa area was first settled in the middle 1800s by the W.M. Mobley Family who migrated from Savannah, Georgia. Odessa was named in the 1880s by Peter Demens, a Russian immigrant who developed the community through the Orange Belt Railway. Later, the railroad came through, running parallel with S.R. 54. Demens also founded St. Petersburg, Florida and named both communities after places he used to go to in Russia (St. Petersburg) and Ukraine (Odesa). 

There was once a large sawmill in the area providing employment. This sawmill replaced some smaller ones and was burned in a fire in 1922.

The area is rapidly being developed as Tampa expands.

Odessa was home to Tampa Bay Executive Airport until 2004.

==Geography==
Odessa is located at (28.183446, -82.568456).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Census Designated Place lies entirely in Pasco County, Florida, and has a total area of of which is land and (6.04%) is water.

The USPS mailing area that uses the city of Odessa stretches into Hillsborough County and overlaps parts of Keystone, a separate CDP located entirely in Hillsborough County. This apparent overlap is due to USPS ZIP code designation only; the two CDPs do not actually overlap - no part of Odessa is truly in Hillsborough County.

<doc id="109650" wikidata="Q2152062" url="?curid=109650" title="Port Richey, Florida">
<text>Port Richey is a city in Pasco County, Florida, United States. It is a suburban city included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2020, the city had a population of 3,052.

==History==
In 1883, Aaron M. Richey arrived from St. Joseph, Missouri, and settled near the mouth of the Pithlachascotee River. He established a post office in his home on July 9, 1884.

Port Richey was incorporated as a municipality in 1925, in response to the incorporation of New Port Richey the previous year. The name Port Richey is older than the name New Port Richey, as the post offices were established in 1884 and 1915, respectively.

Singer Johnny Cash owned a home along the Pithlachascotee River from 1979 until 2002. Cash and his wife June Carter Cash inherited the house from Maybelle Carter after her death, and they sold it in 2002 shortly before their deaths in 2003.

The population of Port Richey has remained small, and proposals to abolish the city have gone before the voters several times.

On February 21, 2019, Mayor Dale Massad was taken into custody by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement with assistance from the Pasco County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the local SWAT team on charges of practicing medicine without a license. He also later was charged with two counts of attempted homicide for opening fire on officers as they attempted to serve the warrant. The next day, Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order to remove Massad from office. Three weeks later, Acting Mayor Terrence Rowe was arrested for several charges, including obstruction of justice and use of a two-way communication device to facilitate the commission of a crime. The charges were described as an &quot;offshoot&quot; of the charges against Massad. DeSantis removed Rowe from office on March 20, which left the city with no one to serve as mayor. The three remaining members of city council were unable to agree on a replacement. State Senator Ed Hooper and Representative Amber Mariano sought to dissolve the city in response. This effort was later dropped.

<text>San Antonio, or unofficially &quot;&quot;San Ann&quot; or &quot;San An&quot;&quot; as the locals call it, is a city in Pasco County, Florida, United States. It is a suburban city included in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, much more commonly known as the Tampa Bay Area. It lies within Florida&#x27;s 12th congressional district. The population was 1,297 at the 2020 census. 

It was established as a Catholic colony by Judge Edmund F. Dunne. The city derives its name from Saint Anthony of Padua. Saint Leo University is located nearby.

==History==

San Antonio was founded by Edmund F. Dunne, an Irish American who had previously served as chief justice of the Arizona Territory. In June 1881, Dunne was a legal counsel involved in the Disston Land Purchase, and as his commission, received 100,000 choice acres (400 km2) of land out of the 4,000,000-acre (16,000 km) purchase. The following year on February 15, 1882, while surveying the Disston Purchase with his cousin, Captain Hugh Dunne, he came upon a previously unsurveyed lake with crystal-clear water. Seeing in a prayer book that it was the feast day of St. Jovita, he named the lake after the early Christian martyr.

Judge Dunne selected the city&#x27;s location on Lake Jovita&#x27;s western shore and began settling it in earnest. He intended for the city to be the center of a Roman Catholic colony in Florida, then a heavily Protestant state. Dunne planned several other villages for the surrounding area including St. Thomas, Villa Maria, Carmel and San Felipe, but only the rural community of St. Joseph survives today.

In San Antonio&#x27;s early years, Dunne only permitted practicing Roman Catholics to settle in the colony. The earliest settlers were mostly of Irish descent, but San Antonio&#x27;s numbers were soon bolstered by German immigrants, who came to form about half the city&#x27;s population by the mid-1880s. There was also a French community and, in later years, a minority of Florida cracker Protestants. As late as the 1900s, African Americans were not permitted to settle in San Antonio; in 1902, a Black American man was lynched in San Antonio for the alleged rape of a white woman.

The &quot;Town of San Antonio&quot; was officially incorporated as a municipality on August 7, 1891.

In June 1889, the Benedictines established the monastery of St. Leo and St. Leo College on Dunne&#x27;s former homestead and farm land, later incorporating the area as part of a separate town, St. Leo, Florida. Earlier that year five Benedictine sisters established Holy Name Convent in the center of San Antonio. The nuns had come to teach at two local schools (St. Anthony School and St. Joseph School), as well as to establish Holy Name Academy. The sisters had the convent and the academy physically moved by oxen to a 40-acre parcel in St. Leo overlooking the southwestern shore of Lake Jovita in 1911. The nuns remained at St. Anthony School until the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.

At the time of its founding San Antonio was located in the southern third of Hernando County, as Pasco County was not created until June 1887. The Orange Belt Railway first began service to San Antonio in November 1887.

On June 2, 1926, the city officially changed its name to the &quot;City of Lake Jovita&quot; in an attempt to capitalize on the Florida Land Boom. The city also changed many of its street names, replacing explicitly Catholic names with secular ones. On May 23, 1931, the city changed its name back to the &quot;City of San Antonio&quot;; but the secularized street names remained.

==Geography==

San Antonio has a rolling topography with elevations varying from a low of 110 feet on the western edge of the city to as high as 183 feet on a hill overlooking Lake Jovita on the eastern edge of town.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of San Antonio has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Demographics==

===2010 and 2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,297 people, 447 households, and 342 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 1,138 people, 414 households, and 302 families residing in the city.

===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 655 people, 270 households, and 180 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 286 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 97.25% White, 1.07% Asian, 0.31% from other races, and 1.37% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.41% of the population.

In 2000, there were 270 households, out of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.8% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 29.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 3.03.

In 2000, in the city, the population was spread out, with 27.2% under the age of 18, 8.4% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.1 males.

In 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $43,125, and the median income for a family was $58,750. Males had a median income of $39,375 versus $27,031 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,287. About 9.8% of families and 10.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.7% of those under age 18 and 14.6% of those age 65 or over.

====Controversial 2000 census data====
In a story that wound up on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, many of the 2000 census numbers were disputed by the City Clerk of San Antonio based on the fact the city had 336 residential water customers at the time. The clerk further asserted that most of the residents received their mail via post office box, which the US Census Bureau would not send forms to. City officials speculated that the population that year was probably closer to 900, which would be more consistent with the growth reflected in data collected in other cities throughout the county, as well as Pasco County as a whole. The 2010 census count of 1,138 residents was considered to be much more accurate.

==Education==

 San Antonio is home to two schools. Saint Anthony Catholic School (grades PreK–8) traces its roots to the Fall of 1883 when local widow Cecilia Morse began teaching colony children in her home. By April 1884 it was officially established as a Catholic school and is by far the oldest school of any kind in Pasco County. In fact it actually predates the county by several years. San Antonio Elementary (grades K–5) was founded 98 years later in 1981 and though its campus lies entirely within San Antonio&#x27;s city limits, its mailing address is actually Dade City, Florida. Holy Name Academy (grades 1–12) was established in 1889 as an &quot;all-girls&quot; boarding school by the Benedictine Sisters of Florida, but moved to the neighboring town of St. Leo in 1911.

<text>Wesley Chapel is a census-designated place in Pasco County, Florida, United States. The population was 64,866 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb in the Tampa Bay area.

==History==

Wesley Chapel originated in the mid-1800s as a cohesive community of settlers. Evidence of Native American presence in the area has been documented as early as 10,000 BC. Lumber harvesting and turpentine production became prominent industries, while cash-crop farming, citrus, and livestock ranching provided sustenance for the pioneer settlement. Charcoal kilns, gator hunting, and moonshine stills supplemented incomes and spawned legends. The community was also identified by the monikers Gatorville, Double Branch, and Godwin. From 1897 to 1902, Wesley Chapel boasted its own post office, two sawmills, and a general store. Primitive roads left residents with an informal town nucleus, and services shifted to surrounding towns until the late 20th century, when postal service and incorporation emerged, and the lumber trusts of John D. Rockefeler, Otto Hermann Kahn, and Edwin Wiley morphed into sizable ranches. The pioneer Boyett(e), Gillett(e), Godwin, and Kersey families received land grants in the area in the 1840s. The real influx of settlers, however, began around the Civil War when the Stanleys and Coopers arrived. The population was 44,092 at the 2010 census, making it the most populous community in Pasco County. In 2003, some residents of Wesley Chapel started a movement to incorporate the community as a city (including areas not in the official CDP), but these plans never materialized.

Originally called Double Branch for the area&#x27;s twin creeks, the community was named for the Methodist church that stood on the northwest corner of SR 54 and Boyette Road. A popular nickname for the area was &quot;Gatorville&quot;.

The area has 3 middle schools and 3 high schools, most of which are new as well as 3 charter schools. Three planned malls have now opened, including the Shops at Wiregrass, Tampa Premium Outlets, and a big box mall called The Grove on the northern perimeter. The Grove also hosts a small outlet mall called KRATE at the Grove. Wiregrass is known for its well-reviewed restaurants, bars &amp; shops. Cypress Creek Town Center &amp; Tampa Premium Outlets are now open (2016–17) and continuously growing. Two new schools were built in 2007 and 2008, Dr. John Long Middle School and Wiregrass Ranch High School.

In 2016, Wiregrass Elementary opened its doors next to JLMS. In 2017, Cypress Creek Middle School and Cypress Creek High School opened as the 3rd middle school and high school in the town. Pasco Hernando State College-Porter Campus has been open since 2013 next to WRHS.

In March 2008, State Road 56 was extended east from its then terminus at Bruce B. Downs Boulevard to a temporary terminus at Meadow Pointe Boulevard. In late 2019, it was extended further east to its final terminus at US 301 in Zephyrhills.

A massive 800-acre project is set to launch in Pasco County, which will become the largest sports park in the United States. This development, part of the Trinity Development Initiative and unveiled at the IAAPA &quot;2024 Expo&quot;, will feature a range of sports facilities, including professional playing fields and an ice arena, as well as hotels, retail outlets, restaurants, and health care services. Plans for a massive development in Trinity, Florida, have sparked significant opposition among local residents. Many community members are concerned that the development will disrupt the area&#x27;s character, increase traffic congestion, and exacerbate flooding issues. A petition with hundreds of signatures has been initiated to halt the project, reflecting a broader tension between rapid growth and the preservation of community values in Pasco County.

The original depot was relocated west of its original location. Restoration of the building began in 1997 with a Grant from the State Department of Transportation. The Historical Preservation Committee and the Zephyrhills Historical Association worked together to complete the restoration. The Zephyrhills Depot Museum opened on October 20, 1998.

<text>Belleair is a town in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area, also known as the Tampa Bay area. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 4,273.

== History ==

Belleair traces its origins to 1896 as a planned resort town with the construction of the Belleview Hotel by railroad tycoon Henry B. Plant. Originally known as Belleair Heights, the village consisted of a few dozen homes, livestock stables, and a famed 200-seat coliseum where bicycle races and political rallies were held. Over 300 acres of land were cleared and streets platted. However, real estate development in the community did not meet expectations, and the population remained small. 

The former village of Belleair Heights fizzled out in the mid-20th century as urban sprawl blurred the lines between communities; the area stopped being referred to as Belleair Heights during the 1930s. Following the acquisition of the hotel by the John McEntee Bowman&#x27;s Biltmore corporation in 1919, management began purchasing large tracts of land south of the resort. The Florida Land Boom was in full swing in 1924, when the company&#x27;s vice president and hotel manager Earl E. Carley announced a new real estate venture of Belleair Estates. 

Belleair Estates was designed by famed landscape architect John Nolen and was intended as Florida&#x27;s most exclusive winter residential colony. The town initially incorporated in late 1924, though was re-incorporated in 1925 under the current name of Belleair. Development continued until the real estate bubble burst in 1926, which subsequently aided in the national Great Depression three years later. Following World War II, Belleair began to develop in earnest, with over two-thirds of the town&#x27;s residences built after 1950.

The Eagles Nest Japanese Gardens was a tourist attraction in the town located on the private estate of Dean Alvord. It opened in 1933 and closed in 1952.

Clearwater Beach is part of the city of Clearwater, but is separated from it by the Intracoastal Waterway. Cleveland Street is one of the city&#x27;s historic avenues, and the city includes BayCare Ballpark and Coachman Park.

The Church of Scientology owns the majority of property in the Clearwater downtown core district.

==History==
Present-day Clearwater was originally the home of the Tocobaga people. Around 1835, the United States Army began construction of Fort Harrison, named after William Henry Harrison, as an outpost during the Seminole Wars. The fort was located on a bluff overlooking Clearwater Harbor, which later became part of an early 20th-century residential development called Harbor Oaks. University of South Florida archaeologists excavated the site in 1962 after Mark Wyllie discovered an underground ammunition bunker while planting a tree in his yard.

The area&#x27;s population grew after the Federal Armed Occupation Act of 1842 offered to anyone who would bear arms and cultivate the land. Early settlers included the Stevens, Stevenson, Sever and McMullen families, who claimed and farmed large tracts of land. Prior to 1906, the area was known as Clear Water Harbor. The name &quot;Clear Water&quot; is thought to have come from a fresh water spring flowing from near where the old City Hall building was located. There were many other freshwater springs that dotted the bluff, many in the bay or harbor itself.

Originally part of Hillsborough County, the first road joining Clearwater and Tampa was built in 1849, which dramatically reduced the prior day-long commute between the cities.
During the American Civil War, Union gunboats repeatedly raided the community&#x27;s supplies, as most of the able-bodied men were away fighting for the Confederate Army. The town began developing in the late nineteenth century, prompted by Peter Demens&#x27; completion of the first passenger railroad line into the city in 1888. Clearwater was incorporated in 1891, with James E. Crane becoming the first mayor. The area&#x27;s popularity as a vacation destination grew after railroad magnate Henry B. Plant built a sprawling Victorian resort hotel named Belleview Biltmore just south of Clearwater in 1897.

By the early 1900s, Clearwater&#x27;s population had grown to around 400, ballooning to nearly 1,000 in the winter. Clearwater&#x27;s oldest existing newspaper, the &quot;Clearwater Sun&quot;, was first published on March 14, 1914. Clearwater was reincorporated, this time as a city, on May 27, 1915, and was designated the county seat for Pinellas County, which broke from Hillsborough County in 1912. In 1915, a bridge was built across Clearwater Harbor, joining the city with Clearwater Beach to the west. Clearwater Beach, although located on a separate barrier island, belongs to the city of Clearwater and fronts the Gulf of Mexico. A new, much higher bridge now arcs over the bay, replacing the former drawbridge; the connecting road is part of State Road 60 and is called Clearwater Memorial Causeway.

During World War II, Clearwater became a major training base for US troops destined for Europe and the Pacific. Virtually every hotel in the area, including the Belleview Biltmore and the Fort Harrison Hotel, was used as a barracks for new recruits. Vehicle traffic was regularly stopped for companies of soldiers marching through downtown, and nighttime blackouts to confuse potential enemy bombers were common practice. Pre-development Sand Key was used as a target by U.S. Army Air Corps fighter-bombers for strafing and bombing practice.

===Tourism===

====Clearwater Public Art and Design Program====
The Clearwater Public Art and Design Program, adopted by City Council in 2005, is funded through a 1% allocation on all city capital improvement projects valued at more than $500,000. The program commissions an average of 2–3 new projects per year.

====Capitol and Royalty Theatre====
Pre-Capitol Theatre, a bandstand stood at 405 Cleveland Street in Downtown Clearwater, where the community gathered to listen to music. The names of locals serving in World War I were etched on the wall of the adjacent &quot;Clearwater Sun&quot; building; this &quot;Panel of Honor&quot; was obscured when the original Capitol Theatre was built but uncovered when the newspaper building was torn down in 2013.
The Capitol Theatre opened March 21, 1921. It was built by Senator-elect John Stansel Taylor. The theater&#x27;s architect was Lester Avery and the contractor was John D. Phillipoff. Avery is known for his architecture in Miami. Philipoff also built the Coachman Building (1916), the Donald Roebling Estate in Belleair (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979), the old Pinellas County Courthouse (added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992), other historical homes which have been saved, and did work at the Belleview Hotel.

Groundbreaking was December 6, 1920. The &quot;New Capitol Theatre&quot; was damaged in a storm on October 26, 1921 (so it had been completed). A theatre organ was installed in 1922, to accompany silent films with music. The organ was made and installed by the Robert Morton Organ Company.

Donald Roebling was a frequent patron, having his own double seat installed at the theatre.

The theatre was managed by various movie companies (EJ Sparks, Paramount, ABC-Southeastern Theatres, and Plitt Southern) and played the most recent movies of the day. The theatre also offered vaudeville on Friday nights in the 1930s. Headliners included Sally Rand, Fred Stone and his daughter, and Lum and Abner (of radio). The theatre was renovated in 1962. The Morton theatre organ was most likely removed during this renovation. When Plitt Southern did not renew their contract in 1979, Bill Neville and Jerry Strain tried to save the theatre with film classics and reduced prices. However, the theatre closed its doors on October 28, 1980.

Royalty Theater Company signed leases with the Taylor family in February 1981, when it then became known as the Royalty Theater (Clearwater, Florida). The building was renovated with Ron Winter of Winter Associates as the contractor and Scott Musheff as the architect.

During the renovations, Bill Neville&#x27;s murdered body was found in the balcony.

The theatre remained in the Taylor family estate until it was sold in 1996. In July 2008, the building went into foreclosure.

In January 2009, the City of Clearwater and Ruth Eckerd Hall joined forces to purchase the theatre (renamed Capitol Theatre) as well as the neighboring Pat Lokey building as part of a renovation and revitalization of the historic Capitol Theater. Fowler Associates Architects, Inc. was selected for the renovation of the Capitol Theatre. The $10 million renovation and expansion began in 2012 and was completed in 2013. In 2019, a $2.5 million donation renamed the building the Nancy and David Bilheimer Capitol Theatre.

====Clearwater Public Library System====
In 1911, the city of Clearwater witnessed a vast population increase as well as acquiring telephones, electricity, paved streets and an ice factory. It is during this time that the Clearwater Library Association opened a subscription library on the second floor of the local People&#x27;s Bank. Its popularity and support led to the request of $10,000 from the Carnegie Foundation to build a public library. The building was designed by Tampa architect F.J. Kennard. In its first year, the library had over 1,277 visitors and 2,792 books borrowed. As a vacation town, the library provided free access to materials for all residents and winter visitors.

During the Depression, the Clearwater Public Library faced many of the same threats seen at other libraries seen throughout the United States. This includes increased patron usage and dwindling budget. In the 1940s, the Clearwater library increased its staff from three assistants to five assistants. The library&#x27;s collection also grew from 18,047 to over 100,000. To account for this increase, the Librarian and Board President Traver Bayly made an appeal to the City Commission for additional space.

As a result of segregation, the Clearwater Public Library was for White patrons only from its founding in 1911 to the mid-twentieth century. In 1950, the City Commission agreed to the building of the North Greenwood library. Designed by Architect Eugene Beach, the new library allowed access for the city&#x27;s African American population to many information sources. This library was renovated in 1984. The new Main library was rebuilt beginning in 2000. It opened in May 2004.

As the population continued to increase throughout the late twentieth century, the library system continued to grow. The Clearwater Public Library System now includes five libraries: Clearwater Main, Countryside, North Greenwood, Beach, and East. In recent years, the Clearwater Public Library System has become increasingly digital, providing patrons with access to computers, online databases, and an online library catalog. This was made possible by the Greater Clearwater Public Library Foundation, Inc. which formed in 1984. As a part of the library&#x27;s Centennial Celebration, a project is commencing to add makerspaces to the libraries. The Main library&#x27;s makerspace is the &quot;Studios at Main&quot; and targets creative arts making.

The Clearwater Public Library System is a contributor to the Pinellas Memory Project. This system of libraries is part of the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative which seeks to provide patrons with access to information and programs to benefit the community.

==== Clearwater Marine Aquarium ====
The Clearwater Marine Aquarium is a small non-profit aquarium. Opening in 1972 on Clearwater Beach, the aquarium is most famous for Winter the dolphin. Rescued as a calf in 2005, Winter was one of the first dolphins to have been fitted with a prosthetic tail after losing it due to entanglement in a crab trap. The aquarium is also home to other dolphins, otters, pelicans, nurse sharks, and turtles among several species of fish and other marine life. CMA also assists in animal strandings and other emergencies regarding sea life. Animals that have stranded are rehabilitated, and if possible, released back into the wild once they have made a full recovery. It has been featured as the main setting of the American family movie series &quot;Dolphin Tale&quot;.

==Sports==
BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater is the spring training home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Philadelphia Phillies, as well as their Low-A affiliate, the Clearwater Threshers.

Moccasin Lake Nature Park is a with a owned and operated by the city. The preserve also features the Moccasin Lake Environmental Education Center, which offers environmental education classes, programs and camps. The Center features live rehabilitated birds of prey, reptiles, amphibians and aquatic wildlife. It opened in 1982. The City of Clearwater contains five pools: Ross Norton, North Greenwood, Morningside, the Long Center, and Clearwater Beach. Swim lessons are offered throughout the year to patrons, and the pools have both a recreation summer pool league and the Clearwater Aquatics Team. These pools have participated in the World&#x27;s Largest Swim Lesson.

==Government==
The City of Clearwater is administered by a council-manager form of government, and the city manager serves as the chief executive and administrative officer of the city.

The Clearwater City Council comprises the mayor and four council members, each of whom serves a four-year term.

The city manager and city council are supported by the various city departments.

==Church of Scientology==
The Church of Scientology&#x27;s &quot;spiritual headquarters&quot; are located in downtown Clearwater. The Church refers to Clearwater as its &quot;Flag Land Base&quot;.
The Church of Scientology owns several historical landmark buildings including the Fort Harrison Hotel and the Clearwater Bank Building. As of 2019, Scientology had purchased so much property in downtown Clearwater that it owned most of the commercial buildings in the downtown core, many of which remained vacant. According to an investigation by the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, &quot;The [Church of Scientology], its members and companies they control now own 185 properties that cover 101 acres in the center of downtown. Half the properties were bought since January 2017. ...Seventy-three percent of the property is [now] tax-exempt for religious purposes.&quot; By 2024, the count was up to 210 parcels purchased since 2017, including the office tower where city government offices were located, and leaving only seven remaining commercial property owners who are not associated with Scientology or government.

Beginning in the 1970s under the code-name Project Normandy, the Church of Scientology began targeting Clearwater in order to &quot;establish area control&quot; of the city and county. The operations were exposed in a Pulitzer Prize winning series of articles in the &quot;Clearwater Sun&quot;. Gabe Cazares, who was the mayor of Clearwater at the time, went so far as to call it &quot;the occupation of Clearwater&quot; and later characterized it as a &quot;paramilitary operation by a terrorist group&quot;. The Church of Scientology targeted Cazares, attempting to entrap him in a sex scandal. Scientology also staged a phony hit-and-run accident with Cazares in an attempt to discredit him. Cazares and his wife sued the Church of Scientology for $1.5 million. The church settled with Cazares in 1986.

<doc id="109666" wikidata="Q990918" url="?curid=109666" title="Dunedin, Florida">
<text>Dunedin () is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. The name comes from &quot;Dùn Èideann&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. Dunedin is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater metropolitan area and is the fifth largest city in Pinellas County. The population was 36,068 as of the 2020 census.

Dunedin is home to several beaches, including Dunedin Causeway, Honeymoon Island, and Caladesi Island State Park, which is consistently rated among the best beaches in the world. Dunedin is one of the few open waterfront communities from Sarasota to Cedar Key where buildings do not completely obscure the view of the Intracoastal Waterway and the Gulf of Mexico beyond; a stretch of Edgewater Drive (also known as Alternate US 19) south of downtown offers views of St. Joseph Sound, Clearwater Beach, and Caladesi Island. Downtown Clearwater and Clearwater Beach are a drive south on Edgewater.

==History==
Richard L. Garrison was the first person given a land grant in Dunedin in 1850. The settlement was originally named &quot;Jonesboro&quot; by George Jones, the owner of the area mercantile. Two Scotsmen, J.O. Douglas and James Somerville, later named the settlement Dunedin after applying for the first post office in northern Pinellas County. The name is taken from Scottish Gaelic &quot;Dùn Èideann&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic for Edinburgh. With a dock built to accommodate larger sailing vessels, Dunedin became an important trading center and at one time it had the largest fleet of sailing vessels in the state.

In 1899, it was incorporated as the &quot;Town of Dunedin&quot; mainly as a response to numerous complaints about pigs running rampant in the settlement, leading to a still-standing ban on livestock within city limits. By 1913, the town had a population of only 350. It became incorporated as the &quot;City of Dunedin&quot; in 1926.

=== Dunedin and the Roebling Alligator ===

During and shortly before World War II the Food Machinery Corporation (FMC) factory in Dunedin (now demolished) was the primary site for the production of the Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT) developed by FMC Dunedin&#x27;s Engineers and Donald Roebling of Clearwater from Roebling&#x27;s own Alligator.

Initial training on the LVT was done at the FMC factory under the auspices of the first Amphibian Tractor School, led by Major William W. Davies. Until barracks and maintenance facilities were completed, the school and its students were housed in the Hotel Dunedin. After training, the Marines from the first Amphibian Tractor School were sent to flesh out the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, which has served with distinction since. In mid-1944, the Marine unit in Dunedin was transferred to Camp Pendleton, California.

===Administration===
The City of Dunedin currently operates under a nonpartisan commissioner-manager form of government. The commission comprises four commissioners and a mayor, who are elected by the registered voters under a staggered system.

The chief executive officer, known as the city manager, oversees the ten departments and the annual budget.

The city government is made up of ten departments with various divisions and sections. The departments are Administration, Human Resources, Information Services, Public Works, Parks &amp; Recreation, Fire, Library, Community Services, Economical Development, Planning/Development and Finance. The Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) oversees downtown projects and the needs of downtown Dunedin merchants and tourism.

==Economy==
Dunedin previously hosted an office of Nielsen Media Research. In 2003, the company consolidated its employees in a new complex in Oldsmar, Florida, with workers from Dunedin and other areas in Pinellas County moving into the Oldsmar Building.

Until early 2005, Dunedin was the home of Nielsen Media Research&#x27;s production operations.

TD Ballpark and Englebert Complex are used by the Dunedin Blue Jays and spring training facilities for the Toronto Blue Jays since 1977. TD Ballpark was built on the former Grant Field c. 1930.

The downtown business district is notable for its absence of large commercial signage, corporate franchise restaurants or chain retail stores. The Pinellas Trail, a bicycle and pedestrian trail that traverses all of Pinellas County, bisects downtown Dunedin. A large portion of the trail lies on the former roadbed of the Orange Belt Railway, the first railroad in Pinellas County, which arrived in 1888.

===Controversy===
Dunedin has been accused of draconian fining of its residents. In one case, it sued a former resident to collect over a hundred thousand dollars for yard and swimming pool maintenance. There are cases where the city has charged tens of thousands of dollars over uncut grass or aesthetic city code violations. The city has a $250 to $500 per day accruing violation policy per city code § 22-79(d). &quot;In 5½ years, the city has collected nearly $3.6 million in fines, sometimes tens of thousands at a time, for violating laws that prohibit grasses taller than 10 inches, recreational vehicles parked on streets at certain hours or sidings and bricks that don&#x27;t match.&quot; The case was dropped about a month after it was initiated (in 2019) due to intense national scrutiny over the matter.

==Culture==
===Traditions===

The sister city of Dunedin is Stirling, Scotland, and it has maintained and embraced its Scottish roots. Once a year, Scottish clans descend upon the city for the Dunedin Highland Games. Both Dunedin High School and Dunedin Highland Middle School have competition-level pipe and drum bands. The high school&#x27;s marching band is known as the Scottish Highlander Band, and both teen and adult members make up the City of Dunedin Pipe Band.

In addition to the Highland Games, Dunedin hosts many other annual festivals. The most popular among these is Dunedin&#x27;s Mardi Gras celebration, during which thousands of visitors descend on the small town.

=== City Hall ===

Located on 737 Louden Avenue, the Dunedin City Hall house the offices of the City Commission, City Manager, City Clerk, Communications, Community Development, Economic &amp; Housing Development, Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, and Utility Billing. The new city hall, opened in 2023, replaced the old city hall located at 542 Main Street. The new Dunedin City Hall is designed with a concept based on a wave, suggesting Dunedin’s identity as a coastal city. This design also aligns with the city’s branding, which features a wave/nautical flag design. The building materials include natural limestone panels and manufactured ledgestone. The curtainwall across the front of the Commission Chambers reflects the &quot;transparency of government.&quot;

===Recreation===

The city of Dunedin contains a Parks &amp; Recreation Department, which provides low-cost recreation programming to the city&#x27;s residents. The city operates four recreation facilities, each one designed to provide resources for a specific age group.

In 2007, Dunedin opened its newest and largest recreation facility, the Dunedin Community Center at a cost of just over $10 million. The project was mostly paid for by the &quot;Penny for Pinellas&quot; tax. The St. Petersburg Times wrote that Marston &quot;figured that since the county needs recreation programs of its own and the city needs a new community center, why not ask the county to pay for the project in exchange for access to the new facility.&quot; Marston&#x27;s proposal marked a turning point for the city as it saved Dunedin taxpayers millions, and allowed Dunedin officials to replenish vital strategic reserves. The center features classrooms / multi-purpose rooms, dance and exercise rooms, fitness center, gymnasium, kids area, gaming room, library, playground, rental facility, stage.

The Dunedin Fine Art Center (DFAC), opened in 1975, has grown to be one of the most renowned centers for visual art instruction and exhibition in the southeastern United States. At nearly , DFAC houses five galleries, 15 studio classrooms, the Gallery Gift Shop, the Palm Cafe and the DLM Children&#x27;s ART Museum. &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; writer Lennie Bennett says that DFAC is &quot;the artistic equivalent of a village square,&quot; offering quality experiences to people of all ages.

Since 1977, Dunedin has been the spring training home of the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the class-A Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League. In April and May 2021, the Toronto Blue Jays played their regulation games at TD Ballpark in Dunedin, due to COVID-19 cross-border restrictions. Dunedin is one of the smallest communities used by Major League spring training teams, although surrounded by a large metropolitan area. TD Ballpark is situated next to the Dunedin Public Library a few blocks south of downtown on Douglas Avenue, and is just two blocks east of Edgewater Drive. The stadium was built as a replacement to Grant Field, the Blue Jays&#x27; first spring training ball park. The library was founded in 1895 and is the oldest public library in Pinellas County.

Other recreation facilities includes:

* Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center – classrooms, game room, gymnasium, outdoor basketball courts, picnic area, playground, rental space, skate park, teen room
* Hale Seniors Activity Center – ballroom event rooms, classrooms, meeting rooms, exercise room, computer room, game room, gift shop, rental rooms
* Dunedin Nature Center
* Highlander Pool Complex/Kiwanis Spraygrounds – outdoor pool open from April to September
* Dunedin Country Club – a semi-private golf course with memberships available and the course is open to the public. The course was deeded to the city of Dunedin for recreational purposes in 1930 by the Contract Investment Company.

The city has a large athletic base, with community soccer, baseball, hockey, and softball teams. Dunedin reflected the Gaelic origins of its name by playing host to a short lived American shinty club, Dunedin Camanachd, in the mid-2000s.

In 2011, the City of Dunedin passed ordinance 2011-04 which authorized the street-legal use of golf carts across approximately 60% of the city.

The city-owned Dunedin Marina has 194 boat slips and is one of the finest municipal marinas on the West Coast of Florida. The marina is located on the Intracoastal Waterway between Dunedin Causeway and Clearwater Causeways. It is home to the Dunedin Boat Club, one of Florida&#x27;s oldest Sailing Clubs. 
===Library===
The Dunedin Public Library has two branches, the Dunedin Main Library (located at 223 Douglas Ave) and the Friends Branch Library (located at 1920 Pinehurst Road), which opened in 2007. The library is considered the oldest library in Pinellas County. In 1895, Christopher B Bouton, a resident from Cleveland, gave the city of Dunedin 200 books for public use. Mr. Bouton&#x27;s brother owned the town&#x27;s meeting hall but gave ownership of it to the Dunedin Library Association to house the public library and a reading room. The building became known thereafter as Library Hall. Belle Culton (Mrs. S. Arthur) Davies was named Dunedin&#x27;s first librarian in 1920 after the Dunedin Woman&#x27;s Club took over the running of the library. By this point, the library&#x27;s collection had grown from 200 books to over 2,000.

In 1935, the City of Dunedin took over the Library when the collection grew to be 7,000 titles. As the population of Dunedin and the usage of the library grew, the facility was in need of more space. Two new libraries were built, one in 1956, on Louden Avenue and another in 1964, on Main Street. Mary (Mrs. William Lovett) Douglas, who was appointed as head librarian in 1935, retired and was replaced by Annie Elizabeth (Mrs. W. Dwight) Niven in 1957. Niven would later be officially appointed as library director in 1959 as the collection continued to grow. In late 1972, Niven retired and was originally going to be replaced by Elizabeth Bradley, but was later replaced by Lucy Eddy in early 1973. After serving for a little over a year, Eddy was replaced by Sydniciel Shinn in July 1974. 

In 1976, the Library leased and moved into a vacant space in the Douglas Plaza Shopping Center, which was purchased by the City of Dunedin for the Library in 1986. After Shinn’s retirement in March 1988, Julia J. (Mrs. Raymond L.) Noah was appointed as the new library director after working as a library employee for 10 years. In 1989, the estate of Franklin Chase Milliken, a retired attorney, was left to the City of Dunedin to benefit the Dunedin Public Library. After years of planning, the City Commission approved funding for a 38,000 square foot building in 1994, costing approximately $3.5 million. Beginning in 1992, the library paved way to the introduction of the internet and new technologies. They began to replace old systems with new public computers and converted their library services, such as the catalog and circulation checkouts, to be available online. Noah later retired as director in July 1994, replaced by Wendy (Mrs. James P.) Foley in October of that year. Soon after the Library&#x27;s centennial in April 1995, the collection was moved into trailers while the old building was torn down and a new one was built in the same location. The new building opened to the public on September 3, 1996.

As part of their offerings and services, the Dunedin Public Library offers monthly delivery service to homebound residents of Dunedin. Other offerings include a seed library where patrons can check out seeds for gardening, a knitting and crocheting group, and genealogy assistance. The Dunedin Public Library initiated a Little Free Library movement in Pinellas County. There are currently thirteen Little Free Libraries within Dunedin. The Literacy Council of Upper Pinellas, Inc., which promotes adult literacy in North Pinellas County, serves the Dunedin Public Library.

Dunedin Public Library is currently a part of the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative (PPLC), a coalition of all public libraries within Pinellas County, Florida.

The library itself is a result of community initiative which resulted in the ELCL opening a physical building November 1, 1999.

In 2013 the ELCL &quot;became an independent library with its own taxing district, thereby providing a new revenue stream for operational expenses and enhancements to the building. This also resulted in an increase in hours, staffing, programs, services, and collections.&quot;

The library&#x27;s outdoor space is designated as a Florida Butterfly Garden. As of January 2015, the library has established a special collection area for local, self-published authors to submit their works for circulation and display.

In 2016, then Governor Rick Scott passed the Florida State Budget granting the ELCL a $1,000,000 in funding for expansion of the library.
On November 20, 2017, the library broke ground on the phase 1 of the expansion which aimed to expand the library by 2,600 square feet.

<doc id="109671" wikidata="Q2153200" url="?curid=109671" title="Gulfport, Florida">
<text>Gulfport is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States, bordering St. Petersburg, South Pasadena, and Boca Ciega Bay. The population of Gulfport was 11,783 at the 2020 census. Gulfport is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Archaeological digs around Boca Ciega Bay indicate that settlements existed in the area circa 8000 to 3000 BC. The area was also densely populated during the Safety Harbor period. In 1528, the Spanish explorer Pánfilo de Narváez landed on the Pinellas peninsula, some say near present-day Gulfport, where he encountered the local Timucuan people.
Gulfport has been known by several names since its founding. The first settler in what would become Gulfport were James and Rebecca Barnett in 1868, and named the area Barnett&#x27;s Bluff. As other settlers trickled in and homesteaded the area, the settlement became known as Bonifacio around 1880. In 1884, Philadelphia financier Hamilton Disston envisioned a thriving port town that he called Disston City. However, the United States Postal Service would not recognize the name as it conflicted with a town in Hillsborough County, and the name Bonifacio was retained. Once that community folded in 1890, the Post Office allowed Bonifacio to be renamed as Disston City. In 1905, the town name was changed to Veteran City to reflect John Chase&#x27;s vision for a retirement community of Civil War veterans. On October 12, 1910, the name changed officially to Gulfport when it got incorporated at the Gulf Casino located on the dock of Electric Railroad Company.

On April 1, 1886, a man named W. J. McPherson, who had moved to Disston City from Deland the previous year, published &quot;The Sea Breeze&quot;, which was the first newspaper for the lower Pinellas Peninsula. With a population of about 150 people, Disston City was the largest settlement on the lower peninsula in the 1880s.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, there was a considerable leftist movement in Florida. This included Gulfport electing E. E. Wintersgill, a Socialist mayor, in 1910 and having four Socialists to one Democrat sitting on the town&#x27;s council.

Gulfport was a sundown town into the 1950s. An informal policy prohibited African Americans from staying within town limits after sundown.

<doc id="109676" wikidata="Q932577" url="?curid=109676" title="Largo, Florida">
<text>Largo is the third largest city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States, as well as the fourth largest in the Tampa Bay area. As of the 2020 Census, the city had a population of 82,485, up from 77,648 in 2010.

Largo was first incorporated in 1905. In 1913, it became the first municipality in Pinellas County to adopt a council-manager government. It switched back and forth between &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; a few times, and became a city again in 1974. It was an exporter of agricultural products until the 1960s population growth began to transform it into a bedroom community. From 1905 to 2010, Largo grew in area from to about , and in population from about 300 people to more than 70,000. Largo began as a rural farming community and became the third largest city in Florida&#x27;s most densely populated county.

Largo is a sister city to Tosayamada, Kōchi, Japan, and has been named a National Arbor Day Tree City for 35 years in a row .

==History==

===Beginnings of the area===

The native inhabitants of the Largo area were the Tocobaga Indians. They are also known as the Safety Harbor culture from their archeological remains near present-day Safety Harbor. The Spanish came to Florida in the 16th century. In the 18th century, the Tocobaga had been virtually destroyed after years of exposure to European diseases, Spanish settlement efforts and warfare between Spain and England. The Largo area, like the rest of Pinellas County, was largely deserted. In 1763, Spain transferred sovereignty of Florida to the United Kingdom. In 1783, Florida fell to Spanish sovereignty once again until it was transferred to the United States in 1821. By 1845, a surveyor recorded the location of Lake Tolulu, apparently south of present-day East Bay Drive and roughly where the Largo Central Park Nature Preserve is today.
Later homesteaders to the Largo area included the families of James and Daniel McMullen, around 1852. The McMullens and other settlers raised cattle, grew citrus and vegetables and fished. During the Civil War, many Largo area residents fought for the Confederate States of America. James and Daniel McMullen were members of the &quot;Cow Cavalry&quot; driving Florida cattle to Georgia and the Carolinas to help sustain the war effort. Other area residents served on blockade runners. Still others left the area to serve in the Confederacy&#x27;s armies. After the war, Largo area residents returned to farming, ranching, and raising citrus. The Orange Belt Railway reached the area in 1888. By this time Lake Tolulu had been renamed Lake Largo, and residents of the community west of the lake adopted the name &quot;Largo&quot;.

===Incorporation to Great Depression===

The Town of Largo was incorporated in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 to make way for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo&#x27;s population increased by about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture—citrus groves, cattle ranches, and hog farms, as well as turpentine stills and sawmills. Largo is best remembered as &quot;Citrus City&quot;, from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and shipping center.

The Great Depression was difficult for Largo, which lacked the financial resources to meet its obligations. Largo reverted to its 1913 boundaries and charter, after which the population dropped by approximately 30%. The debt incurred from the issuance of bonds in the late 1920s was not paid off until after World War II.

===Rapid growth ===

The years after World War II saw rapid growth as people began moving into the area and Largo annexed surrounding lands. During the nuclear arms race, electronics companies like General Electric and Honeywell boosted the economy. The population increased to about 5,000 in 1960, to about 20,000 in 1970, and to about 70,000 in 2005. Largo&#x27;s original area was . By 1982, Largo had grown to about and to about by 2010. The groves, farms, ranches and forests have mostly given way to homes and shopping centers and light industry. The increased population resulted in a need for increased city services. All departments saw rapid growth and improvements in quality, especially under the leadership of the late Mayor Thom Feaster. In 1995, Largo Central Park opened on the site of the old Pinellas County Fairgrounds. It is the setting for the Largo Central Park Performing Arts Center and is located across the street from the Largo Public Library.

In the 2006 commission elections, Largo achieved two milestones furthering its former motto of &quot;City of Progress&quot;. Democrat Patricia Gerard became the city&#x27;s first female mayor. She narrowly defeated incumbent mayor Robert E. Jackson in a bitterly contested race. (Dr. Jackson had been the longest-serving elected Democrat in Pinellas County.) The voters&#x27; choice between these two candidates decided the major issue of the election: that the city would not revert to a mayor-dominated process of governance in lieu of the continuing role for the seven-member commission acting as non-partisans—that is, deliberating independently and equally with the mayor and deciding democratically the political issues of the city.

Also, the city elected its first commissioner of African-American descent, Rodney J. Woods, in a landslide against a former commissioner.

On August 24, 2009, the iconic Largo clock tower, which was constructed shortly after completion of Largo Central Park, was demolished. City officials made the decision as the tower had fallen into disrepair. The area surrounding the clock tower was replaced with a small garden area in order to incorporate the area into Largo Central Park.

The healthcare industry continues to grow to meet the needs of an aging population. Hospitals are among the area&#x27;s strongest employers. Largo Medical Center, owned by the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), was established in 1978; it consists of two separate campuses: its original campus near downtown Largo, and the former Sun Coast Hospital on Indian Rocks Road, which was renamed Largo Medical Center-Indian Rocks Campus after its acquisition by HCA.

<doc id="109677" wikidata="Q2152319" url="?curid=109677" title="Madeira Beach, Florida">
<text>Madeira Beach ( ) is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States, bordered on the west by the Gulf of Mexico, and on the east by St. Petersburg. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,895. The entertainment district of John&#x27;s Pass is located on the Intracoastal Waterway. The city is often referred to by locals as Mad Beach. It is named after the Portuguese island of Madeira.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, the area that makes up what is now Madeira Beach was rarely permanently inhabited. The local Tocobaga chiefdom used the land to harvest seafood, but did not live on the land.

The modern shape of Madeira Beach was formed by a hurricane, the &quot;Gale of &#x27;48&quot;, carving out the strait now known as John&#x27;s Pass. The new waterway was named after an early homesteader, John (Juan) Levique.

Several aborted attempts to settle the area occurred in the early 1900s, but it was not until 1926 that a causeway was built between the mainland and Madeira Beach, allowing for the first houses to be constructed in the area. A bridge was built crossing John&#x27;s Pass a year later. Madeira Beach incorporated as a town in May 1947. The town annexed the nearby municipality of South Madeira in 1951. Significant dredging operations on the intracoastal causeway dramatically expanded the land area of Madeira Beach in the 1950s and 1960s. Additionally, the town annexed some land on mainland Pinellas in 1955 for the construction of a shopping center and a school, now Madeira Beach Fundamental School.

The town saw significant construction in the 1970s and 1980s, including the construction of many beach condos and hotels along the beach. Today, it remains a sleepy beach town, popular as a vacation destination.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land, and (68.50%) are water.

The city is located on a barrier island between the Gulf of Mexico to the southwest, and the Boca Ciega Bay to the northeast. One bridge, the Tom Stuart Causeway, connects Madeira Beach to the mainland, in the unincorporated community of Bay Pines. To the northwest of Madeira Beach is the town of Redington Beach, and to the southeast, across the inlet of John&#x27;s Pass, is the city of Treasure Island.

===Chicken Church===

Madeira Beach&#x27;s Church By The Sea is a non-denominational church serving the gulf beaches including Madeira Beach, Treasure Island, Redington, St. Pete Beach, as well as the cities of Seminole and St. Petersburg. Construction for the church lasted from 1944 to 1946. 

The church has become a tourist attraction because its tower resembles a chicken; it is known colloquially as the &quot;Chicken Church&quot;.

===John&#x27;s Pass Marina===

On September 24, 1848, a strong hurricane struck the West Coast of Florida. It separated the barrier island on the coast and created a waterway known today as John&#x27;s Pass. John Levique, along with Joseph Silva, was the one who discovered it and named it after himself, and it is now a federally owned canal.

In 2022, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, included in the budget $1,500,000 to dredge John&#x27;s Pass.

<text>Oldsmar is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 14,898. The Oldsmar name dates to April 12, 1916, when automobile pioneer Ransom E. Olds purchased of land north of Tampa Bay to establish a planned community.

==Geography==
Oldsmar is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (9.83%) is water.

==History==
A number of archeological digs in the Oldsmar area revealed small campsites as well as permanent villages that date from the Archaic period (c. 8000 to 1000 BC).

In 1916, Ransom E. Olds purchased 37,541 acres (151.92 km2) on the northern tip of Tampa Bay in order to design a planned community. The property appealed to Olds because of its proximity to several other towns (including Tampa and Tarpon Springs) as well as being located on the Tampa and Gulf Coast division of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. The town went through a number of name changes. Initially, it was called R. E. Olds-on-the-Bay and then changed to Oldsmar. In 1927 the name was again changed, this time to Tampa Shores. And finally, in 1937, it went back to its old name of Oldsmar.

Shortly after purchasing the property, Olds formed the Reo Farms Company (renamed Reolds Farms Company) in order to administer to the creation of his new town. Architects and city planners were hired to create drafts and laborers were hired for construction. The town possessed the staples of any small town, such as churches, schools, and a bank, as well as a railroad depot, sawmill, and dock facilities on the 10 miles of waterfront that faced Old Tampa Bay. Outside of town, tracts of land were parcelled up for agriculture. To advertise how good the land was for growing crops and raising livestock, the Reolds Farms Company built a model farm. On the farm was a herd of cattle, horses, pigs, and other livestock. They also had plots planted with potatoes, turnips, beets, celery, and citrus fruits, among other crops. An oil well was drilled but was never productive.

The company also initiated a large publicity campaign to attract Northerners into becoming residents. One of the more popular slogans used was &quot;Oldsmar for Health, Wealth and Happiness.&quot; Tours were also planned with Pullmans chartered between Detroit and Oldsmar. To accommodate prospective residents and other tourists a 60-room hotel called the Wayside Inn was built.

Olds named some of the roads himself including Gim Gong Road, named after the horticulturalist Lue Gim Gong. Olds had hired Gim Gong to help set up the agricultural community.

Built in 1918 under the supervision of R.E. Olds, the Bank Building has been an important part of Oldsmar&#x27;s history. Located in the heart of downtown Oldsmar, the building was built in the style of Mediterranean Revival using rare white Italian glazed bricks. In addition to the Oldsmar State Bank, the bank was originally home to the Reolds Farm Co, and the Real Estate Sale Department. By 1920, it was reported to be handling more than $1million worth of deposits.

In 1919, the city&#x27;s first library was started by the Woman&#x27;s Club. It was donated to the city in 1977.

Original city plans included a golf course and a luxury hotel on the bay, but neither were ever built. A sawmill and foundry were established that made cast-iron engines for tractors and grove heaters. The mill also produced the Olds Chair (also called the Oldsmar Chair). The chair was similar to the popular Adirondack chair and was made out of either yellow pine or cypress.

Olds provided financial backing for the Kardell Tractor and Truck Company to move into town. Renamed Oldsmar Tractor Company, Olds had hoped it would devise a machine to clear out palmetto roots, pine stumps, and other scrub, which all had to be removed by hand otherwise. Eventually, Oldsmar had dairy and agricultural farms and, in the early days, it was a common sight to see cattle and hogs running loose through the town. Aside from peppers, tomatoes, corn, gladiolus, and grapes, a banana plantation was established but the winters proved too harsh and the crops failed.

In 1921, a hurricane hit Tampa Bay. Because Oldsmar sits on a plateau with an elevation never rising over above sea level, it was devastated by the storm. Large trees were uprooted and floodwater reached levels above normal. Some of the homes that survived the storm were moved, by barge, to St. Petersburg in the following two decades.

Olds spent a reported $100,000 drilling an oil well that never yielded. The well is now capped and sits on the grounds of the Tampa Bay Downs Racetrack. Other such wells were dug in Florida; two in the Panhandle and one in Sarasota, but none of them possessed the technology to drill through the Florida aquifer.

By 1923, Olds had over $4.5 million invested in the community and there was only a population of around 200 inhabitants. When he realized Oldsmar was not growing as anticipated, he began liquidating his assets by first selling unplatted parcels of land. The racetrack was nearly completed when he traded it for the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater. The rest of the land was traded for the Belerive Hotel in Kansas. By the time Olds left town, he had suffered a loss of nearly $3 million. While Olds envisioned a city of 100,000, the population was around 200 when he left.

Harry A. Prettyman, a St. Louis promoter, and his associates continued to sell lots in town following Olds&#x27;s departure. Prettyman staged promotional gimmicks like Gold Rushes where pieces of gold were buried on a vacant lot and everyone got to dig for it. In 1927 Prettyman was caught selling underwater lots. To avoid scandal, the town of Oldsmar was renamed Tampa Shores. It wasn&#x27;t until 1935 that the last of the property owned by Olds was finally sold.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 14,898 people, 5,182 households, and 3,707 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 13,591 people, 4,922 households, and 3,495 families residing in the city.

==Economy==

Oldsmar hosts an office of Nielsen Media Research. Most of the employees of Nielsen Media Research work in Oldsmar and the company&#x27;s media measurement work originates from the office. The Associated Press said that the Oldsmar building, with a cost figure of $80 million, was its &quot;nerve center.&quot; In 2003 the company moved into its Oldsmar complex and consolidated its employees there, with workers from Dunedin and other areas in Pinellas County moving into the Oldsmar building. Major defense contractor and aerospace company Lockheed Martin has a facility in Oldsmar that employed over 600 people as of 2015.

==Culture==
Oldsmar celebrates its history every year with Oldsmar Days and Nights, including parades, car shows (featuring the Oldsmobile), and carnival rides. The celebration is held in Spring.

==Education==
Oldsmar is part of the Pinellas County Schools district and is served by East Lake High School, Carwise Middle School, Forest Lakes Elementary School, Oldsmar Elementary School, and Oldsmar Christian School.

<text>Palm Harbor is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 61,366.

==Culture==
Palm Harbor is located north of downtown St. Petersburg and west of Tampa. It is a largely residential community with several concentrations of commerce. Downtown Palm Harbor, north of Tampa Road between U.S. Highway 19 Alternate and Omaha Street hosts many small shops and eateries along with a handful of historic buildings. U.S. Highway 19, a mile or two east of downtown, offers access to higher concentrations of commerce, with an array of national chain restaurants and retailers. One entrance to Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club, a nationally regarded golf course and home of the PGA&#x27;s Valspar Championship, is found on U.S. 19 just north of Alderman Road.
The historic downtown district of Palm Harbor, at Florida Avenue and Alt. US 19 and CR 1, has numerous festivals and craft fairs. Old Palm Harbor Main Streets, Inc., a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, hosts their signature event the first Friday of every month. &quot;Palm Harbor&#x27;s First Friday Celebrations&quot; are a popular community event for youngsters and adults alike. There are rides and games for the children, with opportunities to dine on food from the many local restaurants, enjoy local artists and crafters displaying and selling their wares. Annually, the first Sunday in October marks when the &quot;Taste of Palm Harbor&quot; festival is held. The event is presented by the Palm Harbor Junior Women&#x27;s Club with the proceeds benefiting their &quot;Making a Difference&quot; grants &amp; scholarships program. The Taste of Palm Harbor traditionally offers live music and the tasting of samples from over 20 local restaurants, many of which make seafood their specialty.

==Government==
Palm Harbor is an unincorporated part of Pinellas County. HB 183 – Town of Palm Harbor/Pinellas County, from 2009, was the most recent local bill that would have scheduled a referendum allowing Palm Harbor voters the opportunity to decide whether they wanted to incorporate, but the bill died in committee. Pinellas County legislators had voted on January 22, 2009, to support a bill allowing voters in Palm Harbor to decide whether they wanted their unincorporated community to become the county&#x27;s 25th city. It passed over the objections of Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala, who said she was appearing in both her official capacity and as a Palm Harbor resident. The Legislature would first have needed to conduct a feasibility study to make sure that cityhood made fiscal sense.

In 1985, the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners enacted County Code 85–28, which set into place the Palm Harbor Community Services Agency (PHCSA), a special taxing district to which tax was levied in the form of millage to provide for recreational and library services to the unincorporated community. The PHCSA board is a volunteer panel elected by the voters within the district to oversee the funding of Palm Harbor Library, East Lake Community Library and Palm Harbor Parks &amp; Recreation.

==Recreation==
Palm Harbor has various recreational amenities. The area is home to John Chesnut Sr. Park, located in the East Lake region, as well as H.S. &quot;Pop&quot; Stansell Park, located to the west of Palm Harbor Boulevard and overlooking St. Joseph&#x27;s Sound. The Palm Harbor Community Services District also manages several sport complexes in the community: J. Stephen Putnam Park, Palm Field, and Sunderman Recreation Complex. The community activity center is located at 1500 16th Street, managed by the District&#x27;s parks and recreation department. This facility was originally constructed by Pinellas County in the late 1990s as a senior recreation facility, however lacked the funding to remain open and available to the community. The District received the property in 2004, and started youth, teen and adult programs, youth summer camps and community services.

Palm Harbor is also the home to the Rheba Sutton White Chapel. This historic facility, which was under Pinellas County ownership previously, lacked the funding to keep its doors open and was given to the Palm Harbor Community Services District in November 2012. Now managed by the District&#x27;s parks and recreation department, the chapel was completely restored and is the site for many banquets, weddings and community special events. Harbor Hall, the banquet facility built next to the chapel, also serves as a banquet and recreational space.

== Palm Harbor Library ==

=== Library history ===
Palm Harbor Library opened April 1, 1978, funded by a Municipal Service Taxing Unit (MSTU), and is the only library in the state of Florida funded by a MSTU. Ozona Elementary School teacher, Jeanette Malouf, noted that students did not have a library close enough to their homes to borrow books. The closest libraries at the time were the Dunedin Library and Tarpon Springs Library, both of which charged fees to members not living in their respective cities. Jeanette Malouf was the Vice President of the Palm Harbor Civic Club, which donated $400 as start-up for funding of the library. With donated books, and building supplies by various community members, the first floor of a home on 1205 Omaha Ave. donated by Bill Honey was renovated into a small library.

The Palm Harbor Library ran entirely on volunteers, which formed the group, the Palm Harbor Friends of the Library Inc. on December 18, 1979. The Palm Harbor Friends of the Library elected officials in 1980, where Jeanette Malouf was named director of the library. The library continued to run on community donations and fundraisers and their semi-annual book sales. With 10,000 volumes, the library moved to historical Palm Harbor Methodist Church on 12th Street in Old Palm Harbor in December 1980. By 1982, the library volumes had doubled to 20,000 and served over 2,000 families within the community, and also acquired a new service of accessibility through the donation of a large-print section in memory of Lea Gibbons. As the library continued to grow, it needed more space. The Florida State Library opened up a grant for public libraries of $200,000 to be included 1984–85 budget. Palm Harbor Library encountered two issues in qualification for the grant; the first was that it could only be made to a government agency (and at the time Palm Harbor was unincorporated), but Pinellas County Administrator Fred Marquis supported their application. The second issue was that the community must match the grant of $200,000, which Pinellas County donated 8 acres of 6th Street, counting for $100,000, and the rest must be raised. Ultimately, the grant was vetoed by Governor Graham on June 30, 1983, due to funding and denied tax raises by legislation.

Through extensive fundraising and membership fees, Malouf and the Palm Harbor Friends of the Library continued work towards the goal of building the library. In February 1985, Senator Curt Kiser proposed a bill to create a Special District Status for the Palm Harbor Fire District, which was approved in June. This allowed Palm Harbor to tax themselves for various services such as a library, which led to the development of the MSTU. In order to buy land for the Palm Harbor Library, a proposal for tax-free bonds was approved by the PHCSA and the County Commissioner approved the purchase of the site on Nebraska Avenue as the site for the Palm Harbor Library. The Palm Harbor Library officially opened at its new and current location on Nebraska Avenue on July 5, 1988.

==Geography==
Palm Harbor is located at (28.083926, -82.753947).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land, and , comprising 34.67%, is water.

Palm Harbor has a unique &quot;hilly&quot; geography which is uncommon in Florida.

==History==
The area that is now Palm Harbor was largely uninhabited until settlers began arriving in the 1860s. The area became known as &quot;Curlew&quot;, with the Curlew Pioneer Cemetery, established in 1869, and the Curlew Methodist Church. A post office named &quot;Bay St. Joseph&quot; opened in 1878. In 1881, Henry B. Plant opened the San Marino Hotel in what later became Palm Harbor in 1885. The Gulf View Hotel also opened around that time. The Sutherland Improvement Company acquired land in the Curlew/Bay St. Joseph area and developed it into the settlement of Sutherland. In 1888 the Sutherland Post Office opened. The Orange Belt Railway reached Sutherland in 1890.

The name was changed to Palm Harbor in 1925. Sutherland boasted two beautiful hotels, the larger one becoming Southern College in 1902. It sat high on the bluff overlooking Sutherland Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico. Sutherland was thought to be named after the Duke of Sutherland, who visited these parts after landing at Tarpon Springs in 1887. Local pioneers dismiss this coincidence, pointing out that the name Sutherland is a shortening of Southern Land and Development Company, the group which originally platted the community in 1888.

Palm Harbor was once home to the Florida State Headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan when Donald Kersey, who was not a member of the Klan, allowed the organization to use his 13-acre property just north of Tampa Road on US-19 beginning in 1977. Kersey allowed the KKK to use his land when a portion of it was rezoned from commercial to residential which cost him a substantial amount of money. The KKK told Kersey that they needed to go underground to not gain any attention from authorities but that his land would be a great place to try to recruit people into the organization. Kersey stated that he told the zoning commission that he would make them pay for their zoning decisions which ended up bringing the Klan to the small unincorporated town. The land was sold in 2006 with a large strip mall built on it with a subdivision behind that structure. While Kersey got his revenge on the zoning committee with his actions, the locals did resist since the building was burned down on four occasions and the Palm Harbor Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution condemning the group and the actions of Mr. Kersey. Once his actions were known to locals, his house was set ablaze when someone tried to burn the KKK buildings down on the property. Citizens of Palm Harbor also resisted the Klan&#x27;s relocation. Palm State Bank President Frank S. Weaner, a member of the Jewish community, waged a long campaign against the presence of the Klan in Palm Harbor. He attempted to foster a dialogue between himself and the Florida Grand Dragon Jack Gregory. While these discussions did slowly change the viewpoint of Gregory, they did little to dislodge the group from the community. Weaner later debated Grand Wizard David Duke national head of the KKK, before a nationally publicized rally, and proceeded to inform him that much of the Klan&#x27;s literature about the Jewish people was wrong.
Eventually, the land was sold in 2006 and the Klan&#x27;s activity began to wane in the 1990s.

<text>Pinellas Park is a city located in central Pinellas County, United States. The population was 53,093 at the 2020 census. The city is the fourth largest city in Pinellas County. The City of Pinellas Park was incorporated in 1914. It is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area, most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area.

==History==
The city was founded by Philadelphia publisher F. A. Davis, who purchased of Hamilton Disston&#x27;s land around 1911. Davies used promotional brochures to lure northerners, especially Pennsylvanians, to the town, noting the pleasant climate in the winter and the agreeable agricultural conditions. The Florida Association, a corporation, set up model farms and offered a free lot in the city with the purchase of ten acres of nearby farm land. A two-story building called the Colony House was established to house prospective purchasers of the available farm plots. The primary crop that the founders intended to grow on the farms they established was sugar cane. By 1912, lots in the city were being sold separately. The City of Pinellas Park was formally incorporated on October 14, 1914.

Though not on the original Orange Belt Railway, Pinellas Park did have a train depot, razed in 1970, on the line between Clearwater and St. Petersburg. The city lay on the vehicle road from St. Petersburg to Tampa. Growth was moderate until after World War II, when the city&#x27;s population more than tripled.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.14%) is water.

Pinellas Park city limits are contiguous with those of St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, Seminole, Kenneth City, and unincorporated areas of Pinellas County. Annexation into the city is voluntary by both the property owner and the City Council.

Because of the city&#x27;s relatively low elevation between major bodies of water, and its generally flat topography, it has historically been subject to flooding. Through construction of a network of drainage canals and other measures by the Pinellas Park Water Management District, flooding in the city has been greatly mitigated.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the City of Pinellas Park has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

==Demographics==
===2010 and 2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 53,093 people, 20,746 households, and 12,344 families residing in the city.

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 49,079 people, 20,565 households, and 12,553 families residing in the city.

===2000 census===
Linguistically in 2000, 76.1% of the population over the age of five reported speaking only English at home, while 23.9% reported speaking some other language.

The median age was 43.6 years. 47.1% of the inhabitants were male and 52.9% were female. Like many areas in Florida, the population of Pinellas Park swells temporarily, but substantially, for half the year as mostly-retired adults (called &quot;snow birds&quot;), who reside elsewhere in the northern states or Canada during the summer, come to Florida for its mild winter climate.

As of 2000, educational statues surveys showed that among those 25 and older 14.3% did not have a high school diploma, while 32.4% had only a high school diploma, 19.8% had some college experience without a degree, 25.8% had an Associate&#x27;s or bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 7.7% had a graduate or professional degree.

Regular theatre organ concerts are given at the City Auditorium, home to a &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; restored by the local chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society. The Pinellas Park Arts Society holds monthly themed contests in the Park Station building, close to the Creative District. To encourage artists to live and work in the district, the city has established two facilities: Studios at 5663 and the Artist Live/Work building.

===Automobile culture===
The Tampa Bay Automobile Museum displays an extensive collection of historical automobiles with an emphasis on progressive engineering achievement, the personal interest of founder and benefactor Alain Cerf. The museum houses a unique working full-scale replica of the first self-propelled mechanical vehicle, the fardier of Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. Luxury cars currently displayed and sold in Pinellas Park include Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Bentley, McLaren, and Aston Martin. These and a Maserati dealership are all located in the Gateway area near the Automobile Museum.

Car and truck aficionados display their prized vehicles nearly weekly on 49th Street and compete in the regularly scheduled shows. The Showtime Dragstrip provides a venue for drag racing fans. Nearby on the aptly-named Automobile Boulevard is Tampa Bay Grand Prix, where youth and young adults race high-speed go carts on an indoor track.

===Community events===
Pinellas Park is known throughout the Tampa Bay area for a series of community events held annually in a city-owned bandshell located behind City hall. The most popular of these events is &quot;Country in the Park&quot;, a festival held every year generally on the third Saturday of March, but always after the Florida State Fair and Florida Strawberry Festival. The festival&#x27;s popularity stems from its wide array of events, such as arts and crafts shows, NASCAR displays, popular amusement park rides, and multi-artist day-long concerts, and the fact that parking, entry to the festival, and attendance of the concert are all free of charge. As of 2011, the Country in the Park festival has been organized for 21 years straight.
Another popular celebration among the locals is Pride in the Park. This celebration occurs during the week leading up to Country in the Park. Usually the night before Country in the Park, the firefighters&#x27; chili cookoff takes place at the bandshell.

Pinellas Park is home to a memorial to the Korean War, located in Freedom Lake Park.

==Economy==
Due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay, Pinellas Park is home to many marine businesses, from manufacturing to service and supplies. Large optical manufacturers, including Transitions Optical, are located either in Pinellas Park or nearby in the broader area known as &quot;Gateway&quot;.

In 2024 the city reported the unemployment rate of the &#x27;immediate area&#x27; at 3.10%. In 2020, the city reported total governmental-type and business-type assets of $271 million and total revenue from taxation and charges for services of $104 million.

The city has three concentrations of retail business all along Park Boulevard. At 49th Street, near the historic center of town, one finds traditional shops, small businesses, and restaurants. Just to the east, at U.S. 19, the Shoppes at Park Place anchor the city&#x27;s second retail hub with big-box retailers and a large movie theater. At the western edge of the city, near 66th Street and Belcher Road, are more big box retailers, ethnic specialty shops and restaurants, and the enormous Wagon Wheel and Mustang flea markets.

Due to the significant Vietnamese, Laotian, Indian, and southeast Asian community, Pinellas Park is home to one of the largest concentrations of ethnic restaurants, businesses, and specialty vendors serving those communities in the southeast. The city&#x27;s library maintains the county&#x27;s only special collection of materials in Vietnamese. The population includes those with recent ancestors from Germany, Poland, Eastern Europe, Russia, Armenia, India, Lebanon, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.

The Pinellas Park Chamber of Commerce promotes the interests of local and nearby businesses, contributing to the overall vitality and cooperative nature of the mid-county economy.

==Government==
Pinellas Park has a council-manager form of government. The current mayor is Sandra Bradbury, who is the daughter of former mayor Cecil Bradbury. The current city manager is Bart Diebold. Various volunteer citizen boards are appointed by the city council to advise the council on governmental matters. The city council itself consists of four board members.

===Police and Fire Departments===
Pinellas Park&#x27;s original police department was founded on May 27, 1915, with its only member being the appointed Marshal George W. Williams Sr. The modern Police Force was established in 1948.
Today, the city maintains a Police Department of more than 150 employees. In 2023, Police Chief Adam Geissenberger assumed the role of police chief following the retirement on Police Chief Mike Haworth. In 2015, Mike Haworth assumed the position previously held by Dorene Thomas, the first female police chief in the county. The city announced in its 2020 budget that it will begin work on a $25 million construction project of a new Police and Fire Operations Center.

The Fire Department was established in 1912, when the city had only 50 residents. It serves the city and the surrounding areas. In 2017, the city paid $915,000 for the site of a former church with the intention of building a new fire station. The city has announced construction of the new station will cost approximately $4.7 million. The Fire Department is led by Fire Chief Brett Schlatterer.

====Youth Programs====
The Police Department facilitates the Police Cadets, a youth education and service group. Likewise, the Fire Department facilitates the Fire Explorers. Youth in both programs are involved in community service as well as competitions among similar groups.

==Education==
The city is served by the Pinellas County Schools district. Most of the city&#x27;s high school students attend Pinellas Park High School or Dixie M. Hollins High School.

The Caruth Health Education Center is home to the healthcare-related degree programs of St. Petersburg College. It includes a simulation hospital unit for its nursing program, a patient-care clinic of dental hygiene, and an orthotics and prosthetics lab space.

==Library==

Madalya Fagan was the first president of the library association, and through the efforts of this volunteer organization, the Pinellas Park Public Library was established in December 1948. Fifteen years later, the city of Pinellas Park took control over the library. Marjorie Trimble was the very first paid librarian, although it wouldn&#x27;t be until 1967 when Ms. Harrop would be the first librarian who possessed a Master of Library Science degree to be hired.
The first library building was located in Park Station, an old pump house in the middle of Triangle Park. The second library was then built at 5795 Park Boulevard, although that structure no longer stands. The current library was built in 1969, and is located at 7770 52nd St, across the street from City Hall and Pinellas Park Elementary School. The library was last remodeled in 2001 and has undergone several additions that expanded the original 7,000 square feet interior into 30,972 square feet, which includes over 26 adult desktop computers, 11 children desktop computers, a teen lounge, a quiet room, and two meeting rooms for rentals and programs.

On June 6, 2014, the library was renamed in honor of late director Barbara S. Ponce. Mrs. Ponce was promoted to community activities administrator and library director in 1999, and retired in 2008. The job placed her over the Pinellas Park Library, parks and recreation, and media/public events. 
===Collection===
The library houses a collection of over 100,000 physical items, including books, audio books, newspapers, magazines, DVD&#x27;s, and Blu-ray discs available for holders of Pinellas Public Library Cooperative-issued library cards to check out. E-books and other digital services are also available. Special collections include an Asian Language Collection with materials in Hindi, Mandarin, and Vietnamese, a Spanish Collection, and an extensive collection of graphic novels and Manga.

===Programs===
The Barbara S. Ponce Public Library hosts programs for community residents with many designed for children and teens.

These programs include many art, music, and literature related educational programs as well as chess clubs, board game events, and programs to tutor schoolchildren with homework help.

Adult programming consists of monthly craft nights, an adult coloring club, free movie screenings, murder mystery nights, and technology classes. English as a Second Language (E.S.O.L.), American Sign Language, Origami, and Ukulele classes are also hosted by members of the community in conjunction with the library.

==Transportation==
Pinellas Park is served by major roads such as U.S. Route 19, Florida State Road 693, Florida State Road 694, and is served by an exit off I-275.
Mass Transit through Pinellas Park is provided by Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA).

While the Clearwater Subdivision railroad line runs through Pinellas Park, the city contains no stops on the line.

Nearby Tampa International Airport provides air transportation for most passengers. Smaller airlines, with destinations to smaller cities and towns, operate at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, with most tenants providing only seasonal services.

<text>Safety Harbor is a city on the west shore of Tampa Bay in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. It was settled in 1823 and incorporated in 1917. The population was 17,072 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since the Stone Age. In June 2008, a 6,000-year-old spearhead was found at Marshall Street Park. The inhabitants of the area at the time of Spanish exploration were the Tocobaga people, who lived in villages around Tampa Bay. The adaptation of this culture relied on wild resources. Safety Harbor sites have yielded pottery, and artifacts of copper, shell, and stone. The Tocobaga were known for constructing various ceremonial and communal mounds to bury the dead. Most of these mounds were destroyed in the early 1900s due to development. However, one of these ceremonial mounds is still visible in Safety Harbor&#x27;s Phillippe Park (&quot;see photo&quot;). Shells found in these mounds were used to pave city streets.

In 1528 Spanish explorer Pánfilo de Narváez landed in the area, followed by Hernando de Soto in 1539. Safety Harbor (formerly known as Worth&#x27;s Harbor and Green&#x27;s Springs) was first homesteaded by Count Odet Philippe, a French nobleman who is credited with introducing the grapefruit to Florida in 1823. The name Safety Harbor originated from the early 18th century, when pirates were a substantial influence in the area. Once ships reached this area of the bay, all threats from pirates were gone, and it was commonly referred to as a &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;.

===Springs===
Safety Harbor is the home of the historic Espiritu Santo Springs, or &quot;Springs of the Holy Spirit&quot;, a natural mineral spring. Its waters were given this name in 1539 by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto, who was supposedly searching for the mythical &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot;. Prior to the Spanish exploration of Florida, the Tocobaga and Timuquan tribes are believed to have fished and bathed in the spring&#x27;s waters.

In the 20th century, Espiritu Santo water was bottled and sold commercially, and later a health spa and hotel were built over the springs. The Safety Harbor Resort and Spa, as it is now known, continues to be a prominent visitor attraction in Pinellas County. In 1964, the site was designated a Historical Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior and, in 1997, a Florida Heritage Landmark.

==Geography==

===Library===
The Safety Harbor Public Library was founded in 1938 by the Women&#x27;s Civic Club of Safety Harbor with funds from the federal Works Progress Administration program (WPA). The library was originally housed inside the Community House located at 2nd St. N and 6th Ave N. On November 25, 1938, Daisy Cahow was appointed by the WPA as the First Librarian. To supply the library collection, the Women&#x27;s Civic Club paid the transportation charges to borrow 50 books from the state and return them at regular intervals. As the collection was expanded it quickly outgrew the space. In 1946, Dr. Salem Baranoff, owner of the Safety Harbor Spa, purchased and donated two empty lots on 2nd St. N and 5th Ave N for the new library. Construction for the new building began on March 4, 1949 and the library opened in November 1949. The Women&#x27;s Civic Club continued to operate the library in its new building, however, by 1978 it had become difficult for the club to provide adequate funding on its own. The property was deeded to the City of Safety Harbor in exchange for yearly funding, and the Civic Club continued to operate the library until October 1980 when full operation was taken over by the City. As the population of the city continued to grow, the library again outgrew the space and construction of a new building began in 1993 at its current location on 2nd Ave N with the new library opening on October 1, 1994. In February 2024, construction began on a second-floor addition to the current library. 
Safety Harbor Public Library is part of the Pinellas Public Library Cooperative.

==Government ==
Safety Harbor is governed by an elected Mayor and City Commission. City governmental departments are administered by a City Manager, who is appointed by the City Commission.

==Education==

<text>Tarpon Springs is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. Downtown Tarpon Springs has long been a focal point and underwent beautification in 2010. It is part of the Tampa Bay area. The population was 25,117 at the 2020 census.

As of 2000, Tarpon Springs had the highest percentage of Greek Americans of any city in the US, with 10.4% of residents who had Greek ancestry.

==History==
The region, with a series of bayous feeding into the Gulf of Mexico, was settled by farmers and fishermen around 1876. Some of the newly arrived visitors spotted tarpon jumping out of the waters and so named the location Tarpon Springs. The name is said to have originated with a remark of Mrs. Ormond Boyer, an early settler from South Carolina, and who, while standing on the shore of the Bayou and seeing fish leaping, exclaimed, &quot;See the tarpon spring!&#x27; For the most part, the fish seen splashing here were mullet rather than tarpon. In 1882, Hamilton Disston, who in the previous year had purchased the land, ordered the creation of a town plan. On February 12, 1887, Tarpon Springs became the first incorporated city in what is now Pinellas County. Less than a year later on January 13, 1888, the Orange Belt Railway, the first railroad line to be built in what is now Pinellas County, arrived in the city. During this time the area was developed as a wintering spot for wealthy northerners.

In the 1880s, John K. Cheyney founded the first local sponge business. The industry continued to grow in the 1890s. Many people from Key West and the Bahamas settled in Tarpon Springs to hook sponges and then process them. A few Greek immigrants also arrived in this city during the 1890s to work in the sponge industry.

In 1905, John Cocoris introduced the technique of sponge diving to Tarpon Springs by recruiting divers and crew members from Greece. The first divers came from the Saronic Gulf islands of Aegina and Hydra, but they were soon outnumbered by those from the Dodecanese islands of Kalymnos, Symi and Halki. The sponge industry soon became one of the leading maritime industries in Florida and the most important business in Tarpon Springs, generating millions of dollars a year. The 1953 film &quot;Beneath the 12-Mile Reef&quot;, depicting the sponge industry, takes place and was filmed in Tarpon Springs.

The city&#x27;s Rose Cemetery, where Black residents are interred, is believed to contain burials which began in the late 1800s; the earliest legible marked burial is from 1904. The cemetery contains the grave of Richard Quarls, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who fought alongside his enslaver before moving to Tarpon Springs and choosing the new name &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;, and veterans of subsequent wars.

In 1947, a red tide algae bloom wiped out the sponge fields in the Gulf of Mexico, causing many of the sponge boats and divers to switch to shrimping for their livelihood, while others left the business. Eventually, the sponges recovered, allowing for a smaller but consistent sponge industry today. In the 1980s, the sponge business experienced a boom due to a sponge disease that killed the Mediterranean sponges. There is still a small active sponge industry.

==History==

Tierra Verde was once 15 islands covered with mangroves, pines and bush. These islands ranged in size from only a few acres to the largest, Cabbage Key, having over . For centuries, Native Americans used the islands for ceremonial and burial grounds. A marker remains on the east side of Pinellas Bayway, just north of East Shore Drive, where Native American relics were found in a typical shell mound, excavated when the road was built to Fort De Soto Park. The islands were sacred ground to Native nations as far back as 500 years ago, archaeologists suggest, and deadly conflicts occurred when outsiders trespassed.

Then, the Spanish explorers came. One explorer, Juan Ponce de León, came to the area in 1513, and again in 1521, when he received the wound that he later died from after returning to Cuba. Later, Narvaez and Hernando de Soto explored, and then pirates and buccaneers sailed the area, including José Gaspar, Juan Gomez and Jean Lafitte. A treasure was reputed to have once been buried here.

In 1848 Robert E. Lee, then a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. army, recommended that Mullet Key be used for coastal defense in Florida. During the Spanish–American War of 1898, Fort De Soto was built on Mullet Key. Remains of the fort still stand, along with fortifications on Egmont Key. In 1948 the federal government sold Mullet Key to Pinellas County for park and recreation facilities, now Fort De Soto Park.

Cabbage Key was documented in 1902 as the location where a particularly large alligator was caught, the specimen being reported as twelve feet long and weighing 431 pounds. Human skeletons were also found on the island at one time, although early searches found no pottery. A dredging project in 1913 filled in low-lying areas of the island, and in December of that year the island was sold by owner Will Dent to &quot;[a] syndicate composed of H.E. Dickens, E. Durant and others&quot; for around $50,000. Early settlers to the area included Baltimore sea captain William Bunce and Silas Dent, who with his brother had a dairy farm. Dent lived on Cabbage Key until he died there in 1952. The Roberts family was among the early settlers of Pass-a-Grille and Tierra Verde. George &quot;Florida&quot; Roberts was a fishing guide for figures such as land developer Walter Fuller, Cecil B. Detre, and John Wanamaker. The thousands of tarpon caught by Roberts and his clients can be found as far away as Alexandria, Egypt, in the home of Sir Harry Rofe. By 1920, Cabbage Key had &quot;a first-class dairy with 36 cows&quot;, as well as the first wireless tower in Pinellas County.

Although two homes were built on Monte Cristo in 1923, and one in 1946, things were quiet until the mid-1950s when a Dr. Bradley &quot;Doc&quot; Waldron went to Tallahassee and persuaded the State of Florida to sell him Pine Key, Cabbage Key, Pardee Key and the surrounding bay bottom. This was about the same time construction of the old Skyway Bridge began. Waldron formed a partnership with two builders from Detroit, Hyman and Irving Green, who became majority owners of a group of 36 corporations. They named their island investment &quot;Green Land&quot;.

Waldron-Green Associates applied for a dredge-and-fill permit in 1957. Their intent: to pump some of sand and shells from the bottom of the bay and thus enlarge and raise the ground level of the three keys Doc Waldron had purchased from the State and join them to create one large island intersected with canals between the sections.

Meanwhile, others sought county and state permission to dredge and pump the bay bottom and build up Bird Key, today&#x27;s Bayway Isles and Isla Del Sol. Miami developer Leonard Ratner purchased land which became the site of Eckerd College. Real estate ventures in the area began in 1884 when Hamilton Disston, once the largest landowner in the United States, began and lost his Disston City development, which later was renamed Gulfport in 1910.

At first, the only way to get to Tierra Verde was by boat. A ferry ran from Pass-a-Grille to a dock at the end of Madonna Boulevard. Then the state developed its plans for the Bayway and financed it through a $16.8 million bond issue. The Greens persuaded the Department of Transportation to add a Fort De Soto leg and contributed the land on which it was to be built, thus assuring themselves of land access to their proposed Tierra Verde.

The state&#x27;s final road and bridge plans were approved in early 1960, and the developer&#x27;s dredging permit was granted in December of that year. The dredging would create about of buildable land. Waldron-Green and their various partners and corporations then sold the islands, with the dredge-and-fill permits, to Louis Berlanti, a contractor from New York City, and his son, Fred.

In 1960 Louis and Fred Berlanti arrived in Tierra Verde. By June of that year Louis was named president of the Tierra Verde Community Association, Inc.; Doc Waldron and H. D. Sluyter, of Dallas, Texas, were each appointed vice president. There was considerable speculation at the time as to exactly whose money it was that Berlanti represented. He was generally considered to be a &quot;nominee&quot; for Clint Murchison, Sr., the Texas oil tycoon, since both Murchison and Sluyter had been elected directors of the Association. One or more union pension funds were thought, by some, to be the real source of the new money.

On June 30, 1961, the Tierra Verde Community Association Articles of Incorporation were filed with the State of Florida, and the original Declaration of Restrictions and Covenants were recorded in public records in August that same year.

By December 1962, there was a road and a bridge to Tierra Verde. In January 1963, Guy Lombardo&#x27;s Port O&#x27; Call Resort had its grand opening, where Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Liberace, Mel Tormé, and many other musical and theatrical stars would later perform. Two episodes of the popular TV show &quot;Route 66&quot; were filmed there. The place was hopping with celebrities. Lombardo promoted the resort all across the country when the band did a 10-week national bus tour to more than 20 cities. Every show included several minutes to promote Tierra Verde and &quot;his and the Murchisons&#x27; Port O&#x27; Call Resort.&quot; All across the country, their bus had a Tierra Verde banner hung on its sides.

Six months later, on August 16, 1963, Louis and Fred Berlanti died. The private airplane he was flying with his son was sabotaged and exploded over Lake Okeechobee, Florida, killing them both. Fragments of their bodies and their exploded airplane were found floating in Lake Okeechobee. Berlanti had suffered sizable real estate losses from Castro government property confiscations and had pledged half a million dollars to unseat the Castro regime. He and his son were members of the &quot;United Organizations for the Liberation of Cuba&quot;. The St. Petersburg Times also alluded to &quot;covert&quot; local activities.

With the death of the Berlantis, Tierra Verde was in the hands of the Murchisons for more than 14 years. Guy Lombardo and his band returned for only one more season, and was quoted as saying he had tried to strike a &quot;new deal&quot; with the Murchisons but had not succeeded. He never returned.

Guy Lombardo died in 1977, the same year that real estate developer Frank E. Mackle III was elected president of a new venture called the Tierra Verde Company, a joint venture between Madonna Corporation (a Murchison interest), and Delverde (Deltona) Corporation. Because of lack of local interest, the Tierra Verde Company worked with a network of international brokers and sold many lots to overseas investors. But growth on Tierra Verde was still slow. However, in 1984 an exit ramp was built connecting the Pinellas Bayway to Interstate 275, and Tierra Verde property sales increased greatly because of the easier access. In January 1985 Deltona turned the community over to the homeowners.

Tierra Verde may have been named perhaps as much for the brothers Green as for its green land. Tierra Verde is a unincorporated portion of Pinellas County. Both St. Petersburg and St. Pete Beach have bid for annexation, but Tierra Verde has voted to stay independent. The 15 original islands are now the present six areas of Tierra Verde: Monte Cristo, Entrada, Pinellas Bayway, Sands Point, East Shore (Bayview) and West Shore (Oceanview).

In 1980 Tierra Verde real estate was valued at $15 million. By 1991 values had soared to $304 million. In November 1996 the Pinellas County Property Appraiser&#x27;s Office evaluated Tierra Verde property at $349 million, 1999 values were listed at $478 million and in 2003 values are listed at $632 million. There are now approximately 2,000 single-family and multi-family structures on Tierra Verde, as well as a number of commercial enterprises. An estimated 2,500 families are expected when Tierra Verde is built to completion.

<text>Treasure Island is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. It is situated on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 6,584.

==History==
The area of Treasure Island was originally settled in small communities by the Tocobaga around 300 AD. The Timucua traded with other Native American tribes in the area until the arrival of Pánfilo de Narváez in 1528. De Narváez decimated the indigenous people before leaving the area in search of gold.

Treasure Island got its name early in the 20th century, after several property owners attempted to boost sales of the properties being developed on the island by first burying and then pretending to discover a couple of wooden chests on the beach around 1915. After claiming the chests were filled with treasure, the news of the discovery quickly spread and people began calling the island Treasure Island.

With an elevation of only three feet, the Great Gale of 1848 carved out John&#x27;s Pass on the island&#x27;s north end and split off two smaller islands, called the Isle of Palms and Isle of Capri.

Treasure Island saw a surge in residential and hotel construction following World War II through the 1950s. The real estate used in these ventures often consisted of fill from dredged material. Artificial extensions of the land were created, which were usually designed for convenient access to navigable waterways like Boca Ciega Bay.

==Geography==
The exact coordinates for Treasure Island&#x27;s location is at .

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.3 square miles (13.8 km), of which 1.6 square miles (4.1 km) is land and 3.7 square miles (9.7 km) (70.11%) is water.
