<text>Cornwall is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 1,567 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

==History==
The town of Cornwall, Connecticut, is named after the county of Cornwall, England. The town was incorporated in 1740, nearly four decades before the United States declared its independence. The town encompasses three distinct townships: Cornwall Bridge and West Cornwall, each bordered by the Housatonic River to the west, and Cornwall Village, located three miles east of the river. One significant natural feature is the vast amount of forested land, including hundreds of acres of Mohawk State Forest, resulting in Cornwall often being called “the “Greenest Town in Connecticut”.
The proximity of its settlements to the Housatonic River offered an efficient means of transporting materials and goods, which helped stimulate Cornwall&#x27;s early farming economy as well as assisting in the evolution of business and industry. During the 19th century and the arrival of the Industrial Revolution, the town maintained two furnaces, including a blast furnace, to support charcoal-making industries. Cornwall was home to the Foreign Mission School, dating to 1817, as well as the Cream Hill Agricultural School in 1845, whose property, still an active farmstead, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Cornwall has long been known as the “Home of the Covered Bridge,” which has spanned the Housatonic River since 1864. One of only three surviving covered bridges in Connecticut, the bridge is a popular tourist destination and among the most-photographed locations in the state.
Modern-day Cornwall continues to reflect its rural farming character while being home to arts, culture, artisans and entrepreneurs. Its convenience to major metropolitan areas makes it attractive for year-round and second-home residents.

In 1939 poet Mark Van Doren wrote &quot;The Hills of Little Cornwall&quot;, in which the seductive beauties of the countryside were portrayed:

:&quot;The mind, eager for caresses,&quot;
:&quot;Lies down at its own risk in Cornwall;&quot;

Cornwall also makes a glancing appearance in Wallace Stevens&#x27;s late poem &quot;Reality is an Activity of the Most August Imagination.&quot;

Cornwall played a role in the establishment of Christianity in the Hawaiian Islands after a native Hawaiian died here of Typhus in 1818. This tragedy was instrumental in the Congregational church&#x27;s 1820 outreach to the ‘Sandwich Islands’ at Kona, Hawaii.

<text>Morris is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 2,256 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

Europeans first began to settle the area that became Morris &quot;circa&quot; 1723. Originally part of the town of Litchfield, it was called the South Farms because of its location south of the center. Designated a separate Congregational parish in 1767 and incorporated as a town in 1859, it was named after native son James Morris, a Yale graduate, Revolutionary War officer, and founder of one of the first co-educational secondary schools in the nation.

Morris lies in rolling hill country of woods, wetlands, fields and ponds. It also encompasses much of Bantam Lake, originally called the Great Pond, which covers approximately and is the largest natural lake in the state. The traditional Town of Morris seal features the pine on Lone Tree Hill, which overlooks the lake. Morris is home to one of the oldest state parks in Connecticut, as well as to one of the newest.

The area&#x27;s transition from 18th-century settlement to semi-rural community in the 2000s is the story of many Connecticut towns and much of New England. At first, farming barely made families self-sufficient, but in the 1800s, agriculture evolved into a business. Then, over the next 150 years, competition, rising costs and increasing regulation made it less sustainable, despite economies and innovation. In the early 1900s, local water mills, manufactories and other small businesses encountered similar challenges and gave way to industry in nearby Waterbury, Torrington and beyond.

By the 1970s and 1980s, the area was still largely rural, but residents&#x27; occupations had grown more diverse. Today, the farming tradition continues even as residents engage in a range of professions, businesses and arts locally and in the wider region. A number of second home owners come from the metro New York area. In addition to the two state parks and Bantam Lake, the White Memorial Conservation Center offers a range of opportunities for outdoor sports and recreation. Camp Washington is a spiritual retreat operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut.

Morris center looks like a typical small New England village, with a white Congregational church, a school, and town hall. Interspersed with fields and woods, a mix of Early American and newer homes strings out loosely along the town&#x27;s roads. Children attend the local James Morris elementary school and regional Wamogo High School, a U.S. Department of Education school of excellence. Perhaps counter-intuitively, Morris also holds a Buddhist temple, as well as a Jewish cemetery from the early 1900s.

==History==

===Pre-European===
The Morris/Litchfield region lay in the borderlands between Mahican territory to the north and west and Paugussett land to the south and southeast. Both peoples were part of an Algonquian language population that extended up the coast in a wide swath from Virginia to Canada. Those in the immediate area, the Potatuck, were a Paugussett subgroup.

The Potatuck were woodland dwellers whose bark wigwam and longhouse villages typically housed anywhere from 50 to 200 individuals. Their social structure was relatively simple and egalitarian. Kin groups were matrilineal, and women held authority over land rights and transfer.

Potatuck women gathered wild plants and fruits and raised the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; crops of squash, beans, and maize (corn), though there is some evidence that they began to cultivate maize only in the decades just before English settlers came to New England. Men fished and hunted deer and small game, also growing tobacco for ritual use. The Potatuck used fire as a tool for clearing underbrush to facilitate both hunting and planting. Some may have moved to the shore of Long Island Sound to fish and gather shellfish during the summer.

Like other first peoples in the northeast, the Potatuck believed in a Creator. His lodge, which lay to the west, was where worthy men and women went after they died. Individuals had spiritual guardians. These could be inanimate objects or ghosts but most often were animals. Festivals and other rituals taught that humans are part of nature — neighbors with plants and animals, which also possess spirits. Given their interdependence with the rest of creation, people were taught to respect and seek harmony in their physical and social environments and between earthly and spiritual worlds.

The Potatuck and the Paugussett, more generally, were part of a northeastern trade network whose water routes very probably extended to the midwest and possibly as far as the mid-south. Relations with neighboring groups were by and large harmonious. In the century before Europeans arrived in what became Connecticut, some of the Munsee people, a subgroup of the Lenape (who the English later called the Delaware), moved up the Atlantic coast. They appear to have coexisted and even intermingled with the Paugussett, whose pottery reflects the influence of their culture.

The Paugussett did not side with more easterly tribes such as the Narragansett and the Wampanoag in King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1678), which devastated the colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Providence Plantation and Rhode Island. The Potatuck in northwest Connecticut had even less incentive than other Paugussett groups to become embroiled in the war because European presence in their territory was so limited—and would be for almost another half century.

===European settlement===

Europeans began to settle the region in 1715 after John Marsh came from Hartford to what was known as the Greenwoods, the thickly forested part of the colony that corresponded roughly to today&#x27;s Litchfield County. Having explored and found friendly inhabitants, Marsh and a partner, John Buell of Lebanon, Connecticut, petitioned the General Assembly for the right to establish a town at &quot;a place called Bantam&quot;—the name possibly a corruption of the Algonquian word &quot;Peantum&quot;, the Potatuck group who lived in the area.

Representatives from Hartford and Windsor negotiated with the Potatuck for land, creating the town of Litchfield, which included the area later known as the South Farms, in 1720. The Potatuck reserved rights to a hunting lodge near today&#x27;s Mount Tom and Mt. Tom Pond, both of which became part of a state park on the northwest side of Morris in 1915. While some natives welcomed, or at least tolerated, the newcomers, others did not. The region was subject to periodic Mohawk incursions from the north and west. Some years later, Zebulon Gibbs recalled a 1722 raid in which a settler was killed and scalped. &quot;I was the first who found him dead,&quot; Gibbs said.

When colonists first lived in South Farms is unclear. Land deeds on the east side date to 1723, when local surveyors laid out the area&#x27;s first east–west road. Also on the east end, and perhaps even earlier, a north–south road from Litchfield&#x27;s Chestnut Hill ran down through the section that became known as The Pitch (so-called because the settlers &quot;pitched&quot;, or drew lots, for land there). In 1724, the Connecticut Colony required settlers to build a fort, a log bulwark, on a hillside near the intersection of the old Woodbury (now Higbie) Road and present-day Benton Road. The work took them away from planting, diminished the year&#x27;s harvest, and was consequently unpopular. The structure fell fairly rapidly into disrepair.

Colonial government policies and military action reduced the likelihood of conflict with native groups by 1726, when two European families lived near today&#x27;s Litchfield-Morris border on a north–south track (now Alain White Road) that was more central to the area. At least thirty families very probably lived in South Farms by 1747, since it had a school, which the General Assembly required of places with that number. Meanwhile, colonial policies and disease had decimated the Potatuck. Some who remained merged with other nearby bands to form the Schaghticoke tribe, which still exists in Kent today. Individuals lived alongside the settlers through the 1700s and on into the 1900s. Typically, they adopted non-native customs and religion, though some also conserved elements of traditional culture such as the craft of basketweaving.

===From settlement to town===

Between 1747 and 1859, residents of South Farms were involved in sporadic arguments with the town of Litchfield, the colony, and after independence, the state, over control of their religious and civic activities.

Church and state were inextricably interconnected in the Connecticut Colony&#x27;s early days. South Farms residents had to petition the General Assembly in Hartford for permission to build a meeting house, which would make it possible to avoid the long trip to the center of Litchfield in the winter. After years of resistance, the Assembly finally acquiesced in 1767, when it authorized the organization of a separate Ecclesiastical Society of South Farms. Instead of ending the friction over local control, this act presaged ongoing arguments about the fair division of payments for the existing Litchfield church as well as about funding for the new meeting house in South Farms and for the four, then five, then six schools there.

During the Revolutionary War, South Farms residents were taxed heavily to support the rebellion, and over 100 men served in either the militia or the Colonial Army. Some went to the defense of Danbury after British forces attacked a supply depot in 1777, others as far as Canada and Virginia.

Perhaps the most noteworthy was James Morris, who as a youth had been tutored by Bethlehem minister Joseph Bellamy, a significant figure in the religious Great Awakening. Morris considered a calling to the ministry after he graduated from Yale in 1775, but in 1776 he joined the Continental Army instead, fighting at Long Island and White Plains before being captured at the Battle of Germantown in Pennsylvania. He was imprisoned in Philadelphia, paroled on Long Island, and subsequently exchanged. In the last years of the war, he served as a captain of light infantry under Alexander Hamilton at the Battle of Yorktown.

After the war, Morris returned to South Farms, where he cared for his ailing parents. Concerned for the education and moral welfare of the community&#x27;s youth, he began sharing his library with, and teaching, both boys and girls. Fearing that the girls would grow to be too independent, some locals tried to censure him. His alleged transgressions included permitting students to dance at the close of lessons, treating female students too familiarly, and allowing them to pursue an academic course of study in the first place. The controversy led to a public hearing in which Morris prevailed. In 1803, he opened an academy in a new school building.

The Morris Academy was one of the new nation&#x27;s first coeducational secondary schools, &quot;instructing youths…in the higher branches of literature and the sciences together with the Christian precepts of morality and virtue.&quot; During the years in which it existed, students came from 63 Connecticut towns, 15 states and 10 countries including Argentina, France, Germany, Spain and the West Indies. Among them were the abolitionist John Brown; William and Henry Ward Beecher, brothers of Harriet Beecher Stowe; the native Hawaiian Henry Obookiah, who was a symbol of the American Foreign Mission movement, and Samuel Mills, its &quot;father;&quot; a governor and a lieutenant governor of Connecticut and four congressmen. Morris died in 1820, but the academy continued for another 68 years, having educated more than 1,200 young men and women by the time it closed.

By 1810, when families were still largely self-sufficient, South Farms farmers cultivated wheat, rye, corn and oats. Women spun flax for linen. Sheep and cattle produced wool and milk, respectively, while oxen provided power for field labor. Water mills turned out grist and lumber, as well as seed for products such as linseed oil. Scattered throughout the area were several small stores, smithies, cider mills and other small businesses.

Although its location was rural, South Farms in the early 1800s had connections to the outside world not only because of the academy&#x27;s relatively diverse student body but also because it was part of an active transportation network. At the time, the area had two centers. One at the east end (now East Morris) was at a four corners on the Straitsville toll road (today Straits Turnpike/Route 63), which connected farther north to Litchfield, Albany and Vermont and which ran south to New Haven. Drovers used the roads to move horses, cattle and mules from as far as Vermont. Concord stages brought travelers to and through the area, where they stopped and stayed at local taverns.

Ultimately, however, the more westerly crossroads (leading to East Morris, Litchfield, Bethlehem, Washington and New Milford) became South Farms&#x27; hub. It was more geographically central. A public school; the Morris Academy; and the church, a focus of social life, were there. Also, odors from an East End tannery grew so noxious, people moved to be away from it. South Farms had a Society for Moral and Intellectual Improvement as well as a Lyceum for debating contemporary issues. It also had the first library in Litchfield, dating to 1785.

By 1829, the Great Pond was called Bantam Lake, and local entrepreneurs advertised pleasure cruises and &quot;a small establishment&quot; where ladies and gentlemen could &quot;spend a few hours on and about this beautiful sheet of water.&quot;

In 1786 and again in 1810, the South Farms Society had sought Litchfield&#x27;s permission to form a separate town because of concerns about autonomy similar to those that had prompted the earlier petition for a separate parish. Litchfield successfully opposed both in the General Assembly. In 1859, however, the Assembly approved the voters&#x27; petition for separation. In it, they had described the problems caused by their distance from Litchfield, its inattention to their concerns, and the cost of maintaining roads and bridges that were far removed from them. The new town was named after its native son, the Revolutionary War soldier and pioneering educator.

===A farming community===

At its creation, Morris was a farming community of and about 700 souls. &quot;Almost every homestead was a farm to some degree, …much the same … agricultural economy&quot; as a century before.

Two years later, young men from Morris were serving in the Union Army, mostly in the 19th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry—later the 2nd Connecticut Heavy Artillery Regiment—organized in Litchfield. By the end of the Civil War, at least 33 Morris men had fought in some of the bloodiest battles of the conflict, from Cold Harbor to Atlanta to Petersburg. Five had died. Resident Mary Stockbridge said that when &quot;one after another of the flower of our town was laid in our yard, our hearts were nearly broken.&quot;

In a town where the majority of voters were Democrats, a number questioned the war. Supporters of the Union cause argued vigorously, and sometimes heatedly, with these &quot;white feather&quot; peace advocates. A tradition of lively public exchange continued through the conflict and after; at its conclusion, the Lyceum debated whether representatives from the late Confederacy should be seated in Congress.

At the start, agriculture had made New England families self-sufficient. In the 1800s, it became a profit-making enterprise, especially as the railroad opened markets farther from home. Over the course of the 19th century and into the 20th, farming also became a race to offset narrowing profit margins by expanding sales and creating economies. A major part of the problem was the so-called &quot;tragedy of the commons:&quot; what made sense for a single commercial farmer—producing more goods for sale—was not in either his or the common interest when everyone did the same. More production meant more supply for a limited market. More supply from local farms and still more from beyond the region depressed prices. Profitability suffered.

Farmers in Morris adapted with Yankee ingenuity. Over time, they lowered overhead by reducing the number of workers they needed; they employed new technologies—substituted mechanical reapers and mowers for scythe and cradle, for instance. With better machinery, they could retire their oxen and use horses for work—animals that then doubled as transportation. Later, in the 1900s, trucks and tractors replaced horses. Other innovations—electrical milking machines, refrigeration for milk, for instance—continued to improve efficiency and productivity.

They also planted new crops—potatoes, sweet corn and cabbage—to appeal to new markets in Waterbury and elsewhere. For a time, the newly built Shepaug Railroad took milk from West Morris to New York City, but dealers there collaborated to lower the prices they paid the farmers and to increase their own profits. The farmers responded with a cooperative that sold and delivered their milk, but they were still competing with other producers from other areas. In 1892, they voted to accept a half cent a quart less than twenty years earlier.

They invented new organizations and adopted new practices. In 1934, they created the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. In 1936, the federal Agricultural Adjustment Act began providing assistance to farms. In 1940, Albert Humphrey produced the first test tube calf in Litchfield County. But even as they created economies and innovated, costs rose. New regulations like tuberculin testing and vaccination for cows proved burdensome. Machinery and equipment—large milk holding tanks, for instance—were increasingly expensive.

By the late 1950s, therefore, the size and productivity of Morris&#x27; working farms had grown, but their number had declined. To add to their problems, improving transportation systems and refrigeration had made product from the fertile Midwest—and beyond—ever more cost-competitive. By the 1970s and 1980s, therefore, agriculture in Morris was becoming what it was in the 2000s—a couple of larger operations, underwritten by income from other sources, and smaller ones that served specialty markets. It had become harder and harder, if it wasn&#x27;t impossible, to make a living by farming alone.

===The rise and decline of industry===

The other main economic driver in 19th- and early 20th-century Morris was its collection of water mills, general stores, and other small businesses, some of which had begun as home industries.

One of the more interesting, if somewhat anomalous, businesses during this period was a copper mine on east end land purchased by P.T. Barnum in 1850. Located on near Saw Mill Brook (later dammed to create the Pitch Reservoir), it had two vertical shafts and a tunnel and was a financial bust.

By the late 1800s, the town had three saw or grain mills and a wood-turning mill. Shops produced items from clothes frames to the scythe sharpeners known as &quot;Emmons rifles&quot; to innovative horse-drawn hay rakes, to wagons and sleighs. Some operated in manufactories, others in barns or other farm buildings. The town also had a brickyard; tanneries; cattle dealers; and smithies where workers shoed animals, produced knives and made other implements.

Mass production and new technologies threatened these small businesses in much the same way rising costs and external competition had affected agriculture. Through the late 1800s and early 1900s, manufacturing shifted to larger towns and cities like Waterbury, which flourished well into the 20th century. Furthermore, from the Great Depression and two World Wars, in which over 75 Morris residents served and two died, emerged a national economy, accelerated urbanization and a more mobile population.

===The modern era, a case study in transition===

By the late 1950s and early 1960s, therefore, Morris and similar towns were in transition. The remaining farms were surrounded by large tracts of open land, field and forest where stone walls were reminders of former pastures. Small businesses had changed with the times—the town now had gas stations instead of a wagon manufactory, for instance—but these operations, too, had to reckon with outside competition, and some would close. A growing number of residents commuted to nearby towns and cities for work.

Twenty years later, some farmland had been broken up and developed; for the most part, however, housing was still a mix of Early American structures and newer ones strung loosely along or back from a handful of main roads. Telephones, television, radio, and the roads connected Morris to the rest of the world. Second-home owners from metro New York added to its diversity. But in some ways, the town was not so different from what it had been in the 1800s.

Although it was only two hours by car from New York City, its relative isolation protected it from heedless development and urban sprawl. On the other hand, its location posed special challenges. How would it stay economically viable when local farms and businesses faced low-cost competition from elsewhere? How would it hold onto a population with a healthy mix of ages and incomes when outside opportunities beckoned?

To meet these two challenges, it would have to contend with a third: How would it support desirable development and simultaneously protect the low-key rural character and natural beauty that attracted people in the first place?

Connecticut authorized regional development planning in 1947, and in 1969 it required localities to create their own plans for conservation and development. Meanwhile, normal property turnover and individual initiative shaped development less intentionally. Several outcomes were noteworthy.

===Developments and trends===

====Demographics====

Between 1950 and 2010, the population of Morris roughly tripled, from 770 to 2388. At the same time, it was aging. By 2017, the median age in the U.S. was 38, in Connecticut 41, and in Morris 47, which was actually lower than in many other area communities. These developments reflected the town&#x27;s transition from a primarily agrarian to a semi-rural community with mixed employment. There were more second homes, often owned by weekenders from the metropolitan New York area.

Also, high school graduates from Morris—as well as from other Litchfield County towns, generally—were more likely to leave after completing their formal education, both as a result of normal mobility and because of limited job prospects. Nonetheless, a number remained or came back to the region. In Morris, three quarters of residents were Connecticut natives.

There were 29 towns in Litchfield County. Median income in Morris was eighth highest. Birthrate and family size were the state average.

====Agriculture====

By the early 2000s, there were at least three different models of agriculture in Morris:

*Marketing a specialty product nationally while also supporting traditional product. White Flower Farm, founded in 1950, raised flowers and shrubs for national distribution and had beef cattle as a sideline.
*Marketing traditional products regionally, with support from other activities. South Farms, named for the original settlement, was a several-generation enterprise that had reinvented itself as an event venue. It also leased property for raising hops. The income supported cultivation of corn and cattle.
*Targeted regional marketing of traditional product. Truelove Farm, a smaller operation, marketed beef, ham and produce to targeted sources.

Although the locally-grown movement and specialty markets (hops, e.g.) had created new opportunities, farmers were still squeezed by the availability of cheap goods from outside the area; by the dis-economy of running small or mid-sized operations as equipment, technology, insurance and other costs rose; and by the cost of state health and other regulations, which often failed to reflect the realities of small non-dairy farming.

How a more robust farm economy could develop under these conditions was unclear.

====Tourism, recreation, spiritual renewal====

Bantam Lake had attracted visitors since at least the 1820s, and by late in the nineteenth century, its southern third had become a summer destination for cottage renters and hotel guests. On the east end of town, meanwhile, investors had purchased a large amount of land, where they planned to build a new hotel and spa, a version of Saratoga, but closer to New York City.

The dream of South Farms Springs died in 1904, a story of liens, attachments and lost possibility. Meanwhile, life by the lake flourished. Restaurants and a dance and roller-skating pavilion appeared in the early 1900s. Though these commercial enterprises had closed by the 1990s, the lake remained an attraction for visitors, summer residents and, increasingly, year-round homeowners.

South Farms Springs&#x27; spiritual successor was the Winvian Farm, whose owner in the 1940s was Winthrop Smith, a partner of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. After his death in 1961, his widow, Vivian, married Charles McVay, former captain of the doomed World War II heavy cruiser &quot;Indianapolis&quot;. In 2009, Smith&#x27;s daughter-in-law turned Winvian into a luxury hotel that included the 1775 Seth Bird house and 18, sometimes exotic, theme-based cottages—a tree house and one built around a helicopter, for example—as well as a spa, a pool, and a five-star restaurant.

In 1999, the Woodbury-Southbury Rod and Gun Club purchased the Anderson Farm on Higbie Road, which the same family had operated for several generations. The property remained in farmland and served simultaneously as a fishing and bird hunting preserve.

Mount Tom and Mount Tom Pond were parts of Mount Tom State Park, Connecticut&#x27;s oldest. Camp Columbia became its newest in 2000. The tract included a small slice of land on Bantam Lake, a much larger expanse of field and forest with hiking trails to its south, and a section of wood and wetland to the west, across Route 209. Originally four adjoining farms, it was purchased by Columbia University in 1903 for a school of engineering field station. It was also a training camp for army officers during World War I and later a summer camp for the Columbia football team.

The White Memorial Foundation, created in 1913 by Litchfield residents Alain White and his sister, May White, to honor their parents, acquired of former farmland, about half of it in Morris. The northern and eastern parts of Bantam Lake shoreline were Conservancy property, along with of trails, an education center, a museum and research stations. The Conservancy&#x27;s mix of fields, forest, ponds and wetland, as well as the lake and Bantam River, was open to the public for a range of outdoor activities that included hiking, horseback riding, kayaking and cross-country skiing.

The Mattatuck Trail, a intermediate hiking trail, ran through the White Conservancy, eastward across the northern edge of the town, and down a ridgeline in The Pitch on the way to Waterbury. Its name was an Algonquian term for the Waterbury area, meaning &quot;place with no trees&quot;.

Finally, the Rev. Floyd Kenyon had founded Camp Washington in the Lakeside section of Morris in 1917. Originally a summer residential camp for boys, it later became co-educational. In 1991, its owner, the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut, finished renovating and building facilities to create a year-round retreat and training center for all age groups, as well.

These resources helped to preserve the town&#x27;s rural character. Like the prospects for farming, however, the potential for further development in tourism and recreation was unclear.

====Open space====

Outside of the two state parks and the White Memorial Conservancy, Morris in the 1990s was still largely woodland, wetland, and farmland, some working and some former. Concerned about maintaining the town&#x27;s scenic, rural character, a group of residents in 2006 created the not-for-profit Morris Land Trust, where conservation easements would permanently limit non-farm development and protect agricultural resources.

The largest acquisition was the 2017 transfer of the Farnham farm, which had been in the same family since 1735—an addition made possible by financial support from the Connecticut Farmland Trust. The property includes &quot;farm fields, stone walls, meandering streams, wetlands, diverse forest habitat, and a portion of the Mattatuck Trail.&quot; The land trust continued to seek additions of property consistent with a strategic plan that set priorities for land acquisition. Funding remained an ongoing challenge.

Serving as the water supply for the City of Waterbury, the Pitch Reservoir and most of the Morris Reservoir, as well as their wooded watersheds, had also been dedicated open space since the early 1900s. They connected to the Shepaug Reservoir in Warren through a tunnel, completed in 1926, that ran under Bantam Lake.

====Education====

A well-educated populace was essential to the town&#x27;s—and region&#x27;s—civic health and economic well-being. Since at least the 1850s, the story of Morris&#x27;s schools had been one of consolidation and extension—from several common schools to one elementary school; from three upper grades to local to regional high school.

At the time of its incorporation, Morris had six separate school districts, each with its one-room common school (ages 6–14) and single teacher. Though public high schools began to appear elsewhere in Connecticut during the 1850s, Morris families could pay tuition for their children to continue their education at the Morris Academy. Litchfield High School also became an option in mid- to late century, initially on a tuition basis. The Morris Academy closed in 1888 following a long-term decline in enrollment. A significant factor was competition from publicly funded public schooling, which the state had mandated and begun to support financially twenty years before.

In 1904, 142 of 158 registered Morris voters approved a proposal to provide instruction for students up to the age of 17. Older pupils were taught in the Congregational minister&#x27;s home. Later they moved to the Center School, which was raised to include a room on the second floor; younger children continued in the one room on the first. Students who wanted a diploma could complete their final year of high school in Litchfield.

Until 1910, children in the common school had been taught a more-or-less single curriculum, with adaptation for individual differences. Thereafter, the teacher was supposed to differentiate instruction by grade level—a big challenge, given the range of ages and abilities in a single room. The new &quot;upstairs&quot; class of 22 older children faced the same challenge, according to a state inspector—though he noted that the &quot;school is doing a great service to the community,&quot; preparing them for successful work at Litchfield High.

In 1918, an inspector observed essentially the same conditions and said that &quot;The difficulty for the teacher does not consist in the number of pupils, it lies … in the fact that there are so many different classes of work (subjects and levels) to teach.&quot; He added that &quot;Morris is above the average in respect to the interest taken by the people in social life. During the year, the School… has done much in the line of entertainment which has tended to draw the people (of the town) together.&quot;

In the first part of the 20th century, &quot;(a)n unusually large percentage of the pupils in Morris attended high school. The showing…they made… was a matter of pride to the townspeople.&quot; While some graduates remained in town, others made a difference in the wider world. Sally May Johnson studied at Simmons, graduated from the Massachusetts General Hospital School for Nurses and from Teachers College, Columbia, became Chief Nurse at the Army School of Nursing after serving in World War I, and later was an administrator at Mass. General.

Speaking to the American Nurses Association, she described her childhood in &quot;a little rural New England village, where there were space, clean air, glorious sunsets, starry heavens at night, always a beautiful landscape—a place where fine people lived nobly and without ostentation.&quot;

The state began to reimburse towns for elementary school transportation in 1931, after which the town voted to consolidate its six districts and house all students in one new building at the site of the old Center School. With large enough numbers together under a single roof, there could be a class at each grade and a single curriculum in each class. The James Morris School opened in 1932. In 1935, the Board of Education voted to extend the high school program to a full four years.

Rising enrollments created a need for more classroom space in the late 1940s. One option was to create a new, larger, secondary school by consolidating again, this time with one or more neighboring towns. After considering the idea&#x27;s educational and financial advantages, the town united with Warren and Goshen in 1953 to form Regional School District 6. Atypically, the new Wamogo High School was sited in none of the participating communities, but in centrally located Litchfield. Each town retained its own elementary school.

In the following years, and especially as enrollments began to tail off in the 1970s, there was periodic talk of yet more consolidation, this time with Litchfield. Outreach led nowhere on at least two occasions. By the 2000s, however, some grades at the elementary school had a single class and fewer than ten pupils. Meanwhile, Wamogo held roughly 520 students in grades 7–12, including a number from other districts in its award-winning grade 9–12 agri-science program. Litchfield&#x27;s grades 7–12 had approximately 530 students, a total of about 70 per grade. As a result, consolidation was again a topic of conversation.

In June 2022, after nearly 70 years of episodic discussion and two years of study, voters in each town approved a plan to come together in a new regional District 20. The decision will create a new, merged high school on the Wamogo campus, and a new middle school at the former Litchfield High School. Each town will retain its local elementary school.

Following the creation of a new 12-person board of education and two years of planning, the merged secondary schools will open in the fall of 2024.

Among the reasons for the positive vote were the possibility of offering more courses and a wider array of athletic and other co-curricular opportunities, as well as projected financial savings. Opponents expressed concern that larger Litchfield might override the interests of the smaller towns.

====Economic activity and employment====

Between the new Region 20 school district and the several area independent schools, elementary and secondary education was a significant sector of employment in Morris in the first years of the 2000s. Recreational activities and tourism generated economic activity at Popey&#x27;s Ice Cream Shoppe, at West Shore Seafood, in marine repair and dock installation, and at the handful of other stores in town, as well as in service businesses.

In addition to Winvian, White Flower Farm, and South Farms, other local businesses with broad regional or national reach included I2 Systems (LED lighting design and manufacture), Brierwood Nursery, BigTool Rack, and Harvest Moon timber-frame construction.

Other businesses, professions and entrepreneurial activities fell into no single category. A representative list included agriculture, antique furniture restoration, blacksmithing, construction, electronics, engineering, excavation, furniture design and construction, house painting, interior design, investment, law, lawn care, local and state government, marine products, media, metal fabrication, musical instrument production, nursing, nurseries, physical therapy, publications, horse farming and riding, software design, tree care, veterinary medicine, visual art, winery design and production. Just under a quarter of workers were self-employed.

Considering regional demographic and economic trends in the second decade of the 2000s, local committees and regional entities—the Northwest Connecticut Economic Development Corporation, the Northwest Hills Council of Governments, the Northwest Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, ConneCT and the Rural Lab—began to develop strategies for bringing enhanced fiber-optic communication to the entire region, as well as for promoting tourism, arts and culture, farming, manufacturing and innovation/entrepreneurship.

Resident middle and high school students attend the Northwestern Regional District 7, located in Winsted, Connecticut. It operates Northwestern Regional Middle School and Northwestern Regional High School.

==Community and recreation==
New Hartford is home to Ski Sundown, a locally popular ski mountain that attracts many skiers and snowboarders in Litchfield County. It hosts several Slopestyle Competitions and winter events every year. Many other community events are held at Brodie Park, which lies on the edge of West Hill Lake, where a small beach and swimming area is welcome for New Hartford Residents. Several of the events held at Brodie Park are The Race Around The Lake, on Memorial Day weekend, several camps and concerts during the summer, a community picnic in July, and an annual children&#x27;s Christmas Party held in Berkshire Hall. All other events are held in New Hartford Center, primarily the annual Light New Hartford held in early December. New Hartford is the largest town in the local area and therefore has many of the regional sports teams. Most games for baseball, softball, soccer and football are held at Brown&#x27;s Corner, which is off Route 202.

==Places of worship==
There are six churches in New Hartford: two Congregational churches (the oldest church in the town, at New Hartford Center, and another in the village of Nepaug), an Episcopal church (at Pine Meadow), Saint Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church, a Methodist church (in the village of Bakerville), a Baptist church (Harvest Baptist) and Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church. There is also a Buddhist temple, at Bakerville.

The town&#x27;s main thoroughfares are U.S. Route 202 and U.S. Route 44. US 202 leads west to Torrington and east to Avon, while US 44 leads northwest to Winsted and southeast to Hartford. Connecticut Route 219 has its southern terminus at US 202 between Bakerville and Nepaug, and leads north through New Hartford Center into Barkhamsted.

Being a primarily rural town, New Hartford does not have any public transit services.

<text>New Preston is a rural village and census-designated place (CDP) in the northwestern corner of the town of Washington, Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the New Preston CDP was 1,182, out of 3,578 in the entire town of Washington.

==Geography==
The New Preston CDP includes the entire northwestern quadrant of the town of Washington, including the villages of New Preston and Marbledale, as well as Mount Bushnell and Meeker Swamp. The CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.47%, are water. The dominant geographic feature of New Preston is Lake Waramaug, which is situated just north of the New Preston village center and is the headwaters of the East Aspetuck River, which runs through the village center and over New Preston Falls. The terrain is characterized by steep hills and narrow valleys, with a preponderance of talus slopes and ledge rock.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,110 people, 439 households, and 303 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 563 housing units at an average density of 76.1 per square mile (29.4/km). The racial makeup of the CDP was 97.84% White, 0.36% African American, 0.09% Native American, 0.18% Asian, 0.27% from other races, and 1.26% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.17% of the population.

There were 439 households, out of which 30.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.6% were married couples living together, 5.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.8% were non-families. 26.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.00.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.4% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 17.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.9 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $55,962, and the median income for a family was $69,000. Males had a median income of $45,673 versus $28,333 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $36,566. About 3.4% of families and 3.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under age 18 and 19.9% of those age 65 or over.

Many of New Preston&#x27;s inhabitants are part-time residents who principally reside in New York City, so census data may not accurately reflect the population&#x27;s actual demography.

==Transportation==
The two main roads in New Preston are U.S. Route 202 and Connecticut Route 45. US 202 leads northeast to Litchfield and southwest to New Milford, while Route 45 leads north to Warren. There is no public transportation.

==History==

===Pre-colonial===
Archeological evidence suggests that Native Americans first settled in the area around 10,000 years ago, following the retreat of the glaciers at the conclusion of the last ice age. What is now known as New Preston came to be inhabited by the Wyantenock tribe of Native Americans, who spent summers at Lake Waramaug, establishing a pattern of seasonal residence that is widely repeated by New Preston&#x27;s present-day occupants.

===Colonial===
The signature of Chief Waramaug, who led the Wyantenock tribe in the early 18th century, appears on several local colonial-era property records, including the &quot;New Milford North Purchase&quot;, which encompassed a substantial swath of southern Litchfield County, including contemporary New Preston. Colonists settled New Preston in 1741, and the General Assembly of the Connecticut Colony granted a petition for the establishment of the New Preston Ecclesiastical Society in 1753. In April 1778 the 270 families living in the area petitioned the General Assembly to be incorporated as a town. The petition was granted in January of the following year, incorporating the Town of Washington from the parishes of Judea and New Preston and taking from the towns of Woodbury, Litchfield, Kent, and New Milford. The action marked the first establishment of a municipality in Connecticut after the Declaration of Independence was signed. The town was named after George Washington, who, in his capacity as Commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolution, passed through the area several times. In May 1781, George Washington slept in New Preston at the Cogswell Tavern, which still stands on present-day Christian Street and is used as a private residence.

===19th century===
In the early decades of the 19th century (the era of the Industrial Revolution), numerous mills and modestly scaled factories were constructed along the East Aspetuck River, which drops precipitously between its source at Lake Waramaug and the New Preston village center, providing a robust source of water power. New Preston housed an iron works, as well as manufacturers of twine, hats, cheese boxes, ax handles, shoes, and harnesses. However, with the advent of electricity, expansion of national rail networks, and the rise of larger, more accessible manufacturing centers during the latter part of the 19th century, industrial activity in New Preston decreased, eventually disappearing altogether.

In the latter decades of the 19th century, New Preston began its transformation to a summer colony. With the arrival of the Shepaug Railroad in 1872, passenger service was introduced between New Preston Station and New York City, which gave rise to the construction of summer homes and inns around the perimeter of Lake Waramaug.

===20th century===
The railroad ceased operation in 1948, and many of the large inns on the lake closed, giving way to single-family residences used primarily as vacation homes.

By the 1970s, much of New Preston&#x27;s diminutive village center had fallen into decline, with many shops left vacant and in various states of disrepair. Several buildings and locations in New Preston were used in the filming of the 1981 horror movie &quot;Friday the 13th, Part 2&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, a transformation of the village center began with the opening of a store specializing in antique gardening books and horticultural prints. Antique shops and other upscale retail establishments soon followed, and many of New Preston&#x27;s historic commercial structures underwent renovation. The village&#x27;s only grocery store, pharmacy, and gas station closed, leaving New Preston largely devoid of essential services.

By the mid-1990s, the village center had been completely made over into a picturesque, high-end retail destination catering primarily to weekend residents and out-of-town visitors.

===Contemporary===
During the booming economy of the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the gentrification of New Preston shifted into high gear. Modest lake cottages around Lake Waramaug were torn down and replaced with larger, more luxurious homes, and other lake houses underwent substantial renovation and expansion. Two of the four remaining inns on the lake—The Inn at Lake Waramaug and The Birches Inn—were converted into lavish single-family residences.

==Architecture==
New Preston is known for its traditional rural New England architecture, which includes many well-preserved 18th and 19th century homes built in the Georgian, Greek Revival, Italianate, and Shingle styles, as well as several 19th century mill structures along the East Aspetuck River. Antique barns and other agricultural outbuildings are also widely prevalent.

Because New Preston&#x27;s steep, rocky terrain presents significant constraints to development, most viable development sites were utilized prior to 1900, making contemporary construction of new homes and businesses rare. As a consequence, New Preston exhibits a high degree of architectural and aesthetic cohesion. When new construction does occur, it generally follows—or attempts to follow—the historic vernacular. Portions of New Preston Hill Road and Findlay Road, three quarters of a mile west of the village center, are included in the New Preston Hill Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The more prominent buildings in that district include Hill Congregational Church, the Rev. Samuel Whittlesey House (1808), and the John Ferris House (1800).

==Open space==
A substantial portion of the land in and around New Preston is permanently protected open space, which consists of state parks, local land trust holdings, and privately owned parcels under conservation easement. Public open space areas include the Macricostas Preserve, Mount Bushnell State Park, and a parcel adjacent to the New Preston village center, which the town of Washington purchased in 2010 with money from its open space fund.

==Scenic roads==
In 1996, the Connecticut Department of Transportation designated the of perimeter roads around Lake Waramaug as state scenic roads, affording them a legal status that discourages maintenance or improvements that would detract from the roads&#x27; scenic qualities. In 2010, New Preston&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfare, East Shore Road (also known as Connecticut Route 45), was designated a state scenic road, together with a portion of Route 202 extending northeast from the junction with Route 45 to Rabbit Hill Road.

The town of Washington has also given municipal scenic road designations in New Preston to Rabbit Hill Road, Couch Road, Gunn Hill Road, and Whittlesey Road.

==Postal addresses, municipalities, and nomenclature==
Although the village of New Preston and the New Preston CDP are entirely within the town of Washington, U.S. Postal Service addressing practices result in the name being applied to the Marble Dale section of Washington, and to portions of the adjacent town of Warren. While New Preston village once had its own post office, it is now served by a combined New Preston-Marble Dale post office, which is located in Marble Dale, and also serves the southern portion of Warren. Further confusing matters, there are three separate post offices in the town of Washington, each with a unique ZIP code: Washington (06793), Washington Depot (06794), and New Preston-Marble Dale (06777).

==Notable people==
Many high-profile New York City residents and expatriates maintain homes in New Preston. Current inhabitants of note include Graydon Carter, the editor of the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, actress Christine Baranski, and bandleader Peter Duchin. Past notable residents include the fashion designer Bill Blass, comedian Joan Rivers, and theologian Horace Bushnell.

Former US Congressman Frederick Whittlesey was born here.
Psychiatrist and writer, M. Scott Peck lived here in 1979.

<text>Plymouth is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States, located within the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. It is named after Plymouth, Devon, England. The population was 11,671 at the 2020 census, down from 12,243 at the 2010 census. The town of Plymouth includes the villages of Plymouth Center, Terryville and Pequabuck.

==History==
The town was incorporated in 1795 and became known nationally for the manufacture of clocks. The town was named after Plymouth, Massachusetts. Plymouth (formerly Northbury, a section of Waterbury) was originally used as a burying ground for Waterbury. History records show that it was founded by a group of people who believed they had found a large deposit of lead. This fabled &quot;lead mine&quot; never actually existed (or is still yet to be discovered). The oldest home in the community is on Route 6, and dates to 1690–1700.

In the 1790s, George Washington traveled through here, both to visit relatives and to stay away from the coastline.

The Terry family participated in a great deal of Plymouth&#x27;s history. Eli Terry became partners with Seth Thomas and Silas Hoadley to manufacture clocks in the Greystone section of town. Terry gave the factory to Hoadley and Thomas, and opened his own clock factory near Carter Road in Plymouth Center, while Thomas moved to Plymouth Hollow. Eli Terry, Jr. (son of Eli Terry) joined with another man who was interested in the cabinet and lock industry, and they opened the Eagle Lock Company. In the 1880s, the Plymouth Hollow section of Plymouth decided to split off and become the town of Thomaston, named after Seth Thomas. The Eagle Lock Company closed in the 1970s, and in 1975 the entire abandoned site burned, leaving one building left undamaged. The rest of the buildings were torn down or had floors removed.

The Main Street School was located on the green (Baldwin Park) in Terryville. It was demolished in the 1930s, and the new Terryville High School was constructed behind the green on North Main Street. In the mid-2000s, Prospect Street School and Main Street School (previously called East Main Street) were left abandoned, so the construction of the new Terryville High School could begin in the Holt section of town. The Harry S. Fisher Middle School was turned into the Harry S. Fisher Elementary School, and the old Terryville High School was turned into the Eli Terry Jr. Middle School.

==Geography==
Plymouth is in southeastern Litchfield County and is bordered to the east by the city of Bristol in Hartford County and to the south by the city of Waterbury in New Haven County. Terryville, the largest community in Plymouth, is in the eastern part of town, while Plymouth Center is in the west. The community of Pequabuck is on the eastern border of the town, southeast of Terryville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Plymouth has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.99%, are water. Part of Mattatuck State Forest is in the southwest corner of the town.

<text>Roxbury is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 2,260 at the 2020 census. The town is located northeast of New York City, and is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

==History==
Roxbury, whose Native name was &quot;Shepaug&quot;, a Mahican word signifying &quot;rocky water&quot;, was settled about 1713 as a parish of Woodbury, which meant that the parish rate, a household-based tax, supported the local Roxbury puritan church rather than the Woodbury church. About a decade after the end of the American Revolution, Roxbury incorporated as a town in October 1796. Roxbury is either descriptively named, or the name is a transfer from Roxbury, Massachusetts.

Mine Hill and its minerals have been associated with Roxbury since the middle of the 18th century. A silver mine was opened here and was later found to contain spathic iron, specially adapted to steel making, and a small smelting furnace was built. The abundance of granite found in many of Mine Hill&#x27;s quarries provided the building material for the ore roaster and blast furnace, as well as for such world wonders as the Brooklyn Bridge and Grand Central Terminal in New York City.

<doc id="108761" wikidata="Q2323182" url="?curid=108761" title="Salisbury, Connecticut">
<text>Salisbury () is a town situated in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town is the northwesternmost in the state of Connecticut; the Connecticut-Massachusetts-New York tri-state marker is located at the northwestern corner of the town. The population was 4,194 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

==History==
Salisbury was established and incorporated in 1741, and contains several historic homes, though some were replaced by larger modern structures in the late 20th century. Salisbury was named for Salisbury, a city in England. Historian Ed Kirby relates that traces of iron were discovered in what was to become Salisbury in 1728, with the discovery of the large deposit at Old Hill (later Ore Hill) in 1731 by John Pell and Ezekiel Ashley. From before the American Revolution, through the Federal Period of the nation, and until &quot;circa&quot; 1920, Salisbury was the seat of an important iron industry.
Additional iron mines were opened, mostly in the western end of the town, although historian Diana Muir dismisses them as &quot;scarcely big enough to notice,&quot; with the further disadvantage of not being near a river large enough to ship iron to market at a reasonable cost. The solution, according to Muir, was to pour labor into the iron, working it into a quality of wrought iron so high that it could be used even for gun barrels. This fetched a high price and made Salisbury iron the celebrated choice of Connecticut&#x27;s early nineteenth-century arms industry as well as the preeminent source of cast-iron railroad car wheels until they were superseded by steel wheels. Peter P. Everts, an agent of the mid-19th-century mines, however, stated the quality of Salisbury iron varied. The iron industry in Salisbury became inactive following World War I, a plan to revive it during World War II was never implemented, and the mines remain under water.

Scoville Library in Salisbury was the first in the United States open to the public free of charge. Salisbury is also home to the oldest Methodist church in New England, the Lakeville Methodist Church, constructed in 1789.

<text>Thomaston is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 7,442 at the 2020 census. The urban center of the town is the Thomaston census-designated place, with a population of 1,928 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town, originally part of the town of Plymouth and referred to as &quot;Plymouth Hollow&quot;, was first settled by Henry Cook (&quot;the soldier in the wilderness&quot;, 1683–1750) around 1728. The town is known for clockmaking, which started in 1803, when Eli Terry established a factory in the town. Terry brought mass production to the clockmaking industry, helping to reduce the cost of clocks. He introduced and patented the shelf clock in 1814, which reduced the cost of a clock from $25 to $5. His clocks were sold throughout the United States.

The town was incorporated in its own right and under the name &quot;Thomaston&quot; in 1875. The name derives from Seth Thomas, the early clockmaker, who established a factory in town in 1812. The Seth Thomas clock factory building still exists; however, the clockmaking industry has long since left the state as well as the country.

<text>Washington is a rural town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, in the North Eastern region of the United States. The population was 3,646 at the 2020 census. Washington is known for its picturesque countryside, historic architecture, and active civic and cultural life. The town has strong ties to New York City, and is home to many cultural and business elites. The town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

==History==

===Prehistoric period===
Archeological evidence suggests that Native Americans first settled along the banks of the Shepaug River about 10,000 years ago, following the conclusion of the last ice age. Before the arrival of European settlers, the lands today comprising Washington were inhabited by the Wyantenock tribe.

===Colonial era===
In 1734, Joseph Hurlbut settled the eastern section of what is now Washington, marking the beginning of the town&#x27;s inhabitation by colonists. The area around the Hurlbut homestead came to be known as the Judea Parish, a name preserved in the still active Judea Cemetery. The area was initially part of Woodbury.

In 1746, Edward Cogswell secured the right to mine iron ore, as part of the New Milford North Purchase, and established an ironworks along the East Aspetuck River in New Preston. 1746 also marked the purchase of land from the Wyantenock tribe by the Averill family for a homestead on Baldwin Hill, which is still occupied and farmed by direct descendants of the original inhabitants.

Washington was incorporated in 1779, with lands carved from the towns of Woodbury, Litchfield, Kent and New Milford. The town was named after George Washington, who traveled through the area several times during the American Revolution, and proverbially slept in New Preston in 1781. Major William Cogswell, son of Edward Cogswell, was elected the town&#x27;s first selectman.

===19th century===

&quot;Industrial Revolution&quot;. Early in the 19th century, small mills and factories proliferated along the Shepaug River in present-day Washington Depot, which came to be known as &quot;Factory Hollow&quot;. Small-scale industry simultaneously appeared along the banks of the East Aspetuck River in New Preston.

&quot;Invention of Summer Camp&quot;. In 1861, Frederick W. Gunn, the abolitionist founder of the Gunnery prep school, opened one of America&#x27;s earliest summer camp&#x27;s in Washington.

&quot;Slavery Safe Harbor&quot;. Washington was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Local residents provided a safe harbor for slaves fleeing captivity, and organized efforts to throw bounty hunters off the tracks of their pursuits.

&quot;Arcadian Movement&quot;. The arrival of the Shepaug Railroad in Washington in 1872 introduced rail service to New York City, which brought an influx of new visitors. Architect Ehrick Rossiter, then a recent graduate of the local Gunnery prep school, saw an opportunity to establish an understated alternative to Greenwich, Newport, and the ostentation favored by the nouveaux riches of the day. In collaboration with a coterie of wealthy New York patrons, Rossiter remade the Washington Green area into an idyllic summer colony, transforming it into an idealized version of the quintessential New England village. During this period, the Congregational church received a makeover, commercial enterprises were eliminated for aesthetic purposes, and restrained but elegant summer homes—many of them designed by Rossiter himself—were constructed. Contemporaneously, new seasonal residents established themselves at Lake Waramaug in New Preston.

===20th century===
&quot;Birth of Steep Rock&quot;. In 1925, architect Ehrick Rossiter donated of land along the Shepaug River to a group of trustees for the purpose of preserving it as open space, marking the founding of the Steep Rock Association land trust, which today holds land and conservation easements protecting more than in Washington.

&quot;Flood of 1955&quot;. In August 1955, two large storms passed over Litchfield County in close succession, flooding many local river valleys. North of Washington Depot, twin culverts carrying the Shepaug River under U.S. Route 202 were plugged with debris, causing floodwaters to accumulate upstream. The culverts and roadway succumbed to the resulting pressure, causing a wall of water to race down the river valley, washing away many of the homes and businesses in the Depot&#x27;s village center, and killing a couple who ignored warnings to evacuate. A reconstruction effort, led by Henry B. Van Sinderen, and modeled after a town on Long Island, was quickly commenced. Homes and businesses soon reemerged, but the village lost many historic structures, and it has never regained its pre-flood density or vitality. The layout and visual character of the Depot were also radically altered, and the village center assumed its contemporary appearance, which varies considerably from Washington&#x27;s traditional architectural vernacular.

&quot;Invasion of the Iroquois&quot;. In 1986, Iroquois Gas Transmission System sought permission from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to construct a natural gas pipeline through New York and Connecticut. The proposed route ran through Lake Waramaug&#x27;s eastern watershed, across the Shepaug River, and through the Steep Rock Reservation, with a secondary spur running through Washington Green and Nettleton Hollow. The Washington Environmental Council became an intervenor in the proceedings, retained a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm, and mounted a vigorous opposition campaign. In 1989, Iroquois decided to reroute the pipeline, shifting it south of Washington&#x27;s borders.

&quot;Shepaug River Lawsuit&quot;. In 1997, Washington residents voted unanimously to join a lawsuit against the City of Waterbury, which operates a reservoir at the headwaters of the Shepaug River in the adjacent town of Warren. Waterbury, which had long relied on the reservoir to supply water to its citizens, had come to view the river as a revenue stream, and was removing extra water to sell to neighboring municipalities. The lawsuit, which the town of Roxbury also joined, sought to compel Waterbury to release more water into the river, which slowed to a trickle during summer months, impeding important ecological functions. After considerable legal maneuvering on both sides, river advocates prevailed in February 2000, when a Superior Court judge ordered Waterbury to release more water into the Shepaug.

&quot;Sempra Fight&quot;. In 1998, Sempra Energy submitted a proposal to the Connecticut Siting Council to construct a power plant approximately south of Washington in New Milford. The plant was to emit 443 tons of pollutants per year, many of which would have projected toward Washington, owing to the region&#x27;s prevailing wind patterns and complex terrain. The Washington Environmental Council hired environmental consultants, who demonstrated that the plan would be particularly harmful to New Preston and Lake Waramaug. The council became an intervenor in the proceedings and generated scientific evidence that was cited by the Siting Council when it unanimously rejected the permit application in 1999.

===Contemporary Washington===

In 2008, Optasite submitted an application to the Connecticut Siting Council to erect a telecommunications tower atop Tanner Hill in a visually conspicuous location above the Macricostas Preserve, some north of the Washington town line. The State of Connecticut had previously purchased the development rights for the land beneath the proposed tower site for farmland preservation. Washington&#x27;s Conservation Commission became an intervenor in the application. Working with a coalition that included Governor Jodi Rell, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, and an ad-hoc community organization called CROWW, they built an environmental and legal case against the tower proposal. In 2009, Optasite withdrew its application, and legislation was subsequently introduced in the Connecticut General Assembly to hold companies liable for costs incurred as a consequence of applications submitted to the Siting Council in bad faith.

==Geography==
Washington is located in the Litchfield Hills region of Connecticut, approximately northeast of Danbury, west of Hartford, and northeast of New York City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.48%, are water.

The dominant geographic features of Washington are the Shepaug, East Aspetuck, and Bantam river valleys. Lake Waramaug is in the northeast corner of the town. The landscape is characterized by rolling hills, high plateaus, and river and stream valleys. Mixed deciduous and coniferous forest covers most of Washington, but open agricultural fields are also prevalent.

===Principal communities===
* Washington Green
* Washington Depot
* New Preston
* Marbledale
* Woodville

===Natural resources===
* The Shepaug River flows north to south, roughly through the center of Washington, through a winding, largely undeveloped river valley. Substantial areas along the Shepaug have been preserved as open space, yielding a large and regionally unique protected riparian corridor. Major preserved areas include the Steep Rock Preserve and the Hidden Valley Preserve.
* Lake Waramaug, which is situated at the town&#x27;s northwestern corner, at its border with Warren and Kent, is the second largest natural lake in Connecticut.
* Mount Tom and Mount Tom Pond are in Washington&#x27;s northeast corner and share municipal boundaries with the towns of Morris and Litchfield. Mount Tom State Park is one of Connecticut&#x27;s oldest state parks. A stone tower at the top of the mountain affords distant views and attracts many hikers.
* Meeker Swamp is a large complex of exceptionally high-quality wetlands which overlay a geologically distinctive aquifer. Primary portions of the swamp are located within the Macricostas Preserve. The area provides regionally unique habitat areas for migratory birds and numerous rare plant and animal species, while the aquifer—Washington&#x27;s largest—includes substantial reserves of potable water.
* The ridgeline running east–west along Washington&#x27;s northern boundary, between Lake Waramaug and the Shepaug River, forms the edge of the northern portion of the Highlands of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

==Demographics==
Many families have local histories dating back to the Colonial period. The town is overwhelmingly caucasian, has a substantial gay population, and is unusually urbane for a rural community. A significant percentage of homes are occupied on a part-time basis, with their owners residing principally in New York City or elsewhere. Consequently, census data may not accurately reflect the population&#x27;s demography.

As of the census of 2000, there were 3,596 people, 1,416 households, and 951 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 1,764 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 95.66% White, 0.64% African American, 0.11% Native American, 1.56% Asian, 0.78% from other races, and 1.25% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.14% of the population.

There were 1,416 households, out of which 28.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.6% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.8% were non-families. 26.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.94.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 24.4% under the age of 18, 6.0% from 18 to 24, 23.9% from 25 to 44, 29.9% from 45 to 64, and 15.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $65,288, and the median income for a family was $80,745. Males had a median income of $51,610 versus $35,337 for females. The per capita income for the town was $37,215. About 2.7% of families and 3.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.5% of those under age 18 and 9.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
Washington has a traditional New England town meeting form of government, which operates under the Connecticut General Statutes. Town meetings serve as Washington&#x27;s chief legislative body, and several specialized boards and commissions, run by volunteer residents, tend to municipal business.

An elected board of selectmen manages day-to-day town affairs, and an elected board of finance tends to municipal financial matters. A planning commission, consisting of members appointed by the board of selectmen, engages in long-range town planning—particularly with respect to land-use—and decennially prepares a Plan of Conservation and Development. The planning commission also establishes regulations concerning the subdivision of land, and reviews and acts upon subdivision proposals. An elected zoning commission promulgates and applies zoning regulations, and an inland wetlands commission, appointed by the board of selectmen, regulates activities in or near wetlands and watercourses. A historic district commission reviews development proposals within Washington&#x27;s historic districts, and issues certificates of appropriateness for proposals it approves. A conservation commission, also appointed by the board of selectmen, establishes advisory conservation policies, advocates for the conservation of Washington&#x27;s natural and cultural resources, and acquires and manages municipal open space, consisting of land owned by the town and conservation easements held on private property.

Washington&#x27;s volunteer boards and commissions are supplemented by a small paid staff, which includes the full-time elected positions of First Selectman, Town Clerk, Tax Collector, and Judge of Probate. The town also has a paid land-use coordinator, zoning enforcement officer, inland wetlands enforcement officer, assessor, building inspector, and administrative staff, as well as a road crew and building maintenance person.

===Civic life===

Washington has a culture of volunteerism and active civic engagement. Many residents give freely of their time and resources to operate town government, provide emergency services, and support local community organizations. The town has unusually high voter turnout rates, and, in several elections, has had the highest level of voter participation of any municipality in Connecticut. For example, Washington&#x27;s voter turnout rate in the 2004 presidential election was as high as 93.08%

===Conservation focus===
Successive generations of Washington residents have actively supported land conservation efforts, and their gifts of property and conservation easements to local land trusts have yielded large tracts of permanent open space.

The town&#x27;s strong conservation ethic is also evident in its land-use policies, which strictly limit new development. Washington was one of the first Connecticut municipalities to establish zoning regulations, which were enacted in 1939, The town&#x27;s contemporary land-use policies are substantially natural resource-based, and they have been expressly conceived to maintain the community&#x27;s rural character. Washington is one of only two municipalities in Connecticut to base permissible residential density on the soils composition of land parcels, and it was one of the first Connecticut towns to adopt net-density subdivision regulations, which render wetlands, flood plains, and steep slopes ineligible for satisfying the minimum acreage requirements for creating new building lots Consequently, even large tracts of land may not qualify for subdivision. Washington&#x27;s inland wetlands regulations are similarly rigorous

Development proposals seen as posing a threat to the town&#x27;s natural resources or rural character typically elicit controversy and often result in litigation, which is quietly underwritten by Washington&#x27;s deep-pocketed and well-connected residents.

==Economy==
Washington&#x27;s economy has changed considerably over the course of the town&#x27;s history. At various points, iron works, logging, manufacturing, and farming have driven local economic activity, but contemporary Washington has no industrial base, and only a handful of farms remain active.
Today, the local economy is centered on the town&#x27;s population of affluent, part-time residents, whose income, for the most part, is not locally derived. The design, construction, renovation, decoration, maintenance, and sale of country houses accounts for a substantial portion of local economic activity. Restaurants, inns, speciality retail shops, and professional services also play an important role in Washington&#x27;s economy, as do educational institutions.

== Infrastructure ==

===Transportation===
U.S. Route 202 runs east–west in the northern part of town, connecting the villages of Marbledale, New Preston, and Woodville. Connecticut Route 109 runs east–west near the town&#x27;s geographic center, connecting Washington Depot with New Milford and Morris. The main north–south highways are Route 47, Route 199, and Route 45. There is no public transportation within the town.

===Architecture===
A substantial percentage of the houses in Washington were built prior to 1950, and many of the structures built since then have faithfully followed the town&#x27;s rural New England vernacular, resulting in an unusual degree of architectural cohesion. Washington has many well preserved historic homes, built in the Georgian, Greek Revival, Italianate, and Shingle styles, and many 19th century mill structures, barns, and other agricultural outbuildings.

The Connecticut Historical Commission conducted a comprehensive inventory of historic structures in Washington and in 2000 published the voluminous &quot;Historic and Architectural Resource Survey of Washington, Connecticut,&quot; which includes detailed information about dozens of historic structures throughout the town.

===Historic districts===
Washington includes three municipal historic district and one federally designated National Register district.
* The Washington Green Historic District encompasses the area around the Congregational Church and includes portions of Green Hill Road, Kirby Road, Parsonage Lane, and Old North Road. The district includes several buildings designed by architect Ehrick Rossiter, together with well-preserved 18th- and 19th-century houses designed in the Georgian, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles.
* The Calhoun–Ives Historic District runs along Calhoun Street and Ives Road. It is Connecticut&#x27;s only agricultural historic district and is characterized by modestly scaled 18th- and 19th-century farmhouses, built in the Georgian and Greek Revival styles, together with accompanying agricultural outbuildings, farm fields, and fruit orchards.
* The Sunny Ridge Historic District encompasses the area along Sunny Ridge Road, just south of its junction with Connecticut Route 109, and includes several well-preserved 18th century Georgian homes.
* The New Preston Hill Historic District overlays portions of the top of New Preston Hill, along New Preston Hill Road and Findlay Road, approximately three quarters of a mile west of the New Preston village center. The structures in this district are built principally in the Georgian style.

==Education==

Television writer/producer Amy Sherman-Palladino used a trip to Washington Depot and the Mayflower Inn with her husband Daniel as the inspiration and basis for the fictional town of Stars Hollow seen in her television series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, along with Lorelai Gilmore&#x27;s workplace, the Independence Inn. A &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; fan festival took place in the town in October 2016, in anticipation of the series&#x27; Netflix revival.

Portions of the 1981 horror movie &quot;Friday the 13th, Part 2&quot;, were filmed in New Preston.

Author Stuart Woods&#x27; principal character Stone Barrington had a house in Washington and often ate at the Mayflower Inn. He drives from Manhattan to Washington in numerous novels.

<text>Watertown is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 22,105 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Watertown, before colonization, belonged to the Paugasuck Indians. In that time, the colony was called &quot;Mattatock&quot;, though it had several variations in spelling through the years. Colonization of the area today called Watertown began in 1684 when Thomas Judd and other proprietors bought the land as a group. The land where Watertown is now located, having originally belonged to Mattatock, officially changed its name to Watterbury (now Waterbury) by record on March 20, 1695, by consensus of a council. 

In 1729, the Garnsey family settled in an area of Watterbury, now called Guernseytown. The oldest house in Watertown today was built in 1735 on Main Street. A poet from the Revolutionary War, John Trumbull, was born here in 1750.

With a population of 338, the First Ecclesiastical Society of Westbury was formed. The Town of Watertown was officially established in 1780 when Westbury separated from Watterbury.

<text>Winsted is a census-designated place and an incorporated city in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. It is part of the town of Winchester. The population of Winsted was 7,192 at the 2020 census, a decrease from 7,712 at the 2010 census. It comprises the majority of the town of Winchester&#x27;s 10,224 population. Winsted is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region.

==History==

Settled in 1750, the city of Winsted was formed at the junction of the Mad River and Still River and was one of the first mill towns in Connecticut. Manufactured products started with scythes at the Winsted Manufacturing Company in 1792. The city is within the town of Winchester, and its name derives from the fact that it is the business center for the towns of Winchester and Barkhamsted.

Winsted, along with New Haven, Connecticut, was a center for the production of mechanical clocks in the 1900s. The Gilbert Clock Company, located along the Still River north of town, was founded in 1871 by William L. Gilbert (1806–1890) and became one of the largest clock companies in the world around the start of the 20th century.
The Winsted post office contains an oil on canvas mural, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Arbiter Settles the Winsted Post Office Controversy&quot;, painted by muralist Amy Jones in 1938. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

The Gilbert School, originally endowed with more than $600,000 by William L. Gilbert, is a private secondary school that serves as the public high school for the town of Winchester.

In 1955, Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane passed over Connecticut within one week, flooding the Mad River and Still River through downtown. The Mad River, which parallels Main Street, caused flooding up to deep through the center of town. This damaged the buildings between Main Street and the river such that all buildings on that side of Main Street through the center of town were subsequently removed and Main Street widened to four lanes. The buildings on the north side of Main Street for the most part survived and were repaired. Further downstream, the Still River flowed between the buildings of the Gilbert Clock Company. The flooding caused extensive damage to their buildings, and this was the final blow to a company which was already in poor financial condition.

Northwestern Connecticut Community College was founded in 1965 by Winsted residents, including Ralph Nader&#x27;s older brother, Shafeek. It occupies the original Gilbert School building. NCCC was one of the first four community colleges in Connecticut, and is accredited by both the Connecticut Board of Governors for Higher Education and by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The Northwestern Community College Foundation was incorporated in 1981 to support the mission of Northwestern Connecticut Community College. NCCF generates private funds for the purpose of benefiting the students attending NCCC and the community of Winsted.

In 2013, Henry Centrella, the former city finance director, was served a complaint which stated that over $2.2 million was misappropriated during his 30-year tenure.

Ralph Nader opened the American Museum of Tort Law in 2015, inside the former Winsted Savings Bank building at 654 Main Street.

<text>Woodbury is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 9,723 at the 2020 census. The town center, comprising the adjacent villages of Woodbury and North Woodbury, is designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Woodbury Center census-designated place (CDP). Woodbury was founded in 1673.

The center of Woodbury is distinctive for its mile-long stretch of older buildings lining both sides of the road. The public buildings in the National Register Historic District include the First Congregational Church (1818), the Old Town Hall (1846), the United Methodist Church, the St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church (1785), and the North Congregational Church (1816).

The most eye-catching of the public buildings is the Masonic Temple (1839). It is a modest, clapboard, Greek Revival temple, notable less for its architecture than for its dramatic location, situated atop a high cliff accessed by a long flight of steps (there is a modern road at the rear). It is visible from a distance and is especially dramatic at night, when it is illuminated by spotlights. The Woodbury Temple echoes the many temples of the Greek world that were perched at the edge of high places from which they could be seen from miles around and from far out at sea.

Originally, the many historic houses on the street were residential. In the late twentieth century, they were occupied by a series of antique shops. Woodbury is often referred to as Connecticut&#x27;s antiques capital.

Woodbury is one of the two towns in Litchfield County, along with Bethlehem, served by the area code 203/area code 475 overlay.

&lt;/div style&gt;

==History==
The founders of Woodbury came from Stratford, Connecticut, in the early 1670s. Ancient Woodbury consisted of the present towns of Woodbury, Southbury, Roxbury, Bethlehem, most of Washington and parts of Middlebury and Oxford.

Two groups of settlers came from Stratford. The first, religious dissidents unhappy with the church in Stratford, was led by Woodbury&#x27;s first minister, the Reverend Zachariah Walker. The second, led by Deacon Samuel Sherman, had been given approval by the general court to purchase land from local Native Americans in order to establish a new settlement. Together, fifteen families (about fifty people), arrived in ancient Woodbury, known as &quot;Pomperaug Plantation&quot;, early in 1673.

In 1673, these original settlers drew up an agreement called the &quot;Fundamental Articles&quot;, which proclaimed that as many settlers as could be accommodated would be welcomed to the new settlement. The Fundamental Articles stated that expenses of establishing the settlement would be shared by its inhabitants, and that no one was to be given more than twenty-five or less than ten acres of land. Other sections of the articles provided for common land and for land saved to be divided up for future inhabitants of the settlement.
Signers of the Fundamental Articles:
The settlement was named Woodbury, which means &quot;dwelling place in the woods&quot;, and was first recognized as a town in 1674. Deacon and captain John Minor was the first leader of the community during Woodbury&#x27;s early years. Minor was the first town clerk and, along with Lieutenant Joseph Judson, served as the first deputy to the Connecticut General Court from the town of Woodbury. On October 9, 1751, the town of Woodbury was transferred from Fairfield County at the formation of Litchfield County.

On March 25, 1783, a meeting of ten Episcopal clergy in Woodbury elected Samuel Seabury the first American Episcopal bishop, the second presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, and the first bishop of Connecticut.

===The Woodbury Songbook===

The German composer Hanns Eisler, who had taken asylum in the United States after fleeing from the Nazi rule in Germany, spent three and a half months (from June 15 to September 30, 1941) in Woodbury as the guest of another German refugee, Joachim Schumacher, and his wife Sylvia. Joachim taught classes in art history, musicology, philosophy, and other subjects at the Westover School in Middlebury. Sylvia taught piano at Westover School and privately in her home. Joachim enticed Eisler to compose 20 songs on 16 US children&#x27;s verses or nursery rhymes and four texts in the German language by Goethe, Eduard Mörike and Ignazio Silone. The songs were composed for female voices and suitable for a school chorus. This was published as &quot;The Woodbury Songbook&quot;, or, in German, &quot;Das Woodbury Liederbüchlein&quot; with the lyrics in English and German, unfortunately with a wrong spelling of Woodbury (with two &quot;r&quot;s). The German translations are by Wieland Herzfelde.

The best showing for any Democrat in Woodbury since the founding of the GOP occurred in 1964 when Lyndon Johnson received 48.82% of the vote in an election where he won Connecticut with 67.81% of the vote.

Similarly, Woodbury has also supported the last 36 GOP campaigns for governor of Connecticut.

This may have included the Tunxis, Quinnipiac, Wangunk, and the Wappinger. In 1651, the Mattabesset settlement was incorporated as a town by English settlers. By 1653, the colonists had renamed the settlement Middletown. 
The area now known as Cromwell was referred to by many names before separating from Middletown. It was commonly referred to as the Upper Houses or Upper Middletown. Upper Middletown is surrounded by natural barriers; such as, the Connecticut River, Mattabesset River and by ridgelines in the North and West. By 1715, the Upper Houses had 50 households, their own school, church and cemetery. Before the creation of the new cemetery in January 1713, burials took place in Middletown. The earliest burial is that of Martha Gipson, who had died in February of that year. As Middletown began to emerge as one of the busiest ports in New England, the Upper Houses also boasted its own expansion of maritime industries. As industry expanded within the Upper Houses a merchant class grew with it. Some of the village&#x27;s wealthier families owned slaves. Middletown was then incorporated as a city in 1784. 

In the 19th century, the War of 1812 limited maritime trade creating a decline in the Upper Houses. Some continued to pursue maritime industry, the village generally reverted back to its agricultural beginnings. By the mid century, the area was revitalized by the founding of several new industries. John and Elisha Stevens formed the J &amp; E Stevens Company in 1843. The company had intended to manufacture cast-iron hardware, hammers and a few iron toys. The brothers later shifted their business plan after much success with their iron toys. J &amp; E Stevens Company would grow to become the largest manufacturer of cast-iron toys in the county. Today, toys produced by this company are a valuable collectible item. In the early 1870s, Andrew N. Pierson emigrated from Sweden and established A.N. Pierson’s Inc. The company started as a small floral nursery, and later evolved into the largest commercial rose growing enterprise in the country. These new industries and labor opportunities created further opportunities for those immigrating to the area. Irish, German and Italian immigrants found housing along the river on lower Main Street, in areas that were more prone to flooding.

With the expansion of the Upper Houses, and the geographical barriers around the town it became increasingly difficult to maintain connection with the larger city of Middletown. Initially, the Upper Houses was able to meet the needs of its residents with the creation of its own school and church, but by the mid-19th century, a stronger movement to become independent of Middletown had developed. In 1851, the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut recognized Cromwell as a new town with a population of 1,259.

The exact origin of the town&#x27;s name is debated, but many acknowledge that it was named for either the 17th-century English leader Oliver Cromwell, or for the privateer Oliver Cromwell. Despite the continuing presence of industry, Cromwell maintained its rural character until the mid-20th century. Post-World War II the town began to change significantly, including growth in population. With the expansion of the highway system in Connecticut during the 1970s, Cromwell became an intersecting point for three major highway systems. The highway system created further retail and population development. By 1980 the population had grown to 10,265, which is over three times the size of 40 years earlier.

==History==

Saybrook Colony formally joined Connecticut in 1644. The portion of the original colony east of the Connecticut River was set off as a separate town in 1665. The site of the present village of Deep River was said to have been owned by John, Nathaniel, and Philip Kirtland in 1723. The village of Winthrop was said to have been settled by Baptists as early as 1729. In the early to mid-19th century, various portions of Saybrook broke off as separate towns, starting from Chester in 1836 to Old Saybrook in 1854. In 1947, the town of Saybrook changed its name to &quot;Deep River&quot;, matching the name of the town center village. The name &quot;Deep River&quot; was taken from the river/stream that once powered mills and factories that runs through it and not from the Connecticut River that is its eastern border. The actual Deep River stream begins at the border of its neighboring Town of Chester, in the western Winthrop section of town, on Cedar Swamp Road and flows through town to the stream that can be seen on Route 154, near Winter Avenue, empty onto the cove that connects to The Connecticut River. 

===Towns created from Saybrook Colony===

Saybrook Colony, along the mouth of the Connecticut River, was one of the early settlements in the area. Several towns broke off and incorporated separately over the course of time. The towns which were created from parts of Saybrook Colony are listed below.

*Westbrook in 1840
*Essex (originally Old Saybrook) in 1852

===Ivory===
From 1840 to &quot;circa&quot; 1940, the U.S. was the world&#x27;s biggest buyer of ivory and most of that ivory went to Deep River. Phineas Pratt developed an ivory lathe and eventually Deep River became known as &quot;the queen of the valley&quot; due to wealth from the ivory industry.

<text>East Haddam is a town in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. The population was 8,875 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
Until 1650, the area of East Haddam was inhabited by at least three Indigenous peoples: the Wangunk, the Mohegan and the Niantic. The Indigenous nations called the area &quot;Machimoodus&quot;, the place of noises, because of numerous earthquakes that were recorded between 1638 and 1899. Loud rumblings, the &quot;Moodus Noises&quot;, could be heard for miles surrounding the epicenter of the quakes near Mt. Tom. The land, which is now Haddam and East Haddam, was purchased by settlers from the natives in 1662 for thirty coats, worth about $100.

Layout of the highways began in 1669 with Creek Row about ¼ mile east of the River and Town Street “The Great Highway” about ¼ mile east of Creek Row. The first permanent settlers established homesteads along Creek Row in 1685. By 1700, there were thirty families living in East Haddam. Agricultural and timber farming, shipbuilding, tanneries and blacksmiths were among the early commerce. Captain John Chapman began ferry service across the Connecticut River in 1695, which ended with the completion of the swing bridge in 1913.

East Haddam was incorporated as a separate town from Haddam in 1734. By 1756, there were nearly 2,000 residents, with the Millington District as the most populated. Growth of commerce brought a surge in population to around 3,000 people by the mid-1800s. In the nineteenth century, Moodus was the “Twine Capital of America,” with twelve mills in operation. In the winter of 1773, American patriot Nathan Hale briefly taught in a one-room schoolhouse in East Haddam which is now a living history museum operated by .

Visitors and residents such as actor William Gillette whose castle home was completed in 1914, were drawn to the area known for its rural charm and natural scenery. The growth of the resort areas of Lake Hayward, Bashan Lake and Moodus Reservoir began in the early 1900s and was a booming business for the next fifty years. Lake Hayward is a small private lake community within East Haddam that is home to around 120 families, most living at the lake only during summer months.

East Haddam was listed as one of the 52 Places to Love in 2021 by the New York Times.

== History ==

=== The Great Attack ===

Essex is one of the few American towns to have ever been attacked by a foreign power; this occurred on April 8, 1814, and the economic losses were among the largest sustained by the United States during the War of 1812. 28 vessels, with a total value estimated to be close to $200,000 (at a time when a very large two story home in Essex, then known as Potapoug Point, would have been worth no more than $1,000), were destroyed by the British. One historian has called it the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; of that war.

On that date, approximately 136 British marines and sailors under the command of Richard Coote (or Coot) rowed 6 boats from four British warships (the , , &quot;Maidstone&quot; and ) anchored in Long Island Sound, 6 miles up the Connecticut River, past the unmanned fort in Old Saybrook, arriving at the boat launch at the foot of Main Street in Essex close to 4 A.M. The boats were armed with swivel guns loaded with grapeshot, the officers armed with swords and pistols, the marines with &quot;Brown Bess&quot; muskets, and the sailors with torches and axes; they responded to the single cannon fired by the town&#x27;s surprised defenders with a massive volley, neither side incurring any casualties. They quickly commandeered the town, eliciting a promise of no resistance from the Essex militia in return for promising not to harm the townspeople or burn their homes, while a messenger rode to Fort Trumbull in New London for help. A dubious local myth states that Coote did not burn the town as a favor to a local merchant who greeted him with a secret Masonic handshake.

The British marched to the Bushnell Tavern (now the Griswold Inn), then seized the town&#x27;s stores of rope (each ship of that time requiring 8 miles of rope) and, according to the April 19, 1814 Hartford Courant, &quot;$100,000 or upwards&quot; worth of rum (acquired from the East Indies in trade for beef and wood from Connecticut).

Their main targets, however, were the newly constructed privateers in the harbor, ready or nearly ready for sail, which they burned. Within 6 hours, their mission was accomplished, and The British went downstream with two captured ships in tow, including the &quot;Black Prince&quot;, a vessel that may well have primarily inspired the raid. Stranded in the river by low tide, they were forced to wait at the extreme range of the shots of the volunteers from the nearby town of Killingworth, Connecticut who lined the riverbanks; 2 marines were killed and the captured ships had to be destroyed, but the rest of the men escaped safely when the tide turned.

At the time of the raid, Essex (then known as Potopaug) had been a major center of shipping and shipbuilding, but was suffering under a blockade by The British; as a result, the privateers were being constructed. Captain Richard Hayden, a prominent shipbuilder, had advertised his &quot;Black Prince&quot; in a New York City newspaper as &quot;a 315 ton sharp schooner that would make an ideal privateer.&quot; This may have caught the attention of The British, who then investigated Essex and launched the successful raid. Perhaps as a consequence of the practical, but somewhat less than heroic, response of the town to the raid, shortly afterwards, the name of the town was changed to Essex.

On the second Saturday of each May since 1964, the &quot;Sailing Masters of 1812&quot; of Essex commemorate the &quot;Burning of the Ships&quot; with an ancient fife and drum corps parade down Main Street and ceremony at the steamboat dock, wearing the United States naval uniform of that period; by tradition, this event is unpublicized. The Connecticut River Museum, situated at the site where Coot landed, now hosts an exhibit portraying the raid, featuring a large diorama by Russell Joseph Buckingham, a musket ball believed to have been fired then and a plank from the ship &quot;Osage&quot;, burned by The British. Plans are to expand the celebration of &quot;the town&#x27;s worst day in history&quot; in future years, according to the museum&#x27;s executive director, Jerry Roberts.

=== Historical architecture ===

Centerbrook, a fertile and productive agricultural area, was the &quot;center&quot; of town until the Revolutionary War. Many farmhouses remain from this era. The Selah Griswold House and Clark Nott House on Bokum Road are fine examples of two-story center chimney homes that were characteristic of the time. The Benjamin Bushnell Homestead on Ingham Hill Road falls into the same category. Also characteristic of Centerbrook were smaller Cape Cod type homes. The Snow House on Main Street, the Nott House on Westbrook Road, the Taylor Bushnell House on Ingham Hill Road, and the Silent Rose House near the train station are fine examples. The dominant building in Centerbrook, from a historical standpoint, is the Congregational Church. This structure is the second to stand here, and the oldest existing church building in Middlesex County.

There were a few homes built in Essex Village (known as Potapoug Point until 1854) during the first half of the 18th century. One of the more notable is the Pratt House on West Avenue, an &quot;organic&quot; structure built according to the immediate needs of the Pratt family. Shipbuilding dominated between the Revolution and the Civil War. As a result, the village came to be the focal point of the area. Many homes were erected between 1790 and 1820. By that time, Main Street had much the same make-up as today. The homes were primarily Federal, with one extended family dominating lower Main Street. The first eight structures (including the Griswold Inn) on the south side of this highway (starting at the waterfront) were either built or lived in by members of the Hayden family. Of these eight structures, only the one on the west side of Novelty Lane and the one on the east corner of Parker Lane were not built by this family. The fact that the well known Hayden Shipyard was directly south of these buildings was the primary reason for this situation. All these homes are different architecturally. The Ebenezer Hayden House (third from the river) was the initial hip-roof house in the lower valley, and the current Episcopal Church Rectory (the Richard Hayden Dwelling) was the first brick house in the lower valley. Pratt Street runs parallel to Main Street, and many houses on that thoroughfare not only were built in the Federal style, but have their roof lines perpendicular to the street, which allows for more homes to be erected on a given highway. In addition, there are two homes on Pratt Street that have Palladian windows in the garret area. Also of note is the 1846 Baptist Church on Prospect Street, one of three Egyptian Revival style churches in the United States.

As the construction of wooden sailing ships faded, the growth of the ivory and piano parts industry in the village of Ivoryton changed the focal point of Essex again. The growth of Comstock, Cheney &amp; Co., one of the two largest producers of ivory products in the United States, made Ivoryton literally the center of Essex (and the lower Connecticut River Valley). The houses built here after the Civil war reflect the influence and affluence of that village. East Main Street, entering Ivoryton from Centerbrook is &quot; Victorian Row.&quot; All the houses along this way were owned by executives or stockholders of Comstock, Cheney &amp; Co. Contrast this with Essex Village, where there are relatively few Gothic or Victorian style dwellings, two examples of which are the 1855 &quot;Gingerbread House&quot; at the corner of Riverview Street and Maple Avenue, and the Parker House on North Main Street.

Perhaps the most culturally significant homes in town were built in Ivoryton during the 1890 to 1920 era. The factory was in desperate need of low-cost labor, and as a result, many immigrants from Italy and Poland came to work for Comstock, Cheney &amp; Co. around the turn of the 20th century. The firm constructed many factory homesteads for these people. The great majority of these homes remain today, although most have been substantially altered. A journey through Blake, Oak, Walnut, and Chestnut Streets as well as Comstock Avenue is most revealing, as these factory homes give a glimpse into the past.

<text>Fenwick is a borough in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States, in the town of Old Saybrook. The borough is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. The population was 53 at the 2020 census, making it the least populous borough in Connecticut. Most of the borough is included in the Fenwick Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1995, the district included 66 contributing buildings and one other contributing site.

Fenwick is set off from the town center of Old Saybrook by a large cove crossed by a causeway. It is located exactly where the Connecticut River flows into Long Island Sound, and sits on the river&#x27;s west side. The town has two lighthouses, the Inner and the Outer. The Inner is at the tip of Lynde Point, Fenwick&#x27;s peninsula, and the Outer is a quarter mile off shore, connected by a rough jetty. The Outer Light is the lighthouse shown on many Connecticut license plates.

==Fenwick Historic District==
The Fenwick Historic District covers an area of approximately and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It includes 60 buildings in the center of Fenwick, as well as the Fenwick Golf Course.

Architecturally, the Fenwick Historic District is composed largely of Shingle-style residences from early in the century. The Historic District comprises the bulk of the community, however some residences were built in the 1950s in a more modern style. Of the district&#x27;s 60 main buildings, 17 represent examples of the Shingle style, with some others in Queen Anne or Victorian styles. Frequent features include gable-on-hip roofs that encompass side porches with minimalist wood bracing, creating a sense of heaviness characteristic of the Shingle style. Other frequently observed common architectural features include flares at the eaves of roofs, upper stories that overhang lower stories, and pent roofs over windows and doors. All of the three are typified in St. Mary&#x27;s-By-the-Sea, a 1 and 1/2 story church building at 30 Agawam Avenue, designed by Francis Goodwin and built in 1883.

In the late 1800s The Fenwick Golf Course was created from several empty lots in the center of the district and is the site of the Stephen Potter Cup. The 9-hole golf course has changed layouts on several occasions, with the most recent re-design in the 1930s following acquisition of the course by the British manufacturer Armitage Shanks.

<text>Killingworth is a town in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. The population was 6,174 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
Killingworth was established from the area called Hammonasset, taken from the local Native American tribe of the same name. The area originally incorporated the area of the present town of Clinton, which was separated from Killingworth along ecclesiastical borders in 1838. Part of New London County prior to May 1785, Killingworth was then included in the newly formed Middlesex County, where it remains today.

The New England town received its name from Kenilworth, England, the previous home of one of the first settlers in New England, Edward Griswold. Kenilworth&#x27;s name resembled &quot;Killingworth&quot; during the colonial American period, though over time the pronunciations and spellings of the names drifted toward the two distinct modern ones. A town and village in England called Killingworth and Killingworth Village, in the county of Tyne and Wear, do not appear to have any connection with Killingworth, Connecticut.

In the late 17th century, Killingworth became the birthplace of what would eventually become Yale University. The Rev. Abraham Pierson, the college&#x27;s first president, taught some of the first classes in his Killingworth home—which is actually in present-day Clinton, Connecticut. However, in 1701, the college&#x27;s first official home was constructed in Old Saybrook on the peninsula known as Saybrook Point donated by Yale&#x27;s first Treasurer Nathanial Lynde. Eventually the school was moved to its present-day home in New Haven.

<text>Moodus is a village in the town of East Haddam, Connecticut, United States. The village is the basis of a census-designated place (CDP) of the same name. The population of the CDP was 1,982 as of the census of 2020.

==History==
Prior to its purchase by English settlers in 1662, the area around Moodus was inhabited by Native American Algonquians. The names of three of the inhabiting tribes are known: the Wangunks, the Mohegans and the Nehantics. The name was derived from the Native American name for the area. The name was &quot;Matchetmadosett&quot; or &quot;Matchitmoodus&quot;. It can be translated to &quot;the place of noises.&quot; Its name possibly because of the frequent earthquakes in the area. Numerous earthquakes were recorded in the area between 1638 and 1899. Loud rumblings, possibly the &quot;Moodus Noises&quot;, could be heard for miles surrounding the epicenter of the quakes near Mt. Tom. The land, which is now the towns of Haddam and East Haddam, was purchased by settlers from the Indians in 1662 for thirty coats. In today&#x27;s money, it is worth about $100.

During the nineteenth century, Moodus was advertised as the &quot;Twine Capital of America&quot;, with twelve mills in operation. The most successful was Brownell &amp; Company. Moodus was in an ideal location for textile production since it had access to ample water power and shipping (via the Connecticut River and the Connecticut Valley Railroad), and it was close to an enormous trading center and market, New York City. Moodus&#x27;s mills primarily manufactured cotton yarn, cotton duck, and twine, and that production lasted from 1819 to 1977. The mills also produced certain related products, particularly fishing nets and pearl buttons. A part of that textile mill history is preserved in the Johnsonville historical section of Moodus, named after one of the mill owners. Brownell was a pioneer with DuPont Corporation in the production of nylon products, and Brownell still manufacturers specialized textile-related products in Moodus such as archery bowstrings, helicopter cargo nets, and tennis nets.

Moodus had many local resorts that operated during the course of the early and mid-20th century. During the summer seasons of the 1940s and 1950s, people visiting the more than 30 Moodus-area resorts quadrupled East Haddam&#x27;s population to about 20,000 people. Nearby Bailey Beach on Bashan Lake was popular with local residents and vacationers alike. The resorts, boarding houses and camps of Moodus attracted Christian and Jewish vacationers primarily from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and other parts of Connecticut. One of the last resorts to remain in operation, Sunrise Resort, was purchased by the state of Connecticut in late 2008 to be incorporated into the adjacent Machimoodus State Park as a campground, and to protect &quot;4,700 feet of additional frontage along the Salmon River&quot;.

The village center, dubbed &quot;Downtown Moodus&quot;, located formerly at the intersection of routes CT 151 and CT 149, was a popular destination for resort guests. However most of the village was razed after the citizens of East Haddam controversially voted in 1967 to accept urban renewal funding to build a new commercial district for Moodus a quarter mile east, along CT 149. East Haddam was one of the smallest towns in the United States to participate in the urban renewal program.

==Geography==
Moodus is in eastern Middlesex County, in the northwest part of the town of East Haddam. Connecticut Routes 149 and 151 pass through the village, Route 149 running northeast–southwest and Route 151 running northwest–south. Colchester is to the northeast, East Hampton is to the north-northwest, and the village of East Haddam is to the south, on the Connecticut River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Moodus CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.59%, are water. The CDP includes the village of Bashan and some neighborhoods next to Moodus Reservoir in the northeast.

The area is subject to earthquakes, with an intensity VI quake occurring in 1568, and numerous quakes being recorded from 1638 onwards. The largest earthquake recorded for Connecticut was an intensity VII quake on May 16, 1791, near Moodus.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,263 people, 529 households, and 322 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 592 housing units at an average density of . The racial composition of the CDP was 97.78% White, 0.40% African American, 0.48% Native American, 0.16% Asian, 0.79% from other races, and 0.40% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.27% of the population.

The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the CDP, the age distribution was 25.7% younger than age 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 33.8% from 25 to 44, 21.9% from 45 to 64, and 12.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and older, there were 95.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $52,188, and the median income for a family was $68,500. Males had a median income of $42,938 versus $33,214 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $32,475. None of the families and 2.4% of the population were living below the poverty line, including none younger than age 18 and none of those older than age 64.

==Noises==
Moodus is infamous in Connecticut for strange noises coming from the woods which have been termed &quot;Moodus noises&quot;, and are attributed to shallow micro-earthquakes. The noises can be heard most strongly from Cave Hill, located next to Mt. Tom and owned by the Cave Hill Resort.

In the book &quot;Legendary Connecticut&quot;, author David Philips asserts that the Moodus noises were the source of an indigenous religious cult important to local Native Americans. Local Algonquin chiefs would gather around Mt. Tom in order to experience the living presence of the god Hobomok. Pequot, Mohegan and Narragansett tribes participated with this cult, and according to local Alison Guinness, the Wongums were involved as well. Hobomok was considered the spirit of the dead and worshipped by the tribe that inhabited the area. The Puritans that came to inhabit the area considered him evil. However, to the native people he was more like a Zeus or a Hades, a god that can do good or bad, depending on what mood he was in.

The Moodus noises were the basis for the otherworldly noises in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s “The Dunwich Horror”. The local high school&#x27;s athletic teams are dubbed the &quot;Noises&quot;.

<doc id="108785" wikidata="Q1020609" url="?curid=108785" title="Old Saybrook, Connecticut">
<text>Old Saybrook is a town in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. The population was 10,481 at the 2020 census. It contains the incorporated borough of Fenwick, and the census-designated places of Old Saybrook Center and Saybrook Manor.

==History==

In 1624, shortly after establishing their first settlement at Governors Island, Dutch settlers established a short-lived factory at present-day Old Saybrook. The trading post was named Kievits Hoek, or &quot;Plover&#x27;s Corner&quot;. Kievits Hoek was soon abandoned as the Dutch consolidated settlement at New Amsterdam. In 1633, Fort Goede Hoop (&quot;Huys de Goede Hoop&quot;), was established at present-day Hartford.

The Pequot siege of Saybrook Fort took place from September 1636 to March 1637 during the Pequot War.

Following the August 1636 Massachusetts Bay attack on Manisses, Pequot, and Western Niantic villages, the Pequot retaliation fell on the settlers at Saybrook. Over a period of eight months, the Pequot killed and wounded more than 20 settlers at and near Saybrook Fort. The settlers were attacked when they ventured far from their palisade, and the Pequot destroyed their provisions and burned warehouses while they attempted to interrupt river traffic to Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford.
During the Siege and Battle of Saybrook Fort, the Pequot and New England colonists assessed each other&#x27;s military capabilities, and adjusted countertactics. Each side&#x27;s tactical modifications show a high degree of sophistication, planning, and ingenuity. Lessons learned during the siege of Saybrook escalated the Pequot War in Connecticut Colony, and indirectly resulted in the attack and destruction of Mistick Fort (May 1637).

The Saybrook Colony was established in late 1635 at the mouth of the Connecticut River, in what is today Old Saybrook and environs. John Winthrop, the Younger, son of the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was designated governor by the group that claimed possession of the land via a deed of conveyance from Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. Winthrop was aided by Colonel George Fenwick and Captain Lion Gardiner. As the principals of the group who had planned to settle the colony were supporters of Oliver Cromwell and remained in England during the English Civil War, the colony struggled. In 1644, Fenwick agreed to merge the colony with the more vibrant Connecticut Colony a few miles upriver, which purchased the land and fort from him.

The design of the Flag of Connecticut comes from the seal of Saybrook Colony. The seal was brought from England by Colonel George Fenwick, and depicted 15 grapevines and a hand in the upper left corner with a scroll reading &quot;Qui Transtulit Sustinet&quot;, &quot;He who transplanted sustains&quot;.

In 1647 Major John Mason assumed command of Saybrook (Colony) Fort, which controlled the main trade and supply route to the upper river valley. The fort promptly and mysteriously burned to the ground, but another improved fort was quickly built nearby on the Battery Mound. He spent the next 12 years there and also served as commissioner of the United Colonies, the chief military officer, magistrate, and peacekeeper. In 1659, almost all settlers from Saybrook under the leadership of Mason, purchased land from Uncas, &quot;sachem&quot; of the Mohegan tribe, removed to and founded Norwich, Connecticut. This second fort was eventually abandoned after 200 years and the battery mound remained until 1871, when the Valley Railroad leveled it and other hills on the point to provide needed fill for their tracks across the north and south coves.

In 1661, a witch trial was held of Saybrook residents Margaret Jennings and her husband Nicholas, who were accused of causing the deaths of Marie Marvin and others. The trial resulted in a finding that they were probably witches, but the proof was not sufficient to execute them.

On October 9, 1701, the Collegiate School of Connecticut was chartered in Old Saybrook. It moved to New Haven in 1716, and was later renamed Yale University.

&quot;Turtle&quot;—the first American submarine—was invented in Westbrook, Connecticut, in 1775 by David Bushnell. A replica is housed at the Connecticut River Museum in Essex. 

The General Assembly created the separate town of Old Saybrook from Saybrook in 1852. Old Saybrook was partitioned again in 1854, when the northern part became the town of Essex.

A 1964 meeting at Old Saybrook, the First Invitational Conference on Humanistic Psychology, was key to the early development of humanistic psychology. Saybrook University in California, established in 1971, is named after the conference.

=== Later development ===

In early 2007, plans were established to return the former town hall building to its original use as a theater. The theater was completed in 2009 and is named the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center.

The town has committed spending almost $2 million on the renovation, and at least $810,000 were to be contributed by the state. A committee was attempting to raise another $2.5 million, partly for the renovation and to add two wings, but also for an endowment. The structure was originally built in 1901, and was a theater until the 1940s. After renovations, the theater was to seat 250, and Hepburn memorabilia would be displayed there.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 21.6 square miles (56.0 km), of which 6.6 sq mi (17.0 km) (30.45%) are covered by water.

Coastal Connecticut (including Old Saybrook) is the broad transition zone where so-called &quot;subtropical indicator&quot; plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. Old Saybrook averages about 90 days annually with freeze (temperatures of 32 °F/0 °C) – about the same as Baltimore, Maryland, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, for example. As such, southern magnolias, needle palms, windmill palms, loblolly pines, and crape myrtles are grown in private and public gardens.

==Education==

Old Saybrook is home to a district educational system. Kathleen E. Goodwin School is for prekindergarten through grade 4, Old Saybrook Middle School is for grades 5 through 8, and Old Saybrook Senior High School is for grades 9 through 12. The high school competes in the Shoreline Conference. In 2018 and 2019, the boys&#x27; soccer team won back-to-back state championships.

Old Saybrook is also home to prekindergarten through grade 8 at St John&#x27;s Catholic School, and toddler–grade 6 at the Children&#x27;s Tree Montessori School. The town also has a number of students who attend private schools, including nearby parochial schools such as Xavier High School and Mercy High School.

<doc id="108790" wikidata="Q2572361" url="?curid=108790" title="Beacon Falls, Connecticut">
<text>Beacon Falls is a town in western New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region and is approximately six miles from Waterbury. It lies in the southwestern part of the state, and is bisected by the Naugatuck River. The population was 6,000 at the 2020 census, down from 6,049 at the 2010 census.

== Founding ==
The area that was to become Beacon Falls was first inhabited by tribal communities of Paugusetts and Paugusucks and was originally known as Nyumps. Early history texts indicate that a former Native American slave called Toby bought much of the land that was to become the town on September 7, 1693, for 10 pounds and a barrel of cider.

Settlers from Derby, Connecticut moved to the area in 1678 and the town was incorporated in 1871 on lands carved from the neighboring towns of Bethany, Seymour, Naugatuck and Oxford. The town was named for Beacon Hill, from which a small waterfall descended.

== History ==

The history of Beacon Falls is tied to the series of manufacturing concerns that operated in the town&#x27;s impressive brick factory buildings on North Main Street, adjacent to the Naugatuck River. The last and most successful of those concerns was the Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries rubber manufacturing thrived in the Lower Naugatuck Valley. This followed the invention and 1844 patent, by Connecticut native Charles Goodyear, of a chemical process called Vulcanization to convert natural rubber into a durable, flexible, waterproof material. In the 1850s the American Hard Rubber Company built a brick factory in Beacon Falls, utilizing water power from the Naugatuck River. The company made buttons, whip sockets, and powder flasks. After that company was acquired and moved to Long Island, the empty brick building was bought by the Home Woolen Company, which in the 1860s expanded and manufactured woolen shawls, popular at the time with men, women and Civil War soldiers. The Home Woolen Company operated for 20-plus years until it became insolvent in 1887.

The 1898 inception of the Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company lay in the decision of George Lewis, President of the Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Co. of Naugatuck, Connecticut, and his son Tracy S. Lewis, Secretary and Treasurer of that company, to resign and start a new business together. In 1898 the two Lewis men bought the Home Woolen Company facility and started the Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company. The new company enjoyed great success for over two decades. From 150 pairs of shoes manufactured in 1899, by 1920 5.5 million pair were shipped; during that same time the town&#x27;s population doubled. The company specialized in rubber soled boots with leather uppers (like today&#x27;s &quot;L.L. Bean boots&quot;), and rubber soled athletic shoes with canvas uppers (now called &quot;sneakers&quot;). The footwear was marketed under the brand name, &quot;Top Notch.&quot;

The Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company was a tremendous physical, economic, and cultural presence in Beacon Falls. It made major civic efforts to enhance the town and the lives of its employees, including building a movie theater, with an assembly room and dance hall for public use, sponsoring a musical band that gave daily performances, and commissioning the influential landscape architectural firm Olmsted Brothers to create an overall design for company lands and buildings. The resulting plan embraced the Tracy S. Lewis House and a neighborhood of workers&#x27; homes above the factory.

Tracy Lewis died prematurely in 1921 at age 47, marking the demise of the Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company, followed by the gradual end of manufacturing at the Beacon Falls facility. After Lewis&#x27;s death, the company was acquired by the United States Rubber Company in Naugatuck (formerly Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Co., renamed Uniroyal, Inc. in 1961), and the Beacon Falls athletic shoe was renamed &quot;Keds.&quot; Production in the elegant brick factory buildings ended during the Great Depression in 1930, after which the buildings were used only for storage. Several buildings associated with the company, including the movie theater, were destroyed when the State of Connecticut widened the road in front of the factory in 1949, and when the Flood of 1955 (Connecticut) flooded the Naugatuck River, causing extensive damage through the valley. In 1984 the brick factory buildings were placed on the National Register of Historical Places as the &quot;Home Woolen Company&quot; (#84000410—&quot;also known as Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Factory&quot;). In the late 1980s the buildings were converted to a 188-unit, full-amenity apartment complex called Beacon Mill Village. The &quot;Depot Street Bridge,&quot; spanning the Naugatuck River across from the old brick factory, is also on the National Register of Historical Places (#07000108). Built in 1935 of riveted steel, it was designed by engineers from the Public Works Administration and the Connecticut Highway Department. The bridge joins the two parts of Beacon Falls bisected by the river.

A second major historical Beacon Falls business, where many town residents worked over the years, was the Homer D. Bronson Company. In 1884 the company moved to Beacon Falls from Waterbury, Connecticut (known as &quot;the brass capital of the world&quot;). The Homer D. Bronson Company manufactured a multitude of brass items, specializing in hinges used in industry and homes; automobile hood hinges were a major product.

<text>Bethany is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 5,297 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Bethany was first settled in 1717, but it was not until May 1832 that Bethany separated from Woodbridge to become incorporated as a town. This slightly remote, sparsely populated, residential town retains its rural character. There is some dairying and agriculture. The town is dotted with reservoirs serving Naugatuck and, principally, New Haven.
There have been inhabitants in Bethany since before 1638, predominantly Naugatucks of the Paugusset tribe and Mattabessitts of the Wanguck tribe. The first European settlers arrived in the area around April 1638, creating the towns of Milford and New Haven, with their boundary split down the middle of what is now Bethany. The area of the boundary was settled in 1678, twelve years after New Haven County was organized. In 1717, the Amity Parish was accepted by the General Assembly of the Connecticut Colony and in 1832, Bethany was incorporated as a town. The town is named after the biblical place.

In the mid-to-late 19th century, the population of the town and the land decreased as parts were annexed by the neighboring town of Woodbridge and the new town of Beacon Falls was incorporated into the general geography of Connecticut. The population would continue to decrease until about the 1940s, when the population would spike.

In 1923, the Bethany Airport opened up, one of the first in New England. Soon after, Troop I of the Boy Scouts of America (now known as Troop 931) was chartered in Bethany, and an organized police staff and volunteer fire fighter organization were founded. In 1954, a senior high school was built in Woodbridge to serve Woodbridge, Bethany, and Orange. Earlier Bethany students had been sent to public high schools in neighboring towns as tuition students for grades nine through twelve. In 1963, Amity Junior High School was created in Bethany.

In 1970, Bethany Community School was finished, replacing most of the single roomed schools. The layout composes of a main campus, and two four roomed schools, built in 1934. After the 1975 Ontario School shooting, they discontinued the four roomed schools for educational and safety reasons.

In 2007, Bethany was named Connecticut&#x27;s #1 Small Town by &quot;Connecticut Magazine&quot;.

===Town seal===
Bethany&#x27;s town seal is a circle within which appears a circle of rope. In the upper aspects of the seal appear the words TOWN OF BETHANY CONNECTICUT in two curved lines of print bordering the inner aspect of the rope circle. On the bottom of the seal also bordering the inner aspect of the rope circle appear the words INCORPORATED 1832. These words form the top and bottom edges of a third circle, the sides of which are made of a string of inverted oak leaves on each side. A roadway bisecting the seal and extending from bottom to center is pictured within the innermost circle. Surrounded by trees are Christ Episcopal Church pictured on the right, and First Church of Christ Congregational with carriage shed on the left. The Town Seal was created by local artist and Bethany resident, Betsy Seaton, as part of Bethany&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration in 1982.

== History ==
An area called &quot;Totoket&quot;, which became Branford, was part of the land bought from the Mattabesech Indians in 1638 by the first English settlers of New Haven. Previously, the Dutch in the New Netherland settlements set up a trading post at the mouth of the Branford River in the 17th century, the source of the name &quot;Dutch Wharf&quot;, also known as &quot;Dutch House Wharf&quot; and the Dutch House Quarter. The area was also described by Ezra Stiles as containing a &quot;Dutch Fort&quot;, as hinted at by archaeological excavations completed in the 1990s.

The town&#x27;s name is said to be derived from the town of Brentford, England. The town in early maps was called Brentford before being shortened to Branford. Established in 1644, Branford grew during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the late 18th century, the first shoreline community, Stony Creek, was settled. Indian Neck and Pine Orchard were also settled, but neither of those settlements was permanent until the mid-19th century.

In 1852, the railroad helped bring new business, including Branford Lockworks, Malleable Iron Fittings Company, and the Atlantic Wire Company. The Stony Creek granite quarries also rose to prominence as a direct consequence of railroad construction.

During the mid-19th century, Branford became a popular resort area. Approximately twenty hotels opened, including Indian Point House in Stony Creek, Montowese House in Indian Neck, and Sheldon House in Pine Orchard. During the mid-20th century, Branford shed its resort image. It developed with many characteristics typically associated with northeastern suburbs.

<text>Guilford is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, that borders Madison, Branford, North Branford and Durham, and is situated on I-95 and the Connecticut coast. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 22,073 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Prior to European colonization, the area that became Guilford was the site of Menunkatuck, a Quinnipiac village. The Quinnipiac spoke Quiripi, one of the Eastern Algonquian branches of the Algonquian language family.

By 1614, the Dutch had surveyed, charted, and established New Netherland, a colonial province, with claimed territories from the Delmarva Peninsula to Cape Cod. This included claims over the Quinnipiac territory. However, a lack of any significant Dutch presence in the area gave English settlers an opportunity to settle in the Quinnipiac territory. Dutch claims over land that included Menunkatuck (and would later include Guilford) remained until the 1674 Treaty of Westminster that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

In June 1637 during the Pequot War, a force of 100 English soldiers and Narragansett, Mohegan, and Montauk allies arrived from Long Island in pursuit of the Pequot grand sachem Sassacus near Menunkatuck. At a neck of land known today as Sachems Head, they captured and executed three Pequot sachems before continuing on west in pursuit of Sassacus.

In 1639, after landing in the plantation of Quinnipiaic (later known as New Haven) via ship from England, a group of 24 English Puritan families led by Rev. Henry Whitfield chose to settle almost 13 miles away near Menukatuck. During their voyage from England, the settlers drafted and signed the Plantation Covenant on June 1, 1639 (O.S.). The text of the covenant is memorialized by an engraved pink granite slab at the corner of Old Whitfield and Whitfield streets. On September 29, 1639 (O.S.), the colonists secured a land grant for their settlement from Shaumpishuh, the female sachem of Menunkatuck. 

Guilford was admitted to New Haven Colony in 1643. In 1664, New Haven Colony, including Guilford, joined Connecticut Colony. 

The English settlement originally shared the name Menunkatuck with the Quinnipiac village. On July 6, 1643 (O.S.), records of the General Court session held at New Haven note that Menunkatuck changed its name to “Guilforde,” although no reason for the change was recorded. It is assumed that Guilford was named after the town of Guildford, England, the native home of a share of its first English settlers. In early maps of the Connecticut Colony, the town is seen on several maps as &quot;Gilford.&quot;

Guilford is considered by some to have the third largest collection of historic homes in New England, with important buildings from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. There are five historic house museums, including Dudley Farm and the Henry Whitfield House (1639), the oldest dwelling house in Connecticut and the oldest stone house built by English settlers in North America. The Comfort Starr House (1695) is one of the oldest wooden framed private dwellings in Connecticut, and one of the few houses remaining of the original signers who settled Guilford.

In June 1781, during the American Revolution, a skirmish was fought on Leete&#x27;s Island between the Associated Loyalists and local militia under Captain Peter Vail.

<text>Hamden is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Land of the Sleeping Giant&quot;. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 61,169 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The peaceful tribe of Quinnipiacs were the first residents of the land that is now Hamden, they had great regard awe and veneration for the Blue Hills Sleeping Giant Mountain.

In spring 1638, Theophilus Eaton and the Reverend John Davenport purchased, from Quinnipiac Chief Momauguin, the land that would become the settlement of New Haven Colony. Later that November, Eaton expanded the settlement by acquiring 130 square miles from Mattabesset Chief Montowese. This tract extended the original settlement 10 miles north along the Quinnipiac River, with an additional 8 miles to the east and 5 mi. to the west. This piece of land included what would eventually become Hamden. The payment was made with &quot;11 coats of trucking cloth and a fine coat for the chief.&quot; 
It was settled by Puritans as part of the town of New Haven.

It remained a part of New Haven until 1786 when 1,400 local residents incorporated the area as a separate town, naming it after the English statesman John Hampden.

Largely developed as a nodal collection of village-like settlements (which remain distinct today), including Mount Carmel (home to Quinnipiac University), Whitneyville, Spring Glen, West Woods, and Highwood, Hamden has a long-standing industrial history. In 1798, four years after Eli Whitney began manufacturing the cotton gin in New Haven, he made arms for the U.S. government at a mill site in Hamden, where a waterfall provided a good source of power. At that site, Whitney introduced the modern era of mass production with the concept of interchangeable parts.

The major thoroughfare through Hamden is named Whitney Avenue in honor of Eli Whitney, and it runs past Whitney&#x27;s old factory, now the Eli Whitney Museum.
Whitney constructed stone houses for his employees in the nearby area, which is still referred to as Whitneyville; this is believed to be the first example of employer-provided homes in U.S. history. In 1806, the dam that Eli Whitney built at the mill site was enlarged to create a reservoir, Lake Whitney. The first truss bridge in the United States was erected nearby over the Mill River in Whitneyville in 1823, but has since been replaced.

The Farmington Canal, which ships traveled from New Haven northward, passed through Hamden between 1825 and 1848 until it was supplanted by railroad travel. The canal right-of-way has become, in recent years, a popular walking and bicycling trail, passing by some of the well-preserved locks of the canal, as well as some of Hamden&#x27;s oldest sites. Before its use as a walking and bicycling trail, many local residents rode their motocross bikes on the Farmington Canal.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hamden received a steady influx of immigrants, most notably from Italy and Ireland. To this day, a large part of Greater New Haven&#x27;s Italian-American community resides in Hamden.

During the post-war period, Hamden underwent significant suburban development. Much of the southern section of town is urbanized and is difficult to distinguish from neighboring New Haven. The northern section of town, however, retains a more rural character, and has the distinct neighborhood of Mount Carmel. This area of town is the location of the unique Sleeping Giant hill formation that is the source of the town&#x27;s nickname.
==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.62%, is water. The town features the Mill River, which runs from the northern part of town, is dammed to form Lake Whitney, and flows from there to Long Island Sound. The town also has the Quinnipiac River and Lake Wintergreen, as well as numerous small streams.

Across the street is Freedom Park, which contains a fountain with concrete stepping stones leading to a sign that pleads for peace in several different languages. The Town recently completed new facilities for the police and fire departments in the newly renovated Town Hall.

Hamden was host to the Ghost Parking Lot, a notable roadside public art installation located in front of the Hamden Plaza shopping center in Hamden&#x27;s commercial district on Dixwell Avenue. Erected in 1978, it consisted of 15 car hulks, specially treated and encased in asphalt. Although featured in over 100 art books, the attraction was torn down in 2003 due to the excessive cost of restoration and repair.

==History==
This early mill and farming community incorporated from Branford in 1831. The year prior, Maltby Fowler had opened a button-making shop. Its success along with the inventiveness of his six sons—who devised a range of machines to produce such things as screws, embossed silk, pins, and horseshoe nails—saw the rise of new manufactures along the town&#x27;s Farm River. By the early 1900s, North Branford&#x27;s abundant supply of trap rock, a material used for making roadways, made quarrying a growth industry. Today, the town&#x27;s manufacturing sector is concentrated in electronics and electronic components.

Much of the town&#x27;s acreage is dominated by Totoket Mountain, part of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound almost to the Vermont border. The north side of Saltonstall Mountain is also located in North Branford. Totoket Mountain contains Lake Gaillard, a reservoir, formed in 1926, managed by the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority (SCCRWA). The SCCRWA maintains a network of hiking trails on Totoket Mountain in the Big Gulph area of Northford. The SCCRWA is said to own one-third of the town&#x27;s area.

<text>Prospect is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. It is a suburb of the nearby city of Waterbury to its north, and is on the north-eastern fringes of the New York metropolitan area. The population was estimated to be 9,401 in 2020. Prospect is part of the Waterbury NECTA and of the historical New Haven County. Prospect is also a member of the regional health district Chesprocott, along with Cheshire and Wolcott.

Prospect was incorporated as a town in 1827 from the South Farms part of Waterbury and the West Rocks part of Cheshire. Prospect is an exurban town, with residents often traveling to other major cities and employment centers across the state.

==History==

It is believed that the Native Americans who lived in the area now known as Prospect first arrived to the area between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. Little is known of their time living here, with only a few arrowheads, stone tools, and utensils being found in the town. What is known is that the town rested near the border zone of the Quinnipiac and Tunxis peoples, and it was known that the area served as a hunting and fishing ground for both tribes. There is no known evidence for any indigenous permanent settlement within the town prior to white European settlers permanently occupying the town. The portion of the town that was located in Waterbury also briefly had an indigenous reservation of between 1731 and 1778. The reservation was located on today&#x27;s Bronson road, and did not have a large population, with a total of four inhabitants in 1774.

The first land record inside the town comes from a 1694 land record of John Moss, Jr., who owned to of land on &quot;ye Tenn Mile river alongside an irremovable hill.&quot; The land was then first surveyed in 1697, and divided into four tracts, starting from the Waterbury border, and advancing towards Cheshire in half-mile intervals. Several roads in the town today follow the tier lines as outlined in the original survey, and the old border between Wallingford and Waterbury is seen in the modern-day Straitsville road.

The first European settlers in what would become the town of Prospect arrived in 1712, building homes in the &quot;West Rocks&quot; near the then boundary line of Waterbury and Cheshire. In 1775, citizens petitioned both towns to establish their own church, which was denied. It was in 1778 that a separatist church was constructed, which gained the name Columbia church from its official title of &quot;Society of Columbia.&quot; In 1797, through an act of the Connecticut General Assembly, the Congregational Church was established, governed by the &quot;Columbia Company,&quot; earning the territory the name Columbia Parish until its incorporation as a municipality in 1827. The town was denied the name Columbia, owing to the already incorporated Columbia in Tolland County, and instead it was named Prospect. This name was chosen because of the view from the town green, which before the growth of the trees, one could observe Long Island Sound, the Connecticut River, and even Long Island on clear days.

The town&#x27;s economic history has long been dominated by agriculture, with agricultural production never being eclipsed by manufacturing or services until the onset of suburbanization in the 1950s. The town used to produce wood, charcoal, hay, ice, apples, cider, milk, butter, cheese, eggs, wool, flax, corn, rye, barley, and oats. For some time, the town did have a manufacturing base. From the onset of the Industrial Revolution, farmers saw manufacturing as a way to supplement their incomes. Manufacturing activities that required water power were often located at the edges of the town, where the steep drops allowed for a large amount of power to be obtained. This led to the highest concentration of industry in the town being located in the Rag Hollow area, near the border of Cheshire. This section of town had factories that made sewing needles, britannia and pewter ware, cutlery, buttons, button hooks, hardware, and wagon wheels. The town was also where the first parlor matches were made in the United States, with the factory of Ives &amp; Judd producing them. Other manufacturing was scattered around the town, often on the farms of those who owned the factories. These factories often moved locations. The town&#x27;s brief foray into manufacturing came to a close by the twentieth century, with operations halting and entrepreneurs leaving for Waterbury, Naugatuck, Cheshire, or even New York.

Given the town&#x27;s rural nature and sparse population, modern amenities developed slowly in the town. A telephone line was run through the town in 1898, connecting New Haven and Waterbury, but it was not until 1904 that a telephone was installed in the town. Electrification took place in 1929, when service was established along Route 69. At this time, the Grange hall, the Congregational church, and three street lights made up the initial electric customers. The town made use of dirt roads until the 1920s, where they were upgraded to gravel roads. Other than the two state highways, none of the roads in the towns were paved until 1968, when Asphalt concrete roads began to be installed across the town. The town had a post office from 1830 to 1902, when it was closed and covered by rural delivery until a post office was reopened in 1962. The town has no publicly available sewer service, and all extant hookups are privately funded. Since 2002, there has been limited availability of public water line connections on some roads, which is provided by Connecticut Water. Most town residents and businesses rely on septic systems for discharge, and wells for water. Regulation of these systems is managed by Chesprocott, the regional health authority.

Since the 1950s, the town has undergone a rapid period of suburbanization, as families fled the nearby city of Waterbury and other municipalities during the period of the national white flight. Between 1950 and 1969, 1,053 houses were built, which today makes up one third of Prospect&#x27;s town housing. Today, 88.4% of the houses in the town have been built since 1950. Single family homes make up 90% of the housing stock in the town. In 1955, the &quot;Black Friday Flood&quot; inundated Naugatuck and Waterbury with flood waters, and Prospect became the primary evacuation center. Those who lost their homes found refugee in Prospect&#x27;s Community School, where they received medical attention and temporary housing. This event helped to drive more residents to move to the town.

In 1977, Lorne J. Acquin murdered several members of his extended family. It was the largest mass murder in Connecticut history until the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Prospect is known locally as being &quot;The Best Small Town in Connecticut,&quot; with the phrase posted on the town&#x27;s trucks and website. The name originates from an early 1990s article in &quot;Connecticut&quot; Magazine which ranked Prospect as the worst small town in the entire state. The measurement was done based on its school system, economy, the cost of living, crime rate and cultural resources. In response to this, the town&#x27;s long-time mayor Robert Chatfield removed the magazine from the library, and declared Prospect &quot;The Best Small Town in Connecticut,&quot; and ordered it placed on town vehicles and bumper stickers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.58%, is water. Neighboring towns are Waterbury to the north, Cheshire to the east, Bethany to the south, and Naugatuck to the west.

The town is located among the far eastern hills of the Berkshires, and the hilly landscape dominates the town&#x27;s geography. The town is notable for rocky soil, deposited during the retreat of the glaciers around 11,000 years ago. Trees in the town are relatively new, they had all once been cleared for farming and pastures. Oaks are the most abundant tree in the town, although in the swamp areas, the Red Maple dominates. The town has several reservoirs either fully or partially inside its boundaries. Several small streams and brooks also originate in the town.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen classification, Prospect is &quot;Dfb&quot;, or a humid continental climate. The town has warm and humid summers with cold winters. Precipitation is spread throughout the year, with thunderstorms frequent during the summer months, and heavy snowfalls during the winter months. Due to Prospect&#x27;s elevation and location, temperatures are often colder, leading to snow in the town while lower towns to its east have rain. Like Connecticut, Prospect frequently experiences Nor&#x27;easters and Blizzards during the winter, which can bring heavy snowfall to the town.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 Census, there were 9,405 people, 3,357 households, and 2,616 families living in the town. The population density was . There were 3,094 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 95.3% White, 1.9% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 0.8% from other races, and 1.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.3% of the population.

Of the 3,357 households 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.3% were married couples living together, 7.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 28.4% of households were one person and 8.4% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.15.

The age distribution was 22.6% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 22.0% from 25 to 44, 32.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.2% 65 or older. The median age was 43.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.0 males.

The median household income was $93,631 and the median family income was $104,306. The per capita income for the town was $26,827. About 2.1% of families and 2.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.1% of those under age 18 and 3.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==

The present mayor is Robert Chatfield, known to town residents as &quot;Mayor Bob.&quot; First elected in 1977, Chatfield is the town&#x27;s second mayor and for many residents is the only mayor they&#x27;ve ever known. He is the sixth longest serving incumbent mayor in the United States, and the longest serving Mayor in Connecticut. As of 2020, Chatfield is serving in his 22nd term as the town&#x27;s chief executive.

Prospect operated under the Board of selectmen system of government until 1967, when it shifted to adopt a manager-council form of government. In 1975, the town adopted the mayor–council system of government. George Sabo, the incumbent chief administrative officer, won election as the town&#x27;s first mayor over his Republican opponent, Ronald Dreher. Sabo won 1,636 votes to Dreher&#x27;s 1,189. Chatfield, then a member of the town council, defeated Sabo in the 1977 election with 1,599 votes to Sabo&#x27;s 1,311. Chatfield has been re-elected to the office ever since. His longevity in office has led him to become the only mayor residents have ever known.

Prospect&#x27;s town council employs block voting in its elections. A total of nine members are elected every two years, and the town charter mandates that no political party have a majority larger than one seat. Since 1977, the town council has been controlled by the Republicans. Other elected officials include the Town Clerk, the Town Treasurer, the Tax Collector, members of the Board of Assessment Appeals, the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Zoning Board of Appeals, and seats to the Regional Board of Education.

The current town hall was built in 1961, and prior to that there was no dedicated building for the town&#x27;s government. Just prior to the construction of the town hall the government met in the back of Oliver&#x27;s Supermarket (now 
LaBonne&#x27;s Market). Prior to this, the town government met at the local tavern (which no longer exists) until 1841. From there, it regularly met in the basement of the Congregational Church. Other locations that they met were the Grange hall, Community School, and Center School. The town&#x27;s form of government remained mostly unchanged until the 1960s, when it underwent a rapid series of changes, first replacing the three selectmen system with just one First Selectman, then changing the position to Chief Administrative Officer, and finally in 1975 to Mayor. Prospect is the least populated town in Connecticut with a mayoral form of government.

==Education==

Since 1969, the town of Prospect and the town of Beacon Falls have jointly operated Regional School District 16, with the first full school year having been operated in 1970. Both towns did not have access to a High School of their own, pursuant to the original intent of school district consolidation in Connecticut for small towns, and sought to consolidate their Boards of Education and begin research on the establishment of a new High School for district members. A high school would not be built in Region 16 until a 1998 referendum in the region approved the construction of Woodland Regional High School in Beacon Falls, with it opening on September 4, 2001. The two towns almost dissolved the regional school district in the late 1970s over the composition of the Board of Education, poor funding, and a lower quality of education for students. The composition of the Board of Education was originally slated to be split evenly between the two towns, which was agreed upon prior to the referendum approving the merger. According to a March 1976 Supreme Court ruling which upheld an earlier decision, the principle of One man, one vote applied to the Boards of Education of regional school districts. At the time, Connecticut had 16 regional school districts, and 11 regional school districts were in conflict with this ruling, which affected 34 towns, including Prospect and Beacon Falls. Beacon Falls then attempted to dissolve the regional school district, which at the time only officially contained Long River Middle School, on the basis that the Supreme Court ruling now constituted a breach of contract between Beacon Falls and Prospect.

Prior to the construction of Woodland Regional High School, Prospect students attended High School at Wilby High School in Waterbury until 1983. After the contract with Waterbury concluded, Prospect high schoolers had the choice of attending Nonnewaug High School in Woodbury, Wolcott High School in Wolcott, Naugatuck High School in Naugatuck, Connecticut, Masuk High School in Monroe, Connecticut, Seymour High School in Seymour, Connecticut, Emmet O&#x27;Brien Technical High School in Ansonia, Connecticut as well as Kaynor Technical High School in Waterbury, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2015, total enrollment in Region 16&#x27;s school district has been declining, losing 192 students between 2015 and 2019. In early 2020, the Board of Education began to discuss a policy wherein non-resident students from other towns could attend school within the district, which would cost about $15,800 a student in tuition, but as of the February 22, 2020, no further action was taken on the measure.

Funding for Region 16, which today controls and operates four schools, is based on the number of students from each town attending the district. As of 2020, the operating budget for the district was $40.7 million, with the town of Prospect responsible for $20.5 million due to the town&#x27;s children making up 63.25% of the school district&#x27;s student population. The town, like Beacon Falls, funds its portion of the region&#x27;s budget through property taxes.

In 2011, voters approved a $47.5 million bonding package that would fund the construction of Prospect Elementary School, renovate Laurel Ledge Elementary School, and build a new office for Region 16 in Prospect on the former location of Algonquin School on Coer Road. The new Prospect Elementary School (grades K–5) replaced Algonquin School (grades K–3) and Community School (grades 4–5). Students in grades 6–8 in Prospect and Beacon Falls attend Long River Middle School, and students in grades 9–12 attend Woodland Regional High School.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Prospect is well connected to Connecticut&#x27;s wider transportation network. Route 69 and Route 68 intersect near the town centre, which provide town residents access to New Haven, Waterbury, and Union City. In close proximity to the Waterbury-Prospect line are entrances to I-84, and close to the Cheshire-Prospect border are entrances to I-691.

There are no bus routes within the town, but Bus Routes 431 and 428 of the Greater Waterbury Bus System have stops located just north of the Waterbury-Prospect on East Mountain off Route 69, and on Scott Road near the intersection with Austin Road.

<text>Seymour is a town located in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. The population was 16,748 at the 2020 census. Seymour is bordered by the towns of Oxford and Beacon Falls to the north, Bethany and Woodbridge to the east, Ansonia and Derby to the south, and Shelton to the west.

==History==
Seymour was incorporated as a town in May 1850, and was named for Governor Thomas H. Seymour.

The area that now encompasses the lands of the town was originally part of the town of Derby, which in turn was a part of Milford. The downtown portion of what is now Seymour was eventually called Humphreysville, named after Revolutionary War hero David Humphreys, aide-de-camp to General George Washington. Humphreys had purchased a factory in what is the downtown portion of the town, which produced scythes and other tools as well as wool products from the sheep he had imported.

In 1836, Humphreysville was incorporated as a borough within the town of Derby by the General Assembly. Upon the creation of the town of Seymour in 1850, the borough government was dis-incorporated.

==Emergency services==
The Town of Seymour, CT has its own police department, 2 fire companies, and an ambulance association.

The Police Chief is John Bucherati. The Police Department currently operates out of its headquarters located at 11 Franklin Street. The department was previously located at 4 Wakeley Street (located behind the Citizens&#x27; Engine Co. 2 building and is now the headquarters of the Seymour Ambulance Association).

The Chief of the Fire Department is Michael Lombardi who is assisted by three assistant chiefs. The department consists of two fire companies each led by one captain and two lieutenants. The Fire Marshal&#x27;s is located at the Town Hall and is staffed by two full-time employees, The Fire Marshal, Timothy Willis and Deputy Fire Marshal as well as several volunteer fire inspectors.

The Citizens&#x27; Engine Company No. 2 is located on DeForest Street with its primary response area being the downtown and east side of the town. Citizens&#x27; Engine was organized in August 1884 when the town purchased a Button steam powered fire engine. The original fire company, which was organized in 1882, was later disbanded and the present fire company was organized and named in honor of the town&#x27;s citizens (the company adopted the number 2 since it was the second fire company to exist in town). The current firehouse was erected in the 1880s and a few years later the hose / bell tower was struck by lightning, which severely damaged it; the tower was then dismantled and rebuilt. The current apparatus bay addition was erected in 1976. The Citizens&#x27; operate two engines, a heavy rescue, a tower-ladder and a utility truck.

The Great Hill Hose Company was organized in 1947 to help improve fire protection to Seymour&#x27;s rapidly growing Great Hill and Housatonic River area. Since the Citizens&#x27; Engine Company was located &quot;downtown&quot; it took quite some time for the firefighters and apparatus to reach the west side area. The company was first located on Great Hill Road near the old Grange building. Since the Great Hill area did not have the luxury of fire hydrants, the company utilized ponds and also tanker trucks that carried water. Since the 1950s the Great Hill area continued to grow with new homes and the present high school and middle school buildings. The Great Hill Hose Company operates two fire engines, a water tanker truck, a heavy rescue truck, a rescue boat and two utility vehicles.

Seymour Ambulance Association was organized in 1969 and incorporated as a non-profit entity in 1972. The command structure consists of one chief, one deputy chief, one assistant chief, one captain, one training coordinator, and two lieutenants. The current Chief is Bryan Ryan. The S.A.A. originally operated its ambulances from various locations and was quartered in the Citizens&#x27; firehouse using the easternmost portion of the building for several years. The organization is currently quartered at 4 Wakeley Street, the building formerly housing the Seymour Police Department.

<doc id="108805" wikidata="Q917350" url="?curid=108805" title="Southbury, Connecticut">
<text>Southbury is a town in western New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. It is north of Oxford and Newtown, and east of Brookfield. Its population was 19,879 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region.

Southbury comprises sprawling rural country areas, suburban neighborhoods, and historic districts. It is a short distance from major business and commercial centers. It is 67 miles (107 km) north of New York City, and 34 miles (54 km) south of Hartford.

Southbury is the only community in the country with the name &quot;Southbury&quot;, which is why the town seal reads &quot;Unica Unaque&quot;, meaning &quot;The One and Only.&quot;

==History==
The town of Southbury was one of several towns formed out of parcels of land purchased from the Pootatuck Native Americans. Southbury was originally part of Woodbury, which was settled in 1673. A meetinghouse for the Southbury Ecclesiastical Society was built in 1733, and in 1787 the town of Southbury was incorporated. After two decades within Litchfield County, Southbury was transferred to New Haven County in 1807.

In the 1800s, water power became essential to the growth of Southbury&#x27;s industries, which included mills, tanneries, and distilleries. The power for these industries came primarily from the Pomperaug River and the Housatonic River. As the industrial revolution progressed, many of these businesses left for Waterbury.

In the 1920s, Russian expatriates Count Ilya Tolstoy (son of the author Leo Tolstoy) and George Grebenstchikoff founded an artists&#x27; colony at one end of Main Street, known as &quot;Churaevka&quot; (or &quot;Russian Village&quot;). At its peak, Churaevka had a printing press used by Russian and Ukrainian scholars and novelists. Visitors to the colony included the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. Most of its immigrant population is now gone; however, St. Sergius Chapel, designed by Nicholas Roerich and built in 1932–1933, remains. Churaevka is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In November 1937, residents of the farming outpost got word that a man by the name of Wolfgang Jung had purchased in the town. Residents looking into his plans discovered that he was a member of the German American Bund, an organization of ethnic Germans living in the United States who supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Its leader, Fritz Kuhn, was considered the leading anti-Semite in the country. Word soon got out that they were, in fact, planning to build their largest training facility in the country. Residents objected by calling a town meeting and set up a zoning department with one simple rule, no military activity excluding the United States Army. The law was adopted December 14 and the Bund stopped work and eventually sold the land.

Southbury was a rural farming town for most of its history. However, with the development of the Interstate Highway System, that changed. With the opening of Interstate 84 through Southbury by 1963, the town gained easy access to New York and Hartford, also improving its access to Danbury and Waterbury. Heritage Village opened in 1967, on a site. In 1987, IBM built an extensive office and research building in Southbury, employing over 2,500 workers. Southbury transitioned from a primarily rural community into the varied town it is today, with the commercial downtown and residential neighborhoods sharing the town with farming communities and extended rural acreage. Today, Southbury has approximately 17% open space, with a goal of 20%.

In the early 1990s, Southbury was the subject of a lawsuit by the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation. The 100-member tribe sought to take the land of roughly 1,200 property holders in the town. The lawsuit was thrown out in 1993 based on the fact that the man who brought the suit was not a chieftain, contrary to his claims, and had no standing to bring the suit.

===Southbury Public Library===
The Southbury Public Library is a department of the town, with its own 9-member Board of Directors. On May 1, 2006, Southbury officially opened its new library (its 3rd, though no two have ever been in use concurrently) at 100 Poverty Road. This $6 million project was the first public building constructed in Southbury in 30 years. It is a , 2 floor, state-of-the-art facility. It contains around 90,000 books. It has computers, audiobooks, DVDs, recording rooms for recording books for the blind, meeting rooms, internet, a fireplace and a coffee bar. Selections recorded for the blind at the Southbury Public Library become part of the National Library Service catalog.

Planning for the library began in 1998, with an original projected bond issue of $7.35m. The planning committee solicited donations from the public, which resulted in two single donations of $100,000 or more, and five more of between $25,000 and $99,000, in addition to smaller donations.

The old library building, at 561 Main Street South, has been converted to hold offices for the Parks and Recreation Department, as well as a new senior center. The old library was built in 1969 and expanded in 1979.

The oldest library building was located in South Britain (a section and Historic District of Southbury) and was replaced in 1969. It was built in 1904 and contained approximately 1,000 volumes.

===Shepaug Dam and eagle observation area===

The Shepaug Dam on the Housatonic River is part of a hydroelectric power plant, operated by FirstLight Power Resources, capable of a peak power output of 42,600 kW. This dam is a popular nesting and feeding ground for wintering eagles and hawks, including bald eagles. Near the power station, FirstLight also operates an eagle observation area first opened by the utility&#x27;s predecessor, Northeast Utilities, in the mid-1980s. Access is free, and some telescopes are provided. Utility company employees and volunteers from the Connecticut Audubon Society and other groups are at the observation area to assist visitors. Advanced reservations are required. Eagles are attracted to the spot because the water churning through the dam&#x27;s hydroelectric turbine keeps the surface from icing over, allowing the birds to fish. Red-tailed hawks, goshawks, great blue herons and other waterfowl are also attracted to the spot. The dam flooded an area now known as Lake Lillinonah.

FirstLight Power Resources has submitted a plan to the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control to build a new peak-power plant next to the existing hydroelectric facility.

Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel only. Its original design and construction allowed for of office space, intended for 2,500 people (later increased as around-the-clock operations began). It also had of &quot;raised floor&quot; data center space, originally designed for large-scale water-cooled mainframe operations. It is an &quot;off the grid&quot; facility, with its power plant taking advantage of jet turbine technology to generate power for the entire site. In 2006, this power plant was replaced with a larger one as power demands increased. IBM Southbury was originally designed to be one of IBM&#x27;s new corporate headquarters buildings, as IBM&#x27;s &quot;North Castle&quot; facility in Armonk became outdated. It was never used for this purpose and has been primarily used as an IBM Global Services facility. There are four buildings, labeled A, B, C, and Central Services. Due to decreasing demand for office space, buildings A and C are currently shut down. It was announced in December 2023 that IBM would be closing the complex on January 26, 2024, with the jobs currently located there moving to other locations.

===Southbury Corporate Park===

Southbury Corporate Park is a largely theoretical site between I-84 exits 13 and 14. It is approved for roughly of zone R60-C compliant corporate offices. The town purchased the site for a total of $5 million. It is designed to attract large corporate partners, or at worst, non-&quot;big box&quot; retailers. An arts center has also been proposed for the site, though this proposal was later revoked in favor of a possible location inside the Southbury Training School.

<text>Wallingford is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, centrally located between New Haven and Hartford, and Boston and New York City. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region and the New York Metropolitan Area. The population was 44,396 at the 2020 census. The community was named after Wallingford, in England.

== History ==
Wallingford, Connecticut, is deeply woven into the fabric of early American history, from its founding to its connection with some of the most influential figures of the colonial era. Established on October 10, 1667, by the Connecticut General Assembly, Wallingford was founded by a group of 38 planters and freemen, including notable figures such as John Moss, Samuel Street, and Robert Wallace. These early settlers chose a strategic location near the Quinnipiac River, which is now the area known as Main Street. By May 12, 1670, the settlement had grown to include 126 residents living in temporary housing, and by 1675, 40 permanent homes had been constructed, signaling the town&#x27;s early growth and stability.

One of Wallingford’s early settlers was Thomas Yale, an influential figure in the New Haven Colony and an ancestor of Elihu Yale, the benefactor after whom Yale University is named. Thomas Yale was a signatory of the Wallingford plantation covenant in 1667, marking the formal establishment of the town.

Wallingford’s historical significance extends to its involvement in key moments of colonial America. In 1697, the town became the site of New England&#x27;s last witchcraft trial when Winifred Benham was accused of witchcraft. She was tried three times in Wallingford but was acquitted on each occasion, marking the end of the witch trials in the region. This event reflects the lingering fears and superstitions of the era, even as the fervor of the Salem witch trials had begun to fade.

The town also played a critical role in America’s fight for independence, with Lyman Hall being one of its most distinguished sons. Born in Wallingford in 1724, Lyman Hall went on to become a prominent physician and statesman who represented Georgia in the Continental Congress. Hall was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, underscoring Wallingford’s deep ties to the founding of the United States. His contributions to the Revolutionary cause exemplify the town’s commitment to the ideals of liberty and self-governance.

As Wallingford entered the 19th century, it began to transform from an agricultural community into an industrial hub. The arrival of the railroad in the 1840s, specifically the New Haven and Hartford Railroad (later part of the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad), further accelerated the town&#x27;s growth. The railroad connected Wallingford to larger markets in the Northeast, facilitating the transport of goods, including the town&#x27;s famous silver products, and spurring the development of new industries.

Wallingford became particularly renowned for its silver production, with companies like Hall, Elton &amp; Co., Simpson, Hall, Miller &amp; Co., and R. Wallace &amp; Sons gaining national prominence. One of the key figures in this industry was Samuel Simpson, a local industrialist and philanthropist who played a pivotal role in Wallingford’s rise as a center of silver manufacturing. Simpson, Hall, Miller &amp; Co., which he co-founded, became one of the leading producers of silverware in the country. Samuel Simpson’s contributions were instrumental in establishing Wallingford as a major hub for silver production. His company eventually became part of the International Silver Company, headquartered in the neighboring city of Meriden, which solidified the region&#x27;s status as a global center for silver manufacturing.

In the 19th century, Wallingford was also the birthplace of Moses Y. Beach, a prominent figure in American journalism. Born in 1800, Beach became the owner of the New York Sun and was known for pioneering the &quot;penny press,&quot; making newspapers affordable to the general public. He is also credited for being a leading founder of the Associated Press.

However, Wallingford was not immune to tragedy. On August 9, 1878, a devastating tornado struck the town, leaving a path of destruction and claiming the lives of at least 29, and possibly as many as 34, residents. This tornado remains the deadliest in Connecticut&#x27;s history, and the disaster left a lasting impact on the community.

The 20th century marked a period of suburbanization for Wallingford, as the town transitioned from an industrial hub to a residential community while retaining its economic diversity. The post-World War II era saw significant growth in Wallingford’s population, driven by the suburban boom that reshaped much of America. New housing developments sprang up, attracting families looking for a balance between the conveniences of city life and the charm of a smaller town.

Despite the suburbanization, Wallingford continued to attract businesses, maintaining a robust economic base. The town became a hub for various industries, including medical, healthcare, high-tech specialty manufacturing, and research and development. The development of several industrial parks—Barnes Industrial Park, Casimir Pulaski Industrial Park, Centract Park, and MedWay Industrial Park—helped attract a wide range of businesses, further diversifying Wallingford&#x27;s tax base. The establishment of an Interchange Zone at the intersection of Interstate 91 and Route 68 facilitated the growth of office parks, research centers, and hotels, cementing Wallingford&#x27;s role as a key economic center in the region.

One of the most significant industrial presences in Wallingford during the late 20th and early 21st centuries was the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. The pharmaceutical giant established a research and development facility in Wallingford&#x27;s MedWay Industrial Park, becoming the town&#x27;s largest taxpayer and a key contributor to its economy. However, in 2017, Bristol-Myers Squibb relocated its operations, and the facility was subsequently demolished in 2018.

<doc id="108808" wikidata="Q2305757" url="?curid=108808" title="Wolcott, Connecticut">
<text>Wolcott ( ) is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region. It is primarily residential, with a population of 16,142 as of the 2020 United States census.

The town was settled in the 1730s by English settlers of the Connecticut Colony and was known as Farmingbury. It was renamed as Wolcott after being incorporated in 1796, following the United States&#x27; gaining independence. Some early records spell it as Wolcutt.

==History==

The early towns of Waterbury and Farmington occupied a great deal of west-central Connecticut in the Naugatuck River Valley and Farmington River Valley at the end of the 17th century. At that time, the borderlands between these two towns were known as Farmingbury, a term derived from the two town names.

People were living within the Farmingbury territory as early as the 1730s, but they possessed no official identity apart from the parent towns of either Waterbury or Farmington. By 1770, the residents of Farmingbury successfully petitioned the Connecticut General Assembly to create the First Ecclesiastical Society of Farmingbury. Having established an independent parish, Farmingbury gained some religious, legal, and financial independence from Waterbury and Farmington. However, the political boundaries of the region remained unchanged for more than two decades afterward. During that time, the Farmingbury parish was largely self-sufficient, as it was in a fairly remote location. It was still officially considered to be part of the towns of Waterbury in the west and Farmington in the east. Thus, the parish society had to deal with several matters that would ordinarily have been municipal duties, such as managing taxes and local education.

Farmingbury petitioned the Connecticut General Assembly in 1796, requesting that it be incorporated as an independent town, distinct from Waterbury and Farmington. Assembly votes were tied, with half in favor and half against the proposal. After the tie-breaking vote in favor of Farmingbury was cast by Lieutenant Governor Oliver Wolcott, the lands of Farmingbury were officially ceded by Waterbury and Farmington to the new town. In honor of the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s deciding vote, the residents of Farmingbury renamed their newly incorporated town as &quot;Wolcott&quot;. The 1800 United States census was the first census conducted after Wolcott&#x27;s incorporation; it counted 948 individuals living within the town.

===1962 tornado===
On May 24, 1962, the town was heavily damaged by a high-end F3 tornado. Numerous buildings, homes, businesses, and vehicles were damaged or destroyed, trees were blown down, and a refrigeration truck was thrown into a utility pole, cutting power to the area. Overall, the storm left one dead and 50 injured.

Although there are no natural lakes of significant size in Wolcott, several man-made reservoirs have been created from the damming of small rivers and brooks. Scovill Reservoir, also known as Woodtick Reservoir, covers and was built by damming the Mad River in central Wolcott. Originally constructed in 1917 to supply water for the Scovill Manufacturing Company, a brass manufacturing mill, it is now a town-owned recreational lake. Other reservoirs that are at least partially contained within Wolcott include Chestnut Hill Reservoir, Hitchcock Lake, Southington Reservoir #2, New Britain Reservoir (which extends east into neighboring Southington, Connecticut) and Cedar Lake and Dunham Mill Pond (both of which extend north into neighboring Bristol, Connecticut).

<doc id="108809" wikidata="Q1898540" url="?curid=108809" title="Woodbridge, Connecticut">
<text>Woodbridge is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 9,087 at the 2020 census. The town center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Woodbridge Green Historic District. Woodbridge is part of the Amity Regional School District #5, rated the #1 school district in New Haven County and the 10th best school district in Connecticut by Niche in 2021. As of 2019, Woodbridge had the seventh highest median household income in Connecticut.

== History ==

Woodbridge was originally called &quot;Amity&quot;, having been carved out of land originally belonging to New Haven and Milford as an independent parish in 1739. In 1742, the Rev. Benjamin Woodbridge was ordained in Amity, and it is after him that the modern town was named. Woodbridge was incorporated in 1784.

In 1661, the town was the location of one of the hideouts of the &quot;Regicides&quot;—three of the judges who signed the death warrant for King Charles I of England. The ruins of their hideout can be found on the nearby West Rock ridge, which runs along the town&#x27;s eastern border.

Thomas Darling (1720–1789), a tutor at Yale College and later an entrepreneur in New Haven, moved to town in 1774. His home is now the Darling House Museum, operated by the Amity &amp; Woodbridge Historical Society. The original farms of Woodbridge were located in the area of the West River Valley known as The Flats.
In the modern era, Woodbridge has undergone significant suburbanization.

Following the onset of the 2020 George Floyd protests, Woodbridge and other affluent towns in Connecticut have faced criticism from certain civic organizations alleging the practice of exclusionary zoning. In early 2021, local housing advocacy group Open Communities Alliance called upon Woodbridge to amend its zoning codes to allow for more housing developments, and enable more low-income and minority residents to live in the town. The group cited that just 0.2% of Woodbridge’s land area permits two-family dwellings. In response to efforts by the group, Woodbridge&#x27;s Town Plan and Zoning Commission approved a revision in June 2021 to the town&#x27;s zoning rules to allow for multi-family homes and ADUs on 2% of the town&#x27;s land. The Open Communities Alliance voiced disappointment regarding the scale of the change, and filed a lawsuit alleging Woodbridge was in violation of Connecticut&#x27;s Zoning Enabling Act and Fair Housing Act in August 2022 in a case which has attracted statewide attention.

==Government and politics==
Woodbridge is governed by a 6-member Board of Selectmen.

Woodbridge&#x27;s current First Selectman is Mica Cardozo, whose term expires in December 2025. This is Cardozo&#x27;s first term as First Selectman. Cardozo served two terms as Deputy Selectman to former First Selectwoman Beth Heller and was appointed as Ordinance Chairman.

Cardozo was preceded as First Selectman by Democrat Beth Heller, who served in the position for three terms between 2017 and 2023. She also served briefly in the position following the death of Ed Sheehy, stepping up from her position as his deputy first selectman.

The town&#x27;s previous First Selectwoman was Democrat Ellen Scalettar, who was first elected in 2013, and was re-elected in 2015. Scalettar did not seek a third term in 2017.

Prior to Scalettar, Democrat Ed Sheehy served as the town&#x27;s First Selectman. He became First Selectman in April 2006. Sheehy served on the Board of Selectmen for 27 years as a regular selectman. The Board of Selectmen elected Sheehy First Selectman by a 3 to 2 vote, along party lines, to replace Amey Marella (Republican), who stepped down to accept a job as Deputy Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. Before becoming First Selectwoman in 2001, Marella was an attorney with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Edward Sheehy was reelected in May 2009 to another two-year term. On April 22, 2013, Sheehy died suddenly at the age of 73 while still holding the First Selectman&#x27;s office. He was actively seeking re-election in May. He was laid to rest on April 27, 2013.

<doc id="108810" wikidata="Q2572260" url="?curid=108810" title="Bozrah, Connecticut">
<text>Bozrah is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 2,429 at the 2020 census. Bozrah contains three villages: Fitchville, the town center; Leffingwell, a crossroads on Route 82; and Gilman, a mill village along Fitchville Road.

==History==
The area that became Bozrah was first settled as part of the original &quot;nine-miles-square&quot; of Norwich as well as part of the Parish of West Farms. The area became its own parish, called &quot;New Concord&quot; or the &quot;Fourth Society of Norwich&quot;, in 1737, and was incorporated as the town of Bozrah in 1786.

==A legend about the origin of the town&#x27;s name==
Bozrah is the name of a pastoral community mentioned several times in the Old Testament, sometimes with pleasing connotations, sometimes not. The town name may have resulted from the happy connotations connected with Micah chapter 2, verse 12: &quot;I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold; they shall make a great noise by reason of the multitude of men.&quot; In Hebrew, the name Bozrah signifies &quot;an enclosure&quot;.

According to a persistent legend, the name &quot;Bozrah&quot; was derived from another Biblical text, which came to someone&#x27;s mind under the particular circumstances surrounding the community&#x27;s petition to the Connecticut General Assembly for township status. Whether or not the story is true, the informal, early name &quot;New Concord&quot; was dropped when the town was incorporated.

The community, according to the legend, really wanted to call itself &quot;Bath&quot; after the famous spa in England. The local man chosen to carry the parish&#x27;s request to Hartford had a somewhat eccentric manner of dress, however, and when he appeared before the Legislature he was dressed in loud, parti-colored homespun so odd as to bring to the mind of one amused legislator the query of Isaiah 63:1: &quot;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?&quot; Overcome by the humorous appropriateness of this verse, the Assembly decided to name the town &quot;Bozrah&quot; when it incorporated the place.

==Points of interest==
*Bozrah Congregational Church and Parsonage, at 17 and 23 Bozrah St., was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 26, 1991.
*Hopemead State Park, an undeveloped 60-acre recreation area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.38%, is water. The town is bordered by the city of Norwich to the east and by the town of Montville to the south, Salem to the southwest, Colchester to the west, Lebanon to the northwest, and Franklin to the north. Gardner Lake, a popular recreational destination, occupies the southwestern corner of the town and extends into Salem and Montville.

<doc id="108812" wikidata="Q1107717" url="?curid=108812" title="Colchester, Connecticut">
<text>Colchester is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 15,555 at the 2020 census. In 2010 Colchester became the first town in Connecticut, and the 36th in the country, to be certified with the National Wildlife Federation as a Community Wildlife Habitat.

The villages of Westchester and North Westchester are located within Colchester. The town center village, which was previously incorporated as a borough, is a census-designated place, with a population of 4,700 at the 2020 census.

The Colchester area was part of the Mohegan territory at the time of European settlement. Several members of the Paugussett tribe currently reside in Colchester, where the tribe (which also has a heritage property in Trumbull) has a larger and more recently acquired reservation.

The Colchester Historical Society operates a local history museum.

==History==

=== Pre-Township and Becoming a Township ===
On March 31, 1661, the original settlement of Colchester was founded by Jeremy Adams on a 340-acre area of land, then known as &quot;Jeremiah&#x27;s Farme.&quot; The land was given to Jeremy by Uncas, Sachem of the Mohegan tribe.

When Connecticut&#x27;s first counties were created in 1666, Colchester stayed under Adams&#x27; ownership and was not incorporated into any new county, possibly because of its proximity to both Hartford and New London County. It would not formally join a county until 1698. At this time, Colchester was mainly a farming community. In 2009, Colchester adopted a right-to-farm ordinance, recognizing the &quot;significant role&quot; that agriculture played in Colchester&#x27;s &quot;heritage and future.&quot; 

On October 13, 1698, Michael Taintor II, Samuel Northam and Nathaniel Foote III applied to officially settle Colchester. Jeremiah&#x27;s Farme was selected as the main point of reference for the town, with its north boundary as the Twenty Mile River. The southern side is bordered by Lyme, and the west boundary meets the east bounds of Middletown and Haddam. The east and northeast boundary runs to the bounds of Lebanon and Norwich. During the initial settlement, the area was also referred to as the Plantation of the Twenty-mile River.

On May 11, 1699, the town&#x27;s principal founders asked the general court of Hartford for assistance, alleging that several persons had hindered the advancement of the settlement by claiming ownership of &quot;considerable tracts of land&quot; within the grant. They also asked to be transferred under the jurisdiction of the New London colony and for the town to be recognized as Colchester. On May 11, 1699, the court approved their request, officially establishing Colchester as a town of New London. The town is said to be named after Colchester, a borough and port in Essex, England, where many colonists had emigrated from and from which Foote&#x27;s grandfather, Nathaniel Foote, was born.

=== The 1700s ===
Nathaniel Foote and his family were some of the first to settle here and finished building their house in 1702. The house began construction in 1699 by Nathaniel Foote III and was then finished by his son Nathaniel Foote IV. On November 29, 1703, a saw and grist mill were voted to be built by Israel and Samual Wyatt if they promised to maintain the mill for the town&#x27;s use. The first schoolmaster began operations in 1705, and a schoolhouse was finished in 1711. In 1707 or earlier, a cemetery was built behind where Bacon Academy would later be built. The cemetery later held people like Reverend John Bulkeley, Dr. John Watrous, Pierpont Bacon, and his wife, Abigail Bacon. In 1708 Colchester re-joined Hartford county, and a second religious meeting house was built. On December 31, 1712, at a legal town meeting held in Colchester, Capt Gilbert Wyatt and Mr. Darnell Clark were Chosen, Selectmen. On December 28, 1713, Samuel Northam, Thomas Day, and Ebenezer Colman were chosen for a school committee ensuing year.

At a town meeting on June 12, 1716, it was voted to finish the schoolhouse where the foundation of the said house was the only partly standing. The selectmen Committee for the school has agreed with Nathaniel Loomis Jr. (He and his family are from Windsor) to keep school for twelve months and give him twenty-five pounds and ten shillings. He began to keep building the school. On December 8, 1729, Ensign Foote, Ensign Wells, and Israel Newton were chosen as Selectmen. The constables were selected at the same meeting, being Joseph Chamberlain and Isaac Jones. On June 3, 1774, Stephen Goodwin wrote to the Hartford Courant that he had a runaway slave. The slave was named Jefferey and rode away on horseback. A reward was said to be given out if said horse or Jefferey was found (6 dollars for Jeffery and 4 for the horse).

In 1756 Colchester&#x27;s population was 2,300 people. In 1761 Michael Taintor built Taintors Farm, which stayed in the family until the early 20th century. The Nathaniel Hayward house was built in 1775 for Dudley Wright; The house was lived in by Dr. John Watrous and his wife (who was Dudley Wright&#x27;s daughter). The house was later sold in 1848 and lived in by Nathaniel Hayward. The lawn of this house was the original town green. In 1777 Breed&#x27;s Tavern was built, which is most known for being one of the two remaining sites associated with the Wooster Masonic Lodge. In 1782 Colchester had 3,300 inhabitants. Several men went into the revolutionary war, many of them died. One of which was Ephraim Little Jr., son of the 2nd Reverend of Colchester. In 1783 Colchester rejoined New London County after being within Hartford County. On Thursday, January 29, 1784, Congress suggested a tax, and the representatives of Colchester (Capt. Buckley and Col. Worthington) voted not to have it go into effect. In 1785 the Foote Family house was built by Nathaniel Foote and was lived in by his family. The Henry Champion House was built in 1790 by architect William Sprat. for Colonel Henry Champion who was active in the revolution and a military figure.

Starting in the mid-1700s, Colchester was a hub for the making bed rugs, heavy embroidered bed covers that were both decorative and served to keep New Englanders warm in the cold winters. Colchester bed rugs are important for their strong designs and complex embroidery. Several women from the Foote family, including Mary Foote, Abigail Foote, and Jerusha Foote Johnson, all have bed rugs attributed to them.

=== The 1800s ===
On October 13, 1803, the town of Marlborough, Hartford County was created from parts of the towns of Colchester, Glastonbury, Hartford County, and Hebron, Tolland County. In the 1807 election for governor of Connecticut, Colchester voted 105 for Trumbull and 12 for Hart, a majority for Trumbull. On May 27, 1807, heavy cattle losses were reported because of stray dogs biting them. The following year (1808), Colchester voted for Trumbull’s re-election (135 to 24). In 1810 Colchester voted for the governor, 82 for Treadwell, 61 for Griswold, and 16 for Spalding. On March 6, 1821, John Turner sold the southern green to Bacon Academy Trustees for $100 ($2,800 in 2018). A hatter came in 1828. In 1836, a town description was written in &quot;Connecticut Historical Collections&quot; stating that excellent quality iron ore was found. Colchester was hilly and stony in some parts of town. Hebron’s furnaces later used the ore in 1899. In &quot;Connecticut Historical Collections&quot; the school for colored children is mentioned; considering this book was released in 1836, the school could not have been more than 43 years old. Unbeknownst to John Barber (the writer of this book), he got to see it only four years before its ending. On August 8, 1844, Special Park Committee meeting reported costs to acquire acres of land plus costs of posts and rails to line the perimeter for $398 (about $13,000).  

In March 1850, The borough petitioned for a special meeting for land donation by Nathaniel Hayward. His proposal was a donation of land if the borough laid a tax of $1,000 to defray expenses of fences and grading land (about $32,000). The proposal was approved. In 1851 Work was completed for the new Town Park. The borough passes ordinances to ban cows from the park. Borough records showed the town immediately designated the park as a source of income. This included land rental for circus, shows, and sales of grasses and hay.

==== Colchester Bank ====
The first known mention of the bank, was on June 19, 1856, when the Senate agreed to pass a bill incorporating the bank. On October 11, 1856, the bank&#x27;s stockholders met and decided on a board of directors. They are as follows, Albert B. Isham, Stephen Brainard Day (Isaac&#x27;s Buell&#x27;s brother), William G. Buell, and Samuel F. Jones Jr. (who would later be the main accomplice in the Colchester bank scandal). In the same meeting, Isaac Biglow Buell (the cousin of Harvey Post Buell, a successful druggist, and pharmacist in Colchester) was chosen as president. The bank reportedly began the same day.

=== The 1900s ===

==== The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 ====
On September 21 and 22, 1938, Colchester was slammed by a hurricane. The state of Connecticut was inundated with between 5-10 inches of rain and wind gusts of anywhere from 100–125 miles per hour. Reportedly, the Colchester Town Green resembled a &quot;small lake with cascading streams&quot;

At the time, the town had a number of Dutch Elm trees that were planted in 1850. While the root systems of Dutch elms are extensive, they are also quite shallow. As the hurricane hit on September 21, the shallow root systems were ineffective at keeping the trees rooted in the already saturated ground. These trees fell on many buildings, vehicles, and power lines across town. This blocked roads and left many people without homes.

=== The 2000s ===
In July 2005, Colchester was named by CNN&#x27;s Money Magazine, the 57th best place in the U.S. to live in and is celebrated every year with a festival on the last Saturday of September called 57 Fest.

==Geography==

== Activities ==
The Salmon River State Forest provides opportunities for fishing, hiking, and hunting.

=== Landmarks ===
Formerly an incorporated borough, the town center of Colchester is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, known as the Colchester Village Historic District. The walkable center includes a town green with a veterans&#x27; memorial. Retail stores and restaurants are located here.

<text>East Lyme is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 18,693 at the 2020 census. The villages of Niantic and Flanders are located in the town.

==Geography==
East Lyme is located in southern New London County, west of Waterford and Montville, east of Lyme and Old Lyme, and south of Salem. Long Island Sound is to the south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 19%, is water.

===Villages===
The town consists primarily of two villages, Flanders and Niantic. It is common for the town of East Lyme to be erroneously called &quot;Niantic&quot;, due to this side of town being the &quot;beach&quot; side which is popular with tourists and visitors in the summer months. Niantic&#x27;s population doubles in the summer months for the beach season, and it has a much higher density than the more sparsely populated Flanders side of town, which is known for its apple orchards, the town&#x27;s high school, and the forest.

====Niantic====
The village of Niantic gets its name from the Niantic or Nehantic people, whose ranging grounds once extended from Wecapaug Brook, in what is now Rhode Island, to the Connecticut River. Shortly before the first settlers arrived, the Pequots had invaded Nehantic territory and annexed about half of the land claimed by the tribe. According to local historian Olive Tubbs Chendali:
It was the construction of the railroad in 1851 that lured people to the shoreline which up to this time had been known - not as Niantic - but as &quot;The Bank&quot;. Long before this time, however, as evidenced by &quot;The Diary of Joshua Hempstead - 1711 - 1758&quot; it was known as &quot;Nahantick&quot; &quot;Nyantick&quot; or &quot;Nehantic&quot;, the home territory of the Nehantic Indians.

Sportfishing and marinas dominate the village&#x27;s industry along with summer tourism and restaurant trade. Strong regional businesses include seafood restaurants and hotels/motels serving the town&#x27;s beaches and the casinos at Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. Rocky Neck State Park features camping, swimming and picnic areas along with numerous marinas and sportfishing companies.

The Niantic Bay Boardwalk is a one-mile (1.6 km) long walkway that runs parallel to Amtrak’s shoreline railroad tracks and spans Niantic Bay from the Niantic River inlet to Hole-in-the-Wall municipal beach. It first opened to the public in 2005, but was closed from about 2011 due to a combination of Amtrak building a new railroad bridge across the Niantic River, which required a re-positioning of the approach tracks, and damage caused by Hurricane Irene in October 2011. The boardwalk fully re-opened to the public in March 2016.

The Children&#x27;s Museum of Southeastern Connecticut is located in East Lyme&#x27;s original public library on Main Street. The museum is aimed primarily at children ages infant to ten years old. The current public library is located on Society Road, away from Niantic.

The village of Niantic includes the beach communities of Attawan Beach, Black Point, Crescent Beach, Giants Neck Beach, Giants Neck Heights, Oak Grove Beach, Old Black Point, Pine Grove, and Saunder&#x27;s Point.

East Lyme and Niantic station was an Amtrak station that closed in 1981. There are currently proposals to rebuild the station to accommodate Shore Line East trains.

====Flanders====
The village of Flanders, originally a farming area along the Old Post Road, gets its name from the development of woolen mills similar to that in Flanders, Belgium. The heart of the village is located at Flanders Four Corners at the intersection of Chesterfield Road (Route 161) and Boston Post Road (Route 1). This area is the site of many small stores and businesses, as well as East Lyme High School, Flanders Elementary School, and the Board of Education.

Flanders was the original center of East Lyme society with dozens of 18th century homes, shops and public inns situated along the Boston Post Road until the early 1800s. It lost its pre-eminence as Niantic began to flourish, first with the growth of commercial fishing and then with the construction of the Shore Line Railway. Many of the original Flanders homes have been lost as a result of the construction of Interstate 95 in the 1950s and subsequent commercial construction at the Four Corners area. For example, the old Caulkins Tavern stood at the site of the current CVS and was a well-traveled and documented stopping place in the 18th century from none other than Sarah Kemble Knight in her diary, as well as General George Washington, who stopped here with thousands of troops in 1776. Some homes remain closer to the Waterford line at the site of the old Beckwith Shipyard at the head of the Niantic River.

====Other minor communities====
Golden Spur is a community located at the head of the Niantic River, which earned it its other name, &quot;Head of the River&quot;. In the eighteenth century it was the site of the Beckwith shipyard. By the turn of the 20th century it was the site of an amusement park accessible by trolley run by the East Lyme Street Railway. The park operated until 1924.

===Topography===
The topography of East Lyme consists of rolling hills and lush valleys rounded by glaciers during the last Ice Age. Hills rise to elevations of above sea level in the eastern and central areas of the town. The highest point in town is an unnamed hill with an elevation of located in Nehantic State Forest in the northwest corner of the town. East Lyme is especially scenic in the summer when the trees are in bloom. On its east and southern sides, the town abuts tidewater. The tidal Niantic River on the east feeds Niantic Bay, an arm of Long Island Sound, which forms the southern edge of the town.

The last kiva is a world language kiva where students can study French or Spanish.

==History==
The Thomas Lee House, built , is the oldest house in Connecticut that is still in its primitive state. This building is located in the southwestern section of East Lyme, adjacent to Rocky Neck State Park, at the intersection of Connecticut Route 156 and Giants Neck Road. Co-located on this site is the one-room Little Boston Schoolhouse, which was relocated to its current location from across Route 156. The town features six homes from 1699 or earlier, and the Old Stone Church Burial Ground from 1719 located off Society and Riverview roads.

The area occupied by the town was originally inhabited by the Nehantic people, who maintained villages in the present-day Indian Woods section as well as on Black Point, in the McCook&#x27;s Beach area and near the Niantic River. The tribe allied itself with the colonists in the 1636 war against the Pequot people. The Nehantic were reported to have died out in the mid-19th century, but there still exist a Nehantic community today. The 1750s Ezra Stiles map shows the Nehantic village in what is now Indian Woods as consisting of &quot;12 or 13 huts&quot;.

East Lyme, then a part of Lyme, had several taverns which offered stopping places for travelers such as Sarah Kemble Knight. These included Calkins Tavern on what is now Boston Post Road, Royce&#x27;s Tavern, and Taber Tavern near present-day I-95. At least 45 Revolutionary War veterans are buried within the borders of East Lyme, and countless more veterans from East Lyme found resting places in upstate New York, New Hampshire and Ohio. Moses Warren, along with General Samuel Holden Parsons originally of Lyme and Moses Cleaveland, set out to survey the Ohio Territory in the latter part of the 1790s and has Warren County, Ohio named after him.

<text>Franklin is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 1,863 at the 2020 census. The town includes the village of North Franklin.

==History==
 Europeans first settled in what would become Franklin in 1663 as part of the larger division of the town of Norwich. The residents of what would become Franklin first petitioned for an ecclesiastical society in 1710, but were denied. Six years later, their petition was granted and they formed the second ecclesiastical society of Norwich, also called the West Farms . 

During the First Great Awakening the society was shaken by controversy, partly over the location of the meetinghouse, but mostly fueled by conflict between the Old and New Lights in the society. The minister, Henry Willes, retired in 1749 as a result and in 1758 permission was granted to the eastern portion of the society to be formed as the Eighth, or Pautipaug, society of Norwich. The boundaries between the two societies would not be set until 1761. 

The West Farms and Pautipaug societies were incorporated together as the Town of Franklin in 1786. The town is named after Benjamin Franklin. 

Until 1861 the town&#x27;s borders extended east to the Shetucket River and included the early village of Baltic. That year, the town of Sprague, was incorporated from the towns of Franklin and Lisbon, which gave Franklin its present boundaries.

<doc id="108817" wikidata="Q755636" url="?curid=108817" title="Groton Long Point">
<text>Groton Long Point (GLP) is located within the town of Groton, on Fishers Island Sound, in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The year-round population was 518 at the 2010 census.

The area is administered by the Groton Long Point Association (GLPA), a private association that was established by Special Act of the Connecticut Legislature in 1921. The act is the charter of the GLPA and enables the Association to tax and issue bonds to provide services independent of the town of Groton; typically, such municipal corporations provided services that the larger township could not or would not provide. Pursuant to the act, the GLPA has the same governmental powers as a borough. Today, such a special taxing district can be formed by Connecticut residents on their own without special acts of the Legislature. The area is treated by the U.S. Census Bureau as a borough, although it is not formally incorporated as such.

==Summer life==

Summer in Groton Long Point runs roughly from mid-June to early September. The population is dramatically larger in the summer, as nearly every property is occupied by its owners or by summer tenants; the number of people also increases on summer weekends compared to summer weekdays. The Groton Long Point Yacht Club is a cross between a traditional yacht club and a summer camp, as it runs many classes for children. These include swimming, sailing, sports, and tennis lessons. The Yacht Club also organizes evening events such as dances, movies, and scavenger hunts for children; events are also organized for adults and families, including concerts at nearby Esker Point, dances, and fireworks.

==Winter life==
Being a summer community, Groton Long Point experiences something of an exodus in early September, as many of the summer families and the renters exit, leaving only a small number of full-time residents in the fall, winter, and spring months. Children remaining attend Groton public schools, including nearby Fitch Senior High School.

==Groton Long Point Police Department and Volunteer Fire Department==

The Point is protected year-round by the Groton Long Point Police Department, with a chief and officers certified by the State of Connecticut Police Officer Standards and Training Council. Groton Long Point also has a Volunteer Fire Department, established in 1951. The mission of the Fire Department is &quot;the preservation of lives and property, the extinguishment of fires, the provision of emergency medical services and social assembly&quot;. The Fire Department hosts the 4th of July parade each year.
