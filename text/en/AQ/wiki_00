<text>Theodore Bevry Olson (September 11, 1940 – November 13, 2024) was an American lawyer who served as the 42nd solicitor general of the United States from 2001 to 2004 in the administration of President George W. Bush. He previously served as the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice from 1981 to 1984 under President Ronald Reagan, and he was also a longtime partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn.

==Early life and education==
Olson was born on September 11, 1940, in Chicago, the son of Yvonne Lucy (&quot;née&quot; Bevry) and Lester W. Olson. He grew up in Mountain View, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. After graduating from Los Altos High School in 1958, he studied communications and history at the University of the Pacific, where he was a charter member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity chapter. He graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;cum laude&quot;. He then attended the UC Berkeley School of Law, where he was a member of the &quot;California Law Review&quot; and campaigned for Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president in 1964. He graduated in 1965 with Order of the Coif membership.

== Legal career ==

===Early legal career: 1965 to 2000===
In 1965, Olson joined the Los Angeles office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher as an associate. In 1972, he was named a partner. From 1981 to 1984, Olson served as an Assistant Attorney General (Office of Legal Counsel) in the Ronald Reagan administration. While serving in the Reagan administration, Olson was Legal Counsel to President Reagan during the Iran-Contra Affair&#x27;s investigation phase. Olson was also the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel when then-President Ronald Reagan ordered the Administrator of the EPA to withhold documents on the ground that they contained &quot;enforcement sensitive information.&quot; 

This led to an investigation by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee that later produced a report suggesting Olson had given false and misleading testimony before a House subcommittee during the investigation. The Judiciary Committee forwarded a copy of the report to the Attorney General, requesting the appointment of an independent counsel investigation. Olson argued that the Independent Counsel took executive powers away from the office of the President of the United States and created a hybrid &quot;fourth branch&quot; of government that was ultimately answerable to no one. He argued that the broad powers of the Independent Counsel could be easily abused or corrupted by partisanship. In the United States Supreme Court Case &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;, the Court disagreed with Olson and found in favor of the Plaintiff and independent counsel Alexia Morrison.

Olson returned to private law practice as a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of his firm, Gibson Dunn. A high-profile client of his in the 1980s was Jonathan Pollard, who had been convicted of selling government secrets to Israel. Olson handled the appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Olson argued the life sentence Pollard received was in violation of the plea bargain agreement, which had specifically excluded a life sentence. Olson also argued that the violation of the plea bargain was grounds for a mistrial. The Court of Appeals ruled (2‑1) that no grounds for mistrial existed. Olson argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court prior to becoming Solicitor General. In one case, he argued against federal sentencing guidelines, and, in a case in New York state he defended a member of the press who had first leaked the Anita Hill story.

Olson successfully represented presidential candidate George W. Bush in the Supreme Court case &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, which effectively ended the recount of the contested 2000 U.S. presidential election. On December 11, 2000, Olson personally delivered the oral arguments before the Supreme Court on behalf of Bush.

===Later legal career: After 2001===
Olson was nominated for the office of Solicitor General by President Bush on February 14, 2001. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 24, 2001, and took office on June 11, 2001. In 2002, Olson argued for the federal government in the Supreme Court case &quot;Christopher v. Harbury&quot; (536 U.S. 403), in which Supreme Court agreed with Olson&#x27;s position in its unanimous opinion written by Justice Souter. Olson maintained that the government had an inherent right to lie: &quot;There are lots of different situations where the government quite legitimately may have reasons to give false information out.&quot;

In July 2004, Olson retired as Solicitor General and returned to private practice at the Washington office of Gibson Dunn. In 2006, Olson represented a defendant journalist in the civil case filed by Wen Ho Lee and pursued the appeal to the Supreme Court. Lee sued the federal government to discover which public officials had named him as a suspect to journalists before he had been charged. Olson wrote a brief on behalf of one of the journalists involved in the case, saying that journalists should not have to identify confidential sources, even if subpoenaed by a court. In 2011, Olson represented the National Football League Players Association in the 2011 NFL lockout.

In 2009, Olson joined with President Bill Clinton&#x27;s former attorney David Boies, who was also his opposing counsel in &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, to bring a federal lawsuit, &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;, challenging Proposition 8, a California state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. His work on the lawsuit earned him a place among the Time 100&#x27;s greatest thinkers. In 2010, Olson and Floyd Abrams argued in favor of the Citizens United vs FEC case before the Supreme Court, which granted corporations the same free speech rights as individuals, and allowed unlimited corporate spending in elections. In 2011, Olson and David Boies were awarded the ABA Medal, the highest award of the American Bar Association. In 2014, Olson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Brendan V. Sullivan, Jr.

Apple Inc. hired Olson to fight the FBI–Apple encryption dispute court order to unlock an iPhone, which ended with the government withdrawing its case. Olson also represented New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in the Deflategate scandal, which ended with Brady electing not to pursue Supreme Court appeal of a four-game suspension. In 2017, Olson represented a group of billboard advertisers in a lawsuit against the City of San Francisco. The group challenged a city law requiring soda companies to include in their advertisements warnings that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with serious health risks like diabetes. The suit claimed that the law is an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech. In September 2017, a panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Olson and provisionally barred the city&#x27;s mandated warnings.

In March 2018, Olson turned down an offer to represent Donald Trump in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. In November 2019, Olson represented the DACA recipients in the Supreme court case &quot;Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California&quot;. On June 18, the Supreme Court upheld the program due to the failure of the Trump administration to follow the Administrative Procedure Act while rescinding DACA. Olson was solicitor general during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and his wife died on board the plane that was used to crash into the Pentagon. In 2023, Olson wrote in an op-ed that the U.S. should conclude the criminal cases of the remaining defendants. Citing the complicated nature of death penalty cases, as well as the fact that many of the convictions already secured had been partially or fully overturn by appeals courts, he publicly encouraged the government to offer sentences of life in prison.

== Personal life ==
Olson was married four times. His first marriage was to Karen Beatie whom he met in college at the University of the Pacific. Olson&#x27;s second wife was Jolie Ann Bales, an attorney and a liberal Democrat. Olson&#x27;s third wife, Barbara Kay Olson (née Bracher), an attorney and conservative commentator, was a passenger aboard the hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 that crashed into a sector of the Pentagon on his birthday, September 11, 2001. Her original plan was to fly to California on September 10, but she delayed her departure until the next morning so she could wake up with her husband on his birthday. Before she died, she called her husband to warn him about the flight. Some of the phone call was recorded and can still be heard. On October 21, 2006, Olson married Lady Evelyn Booth, a tax attorney from Kentucky and a lifelong Democrat. They remained married for 18 years until his death. Olson died of a stroke at a hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, on November 13, 2024, at the age of 84.

== Politics ==
Olson was a founding member of the Federalist Society. He served on the board of directors of &quot;The American Spectator&quot; magazine. Olson was a prominent critic of Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, and he helped prepare the attorneys of Paula Jones prior to their Supreme Court appearance. Olson served on Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign as its judicial committee chairman. In 2012 he participated in Paul Ryan&#x27;s preparation for the vice presidential debate, role-playing Joe Biden. He was an outspoken advocate for gay marriage in the Republican Party.

== Executive appointment speculation ==
Prior to President Bush&#x27;s nomination of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge John G. Roberts, Olson was considered a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s post. Following the withdrawal of Harriet Miers&#x27; nomination for that post, and prior to the nomination of Third Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Samuel Alito, Olson&#x27;s name was again mentioned as a possible nominee. In September 2007, Olson was considered by the Bush administration for the post of Attorney General to succeed Alberto Gonzales. The Democrats were so vehemently opposed that Bush nominated Michael Mukasey instead.

== Controversies ==
Olson, who served as Ronald Reagan&#x27;s assistant attorney general from 1981 to 1983, recommended that Reagan invoke executive privilege to prevent a Democratic Party-led investigation into the scandal-ridden Superfund program. These claims ultimately proved to be false, in large part. In the end, it was Olson&#x27;s mistakes that led to the departure of Reagan&#x27;s appointed Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Anne Gorsuch Burford. As a result, Reagan&#x27;s plan to reform environmental policy was derailed indefinitely.

In the 1980s, Olson provided evasive answers to questions asked by the Congress about the scandal. He was then investigated by an independent counsel for allegedly providing false testimony to Congress, which some have termed as perjury, in an effort to conceal his own wrongdoing. The investigation ended with the independent counsel ruling that Olsen&#x27;s testimony was &quot;misleading and disingenuous&quot;. Olson was a prominent figure in the Arkansas Project, which used the tax-exempt &quot;The American Spectator&quot; to transfer over $2 million to private investigators digging out anti-Clinton trash. He suggested that officials of the Clinton administration were involved in illegal activities and compared the White House to a Mafia family in anonymous pieces for the &quot;Spectator&quot;.

Olson challenged California tribal gaming law, namely California&#x27;s Proposition 5, from 1998 on. In January 2022, Olson began representing Maverick Gaming, a Las Vegas-based, in a challenge to gaming compacts in Washington state that gave exclusivity to more than a dozen Washington tribes for sports betting. The case has been described as a threat to tribal sovereignty and may potentially result in a return to Termination Era policies of the 1950s. After participating as a defendant, the Shoalwater Bay Tribe filed a move to dismiss the case in October 2022. In February 2023, the case was dismissed by David Estudillo, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

<text>A solicitor general is a government official who serves as the chief representative of the government in courtroom proceedings. In systems based on the English common law that have an attorney general or equivalent position, the solicitor general is often the second-ranked law officer of the state and a deputy of the attorney general. The extent to which a solicitor general actually provides legal advice to or represents the government in court varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and sometimes varies between individual office holders in the same jurisdiction.

==List==
Solicitors General include the following:

===Australia===
* In Australia the role of the Solicitor-General is as the second law officer after the Attorney-General. At federal level, the position of Solicitor-General of Australia was created in 1916 and until 1964 was held by the secretary of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department. It has always been held by a public servant. At state (and prior to 1901, colonial) level, the position has existed since the granting of self-government in the 19th century, and until the early 20th century was held by a member of parliament. During the 20th century there have been significant changes to the role, becoming increasingly independent and non-political to balance the increasing political engagement of the Attorney-General. Criminal litigation has largely been devolved to the various Directors of Public Prosecution. The Solicitor-General provides legal advice to the executive and represents the relevant government in court proceedings, particularly in constitutional matters.

<doc id="105906" wikidata="Q1709" url="?curid=105906" title="Schwerin">
<text>Schwerin (; Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch Low German: &quot;Swerin&quot;; Polabian: &quot;Zwierzyn&quot;; Latin: &quot;Suerina&quot;, &quot;Suerinum&quot;) is the capital and second-largest city of the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as well as of the region of Mecklenburg, after Rostock. It has around 96,000 inhabitants, and is thus the least populous of all German state capitals.

Schwerin is located on the southwestern shore of Lake Schwerin (&quot;Schweriner See&quot;), the second-largest lake of the Mecklenburg Lake Plateau after the Müritz, and there are eleven other lakes within Schwerin&#x27;s city limits. The city is surrounded by the district of Northwestern Mecklenburg to the north, and the district of Ludwigslust-Parchim to the south. Schwerin and the two surrounding districts form the eastern outskirts of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. The name of the city is of Slavic origin, deriving from the root &quot;zvěŕ&quot; (&quot;wild animal&quot;) or &quot;zvěŕin&quot; (&quot;game reserve&quot;, &quot;animal garden&quot;, &quot;stud farm&quot;).

Schwerin was first mentioned in 1018 as &quot;Zuarina&quot; and was granted city rights in 1160 by Henry the Lion, thus it is the oldest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As main residence of the House of Mecklenburg, a dynasty with Slavic roots also known as the Obotrites or Niklotides, Schwerin was the capital of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1379 to 1815, of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (after the duke was elevated to the title of a grand duke) from 1815 to 1918, of the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1918 to 1934, of the State of Mecklenburg (after it was merged with the Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz) from 1934 to 1952, and of the District of Schwerin from 1952 to 1990.

The romantic Schwerin Palace, situated on Castle Island between Lake Schwerin and Castle Lake, known for its golden dome, the Castle Church, the throne room, and the Niklot statue, used to be the seat of the dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and since 1990, it is the seat of the state parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Schwerin&#x27;s silhouette is completed by the towers of Schwerin Cathedral, St Paul&#x27;s Church and St Nicholas&#x27; Church. Because of only minor damage in World War II, the city has a largely intact building structure, both in the Altstadt (Old Town) and Schelfstadt (Reed City) quarters.

Major industries and employers include high technology, machine building, healthcare, government agencies, railway supply, consumer goods and tourism.There is a regional airport in Parchim, southeast of the city, while Hamburg Airport serves as the city&#x27;s main airport.

==History==
===Early years===
Schwerin is enclosed by lakes. The largest of these lakes, the &quot;Schweriner See&quot;, has an area of 60 km2. In the middle part of these lakes there was a settlement of the Slavic Obotrite (dated back to the 11th century). The area was called &quot;Zuarin&quot; (Polabian &quot;Zwierzyn&quot;), and the name &quot;Schwerin&quot; is derived from that designation. In 1160, Henry the Lion defeated the Obotrites and captured Schwerin. The town was later expanded into a powerful regional centre. A castle was built on this site, and expanded to become a ducal palace. It is supposedly haunted by the small, impious ghost, called Petermännchen (&quot;Peterman&quot;).

In 1358, Schwerin became a part of the Duchy of Mecklenburg, making it the seat of the duchy from then on. About 1500, the construction of the Schwerin Palace began, as a residence for the dukes. After the division of Mecklenburg (1621), Schwerin became the capital of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Between 1765 and 1837, the town of Ludwigslust served as the capital, until Schwerin was reinstated.

===Recent times===
In the mid-1800s, many residents from Schwerin moved to the United States, many to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Today Milwaukee and Schwerin are sister cities. After 1918, and during the German Revolution, resulting in the fall of all the German monarchies, the Grand Duke abdicated. Schwerin became capital of the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin thereafter.

During World War II, Schwerin was hit by bombs in July 1940, on 7 April 1945 and 19 April 1945. At the end of World War II, on 2 May 1945, Schwerin was taken by United States troops. It was turned over to the British on 1 June 1945, and one month later, on 1 July 1945, it was handed over to the Soviet forces, as the British and American forces pulled back from the line of contact to the predesignated occupation zones.

Schwerin was then in the Soviet Occupation Zone which was to become the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Initially, it was the capital of the State of Mecklenburg which at that time included the western part of Pomerania (Vorpommern). After the states were dissolved in the GDR, in 1952, Schwerin served as the capital of the Schwerin district (Bezirk Schwerin).
After reunification in 1990, the former state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was recreated as one of the . Rostock was a serious contender for state capital but the decision went in favour of Schwerin.

==Population==
Schwerin has a population of about 95,000 and is the smallest state capital of Germany. In the East German era, Schwerin was an industrial city known for its leather products. In 1991, when Schwerin became the capital of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state, it had a population of 126,000. After the German Reunification, Schwerin&#x27;s population started to decline and fell below 100,000 in 2000, so that it lost its official status as a major city. Schwerin is also the only state capital that has no universities.

==Crime rate==
According to the official 2007 Crime Report for Germany, Schwerin was the only German city with a crime rate over 17,000 total offenses committed per 100,000 inhabitants; thus being 1st in the list of Germany&#x27;s most dangerous cities. The larger cities, such as Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, or Bremen, all have crime rates ranging from 14,000 to 16,000 total offenses committed per 100,000 people. However, Schwerin is the only city where riding a bus (or tram) without a ticket and social security fraud is counted towards the crime rate, significantly boosting the numbers.

<doc id="105908" wikidata="Q183476" url="?curid=105908" title="Ford Mustang">
<text>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the &quot;pony car&quot; automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by &quot;long hood, short deck&quot; proportions.

Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A. Introduced on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units were sold in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch. In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.

The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger (1970). It also competed with the Plymouth Barracuda, which was launched around the same time. The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s, it included more features and was marketed as a personal luxury car.

From 1965 until 2004, the Mustang shared chassis commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive throughout its production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 until 1978, the Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Pinto. From 1979 until 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to the model line.

Through its production, multiple nameplates have been associated with the Ford Mustang series, including GT, Mach 1, Boss 302/429, Cobra (separate from Shelby Cobra), and Bullitt, along with &quot;5.0&quot; fender badging (denoting 4.9 L OHV or 5.0 L DOHC V8 engines).

== Name ==
Executive stylist John Najjar, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is credited by Ford with suggesting the name. Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the Ford Mustang known as the &quot;Ford Mustang I&quot; in 1961, working jointly with fellow Ford stylist Philip T. Clark. The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen, New York, on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney lapped the track in a demonstration using the second &quot;race&quot; prototype.

An alternative view was that Robert J. Eggert, Ford Division market research manager, first suggested the Mustang name. Eggert, a breeder of quarterhorses, received a birthday present from his wife of the book, &quot;The Mustangs&quot; by J. Frank Dobie in 1960. Later, the book&#x27;s title gave him the idea of adding the &quot;Mustang&quot; name for Ford&#x27;s new concept car. The designer preferred Cougar (early styling bucks can be seen wearing a Cougar grille emblem) or Torino (an advertising campaign using the Torino name was actually prepared), while Henry Ford II wanted T-bird II. As the person responsible for Ford&#x27;s research on potential names, Eggert added &quot;Mustang&quot; to the list to be tested by focus groups; &quot;Mustang&quot;, by a wide margin, came out on top under the heading: &quot;Suitability as Name for the Special Car&quot;. The name could not be used in Germany, however, because it was owned by Krupp, which had manufactured trucks between 1951 and 1964 with the name &quot;Mustang&quot;. Ford refused to buy the name for about from Krupp at the time. Kreidler, a manufacturer of mopeds, also used the name, so Mustangs were sold in Germany as &quot;T-5s&quot; until December 1978.

== First generation (1965) ==

Lee Iacocca&#x27;s assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months—while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.

The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model&#x27;s front and rear ends with a roof that was lower. It was originally based on the platform of the second-generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. Gale Halderman&#x27;s side view design is the basis for the first clay model.

=== Non-traditional (1964½) introduction ===
The Ford Mustang began production five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as &quot;1964½ models&quot;, but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates in August 1964 at the formal start of the 1965 production year contribute to tracking 1964 production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964; the new car was, on 14 April 1964, first sold to the public, at a Ford dealership in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada before it was even introduced on April 17, 1964, at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Body styles available included a two-door hardtop and convertible, with a &quot;2+2&quot; fastback added to the line in September 1964. A Wimbledon White (paint code P) convertible with red interior was used as product placement when the &quot;James Bond&quot; movie &quot;Goldfinger&quot; was released September 17, 1964, at its London premiere, where Bond girl Tilly Masterson was in a spirited chase with James driving an Aston Martin DB5 in the Swiss Alps. A Tropical Turquoise (paint code O) coupe was again used in the next film &quot;Thunderball&quot; at its Tokyo premiere 9 December 1965 with Bond girl Fiona Volpe as she drives James to meet the villain Emilio Largo at his compound at a very high speed across The Bahamas.

Favorable publicity articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next morning, the day the car was &quot;officially&quot; revealed. A four-seat car with full space for the front bucket seats and a rear bench seat was standard. A &quot;fastback 2+2&quot;, first manufactured on August 17, 1964, enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line similar to the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.

=== Price and record-breaking sales ===
To achieve an advertised list price of , the Mustang was based heavily on familiar yet simple components, many of which were already in production for other Ford models. Many (if not most) of the interior, chassis, suspension, and drivetrain components were derived from those used on Ford&#x27;s Falcon and Fairlane. This use of common components also shortened the learning curve for assembly and repair workers, while at the same time allowing dealers to pick up the Mustang without also having to invest in additional spare parts inventory to support the new car line. Original sales forecasts projected less than 100,000 units for the first year. This mark was surpassed in three months from rollout. Another 318,000 would be sold during the model year (a record), and in its first eighteen months, more than one million Mustangs were built.

=== Upgrades ===
Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from with an increase from , and an upgrade of the V8 engine from with an increase from . The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the &#x27;Ford Falcon&#x27; logo covered by a trim ring with a &#x27;Ford Mustang&#x27; logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as &quot;1964½&quot; Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.

Ford&#x27;s designers began drawing up larger versions even as the original was achieving sales success, and while &quot;Iacocca later complained about the Mustang&#x27;s growth, he did oversee the 1967 redesign.&quot; From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not necessarily more powerful. The Mustang was facelifted, giving the Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was more pronounced, and the &quot;twin cove&quot; instrument panel offered a thicker crash pad and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback, and convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which used its own styling cues, such as a &quot;prowling cat&quot; logo and hidden quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency flashers, and a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer interior knobs. The 1968 models received revised side scoops, steering wheel, and gasoline caps. Side marker lights were also added that year, and cars built after January 1, 1968, included shoulder belts for both front seats on coupes. The 1968 models also introduced a new V8 engine, designed with Federal emissions regulations in mind.

The 1969 restyle &quot;added more heft to the body as width and length again increased. Weight went up markedly too.&quot; Due to the larger body and revised front end styling, the 1969 models (but less so in 1970) had a notable aggressive stance. The 1969 models featured &quot;quad headlamps&quot; which disappeared to make way for a wider grille and a return to standard headlamps in the 1970 models. This switch back to standard headlamps was an attempt to tame the aggressive styling of the 1969 model, which some felt was too extreme and hurt sales, but 1969 production exceeded the 1970 total.

=== Models ===
Starting in 1969, to aid sales and continue the winning formula of the Mustang, a variety of new performance and decorative options became available, including functional (and non-functional) air scoops, cable and pin hood tie-downs, and both wing and chin spoilers. Additionally, a variety of performance packages were introduced that included the Mach 1, the Boss 302, and Boss 429. The two Boss models were to homologate the engines for racing. The 1969 Mustang was the last year for the GT option (although it did return on the third-generation Mustang for the 1982 model year). A fourth model available only as a hardtop, the Grandé, saw success starting in 1969 with its soft ride, &quot;luxurious&quot; trim, of extra sound deadening, and simulated wood trim.

=== Sales fluctuation ===
Developed under the watch of S. &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen, Mustang evolved &quot;from speed and power&quot; to the growing consumer demand for bigger and heavier &quot;luxury&quot; type designs. &quot;The result was the styling misadventures of 1971–73 ...the Mustang grew fat and lazy,&quot; &quot;Ford was out of the go-fast business almost entirely by 1971.&quot; &quot;This was the last major restyling of the first-generation Mustang.&quot; &quot;The cars grew in every dimension except height, and they gained about .&quot; &quot;The restyling also sought to create the illusion that the cars were even larger.&quot; The 1971 Mustang was nearly wider than the 1970, its front and rear track was also widened by , and its size was most evident in the SportsRoof models with its nearly flat rear roofline and cramped interior with poor visibility for the driver. Performance decreased with sales continuing to decrease as consumers switched to the smaller Pintos and Mavericks. A displeased Iacocca summed up later: &quot;The Mustang market never left us, we left it.&quot;

== Second generation (1974) ==

Iacocca, who had been one of the forces behind the original Mustang, became president of Ford Motor Company in 1970, and ordered a smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974. Initially, it was to be based on the Ford Maverick, but ultimately was based on the Ford Pinto subcompact.

The new model, called the &quot;Mustang II&quot;, was introduced on September 21, 1973, two months before the first 1973 oil crisis, and its reduced size allowed it to compete against successful imported sports coupes such as the Japanese Datsun 240Z, Toyota Celica and the European Ford Capri (then Ford-built in Germany and Britain, sold in U.S. by Mercury as a captive import car). The Mustang II also later competed against the Chevrolet Monza, Pontiac Sunbird, Oldsmobile Starfire and Buick Skyhawk. First-year sales were 385,993 cars, compared with the original Mustang&#x27;s twelve-month sales record of 418,812. Ultimately, the Mustang II was an early example of downsizing that would take place among Detroit&#x27;s Big Three during the &quot;malaise era&quot;.

Iacocca wanted the new car, which returned the Mustang to its 1965 model year predecessor in size, shape, and overall styling, to be finished to a high standard, saying it should be &quot;a little jewel&quot;. Not only was it smaller than the original car, but it was also heavier, owing to the addition of equipment needed to meet new U.S. emission and safety regulations. Performance was reduced, and despite the car&#x27;s new handling and engineering features the galloping mustang emblem &quot;became a less muscular steed that seemed to be cantering&quot;.

Engines for the 1974 models included the venerable 2.3 L I4 from the Pinto and the 2.8 L Cologne V6 from the Mercury Capri. The 1975 model year reintroduced the Windsor V8 that was only available with the C-4 automatic transmission, power brakes, and power steering. This continued through production&#x27;s end in 1978. Other transmissions were the RAD four-speed with unique gearing for all three engines, and the C-3 automatic behind the 2.3 L and 2.8 L. The &quot;5.0 L&quot; marketing designation was not applied until the 1978 King Cobra model. All -equipped Mustang IIs, except the King Cobras, received updated versions of the classic Ford &quot;V8&quot; emblem on each front fender.

The car was available in coupe and hatchback versions, including a &quot;luxury&quot; Ghia model designed by Ford&#x27;s recently acquired Ghia of Italy. The coupe was marketed as a &quot;hardtop&quot; but actually had a thin &quot;B&quot; pillar and rear quarter windows that did not roll down. All Mustangs in this generation did feature frameless door glass, however. The &quot;Ghia&quot; featured a thickly padded vinyl roof and starting with 1975 models smaller rear quarter windows, giving a more formal look. 1974 models were: hardtop, hatchback, Mach 1, and Ghia. Changes introduced for 1975 included the availability of an &quot;MPG&quot; model which had a different rear axle ratio for better fuel economy. 1976 added the &quot;Stallion&quot; trim package. The Mach 1 remained through the life cycle 1974–1978. Other changes in appearance and performance came with a &quot;Cobra II&quot; version in 1976–1978 and a &quot;King Cobra&quot; in 1978 of which around 4,972 were built. The 1977–1978 hatchback models in all trim levels were now available with the T-top roof option, which included a leatherette storage bag that clipped to the top of the spare tire hump.

== Third generation (1979) ==

The 1979 Mustang was based on the larger Fox platform, initially developed for the 1978 Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr. The larger four passenger body used a larger wheelbase which yielded increased room in the passenger cabin, trunk and engine bay.

Body styles included a coupe (or notchback), hatchback, and convertible, the latter added for model year 1983. Available trim levels included an unnamed base model (1979–1981), Ghia (1979–1981), Cobra (1979–1981, 1993), L (1982–1984), GL (1982–1983), GLX (1982–1983), GT (1982–1993), Turbo GT (1983–1984), LX (1984–1993), GT-350 20th anniversary edition (1984), SVO (1984–1986) and Cobra R (1993).

Engines and drivetrains carried over from the Mustang II including the 2.3 L I4, 2.8 L V6, and 4.9 L V8 engines. A troublesome 2.3 L turbocharged I4 was available during initial production startup and then reappeared after undergoing improvements for the mid-year introduction of the 1983 turbo GT. The 2.8 L V6, in short supply, was replaced with a 3.3 L I6 engine during the 1979 model year. That engine was ultimately replaced with a new 3.8 L V6 for 1983. The V8 was suspended after 1979 and replaced with a smaller, 4.2 L V8 which was dropped in favor of the high output V8 for 1982.

From 1979 to 1986, the Capri was domestically produced as a badge engineered variant of the Mustang, using a few of its own styling cues.

The third-generation Mustang had two different front-end styles. From 1979 to 1986, the front end was angled back using four rectangular headlights. The front end was restyled for 1987 to 1993 model years providing a rounded-off &quot;aero&quot; style with flush-composite headlamps and a smooth grille-less nose.

When the Mustang was selected as the 1979 Official Indianapolis 500 Pace Car, Ford also marketed replica models, and its special body-appearance parts were adapted by the Cobra package for 1980–81.

1982 marked the return of the Mustang GT (replacing the Cobra) which used a specially-modified high-output engine.

In 1983, Ford again offered a convertible Mustang, after a nine-year absence. The front fascias of all Mustangs were restyled, featuring new grilles, sporting &quot;blue oval&quot; Ford emblems for the first time.

1984 introduced the high-performance Mustang SVO, which featured a 2.3 L turbocharged and intercooled four-cylinder engine and unique bodywork.

The Mustang celebrated its 20th anniversary with a special GT350 model in white with red interior and red lower-bodyside rocker stripes. 1985 Mustangs received another front-fascia restyle.

In response to poor sales and escalating fuel prices during the early 1980s, a new Mustang was in development. It was to be a variant of the Mazda MX-6 assembled at AutoAlliance International in Flat Rock, Michigan. Enthusiasts wrote to Ford objecting to the proposed change to a front-wheel drive, Japanese-designed Mustang without a V8 option. The result was the continuation of the existing Mustang while the Mazda MX-6 variant had a last-minute name change from Mustang to Probe and was released as a 1989 model.

The Mustang received a major restyling for 1987, including the interior, which carried it through the end of the 1993 model year.

Under the newly established Ford SVT division, the 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra and Cobra R were added as special, high-performance models.

== Fourth generation (SN95; 1994) ==

In November 1993, the Mustang debuted its first major redesign in fifteen years. Code-named &quot;SN95&quot; by the automaker, it was based on an updated version of the rear-wheel drive Fox platform called &quot;Fox-4.&quot; The new styling by Patrick Schiavone incorporated several styling cues from earlier Mustangs. For the first time since its introduction 1964, a notchback coupe model was not available. The door windows on the coupe were once again frameless; however, the car had a fixed &quot;B&quot; pillar and rear windows.

The base model came with a 3.8 OHV V6 engine rated at in 1994 and 1995, or (1996–1998), and was mated to a standard 5-speed manual transmission or optional 4-speed automatic. Though initially used in the 1994 and 1995 Mustang GTS, GT and Cobra, Ford retired the 302 cid pushrod small-block V8 after nearly 30 years of use, replacing it with the newer Modular SOHC V8 in the 1996 Mustang GT. The 4.6 L V8 was initially rated at , 1996–1997, but was later increased to in 1998.

For 1999, the Mustang was reskinned with Ford&#x27;s New Edge styling theme with sharper contours, larger wheel arches, and creases in its bodywork, but its basic proportions, interior design, and chassis remained the same as the previous model. The Mustang&#x27;s powertrains were carried over for 1999, but benefited from new improvements. The standard 3.8 L V6 had a new split-port induction system, and was rated at 1999–2000, while the Mustang GT&#x27;s 4.6 L V8 saw an increase in output to (1999–2004), due to a new head design and other enhancements. In 2001, the 3.8 L was increased to 193 bhp. In 2004, a 3.9 L variant of the Essex engine replaced the standard 3.8 L mid year with an increase of of torque as well as NVH improvements. There were also three alternate models offered in this generation: the 2001 Bullitt, the 2003 and 2004 Mach 1, as well as the 1999 and 2001, and 2003 and 2004 Cobra.

;Ford Australia
This generation was sold in Australia between 2001 and 2002, to compete against the Holden Monaro (which eventually became the basis for the reborn Pontiac GTO). Due to the fact that the Mustang was never designed for right-hand-drive, Ford Australia contracted Tickford Vehicle Engineering to convert 250 Mustangs and modify them to meet Australian Design Rules per year. The development cost for redesigning the components and setting up the production process was . Sales did not meet expectations, due in part to a high selling price. In total, just 377 Mustangs were sold in Australia between 2001 and 2003. For promotional purposes, Ford Racing Australia also built a Mustang V10 convertible, which was powered by a Ford Modular 6.8 L V10 engine from the American F truck series but fitted with an Australian-made Sprintex supercharger.

== Fifth generation (S197; 2005) ==


Ford introduced a re-designed 2005 model year Mustang at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, codenamed &quot;S197&quot;, that was based on the new D2C platform. Developed under the direction of chief engineer Hau Thai-Tang, a veteran engineer for Ford&#x27;s IndyCar program under Mario Andretti, and exterior styling designer Sid Ramnarace, the fifth-generation Mustang&#x27;s styling echoes the fastback Mustang models of the late-1960s. Ford&#x27;s senior vice president of design, J Mays, called it &quot;retro-futurism&quot;. The fifth-generation Mustang was manufactured at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan.

For the 2005 to 2010 production years, the base model was powered by a cast-iron block 4.0 L SOHC V6, while the GT used an aluminum block 4.6 L SOHC three-valve Modular V8 with variable camshaft timing (VCT) that produced . Base models had Tremec T5 five-speed manual transmissions with Ford&#x27;s 5R55S five-speed automatic being optional. Automatic GTs also featured this, but manual GTs had the Tremec TR-3650 five-speeds.

For 2007, Ford&#x27;s SVT launched the Shelby GT500, a successor to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The supercharged and intercooled Ford Modular DOHC 4 valves per cylinder V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm.

The 2010 model year Mustang was released in the spring of 2009 with a redesigned exterior — which included sequential LED taillights — and a reduced drag coefficient of 4% on base models and 7% on GT models. The engine for base Mustangs remained unchanged, while the GT&#x27;s 4.6 L V8 was revised resulting in at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,255 rpm. Other mechanical features included new spring rates and dampers, traction and stability control system standard on all models, and new wheel sizes.

Engines were revised for 2011, and transmission options included the Getrag-Ford MT82 six-speed manual or the 6R80 six-speed automatic based on the ZF 6HP26 transmission, licensed for production by Ford. Electric power steering replaced the conventional hydraulic version. A new aluminum block V6 engine weighed less than the previous version. With 24 valves and twin independent variable cam timing (TiVCT), it produced and of torque. The 3.7 L engine came with a new dual exhaust. GT models included 32-valve 5.0 L engine () (also referred to as the &quot;Coyote&quot;) producing 412 hp and 390 ft-lbs of torque. Brembo brakes were optional along with 19-inch wheels and performance tires.

For 2012, a new Mustang Boss 302 version was introduced. The engine had and of torque. A &quot;Laguna Seca&quot; edition was also available, which offered additional body bracing, the replacement of the rear seat with a steel &quot;X-brace&quot; for stiffening, and other powertrain and handling enhancements.

In the second quarter of 2012, Ford launched an update to the Mustang line as an early 2013 model. The Shelby GT500 had a new 5.8 L supercharged V8 producing . The Shelby and Boss engines came with a six-speed manual transmission. The GT and V6 models revised styling incorporated the grille and air intakes from the 2010–2012 GT500s. The decklid received a black cosmetic panel on all trim levels. The GT&#x27;s 5.0 liter V8 gained eight horsepower from to .

== Sixth generation (S550; 2015) ==

The sixth generation Mustang was unveiled on December 5, 2013, in Dearborn, Michigan; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, Australia. The internal project code name is S550.

Changes include a body widened by 1.5 inches and lowered 1.4 inches, a trapezoidal grille, and a 2.75-inch lower decklid, as well as new colors. The passenger volume is increased to 84.5 cubic feet, the wheelbase is still 8 ft. 11.1 in. (107.1 in.), and three engine options are available: a newly developed 2.3 L EcoBoost 310 hp four-cylinder introduced to reach high tariff global markets like China, 3.7 L 300 hp V6, or 5.0 L Coyote 435 hp V8, with either a Getrag six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.

A new independent rear suspension (IRS) system was developed specifically for the new model. It also became the first version factory designed as a right hand drive export model to be sold overseas through Ford new car dealerships in right hand drive markets. 

In February 2015, the Mustang earned a five-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for front, side, and rollover crash protection.

In May 2015, Ford issued a recall involving 19,486 of the 2015 Ford Mustang with the 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder engine with a production date between February 14, 2014, and February 10, 2015, that were built at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant. As of June 2015, 1 million Mustangs (between 2005 and 2011) and GTs (between 2005 and 2006) were affected by a recall of airbags made by Takata Corporation. This was after Takata announced that it was recalling 33.8 million vehicles in the U.S. for airbags that could explode and send metal pieces flying at drivers and passengers.

Euro NCAP crash-tested the left hand drive (LHD) European version of the 2017 Mustang which received only two stars due to the lack of auto safety features such as lane assist and auto braking. Euro NCAP also pointed to insufficient pressure of the Airbag resulting in the driver&#x27;s head hitting the steering wheel. In the full-width test, the rear passenger slipped under the seatbelt.

The 2018 model year Mustang was released in the third quarter of 2017 in North America and by 2018 globally. It featured a minor redesign to the exterior. The 2018 Mustang engine line up was revised. The 3.7 L V6 was dropped and the 2.3 L I4 Ecoboost (direct-injection turbocharged) engine now serves as the base power plant for the Mustang, producing and of torque when using 93-octane fuel. The 5.0 L V8 gets a power increase to and of torque. The automatic transmission in both engines is now a ten-speed Ford 10R80. In January 2018, Ford displayed a prototype of the special edition 2018 Bullitt model, to be released in the summer; this vehicle commemorated the 50th anniversary of the movie &quot;Bullitt&quot; that helped attract interest in the marque.

For the 2019 model year, Ford revised many components on the 2019 Shelby GT350 including stickier Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires along with steering and suspension components.

The 2020 model year saw the re-introduction of the GT500. The 2020 GT500 includes a hand-built 5.2-liter &quot;Predator&quot; aluminum-alloy V8 engine with a 2.65-liter roots-type supercharger. The Shelby GT500 produces and of torque. The GT350 was discontinued at the end of the 2020 model year.

For the 2021 model year, Ford re-introduced the Mach 1 after a 17-year hiatus. The 2021 Mach 1 utilizes the current Coyote 5.0 L engine with GT350 parts, including the intake manifold, increasing performance to at 7,000 rpm and at 4,600 rpm in addition to utilizing the GT350&#x27;s lightweight Tremec six-speed manual transmission, oil-filter adapter, engine oil cooler, and front and rear subframe. The Mach 1 also utilizes parts from the GT500, including the rear axle cooling system, rear toe link, and rear diffuser.

== Seventh generation (S650; 2024)==

Ford previewed the seventh-generation Mustang at the 2022 Detroit Auto Show on September 14, in a special event called &quot;The Stampede&quot;. As part of its introduction, multiple track-only models were showcased, such as a NASCAR Cup Series body, a V8 Supercar version, and multiple GT racing versions, among others. Also announced was the addition of the “Dark Horse” series. Bridging the gap between the Mach 1 and now-discontinued GT350, the Dark Horse performs much the same role as the 2012–2013 Boss 302 Mustangs — a street legal car with enhanced performance on road courses. The seventh generation Mustang is assembled at Ford&#x27;s Flat Rock Assembly Plant and began production on May 1, 2023, initially available with either the redesigned 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged 4-cylinder with , or the revised, 4th generation Coyote V8 with in the GT and in the Dark Horse. At launch, three transmissions were offered: a Getrag 6-speed manual (GT only), a Tremec 6-speed manual transmission (Dark Horse only), or a 10-speed automatic transmission (available on all trims).

==Mustang Mach-E==

On November 17, 2019, Ford announced the Ford Mustang Mach-E. Unrelated to any of the pony car Mustang versions, it is an electric crossover with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, depending on trim level. It has of range and an updated Ford Sync system with a 15.5 inch display. The Mustang Mach-E comes in several different trims including First Edition, Select, Premium, California Route 1, and GT. The Mach-E also offers two battery options, and Ford is expected to introduce a third option in the future. Although it shares the Mustang name and badge, this vehicle is not counted among the Mustang&#x27;s seven generations, as it is a separate model produced alongside the existing two-door Mustang rather than being a chronological successor to it, and is designed around a separate vehicle platform.
== Racing ==
The Mustang made its first public appearance on a racetrack as pace car for the 1964 Indianapolis 500.

The same year, Mustangs won first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally.

In 1969, modified versions of the 428 Mach 1, Boss 429 and Boss 302 took 295 United States Auto Club-certified records at Bonneville Salt Flats. The outing included a 24-hour run on a course at an average speed of . Drivers were Mickey Thompson, Danny Ongais, Ray Brock, and Bob Ottum.

=== Drag racing ===
The car&#x27;s American competition debut, also in 1964, was in drag racing, where private individuals and dealer-sponsored teams campaigned Mustangs powered by V8s.

In late 1964, Ford contracted Holman &amp; Moody to prepare ten 427-powered Mustangs to contest the National Hot Rod Association&#x27;s (NHRA) A/Factory Experimental class in the 1965 drag racing season. Five of these special Mustangs made their competition debut at the 1965 NHRA Winternationals, where they qualified in the factory stock eliminator class. The car driven by Bill Lawton won the class.

A decade later Bob Glidden won the Mustang&#x27;s first NHRA pro stock title.

Rickie Smith&#x27;s Motorcraft Mustang won the International Hot Rod Association pro stock world championship.

In 2002 John Force broke his own NHRA drag racing record by winning his 12th national championship in his Ford Mustang funny car; Force beat that record again in 2006, becoming the first-ever 14-time champion, driving a Mustang.

=== Circuit racing ===
Early Mustangs also proved successful in road racing. The GT 350 R, the race version of the Shelby GT 350, won five of the Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s (SCCA) six divisions in 1965. Drivers were Jerry Titus, Bob Johnson and Mark Donohue, and Titus won the (SCCA) B-Production national championship. The GT 350s won the B-Production title again in 1966 and 1967. They also won the 1966 manufacturers&#x27; championship in the inaugural SCCA Trans-Am series, and repeated the win the following year.

In 1970, Mustang won the SCCA series manufacturers&#x27; championship again, with Parnelli Jones and George Follmer driving for car owner/builder Bud Moore and crew chief Lanky Foushee. Jones won the &quot;unofficial&quot; drivers&#x27; title.

In 1975 Ron Smaldone&#x27;s Mustang became the first-ever American car to win the Showroom Stock national championship in SCCA road racing.

Mustangs competed in the IMSA GTO class, with wins in 1984 and 1985. In 1985 John Jones won the 1985 GTO drivers&#x27; championship; Wally Dallenbach Jr., John Jones and Doc Bundy won the GTO class at the Daytona 24 Hours; and Ford won its first manufacturers&#x27; championship in road racing since 1970. Three class wins went to Lynn St. James, the first woman to win in the series.

1986 brought eight more GTO wins and another manufacturers&#x27; title. Scott Pruett won the drivers&#x27; championship. The GT Endurance Championship also went to Ford.

In 1987 Saleen Autosport Mustangs driven by Steve Saleen and Rick Titus won the SCCA Escort Endurance SSGT championship, and in International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) racing a Mustang again won the GTO class in the Daytona 24 Hours. In 1989, the Mustang won Ford its first Trans-Am manufacturers&#x27; title since 1970, with Dorsey Schroeder winning the drivers&#x27; championship.

In 1997, Tommy Kendall&#x27;s Roush-prepared Mustang won a record 11 consecutive races in Trans-Am to secure his third straight driver&#x27;s championship.

Mustangs compete in the SCCA World Challenge, with Brandon Davis winning the 2009 GT driver&#x27;s championship. Mustangs competed in the now-defunct Grand-Am Road Racing Ford Racing Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup series.

Ford won championships in the Grand-Am Road Racing Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge for the 2005, 2008, and 2009 seasons with the Mustang FR500C and GT models. In 2004, Ford Racing retained Multimatic Motorsports to design, engineer, build and race the Mustang FR500C turn-key race car. In 2005, Scott Maxwell and David Empringham took the driver&#x27;s title. In 2010, the next-generation Mustang race car was known as the Boss 302R. It took its maiden victory at Barber Motorsports Park in early 2011, with drivers Scott Maxwell and Joe Foster.

In 2012, Jack Roush Jr and Billy Johnson won the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge race at the Daytona International Speedway opening race of the 50th Anniversary Rolex 24 At Daytona weekend in a Mustang Boss 302R.

In 2016, Multimatic Motorsports won the IMSA CTSCC drivers&#x27; and manufacturers&#x27; titles with the S550-based Shelby GT350R-C, driven by Scott Maxwell and Billy Johnson.

On July 27, 2023, Ford announced that the 7th Generation Mustang would have its own spec-racing series called Mustang Challenge, sanctioned by the IMSA.

=== Stock car racing ===
Dick Trickle won 67 short-track oval feature races in 1972, a US national record for wins in a single season.

In 2010 the Ford Mustang became Ford&#x27;s Car of Tomorrow for the NASCAR Nationwide Series with full-time racing of the Mustang beginning in 2011. This opened a new chapter in both the Mustang&#x27;s history and Ford&#x27;s history. NASCAR insiders expected to see Mustang racing in NASCAR Sprint Cup by 2014 (the model&#x27;s 50th anniversary). The NASCAR vehicles are not based on production models but are a silhouette racing car with decals that give them a superficial resemblance to road cars. Carl Edwards won the first-ever race with a NASCAR-prepped Mustang on April 8, 2011, at the Texas Motor Speedway.

Ford Mustangs have also raced in the NASCAR Xfinity Series since 2010.

Ford Mustangs are driven in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series also.

Ford Mustangs have been track-raced in the NASCAR Cup Series since 2019, replacing the discontinued Ford Fusion.

=== Drifting ===
Mustangs have competed at the Formula Drift and D1 Grand Prix series, most notably by American driver Vaughn Gittin Jr.

Brazilian Driver Diego Higa won the Netflix Hyperdrive Series in 2019 in a 2006 Ford Mustang V8.

=== Europe ===
Ford Mustangs compete in the FIA GT3 European Championship, and compete in the GT4 European Cup and other sports car races such as the 24 Hours of Spa. The Marc VDS Racing Team was developing the GT3 spec Mustang since 2010.

=== Australia ===
The Ford Mustang was announced as the replacement for the Ford Falcon FG X in the 2019 Supercars Championship, which is being contested in Australia and New Zealand. The Mustang placed first in the first race of the year with Scott McLaughlin winning for DJR Team Penske.
== Awards ==

The 1965 Mustang won the Tiffany Gold Medal for excellence in American design, the first automobile ever to do so.

The Mustang was on the Car and Driver Ten Best list in 1983, 1987, 1988, 2005, 2006, 2011, and 2016. It won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award in 1974 and 1994.

==Mustang Owner&#x27;s Museum==
In May 2016, the Mustang Owner&#x27;s Museum was announced, with an official opening in Concord, North Carolina on April 17, 2019; the fifty-fifth anniversary. The decision to locate somewhere in Concord was a result of the success of the 2014 Mustang 50th-anniversary celebration at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, with over 4,000 Mustangs registered and an estimated economic impact of .

== In popular culture ==
The Ford Mustang has been featured in numerous media. Effective product placement allowed the car to reach &quot;celebrity status in the 1960s&quot;. In particular, &quot;movie glamour&quot; assisted in establishing a positive association with the Mustang. The following are a few notable cases where embedded marketing influenced the sales or other tangible aspect of the vehicle:
* The 1964 movie &quot;The Troops of St. Tropez&quot;, was the Ford Mustang&#x27;s first appearance in a movie. &quot;Contrary to popular belief, the Ford Mustang did not make its cinematic debut in the classic James Bond film Goldfinger. On September 9, 1964, Nicole Cruchot cruised around in a Poppy Red 1964.5 Mustang convertible in the French comedy Le Gendarme de Saint-Tropez. Known to American audiences as The Troops of St. Tropez, Cruchot&#x27;s character, Geneviève Grad, holds the distinct honor of being the first person to drive a Ford Mustang on the silver screen.&quot;
* The 1964 movie &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, was the Ford Mustang&#x27;s second appearance in a feature film and timed with the car&#x27;s introduction in the US marketplace.
* The song &quot;Mustang Sally&quot;, first recorded by Wilson Pickett in 1966 and covered by many other artists since, is about a man who buys a Mustang for his girlfriend, Sally, who ends up preferring the car over him. It has been described by one cultural historian as &quot;free advertising for the Ford Motor Company.&quot;
* The TV series &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; was sponsored by Ford Motor Company. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. drove new Mustang convertibles during the first four seasons (1965–1969), and viewers can see how the Mustang evolved into a muscle car.
* Using real cars, Steve McQueen drove a debadged Highland Green 1968 Mustang GT fastback with a 390 cubic inch engine and 4 speed transmission in a chase scene, alongside a black 1968 Dodge Charger, in the 1968 film &quot;Bullitt&quot;. Ford has released several special editions of the Mustang paying homage to the movie car.
* A 1971 Mustang (modified to look like a 1973 model), nicknamed &quot;Eleanor&quot;, was the feature car in the 1974 car heist film &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;. &quot;Eleanor&quot; returned, as a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500, in the movie&#x27;s remake in 2000. The remake version of Eleanor featured a custom body kit designed by Chip Foose that has inspired numerous restomods since.
* The racing video game &quot;Ford Mustang: The Legend Lives&quot;, released in 2005, features only Mustangs.
* The 2008 TV movie &quot;Knight Rider&quot; featured a black 2008 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR as KITT (replacing the 1982 Pontiac Firebird from the original series), voiced by Val Kilmer.
* The David Gelb directed documentary &quot;A Faster Horse&quot; covers the creation of the 2015 Mustang.
* The 2014 film &quot;Need for Speed&quot; features, along with a Shelby Mustang integral to the plot, a 2015 Mustang that briefly appears at the end. Like with &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the scene was shot before the car was revealed to the public. A prototype was used and kept secret, with only the actors and film crew allowed to see the car.

<doc id="105914" wikidata="Q2742946" url="?curid=105914" title="Darius II (video game)">
<text>is a 1989 arcade shooter video game developed and published by Taito. It is a direct sequel to the 1987 title, &quot;Darius&quot;. It was later released as in Japan in 1991 for the Game Boy as well as non-Japanese ports. A remake was released for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² as in 1993.

==Gameplay==
The game is set in the inner half of the Solar System, and has the same branching level structure as &quot;Darius&quot;. Similar to the first &quot;Darius&quot; game, &quot;Darius II&quot; was programmed for multiple screens; while a three-screen version like the original exists, &quot;Darius II&quot; is more commonly and generally represented as a two-screen game.

The red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function, respectively. They provide upgrades to the &quot;missile&quot; main weapon, the &quot;bomb&quot; subweapon, and a shield to absorb damage. Two new powerups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new &quot;laser&quot; main weapon which functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to &quot;all&quot; the players weapons. Acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is vastly different from &quot;Darius&quot;. A formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Furthermore, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade is the same as before.

Another new feature in &quot;Darius II&quot; is the appearance of minibosses known as &quot;captains&quot;; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In &quot;Darius II&quot;, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.

==Plot==
&quot;Darius II&quot; takes place sometime after the first &quot;Darius&quot; game. The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game&#x27;s heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius&#x27; inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius&#x27; societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.

==Ports==
A Mega Drive conversion was released in Japan in 1990; it was later released for the Genesis in the United States and Brazil in 1991, where it was renamed &quot;Sagaia&quot;. Changes include a boss rush mode (via a code) and various modifications to levels and mechanics, such as the boss Steel Spine being moved to another level and the boss Killer Higia being replaced with a similar creation called Nehonojia. This conversion does not support two players, so the ability to choose between Proco Jr. and Tiat Young was added; Proco plays like normal, while Tiat starts every life off with one power level to each weapon.

A Master System conversion, developed by Natsume, was released in Europe and Brazil in 1992, also titled &quot;Sagaia&quot;. It is somewhat based on the Mega Drive port, and while Tiat Young and her abilities are still present (though even more limited), many zones (and thus bosses) have been completely removed.

The PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version was published by NEC Avenue and released in 1993 under the title &quot;Super Darius II&quot;. This version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.

In 1996, a port of the arcade version itself was released in Japan and Europe for the Sega Saturn, complete with two-player mode and stretchable wide screen modes. The arcade version is also available in the Japan-only &quot;Taito Memories&quot; series of emulation-based compilations.

<doc id="105921" wikidata="Q1375672" url="?curid=105921" title="King David Hotel">
<text>The King David Hotel (; ) is a 5-star hotel in Jerusalem and a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. Opened in 1931, it was built with locally quarried pink limestone and was founded by Ezra Mosseri, a wealthy Egyptian Jewish banker. It is located on King David Street in the centre of Jerusalem, overlooking the Old City and Mount Zion, and is named after the Biblical King David.

The hotel, owned and operated by the Dan Hotels group, has traditionally been the chosen venue for hosting heads of state, dignitaries, politicians and celebrities during their visits to Jerusalem.

It is also famous for the 1946 King David Hotel Bombing, when a terrorist attack by the Zionist organization Irgun targeted the hotel&#x27;s southern wing, which contained offices for the British authorities during Mandatory Palestine, killing 91 people of various nationalities and injuring 45.

==History==
===British Mandate of Palestine===
In 1929, Palestine Hotels Ltd. purchased on Jerusalem&#x27;s Julian&#x27;s Way, today King David Street. Half the construction costs were paid by Ezra Mosseri, an affluent Egyptian Jewish banker and director of the National Bank of Egypt, and another 46% by the Goldschmidt family and other wealthy Cairo Jews. The approximately 4% remaining was paid by the National Bank of Egypt, which purchased 693 shares of the company between 1934 and 1943.

From its earliest days, the King David Hotel hosted royalty: the dowager empress of Pahlavi dynasty, Tadj ol-Molouk, queen consort Nazli of Egypt, and King Abdullah I of Jordan stayed at the hotel, and three heads of state forced to flee their countries took up residence there: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, forced to abdicate in 1931, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, driven out by the Italians in 1936, and King George II of Greece, who set up his government in exile at the hotel after the Nazi occupation of his country in 1942. During the Mandatory Palestine, the southern wing of the hotel contained British administrative and military offices.

====Bombing====
On July 22, 1946, the southwestern corner of the hotel was bombed during a terrorist attack by the Zionist paramilitary group Irgun. 91 people of various nationalities, including Britons, Arabs and Jews, were killed and 45 people were injured by the militant right-wing group. An earlier attempt by the Irgun to attack the hotel had been foiled when the Haganah learned of it, and warned the Mandatory Palestine&#x27;s British authorities.

=== Israel ===
On May 4, 1948, when the British flag was lowered as the British Mandate ended, the building became a Jewish stronghold. At the end of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the hotel found itself overlooking &quot;no-man’s land&quot; on the armistice line that divided Jerusalem into Israeli and Jordanian territory. The hotel was purchased by the Dan Hotels chain in 1958. Multiple scenes in the 1960 film &quot;Exodus&quot; were shot at the hotel, both outside and inside, in the main lobby and on the terrace. When East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War, two additional floors were added.

Among the hotel&#x27;s famous official guests: British monarch Charles III; King Hussein of Jordan; U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden; British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and Tony Blair; Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi; U.S. politicians Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton; as well as many stars including Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Dreyfuss, Richard Gere and Madonna.

==Architecture==
The design for the hotel was commissioned from a Swiss architect, , with the actual construction supervised by Jerusalem architect Benjamin Chaikin. According to Hebrew University professor Ruth Kark, Vogt&#x27;s approach was typical of European architects who, commissioned to design buildings in Jerusalem, incorporated &quot;Eastern-style domes, arches, various kinds of different-colored stone, and interior decorations with religious symbols and inscriptions,&quot; in buildings whose strict symmetry marks them indelibly as European. The public rooms were decorated by Gustave-Adolphe Hufschmid in motifs taken from Assyrian, Hittite, Phoenician and Muslim buildings in an effort to evoke a &quot;Biblical&quot; style. Hufschmid, also Swiss, stated that his intention was &quot;to evoke by reminiscence the ancient Semitic style and the ambiance of the glorious period of King David.&quot;

==Dining==
In the early days of the hotel, there were few Jews or Arabs on the staff. The chefs were Italian, the service staff were mostly Berbers, the management was Swiss, and the menu served primarily European influenced dishes. In 1958, after ownership of the hotel changed hands, the kitchen began to comply with kashrut regulations, but continued to serve a kosher version of French influenced haute cuisine. Dishes served by the hotel&#x27;s restaurant during that era included entrecote steak with béarnaise sauce, &quot;pommes mignonettes dorées&quot; and salmon poached in court-bouillon. By the 1960s, demographics had changed with senior staff positions held mostly by Jews of German or Czech origin, and the restaurant had also started serving traditional dishes from Ashkenazi cuisine for &quot;shabbos&quot; dinners, such as &quot;gehakte leber&quot; and gefilte fish. By the 1980s dinner menus included kugel, kreplach in consomme broth, and strudel. Breakfasts consisted of Danish pastry, fruit, cheese, and smoked fish; the latter has become part of a typical Israeli breakfast.

The hotel includes four dining options:
* La Régence – fine dining
* King&#x27;s Garden
* The Oriental Bar
* Poolside Snack Bar
La Régence and King&#x27;s Garden are run by executive chef David Biton.

<doc id="105922" wikidata="Q1814446" url="?curid=105922" title="King David Hotel bombing">
<text>The British administrative headquarters for Mandatory Palestine, housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, were bombed in a terrorist attack on 22 July 1946, by the militant right-wing Zionist underground organization Irgun during the Jewish insurgency. Ninety-one people of various nationalities were killed, including Arabs, Britons and Jews, and 46 were injured.

The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine, principally the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan. When planned, the attack had the approval of the Haganah, the principal Jewish paramilitary group in Palestine, though, unbeknownst to the Irgun, this had been cancelled by the time the operation was carried out. The main motive of the bombing was to destroy documents incriminating the Jewish Agency in attacks against the British, which were obtained during Operation Agatha, a series of raids by mandate authorities. It was the deadliest attack directed at the British during the Mandate era (1920–1948).

Disguised as Arab workmen and as hotel waiters, members of the Irgun planted a bomb in the basement of the main building of the hotel, whose southern wing housed the Mandate Secretariat and a few offices of the British military headquarters. The resulting explosion caused the collapse of the western half of the southern wing of the hotel. Some of the deaths and injuries occurred in the road outside the hotel and in adjacent buildings.

Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of any warnings. The Irgun stated subsequently that warnings were delivered by telephone; Thurston Clarke states that the first warning was delivered by a 16-year-old recruit to the hotel switchboard 15 minutes before the explosion. The British Government said after the inquest that no warning had been received by anyone at the Secretariat &quot;in an official position with any power to take action&quot;.

==Background==
===Motivation===
The Irgun committed the attack in response to Operation Agatha, known in Israel as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;. British troops had searched the Jewish Agency on 29 June and confiscated large quantities of documents directly implicating the Haganah in the Jewish insurgency against Britain. The intelligence information was taken to the King David Hotel, where it was initially kept in the offices of the Secretariat in the southern wing. The Irgun was determined to destroy that wing of the hotel in order to destroy the incriminating documents.

===Hotel layout===
In plan form, the six-story hotel, which was opened in 1932 as the first modern luxury hotel in Jerusalem, had an I-shape, with a long central axis connecting wings to the north and south. Julian&#x27;s Way, a main road, ran parallel and close to the west side of the hotel. An unsurfaced lane, where the French Consulate was situated and from where access to the service entrance of the hotel was gained, ran from there past the north end of the hotel. Gardens and an olive grove, which had been designated as a park, surrounded the other sides.

===Government and military usage===
In 1946, the Secretariat occupied most of the southern wing of the hotel, with the military headquarters occupying the top floor of the south wing and the top, second and third floors of the middle of the hotel. The military telephone exchange was situated in the basement. An annex housed the military police and a branch of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Palestine Police.

Rooms had first been requisitioned in the hotel in late 1938, on what was supposed to be a temporary basis. Plans had already been made to erect a permanent building for the Secretariat and Army GHQ, but these were cancelled after the Second World War broke out, at which point more than two-thirds of the hotel&#x27;s rooms were being used for government and army purposes.

In March 1946, British Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Richard Crossman described activity at the hotel: &quot;Private detectives, Zionist agents, Arab sheiks, special correspondents, and the rest, all sitting around about discreetly overhearing each other.&quot; Security analyst Bruce Hoffman has written that the hotel &quot;housed the nerve centre of British rule in Palestine&quot;.

===Previous attacks===
Amichai Paglin, chief of operations of the Irgun, developed a remote-controlled mortar with a range of four miles that was nicknamed the V3 by British military engineers. In 1945, after attacks using the mortar had been executed against several police stations, six V3s were buried in the olive grove park south of the King David Hotel. Three were aimed at the government printing press and three at the hotel itself. The intention was to fire them on the king&#x27;s birthday, but the Haganah learned about the plan and warned the British through Teddy Kollek of the Jewish Agency. Army sappers then located and removed the buried V3s. On another occasion, members of an unknown group threw grenades at the hotel but missed.

==Preparations==
===Planning===

The leaders of Haganah opposed the idea initially. On 1 July 1946, Moshe Sneh, chief of the Haganah General Headquarters, sent a letter to the then leader of the Irgun, Menachem Begin, which instructed him to &quot;carry out the operation at the &#x27;chick&#x27;&quot;, code for the King David Hotel. Despite this approval for the project, repeated delays in executing the operation were requested by the Haganah, in response to changes unfolding in the political situation. The plan was finalized between Amichai Paglin (Irgun alias &#x27;Gidi&#x27;), Chief of Operations of the Irgun, and Itzhak Sadeh, commander of the Palmach.

In the plan, Irgun men, disguised as Arabs, except for Gideon, the leader, who would be dressed as one of the hotel&#x27;s distinctive Sudanese waiters, would enter the building through a basement service entrance carrying the explosives concealed in milk cans. The cans were to be placed by the main columns supporting the wing where the majority of the offices used by the British authorities were located. The columns were in a basement nightclub known as the Régence. In the final review of the plan, it was decided that the attack would take place on 22 July at 11:00, a time when there would be no people in the coffee shop in the basement in the area where the bomb was to be planted. It would be possible to enter the hotel more easily at that time as well.

It would have been impossible to have planted the bomb in the Régence any later than 14:00 because it was always full of customers after that time. The timing was also determined by the original intention that the attack should coincide with another, carried out by the Lehi, on government offices at the David Brothers Building. Codenamed &quot;Operation Your Slave and Redeemer&quot;, this one was cancelled at the last moment. The Irgun said details of the plan were aimed at minimizing civilian casualties. Irgun reports allegedly included explicit precautions so that the whole area would be evacuated. This led to recriminations between the Haganah and Irgun later. The Haganah said that they had specified that the attack should take place later in the day when the offices would have been emptier of people.

===Warnings===
Since the bombing, much controversy has ensued over the issues of when warnings were sent and how the British authorities responded. Irgun representatives have always stated that the warning was given well in advance of the explosion so that adequate time was available to evacuate the hotel. Menachem Begin, for example, wrote that the telephone message was delivered 25–27 minutes before the explosion. The British government said, five months after the bombing, once the subsequent inquest and all inquiries had been completed, that no such warnings had been received by anyone at the Secretariat &quot;in an official position with any power to take action&quot;. Begin directly accused Chief Secretary of the Palestine Mandate, John Shaw, of ignoring a warning, which he denied having received. (see Sir John Shaw controversy)

American author Thurston Clarke&#x27;s analysis of the bombing gave timings for calls and for the explosion, which he said took place at 12:37. He stated that as part of the Irgun plan, a 16-year-old recruit, Adina Hay (alias Tehia), was to make three warning calls before the attack. At 12:22 the first call was made, in both Hebrew and English, to a telephone operator on the hotel&#x27;s switchboard (the Secretariat and the military each had their own, separate, telephone exchanges). It was ignored. At 12:27, the second warning call was made to the French Consulate adjacent to the hotel to the north-east. This second call was taken seriously, and staff went through the building opening windows and closing curtains to lessen the impact of the blast. At 12:31 a third and final warning call to the &quot;Palestine Post&quot; newspaper was made. The telephone operator called the Palestine Police CID to report the message. She then called the hotel switchboard. The hotel operator reported the threat to one of the hotel managers. This warning resulted in the discovery of the milk cans in the basement, but by then it was too late.

Begin claimed in his memoirs that the British had deliberately not evacuated, thereby creating a possible opportunity to vilify the Jewish militant groups.

===Leaks and rumours===
Shortly after noon Palestine time, the London UPI bureau received a short message stating that &#x27;Jewish terrorists have just blown up the King David Hotel!&#x27;. The UPI stringer who had sent it, an Irgun member, had wanted to scoop his colleagues. Not knowing that the operation had been postponed by an hour, he sent the message before the operation had been completed. The bureau chief decided against running the story until more details and further confirmation had been obtained. There were other leaks.

==Execution==
The perpetrators met at 7 am at the Beit Aharon Talmud Torah. This was the first time they were informed of the target. The attack used approximately of explosives spread over six charges. According to Begin, due to &quot;consultations&quot; about the cancellation of the attack on the David Brothers Building, the operation was delayed and started at about 12:00, an hour later than planned.

After placing the bombs in the La Regence Cafe, the Irgun men quickly slipped out and detonated a small explosive in the street outside the hotel, reportedly to keep passers-by away from the area. The police report written in the aftermath of the bombing says that this explosion resulted in a higher death toll because it caused spectators from the hotel to gather in its south-west corner, directly over the bomb planted in its basement. The first explosion also caused the presence in the hotel of injured Arabs who were brought into the Secretariat after their bus, which had been passing, was rolled onto its side. The Arab workers in the kitchen fled after being told to do so.

There were two Irgun casualties, Avraham Abramovitz and Itzhak Tsadok. In one Irgun account of the bombing, by Katz, the two were shot during the initial approach to the hotel, when a minor gunfight ensued with two British soldiers who had become suspicious. In Yehuda Lapidot&#x27;s account, the men were shot as they were withdrawing after the attack. The latter agrees with the version of events presented by Bethell and Thurston Clarke. According to Bethell, Abramovitz managed to get to the taxi getaway car along with six other men. Tsadok escaped with the other men on foot. Both were found by the police in the Jewish Old Quarter of Jerusalem the next day, with Abramovitz already dead from his wounds.

==Explosion and aftermath==

The explosion occurred at 12:37. It caused the collapse of the western half of the southern wing of the hotel. Soon after the explosion, rescuers from the Royal Engineers arrived with heavy lifting equipment. Later that night, the sappers were formed into three groups, with each working an eight-hour shift. The rescue operation lasted for the next three days and 2,000 lorry loads of rubble were removed. From the wreckage and rubble the rescuers managed to extract six survivors. The last to be found alive was Assistant Secretary Downing C. Thompson, 31 hours after the explosion, but he died just over a week later.

Ninety-one people were killed, most of them being staff of the hotel or Secretariat: 21 were first-rank government officials, including under-secretary Robert Paus Platt, the most senior official among the victims, and seven assistant secretaries; 49 were second-rank clerks, typists and messengers, junior members of the Secretariat, employees of the hotel and canteen workers; 13 were soldiers; three policemen; and five were bystanders. By nationality, there were 41 Arabs, 28 British citizens, 17 Jews, two Armenians, one Russian, one Greek and one Egyptian. Forty-nine people were injured. Some of the deaths and injuries occurred in the road outside the hotel and in adjacent buildings. The blast threw Postmaster General Gerald Kennedy from the hotel across the street onto a wall of the YMCA building opposite, from which his body had to be scraped off. No identifiable traces were found of thirteen of those killed. Among the dead were Yulius Jacobs, an Irgun sympathizer, and Edward Sperling, a Zionist writer and government official. Immediately after the bombing the Mandate government began planning Operation Shark.

==Reactions==
===British reactions===
The bombing inflamed public opinion in Britain. After the bombing, editorials in British newspapers argued that the bombing deflated statements by the government that it had been winning against the Jewish paramilitaries. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; argued that &quot;British firmness&quot; inside Palestine had brought about more terrorism and worsened the situation in the country, the opposite effect that the government had intended.

Speaker after speaker in the House of Commons expressed outrage. Ex-Prime Minister Winston Churchill, a prominent and enthusiastic supporter of Zionism, criticized the attack. He also related the bombing to the problems within the Mandate system, and he advocated allowing further Jewish immigration into Palestine. Chief Secretary for the Government of Palestine, Sir John Shaw, noted that the majority of the dead had been members of his own personal staff: &quot;British, Arabs, Jews, Greeks, Armenians; senior officers, police, my orderly, my chauffeur, messengers, guards, men and women—young and old—they were my friends.&quot;

British Prime Minister Clement Attlee commented in the House of Commons:
Hon. Members will have learned with horror of the brutal and murderous crime committed yesterday in Jerusalem. Of all the outrages which have occurred in Palestine, and they have been many and horrible in the last few months, this is the worst. By this insane act of terrorism 93 innocent people have been killed or are missing in the ruins. The latest figures of casualties are 41 dead, 52 missing and 53 injured. I have no further information at present beyond what is contained in the following official report received from Jerusalem:

It appears that after exploding a small bomb in the street, presumably as a diversionary measure—this did virtually no damage—a lorry drove up to the tradesmen&#x27;s entrance of the King David Hotel and the occupants, after holding up the staff at pistol point, entered the kitchen premises carrying a number of milk cans. At some stage of the proceedings, they shot and seriously wounded a British soldier who attempted to interfere with them. All available information so far is to the effect that they were Jews. Somewhere in the basement of the hotel they planted bombs which went off shortly afterwards. They appear to have made good their escape.

Every effort is being made to identify and arrest the perpetrators of this outrage. The work of rescue in the debris, which was immediately organised, still continues. The next-of-kin of casualties are being notified by telegram as soon as accurate information is available. The House will wish to express their profound sympathy with the relatives of the killed and with those injured in this dastardly outrage.
In a visit made sometime before the attack, Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, soon to become Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, had told Lieutenant General Sir Evelyn Barker, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, to emphasise to the British servicemen that they were facing a cruel, fanatical and cunning enemy, and there was no way of knowing who was friend and who foe. Since there were female terrorists as well, according to Montgomery, all fraternising with the local population would have to cease. Within a few minutes of the bombing, Barker translated this instruction into an order that &quot;all Jewish places of entertainment, cafes, restaurants, shops and private dwellings&quot; be out of bounds to all ranks. He concluded: &quot;I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, but I am certain that if my reasons are fully explained to them, they will understand their propriety and they will be punishing the Jews in a way the race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them.&quot; The future Israeli diplomat Abba Eban, then an officer in the British Army, leaked the order to the press. Barker&#x27;s wording was interpreted as antisemitic and caused much outrage and bad publicity for the British. Barker was nearly dismissed from his position over the scandal, and only Montgomery&#x27;s threat to resign if Barker was sacked saved him his job.

The attack did not change Britain&#x27;s stance toward an Anglo-American agreement on Palestine, which was then in its concluding phase. In a letter dated 25 July 1946, Prime Minister Attlee wrote to American President Harry S. Truman: &quot;I am sure you will agree that the inhuman crime committed in Jerusalem on 22 July calls for the strongest action against terrorism but having regard to the sufferings of the innocent Jewish victims of Nazism this should not deter us from introducing a policy designed to bring peace to Palestine with the least possible delay.&quot;

===Israeli and Zionist reactions===
The Jewish political leadership publicly condemned the attack. The Jewish Agency expressed &quot;their feelings of horror at the base and unparalleled act perpetrated today by a gang of criminals&quot;. The Jewish National Council denounced the bombing. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;although the Hagana had sanctioned the King David bombing, world-wide condemnation caused the organization to distance itself from the attack&quot;. David Ben-Gurion deemed the Irgun &quot;the enemy of the Jewish people&quot; after the attack. &quot;Hatsofeh&quot;, a Jewish newspaper in Palestine, labelled the Irgun perpetrators &quot;fascists&quot;.

The Irgun issued an initial statement accepting responsibility for the attack, mourning their Jewish victims, and calling into fault the British for what they saw as a failure to respond to the warnings. A year later, on 22 July 1947, they issued a new statement saying that they were acting on instructions from &quot;a letter from the headquarters of the United Resistance, demanding that we carry out an attack on the center of government at the King David Hotel as soon as possible&quot;. The Irgun&#x27;s radio network announced that it would mourn for the Jewish victims, but not the British ones. This was explained by claiming that Britain had not mourned for the millions of Jews who died in the Nazi Holocaust. No remorse was expressed for the largest group of victims, the Arab dead.

Richard Crossman, a British Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), whose experience on the Anglo-American Committee had made him sympathetic to Zionism, visited Chaim Weizmann shortly after the attack. Weizmann&#x27;s ambivalence towards Zionist violence was apparent in the conversation. While condemning it, he also stated that he sympathised with its causes. When the King David Hotel bombing was mentioned, Weizmann started crying: &quot;I can&#x27;t help feeling proud of our boys. If only it had been a German headquarters, they would have gotten the Victoria Cross.&quot;

==Sir John Shaw controversy==
At the time of the explosion, Chief Secretary, Sir John Shaw was in his office, which was in the eastern half of the south wing, rather than the destroyed western half. Jewish militant organisations sought to shift the blame to Shaw for the deaths.

Begin said that Shaw had been responsible for the failure to evacuate the hotel: &quot;A police officer called Shaw and told him, &#x27;The Jews say that they have placed bombs in the King David.&#x27; And the reply was, &#x27;I am here to give orders to the Jews, not to take orders from them.&#x27;&quot; The 1947 Irgun pamphlet &quot;Black Paper&quot; said that Shaw had forbidden anyone to leave the hotel: &quot;For reasons best known to himself Shaw, the Chief Secretary of the Occupation administration, disregarded the warning. That is, he forbade any of the other officials to leave the building, with the result that some of his collaborators were killed, while he himself slunk away until after the explosion. … Shaw thus sent nearly 100 people to their deaths—including Hebrews, including friends of our struggle.&quot; Begin said he had heard the information about Shaw from Israel Galili, Chief of Staff of Haganah, when they met on 23 July, the day after the bombing. In an interview with Bethell, Galili said his source for the Shaw story had been Boris Guriel, the future head of Israel&#x27;s intelligence service, who had heard it in turn from the American Associated Press bureau chief Carter Davidson. Thurston Clarke interviewed both Galili and Guriel, the former in 1977. Guriel denied that he had been the source of the story. Galili was unable to produce any evidence that Shaw had received a warning. Carter Davidson died in 1958 and so could not be asked to confirm or deny what Galili had said. Clarke&#x27;s assessment was that the story about Shaw was, in fact, &quot;a baseless rumour promoted by the Haganah in order to mollify the Irgun and fix responsibility for the carnage on Shaw&quot;. Shmuel Katz, who had been a member of the Irgun&#x27;s high command, later also wrote that &quot;the story can be dismissed&quot;.

In 1948, a libel action was taken out by Shaw against a Jewish London newspaper which repeated the allegations made by Begin and the Irgun pamphlet. The newspaper did not mount a defence and made an unreserved apology to Shaw. About the allegation that he had said that he did not take orders from Jews, Shaw said: &quot;I would never have made a statement like that and I don&#x27;t think that anyone who knows me would regard it as in character. I would never have referred to the Jews in that way&quot;.

Also in 1948, William Ziff, an American author, released a revised edition of his 1938 book &quot;The Rape of Palestine&quot; which contained an embellished version of Galili&#x27;s story, similar to the one given in the &quot;Black Paper&quot; pamphlet. It said that Shaw had escaped from the hotel minutes before the main explosion, abandoning its other occupants to their fate. Shaw took out another libel action against Ziff and his British publisher. After lawyers in Israel failed to find evidence supporting Ziff&#x27;s version of events, the book&#x27;s publishers withdrew it from circulation and apologised to Shaw.

&quot;The Revolt&quot;, Menachem Begin&#x27;s book on the Irgun, which was published in Britain in 1951, made references to a &quot;high official&quot; having received a warning but refusing to evacuate the hotel in time. Shaw, believing this to be a reference to himself, considered suing Begin and his British publisher for libel and consulted with his personal attorney, but was advised against it, on grounds that a reference to a &quot;high official&quot; was insufficient to justify a claim of personal defamation. He instead wrote a letter to the publisher denying the book&#x27;s version of events.

Bethell says that all of the British witnesses who were in the vicinity of the hotel at the time of the explosion confirmed what Shaw said. None of them had any knowledge of a warning having been sent in time to make evacuation of the hotel possible. They said that, like themselves, Shaw had not known about the bomb beforehand and that he bore no responsibility for putting colleagues&#x27; lives at risk immediately before the explosion. The only criticism made was that Shaw should have closed the Régence restaurant and put guards on the service entrance weeks before. Shaw agreed that not having done this was a mistake. The decision not to do it had been made because &quot;everyone was under orders to preserve the semblance of normality in Palestine&quot;, &quot;social life had to be allowed to continue&quot; and because nobody had believed that the Irgun would put the whole of the Secretariat, which had many Jewish employees, in danger.

Two months after the bombing, Shaw was appointed High Commissioner of Trinidad and Tobago. The Irgun immediately sent a letter bomb to him there, but it was intercepted and successfully disarmed.

==Legacy and later reports==
===Locally===
The attack significantly escalated the conflict between Jewish militants and the Mandate government. Early on 30 July 1946, in an effort to capture wanted underground members, &quot;Operation Shark&quot; was launched in Tel Aviv. Four army brigades, comprising about twenty thousand soldiers and police, established a cordon around the city. A historian later described the situation as &quot;looking for a few needles of militants in a haystack 170,000 people deep.&quot; Nearly eight hundred individuals were detained and subsequently sent to the Rafah detention camp.

The attack prompted the British government to impose widely unpopular restrictions on the civil liberties of Jews in Palestine. These measures included random personal searches, random searches of homes, military curfews, roadblocks, and mass arrests. The actions further eroded British public support for the Mandate system and alienated the Jewish populace, aligning with Begin&#x27;s original intent.

Following the bombing, the Irgun and Lehi intensified their campaign, carrying out a series of attacks. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, the bombing marked the end of the united front between the Irgun and other Zionist groups, such as the Haganah. From that point forward, their relationships became more adversarial. Irgun ex-members and sympathizers argue that modern historical accounts in Israel are biased in favor of more established groups like the Haganah.

After the bombing, the hotel complex continued to be used by the British until 4 May 1948. It later served as an Israeli headquarters from the end of the 1947–1949 Palestine war until the Six-Day War. Subsequently, the Israelis reopened the hotel for commercial purposes, and in recent years, it has hosted visiting dignitaries and celebrities.

===Terrorism===
The bombing has been discussed in literature about the practice and history of terrorism. It has been called one of the most lethal terrorist attacks of the 20th century.

Security analyst Bruce Hoffman wrote of the bombing in his 1999 book &quot;Inside Terrorism&quot;:
&quot;Unlike many terrorist groups today, the Irgun&#x27;s strategy was not deliberately to target or wantonly harm civilians. At the same time, though, the claim of Begin and other apologists that warnings were issued cannot absolve either the group or its commander for the ninety-one people killed and forty-five others injured ... Indeed, whatever nonlethal intentions the Irgun might or might not have had, the fact remains that a tragedy of almost unparalleled magnitude was inflicted ... so that to this day the bombing remains one of the world&#x27;s single most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century.&quot;

Enders Walter and Todd Sandler theorized in a 2006 book on the political economy of terrorism that it provided a model for the terrorist bombings of the 1980s. In another 2006 book, Gus Martin wrote that the attack is one of the best historical examples of successful terrorism, it having yielded, according to him, everything that the Irgun had wanted. He went on to compare the aftermath of the bombing to that of Carlos Marighella&#x27;s campaign with the Brazilian Communist Party. Max Abrahms contests the view that the civilian deaths in the King David Hotel expedited British withdrawal from Palestine, stating that the widespread public backlash—including from Jews—combined with a British crackdown &quot;nearly destroyed the Irgun&quot; and &quot;is thus hardly a strong example of terrorism paying&quot;.

The Irgun&#x27;s activities were classed as terrorism by MI5. The Irgun has been viewed as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts. In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain, the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency. Begin argued that terrorists and freedom fighters are differentiated in that terrorists deliberately try to target civilians, and that the Irgun was not guilty of terrorism since it tried to avoid civilian casualties. At the events to mark the 60th anniversary of the attack, Benjamin Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians.

===Army and police reports===
Various British government papers relating to the bombing were released under the thirty year rule in 1978, including the results of the military and police investigations. The reports contain statements and conclusions contradicted by other evidence, including that submitted to the inquest held after the bombing. Affidavits reflecting badly on the security of the hotel were removed from the army report before it was submitted to the High Commissioner and then the Cabinet in London.

The police report makes the claim that the warning sent to the French Consulate was received five minutes after the main explosion. This is contradicted by multiple eyewitnesses who reported seeing staff opening the Consulate windows five minutes before it. The report also claims that the warning received by the &quot;Palestine Post&quot; was not received until after the explosion. That claim is supported in the report by the testimony of two members of the &quot;Palestine Post&quot; staff, one of whom said that she was put under pressure by the Palestine Police to withdraw her statements she had made in her account.

===60th anniversary controversy===
In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun. A plaque commemorating the bombing reads: &quot;For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated.&quot; The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying &quot;We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated&quot;, and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an act of terror could not be honoured, even if it was preceded by a warning. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, stating that the statement accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and &quot;did not absolve those who planted the bomb&quot;.
To prevent a diplomatic incident, and over the objections of Knesset member Reuven Rivlin (Likud), who raised the matter in the Knesset, changes were made in the plaque&#x27;s text, though to a greater degree in English than the Hebrew version. The final English version reads: &quot;Warning phone calls has been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel&#x27;s occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun&#x27;s regret, 92 persons were killed.&quot; The death toll given includes Avraham Abramovitz, the Irgun member who was shot during the attack and died later from his wounds, but only the Hebrew version of the sign makes that clear. The Hebrew version has words which translate as &quot;including an Irgun man who was killed in a shootout which happened there&quot; () at the end.

<doc id="105925" wikidata="Q3129796" url="?curid=105925" title="Valley girl">
<text>A valley girl is a socioeconomic, linguistic, and youth subcultural stereotype and stock character originating during the 1980s: any materialistic upper-middle-class young woman, associated with unique vocal and California dialect features, from the Los Angeles commuter communities of the San Fernando Valley. In subsequent years, the term was broadly applied to any American woman who epitomized frivolity, , , or who prioritizes superficial concerns such as personal appearance, physical attractiveness, and excessive materialism over intellectual or personal accomplishment.

==Valleyspeak==
Valleyspeak, or Valspeak, is a California English social dialect and accompanying vocal features, best associated with valley girls, though elements of it have spread to other demographics, including men called &quot;Val dudes&quot;. This sociolect became an international fad for a certain period in the 1980s and 1990s, with a peak period from around 1981 to 1985. Valleyspeak is popularly characterized by both the steady use of uptalk and its vocabulary.

=== Language ideology ===

This lends itself to explicit language ideologies about dialects in the area as they receive more scrutiny than dialects in other nearby regions. Linguistic characteristics of valleyspeak are often thought to be &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot; and seen as a sign of low intelligence. Speakers are also often perceived as &quot;materialistic&quot; and &quot;air-headed&quot;. The use of &quot;like&quot; or the quotative phrase &quot;be like&quot; are often ideologically linked to California and Valleyspeak despite the now-widespread use of the terms among youth, which results in their also receiving the &quot;superficial&quot; cast. In the national understanding, California speech is thought to be a product of the combination of Valley girl and surfer dude speech, and &quot;is associated with good English, but never proper&quot;.

A study on regional language ideologies done in California in 2007 found that, despite its prevalence and association with California in past decades, Californians themselves do not consider &quot;Valley girls&quot; to be an overly prevalent social or linguistic group within the state. State residents listed factors such as immigrant populations and north–south regional slang as more relevant than Valleyspeak within the state.

Amanda Ritchart, a doctoral candidate studying linguistics at the University of California, San Diego, analyzed 23-year-olds (college age students) from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities, specifically in the Southern California region. After this study, Ritchart once stated, &quot;Women used uptalk more frequently than men did. Their pitch rose higher overall, and the rise began much later in the phrase.&quot; Even though the gender difference is notable, the majority of both men and women speak in uptalk in Southern California. In fact, 100% of the participants used uptalk when they asked a confirming question, such as &quot;Go all the way to the right in the middle where it says Canyon Hills?&quot;

According to the article &quot;What&#x27;s Up With Upspeak?&quot;, when women use Valleyspeak, it is assumed that they have &quot;inferior speech&quot; patterns. For men, the high rise of intonation usually &quot;plateaued&quot; at certain points, especially in situations where they didn&#x27;t want to be interrupted.

=== Features and qualifiers ===
The sound of Valleyspeak has these main habits: nasal sound; fast-paced run-on sentences; breathiness; uptalk, or the sound of a question; and vocal fry.
* High rising terminal (also called &quot;up speak&quot; or &quot;uptalk&quot;) is a defining feature of Valleyspeak. Statements have a rising intonation, causing declarative language to appear interrogative to listeners unfamiliar with the dialect. Research on uptalk has found a number of pragmatic uses, including confirming that the interlocutor follows what is being said and indicating that the speaker has more to say and so their conversation partner should not interrupt them (also called &quot;floor holding&quot;). Another use is as a confirmation statement of general agreement, such as &quot;I know, right?&quot; or simply &quot;right?&quot;. The difference between the intonation of a question, confirmation statements, and floor holding is determined by the extent of the rise and its location within the phrase. The high rising terminal feature has spread and been adopted outside the geographical area and groups originally associated with Valleyspeak including, in some cases, men. (However, in some varieties of English, usage of high rising terminal emerged independently and/or has been documented as preceding Valleyspeak by decades, such as in Australian English and New Zealand English.)
* &quot;Like&quot; as a discourse marker. &quot;Like&quot; is used as a filler word, similar to &quot;um&quot; or &quot;er&quot;, as in, &quot;I&#x27;m, like, totally about to blow chunks.&quot; When &quot;like&quot; is functioning as a discourse marker, the word itself does not semantically change the phrase or sentence. Instead, it provides time for the speaker to formulate what they will say next. The word is always unstressed when used in this way. It is important to note that &quot;like&quot; does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: &quot;It was like 8 feet deep&quot; and &quot;I think that, like, it is entertaining.&quot; Even though both sentences contain the word &quot;like,&quot; they employ it differently. In the former, &quot;like&quot; serves as an adverb that is synonymous with &quot;approximately&quot;, whereas the latter &quot;like&quot; is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence. Furthermore, &quot;like&quot; is frequently used to introduce quoted speech. For example, a person can recount a conversation by stating, &quot;So, um, I&#x27;m like &#x27;Where did he go?&#x27; and she was um, like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t seen him.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;To be like&quot; as a colloquial quotative. &quot;Like&quot; (always unstressed) is used to indicate that what follows is not necessarily an exact quotation of what was said, but captures the meaning and intention of the quoted speech. As an example, in &quot;And I was like, &#x27;don&#x27;t ever speak to my boyfriend again&#x27;&quot;, the speaker is indicating that they may or may not have literally said those words, but they conveyed that idea. &quot;Be like&quot; can introduce both a monologue or direct speech, allowing a speaker to express an attitude, reaction, or thought, or to use the phrase to signal quotation.
* Particular slang terms, including &quot;to be all&quot; or &quot;to be all like&quot; used in the same manner as &quot;to be like&quot;, &quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;as if&quot; used to express any disbelief, &quot;totally&quot; meaning &quot;quite&quot; or &quot;very&quot;, &quot;seriously&quot; as a frequent interjection of approval or an inquiry of veracity, &quot;bitchin&#x27;&quot; meaning &quot;excellent&quot;, and &quot;grody&quot; meaning &quot;dirty&quot;.
*Vocal fry is characterized by &quot;low, creaky vibrations&quot; or a &quot;guttural vibration&quot;. Researchers have studied two qualities of this speech pattern, such as the &quot;jitter&quot; (variation in pitch) and &quot;shimmer&quot; (variation in volume). When women tend to speak with these mannerisms, they are perceived as less competent, less hirable, less trustworthy, or less educated. A prominent example is Kim Kardashian.

==In popular culture==
* Laraine Newman is often credited with the introduction of the &quot;Valley Girl Accent&quot; after her portrayal of her original character Sherry on Saturday Night Live starting in 1975.
* In Los Angeles, &quot;vals&quot; (inhabitants of &quot;the Valley&quot;) were derided for their perceived other-ness in the late 1970s. Valspeak and the term &quot;Valley Girl&quot; received wider attention with the release of the 1982 hit single &quot;Valley Girl&quot; by Frank Zappa, on which his fourteen-year-old daughter Moon delivered a monologue in &quot;Valleyspeak&quot; behind the music. This song popularized phrases such as &quot; to the max&quot; and &quot;&quot; as well as the use of the term &quot;like&quot;, which did not originate in Valleyspeak, as a discourse marker. Zappa intended to lampoon the image, but after the song&#x27;s release there was a significant increase in the &quot;Valspeak&quot; slang usage, whether ironically spoken or not. Moon herself portrayed a Valley Girl in the episode &quot;Speedway Fever&quot;, the fifth episode of the sixth season of the TV series &quot;CHiPs&quot;.
* An early appearance of Valleyspeak and the Valley Girl stereotype was through the character of Jennifer DiNuccio, played by Tracy Nelson in the 1982–1983 sitcom &quot;Square Pegs&quot;. According to an interview with Nelson included on the 2008 DVD release of the series, she developed the character&#x27;s Valleyspeak and personality prior to the Zappa recording becoming popular.
* The 1983 film &quot;Valley Girl&quot; starring Nicolas Cage and Deborah Foreman centered on a group of &quot;Valley Girl&quot; characters and featured several characterizations associated with their lifestyle (such as going shopping at the mall or &quot;Galleria&quot;, suntanning at the beach, and going to parties).
* In the 1990s TV series UPN Network &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; Based on the book series by Francine Pascal, this series revolves around the lives of the Wakefield twins and their friends as they attend High School in Sweet Valley, California a fictitious suburb of Los Angeles. In the song Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-lot’s prelude there is a conversation between two (presumably) thin, white valley girls, similar to girl talk in Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Valley Girl&quot;. One girl (dubbed Linda by Amylia Dorsey)[5] remarks to her friend, &quot;Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt! It is so big... She&#x27;s just so black!&quot;, at which point Sir Mix-a-Lot begins rapping and animated TV series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, Shirley the Loon, an anthropomorphic waterfowl, speaks with a thick valley girl accent and is quite smart but also obsessed with New Age paraphernalia and also seems to have some magic abilities. She appears not to notice the other meaning of her surname as she often recites &quot;oh, what a loon i am&quot; while meditating.
* Cher Horowitz, the protagonist of the 1995 film &quot;Clueless&quot;, played by Alicia Silverstone, has been described as a caricature of 1990s Valley Girls, though she is actually from nearby Beverly Hills and even before making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, was somewhat altruistic.
* On the 1990s television series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; the character of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, played by Alexandra Tydings, speaks with a heavy Valley Girl accent, despite the anachronism of the series taking place in Ancient Greece. She also has an obsession with material possessions and her own physical attractiveness.
* In the recurring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;The Californians&quot;, the characters speak with wildly exaggerated valley accents.
* American Girl doll Courtney Moore, a historical character from 1986, has an older stepsister named Tina D&#x27;Amico, who is often referred to as a valley girl by doll collectors, despite Tina herself not yet becoming an official doll. Tina and Courtney live in Orange Valley, a fictional version of Los Angeles.
* In her 2015 memoir entitled &quot;Wildflower&quot;, actress Drew Barrymore says she talks &quot;like a Valley girl&quot; because she lived in Sherman Oaks from the age of 7 to 14.
* The &quot;influencer speak&quot; or &quot;TikTok voice&quot; accent prominent on digital platforms such as TikTok is believed to originate from the valley girl accent.

<doc id="105927" wikidata="Q46280" url="?curid=105927" title="Charles de Gaulle Airport">
<text>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport , also known as Roissy Airport, is the primary international airport serving Paris, the capital city of France. The airport opened in 1974 and is located in Roissy-en-France, northeast of Paris. It is named for World War II leader and French President Charles de Gaulle (1890–1970), whose initials form its IATA airport code.

Charles de Gaulle Airport serves as the principal hub for Air France and a destination for other legacy carriers (from Star Alliance, Oneworld and SkyTeam), as well as an operating base for easyJet and Norse Atlantic Airways. It is operated by Groupe ADP (Aéroports de Paris) under the brand Paris Aéroport.

In 2024, the airport handled 70,290,260 passengers and 460,916 aircraft movements, thus making it the world&#x27;s ninth busiest airport and Europe&#x27;s third busiest airport (after Istanbul and Heathrow) in terms of passenger numbers. Charles de Gaulle is also the busiest airport within the European Union. In terms of cargo traffic, the airport is the eleventh busiest in the world and the busiest in Europe, handling of cargo in 2019. It is also the airport that is served by the greatest number of airlines, with more than 105 airlines operating at the airport.

, the airport offered direct flights to the most countries and hosts the most airlines in the world. Marc Houalla has been the director of the airport since 12 February 2018.

== Location ==
Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport covers of land. The airport area, including terminals and runways, spans over three &quot;départements&quot; and six &quot;communes&quot;:
* Seine-et-Marne &quot;département&quot;: Le Mesnil-Amelot (Terminal 2E, Satellites S3 and S4, and Terminal 2F), Mauregard (Terminals 1, 3), and Mitry-Mory (Terminal 2G) &quot;communes&quot;;
* Seine-Saint-Denis &quot;département&quot;: Tremblay-en-France (Terminals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and Roissypôle) &quot;commune&quot;;
* Val-d&#x27;Oise &quot;département&quot;: Roissy-en-France and Épiais-lès-Louvres &quot;communes&quot;.

The choice of constructing an international aviation hub outside of central Paris was made due to a limited prospect of potential relocations or expropriations and the possibility of further expanding the airport in the future.

Management of the airport lies solely on the authority of &quot;Groupe ADP&quot;, which also manages Orly (south of Paris), Le Bourget (to the immediate southwest of Charles de Gaulle Airport, now used for general aviation and Paris Air Shows), several smaller airfields in the suburbs of Paris, and other airports directly or indirectly worldwide.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The planning and construction phase of what was known then as &quot;Aéroport de Paris Nord&quot; (Paris North Airport) began in 1966. On 8 March 1974 the airport, renamed Charles de Gaulle Airport, opened. Terminal 1 was built in an avant-garde design of a ten-floors-high circular building surrounded by seven satellite buildings, each with six gates allowing sunlight to enter through apertures. The main architect was Paul Andreu, who was also in charge of the extensions during the following decades.

Terminal 2 opened in 1981 with the official inauguration in presence of the then President, Francois Mitterrand, in March 1982. Unlike Terminal 1, Terminal 2 was designed with a traditional linear layout, but has evolved over time into a series of distinct terminals, designated as 2A through to 2G.

Following the introduction of the brand Paris Aéroport to all its Parisian airports, Groupe ADP also announced major changes for the Charles de Gaulle Airport: Terminals of the Satellite 1 were to be merged, as well as terminals 2B and 2D. A new luggage automated sorting system and conveyor under Terminal 2E Hall L was installed to speed luggage delivery time. The CDG Express, the direct express rail link from Paris to Charles de Gaulle Airport, is scheduled to open in early 2027.

=== Corporate identity ===
The Frutiger typeface was commissioned for use in the airport and implemented on signs throughout the building in 1975. Initially called &quot;Roissy&quot;, it was renamed after its designer Adrian Frutiger.

Until 2005, every PA announcement made at Terminal 1 was preceded by a distinctive chime, nicknamed &quot;Indicatif Roissy&quot; and composed by Bernard Parmegiani in 1971. The chime can be heard in the Roman Polanski film &quot;Frantic&quot;. The chime was officially replaced by the &quot;Indicatif ADP&quot; chime.

On 14 April 2016, the Groupe ADP rolled out the &quot;Connect 2020&quot; corporate strategy and the commercial brand Paris Aéroport was applied to all Parisian airports, including Le Bourget airport.

== Terminals ==

Charles de Gaulle Airport has three terminals: Terminal 1 is the oldest and situated opposite to Terminal 3; Terminal 2 is located at another side with 7 sub-terminal buildings (2A to 2G). Terminal 2 was originally built exclusively for Air France; since then it has been expanded significantly and now houses other airlines. Terminals 2A to 2F are interconnected by elevated walkways and situated next to each other. Terminal 2G is a satellite building connected by shuttle bus.

Terminal 3 (formerly known as &quot;Terminal 9&quot;) hosts charter and low-cost airlines. The CDGVAL light-rail shuttle connects Terminal 2 to Terminals 1 and 3 and their parking lots.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Charles de Gaulle Airport had assigned all Star Alliance members to use Terminal 1, Oneworld members to use Terminal 2A and SkyTeam members to use Terminals 2C, 2E (intercontinental), 2D, 2F and 2G (European routes). The assignments changed several times due to the pandemic.

Today, the airport has assigned Star Alliance airlines to Terminal 1, Oneworld airlines to use Terminal 1 for routes to the Middle East and Asia, and 2B for flights to the Americas, Africa, and Europe (due to the closure of Terminal 2A), and SkyTeam airlines to use Terminals 2E for international routes and 2F for Schengen routes.

=== Terminal 1 ===
The first terminal, designed by Paul Andreu, was built in the image of an octopus. It consists of a circular terminal building which houses key functions such as check-in counters and baggage claim conveyors. Seven satellites with boarding gates are connected to the central building by underground walkways.

The central building, with a large skylight in its centre, dedicates each floor to a single function. The first floor is reserved for technical operations and not accessible to the public. The second floor contains shops and restaurants, the CDGVAL inter-terminal shuttle train platforms (for Terminal 2 and trains to central Paris) and check-in counters from a recent renovation. The majority of check-in counters, however, are located on the third floor, which also has access to taxi stands, bus stops and special pick-up vehicles. Departing passengers with valid boarding passes can reach the fourth floor, which houses duty-free stores and border control posts, for the boarding gates. The fifth floor contains baggage claim conveyors for arriving passengers. All four upper floors have assigned areas for parking and airline offices.

Passages between the third, fourth and fifth floors are provided by a tangle of escalators arranged through the centre of the building. These escalators are suspended over the central court. Each escalator is covered with a transparent tube to shelter from all weather conditions. These escalators were often used in film shootings (e.g., &quot;The Last Gang of Ariel Zeitoun&quot;). The Alan Parsons Project album &quot;I Robot&quot; features these escalators on its cover.

Terminal 1 closed in March 2020 in response to the drop in traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. ADP used this time for a €250 million refurbishment. Completed in 2023, the refurbishment included the creation of a new junction building linking satellites 1, 2 and 3, and modernisation of the central body of the terminal. Various design details in the refurbished terminal pay homage to the circular shape of the original Andreu design. The upgraded Terminal 2 also features a new departure lounge designed by French designers Maxime Liautard and Hugo Toro, which reflects the ambiance of a Parisian bistro.

Star Alliance airlines use Terminal 1 except Air Canada and Ethiopian Airlines Other carriers using Terminal 1 include Oneworld carriers Cathay Pacific, Qatar Airways and SriLankan Airlines and non-aligned carriers Aer Lingus, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Eurowings, Icelandair, Kuwait Airways and Oman Air.

=== Terminal 2 ===
Terminal 2 is spread across seven sub-terminals: 2A to 2G. Terminals 2A to 2F are connected by inter-terminal walkways, but Terminal 2G is a satellite building away. Terminal 2G can only be accessed by shuttle bus from Terminals 1, 2A to 2F and 3. The CDGVAL inter-terminal shuttle train, Paris RER Regional-Express and high-speed TGV rail station, Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV, is located within the Terminal 2 complex and between 2C and 2E (on one side) or 2D and 2F (on the opposite side).

Terminal 2F was used for the filming of the music video for the U2 song &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;. The band also had their picture taken inside Terminal 2F for the album artwork of their 2000 album &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;.

Terminals 2B and 2D are used by the majority of the airlines part of the Oneworld alliance, except Oneworld&#x27;s long haul carriers to Asia and the Middle East, French overseas airlines Air Austral and Air Tahiti Nui, and all other non SkyTeam short-haul and mid-haul airlines which do not operate from Terminal 1. and SkyTeam carrier Czech Airlines also use this terminal.

Terminals 2E and 2F are dedicated use for Air France and its SkyTeam partners except Czech Airlines (Terminal 2D) and Saudia (Terminal 1). Several other carriers also use Terminal 2E, these are Oneworld carrier Japan Airlines and non-aligned carriers Air Mauritius, China Southern Airlines, Gulf Air, LATAM Chile, and WestJet.

==== Collapse of Terminal 2E ====
On 23 May 2004, shortly after the inauguration of terminal 2E, a portion of it collapsed near Gate E50, killing four people. Two of the dead were reported to be Chinese citizens, one Czech and the other Lebanese. Three other people were injured in the collapse. Terminal 2E had been inaugurated in 2003 after some delays in construction and was designed by Paul Andreu. Administrative and judicial enquiries were started.

Before this accident, ADP had been planning for an initial public offering in 2005 with the new terminal as a major attraction for investors. The partial collapse and indefinite closing of the terminal just before the beginning of summer seriously hurt the airport&#x27;s business plan.

In February 2005, the results from the administrative inquiry were published. The experts pointed out that there was no single fault, but rather a number of causes for the collapse, in a design that had little margin for safety. The inquiry found the concrete vaulted roof was not resilient enough and had been pierced by metallic pillars and some openings weakened the structure. Sources close to the inquiry also disclosed that the whole building chain had worked as close to the limits as possible, so as to reduce costs. Paul Andreu denounced the building companies for having not correctly prepared the reinforced concrete.

On 17 March 2005, ADP decided to tear down and rebuild the whole part of Terminal 2E (the &quot;jetty&quot;) of which a section had collapsed, at a cost of approximately €100 million. The reconstruction replaced the innovative concrete tube style of the jetty with a more traditional steel and glass structure. During reconstruction, two temporary departure lounges were constructed in the vicinity of the terminal that replicated the capacity of 2E before the collapse. The terminal reopened completely on 30 March 2008.

==== Terminal 2G ====
Terminal 2G, dedicated to regional Air France and HOP! flights and its affiliates, opened in 2008. This terminal is to the east of all terminals and can only be reached by shuttle bus. Terminal 2G is used for passengers flying in the Schengen Area (and thus has no passport control) and handles Air France regional and European traffic and provides small-capacity planes (up to 150 passengers) with a faster turnaround time than is currently possible by enabling them to park close to the new terminal building and boarding passengers primarily by bus, or walking. A bus line called &quot;navette orange&quot; connects the terminal 2G inside the security check area with terminals 2E and 2F. Passengers transferring to other terminals need to continue their trip with other bus shuttles within the security check area if they do not need to get their bags.

==== Terminal 2E Hall L (Satellite 3) ====
The completion of long Satellite 3 (or S3) to the immediate east of Terminals 2E and 2F provides further jetways for large-capacity airliners, specifically the Airbus A380. Check-in and baggage handling are provided by the existing infrastructure in Terminals 2E and 2F. Satellite 3 was opened in part on 27 June 2007 and fully operational in September 2007. It corresponds now to gates L of terminal 2E.

==== Terminal 2E Hall M (Satellite 4) ====
The satellite S4, adjacent to the S3 and part of terminal 2E, officially opened on 28 June 2012. It corresponds now to gates M of terminal 2E. Dedicated to long-haul flights, it has the ability to handle 16 aircraft at the same time, with an expected capacity of 7.8 million passengers per year. Its opening has led to the relocation of all SkyTeam airlines to terminals 2E (for international carriers), 2F (for Schengen European carriers) and 2G.

==== Recent terminal reassignments ====
Air France has moved all of its operations previously located at 2C to 2E. In October 2012, 2F closed its international operations and became completely Schengen, allowing for all Air France flights previously operating in 2D to relocate to 2F.

Further, in April 2013, Terminal 2B closed for a complete renovation (with all airlines relocating to 2D) and received upgrades including the addition of a second floor completely dedicated to arrivals. Terminal 2B reopened on 2 June 2021. Airlines including the Lufthansa group, Aegean Airlines, easyJet, Icelandair, LOT Polish Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Play, Royal Air Maroc, and Scandinavian Airlines began operations at Terminal 2B until 2 December 2022, when the airlines except easyJet and Royal Air Maroc moved back to Terminal 1. Low-cost carrier easyJet has shown interest in being the sole carrier at 2B. To facilitate connections, a new boarding area between 2A and 2C was opened in March 2012. It allows for all security and passport control to be handled in a single area, allows for many new shopping opportunities as well as new airline lounges, and eases transfer restrictions between 2A and 2C. Terminal 2D was closed during the pandemic and received the same upgrade including an additional floor. Terminal 2D reopened on 18 April 2023 and some airlines have moved operations to the terminal.

Terminals 2A and 2C are closed for baggage renovation system for 18 months (with all airlines relocating to Terminal 1 or 2B).

=== Terminal 3 ===
Terminal 3 is located 1 km (0.62 mi) away from Terminal 1. It consists of one single building for arrivals and departures. The walking distance between Terminals 1 and 3 is ; however, the rail station (named as &quot;CDG Airport Terminal 1&quot;) for RER and CDGVAL trains are only at a distance of . Terminal 3 has no boarding gates constructed and all passengers are ferried by airport buses to the aircraft stands.

Terminal 3 is voted 2024 best low-cost airlines terminal in the world by Skytrax. 

=== Terminal usage during COVID-19 pandemic===
The airport&#x27;s services during the pandemic were sharply reduced. On 30 March 2020, the airport announced it would temporarily close Terminals 1 and 3, moving all remaining flights to Terminal 2. Terminal 2D was also closed during the pandemic and only Terminals 2A, 2C, 2E, 2F and 2G were opened. At the beginning of the pandemic, airlines were grouped by alliances: Star Alliance airlines operated at Terminal 2A, where Air Canada and Ethiopian Airlines operated prior to the pandemic, Oneworld airlines shifted their operations to Terminal 2C, and SkyTeam airlines operated at Terminals 2E and 2F. Between December 2020 and June 2021, only Terminals 2E and 2F were opened with non-Schengen flights operating at Terminal 2E and Schengen flights operated at Terminal 2F. 2B reopened on 2 June 2021 and some airlines were shifted to that concourse. Terminals 2A, 2C and 2D were then reopened for more space. Between June 2021 and December 2022, Star Alliance airlines operated at Terminals 2A (non-Schengen) and 2B (Schengen), Oneworld airlines operated at Terminals 2C (non-Schengen) and 2D (Schengen) and SkyTeam airlines operated at Terminals 2E (non-Schengen), 2F and 2G (both Schengen). However, Star Alliance airlines flights to Asia except Singapore Airlines, who operated at Terminal 2A were operating at Terminal 2E due to the capacity restrictions at Terminal 2A. Terminal 3 reopened on 3 May 2022 for the use of all charter and low cost airlines. Terminal 1 remained closed for renovation at that time. It reopened on 1 December 2022 to reduce traffic at Terminal 2.

=== Cancelled project for Terminal 4 ===
Plans for a new terminal, Terminal 4, were first announced in 2014. With an estimated cost of €9bn, the new terminal was to be built around 2025, when Charles de Gaulle Airport&#x27;s maximum capacity of 80 million would have been reached. When constructed, the new terminal would have been able to accommodate 30–40 million passengers per year and would have likely been built north of Terminal 2E. However, the Terminal 4 proposal was cancelled in 2021 due to reduced traffic resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and new environmental regulations making the project unfeasible. Environmentalist groups hailed the cancellation of the project as a &quot;great victory.&quot;

== Roissypôle ==
Roissypôle is a complex consisting of office buildings, shopping areas, hotels, and a bus coach and RER B station within Charles de Gaulle Airport. The complex includes the head office of Air France, Continental Square, the Hilton Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, and le Dôme building. Le Dôme includes the head office of Air France Consulting, an Air France subsidiary. Continental Square has the head office of Air France subsidiary Servair and the Air France Vaccinations Centre.
== Airlines and destinations ==

=== Passenger ===

=== Cargo ===
== Ground transportation ==

=== CDGVAL ===

The airport&#x27;s terminals are served by a free automated shuttle rail system, consisting of two lines (CDGVAL and LISA).

CDGVAL (&quot;Charles de Gaulle Véhicule Automatique Léger&quot;, English: &quot;Charles de Gaulle light automatic vehicle&quot;) links Terminal 1, parking lot PR, Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 RER station (located inside Roissypôle and next to Terminal 3), Parking lot PX, and the Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV and RER station located between Terminals 2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F

LISA (&quot;Liaison Interne Satellite Aérogare&quot;, English: &quot;Connection internal satellite terminal)&quot; links Terminal 2E to the Satellite S3 (L Gates) and Satellite S4 (M Gates).

=== RER ===
Charles de Gaulle Airport is connected to central Paris by the RER B, a hybrid suburban commuter and rapid transit line. The service has two stations on the airport grounds:

* Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 station, located inside Roissypôle and next to Terminal 3. The station provides the fastest access to Terminal 1 via a connection on CDGVAL.
* Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV station, located between Terminals 2C, 2D, 2E, and 2F.

During most times, there are two types of services that operate on the RER B between Charles de Gaulle airport and Paris:
* 4 trains per hour making all stops between Charles de Gaulle airport and Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse
* 4 trains per hour that offer non-stop express service between Charles de Gaulle airport, Aulnay-sous-Bois, and Gare du Nord, and then all stops to Massy–Palaiseau

The RER B has historically suffered from slowness and overcrowding, so French authorities are building CDG Express, a train service that will operate non-stop from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Paris Gare de l&#x27;Est railway station (next to Gare du Nord) starting in 2027. It will share some of the same tracks, and is expected to offer a 20-minute non-stop ride every half hour from 5am to midnight. The new line is expected to take airline customers off RER B, making room for local passengers, and divert to rail 15% of automobile trips to the airport.

=== TGV ===
Terminal 2 includes a TGV station on the LGV Interconnexion Est line. TGV inOui, Ouigo and Thalys high-speed services operate from the station offering services to stations across France and into Belgium and the Netherlands.

=== Bus ===
* Roissybus offers non-stop express service between Opéra station of the Paris Métro and Charles de Gaulle airport, making stops at all terminals (except 2G).
*&quot;Magical Shuttle&quot; offers non-stop express service between Disneyland Paris and Charles de Gaulle airport, making stops at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2E/2F.
*RATP bus 350 offers local (all-stops) service between Gare de l&#x27;Est/Gare du Nord in Paris and Charles de Gaulle airport, all terminals (except 2G) and other areas of the airport.
*RATP bus 351 offers local service between Nation station in Paris, Gallieni station, all terminals (except 2G) and other areas of the airport.
*Noctilien routes N140 and N143 offers local service during the overnight hours between Gare de l&#x27;Est/Gare du Nord in Paris and Charles de Gaulle airport, all terminals (except 2G) and other areas of the airport.

=== Long-distance bus ===
BlaBlaBus and Flixbus all offer services to international and domestic destinations from the bus station outside of the Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 RER station.

=== Car ===
Charles de Gaulle Airport is directly connected to Autoroute A1 which connects Paris and Lille.

== Alternative airports ==
The two other airports serving Paris are Orly Airport (south of Paris, the other major airport in Paris) and Paris-Le Bourget Airport (north-northeast of Paris, for general aviation and private jets).

Several low-cost airlines also advertise Beauvais–Tillé Airport and Châlons Vatry Airport, respectively and from Paris proper, as serving &quot;Paris&quot; with &quot;Paris–Beauvais&quot; and &quot;Paris–Vatry&quot;. Beauvais airport has no railway connections, but there is a shuttle bus to central Paris 15 times daily.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 6 January 1993, Lufthansa Flight 5634 from Bremen to Paris, which was carried out under the Lufthansa CityLine brand using a Contact Air Dash 8–300 (registered D-BEAT), hit the ground short of the runway of Charles de Gaulle Airport, resulting in the death of four out of the 23 passengers on board. The four crew members survived. The accident occurred after the pilot had to abort the final approach to the airport because the runway had been closed: the aircraft immediately ahead, a Korean Air Boeing 747, had suffered a blown tire upon landing.
* On 25 May 2000, a freight-carrying Short SH36 (operated as Streamline flight 200), departing to Luton, England, collided on the runway with departing Air Liberté Flight 8807, an MD-83 jet. The first officer of the SH36 was killed when the wing tip of the MD-83 tore through his side of the flight deck. The captain was slightly injured and all others aboard survived.
* On 25 July 2000, a Concorde, Air France Flight 4590 from Charles de Gaulle to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, crashed into Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse, killing all 109 people on the aircraft and four people on the ground. Investigations concluded that a tire burst during take-off roll, after running over a metal strip on the runway that had detached from a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 operating as Continental Airlines Flight 55, which departed shortly before, leading to a ruptured fuel tank and resulting in engine failure and other damage. Concorde was conducting a charter flight for a German tour company.

<doc id="105931" wikidata="Q106077" url="?curid=105931" title="Lady Godiva">
<text>Lady Godiva (; died between 1066 and 1086), in Old English , was a late Anglo-Saxon noblewoman who is relatively well documented as the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and a patron of various churches and monasteries.

Today, she is mainly remembered for a legend dating back to at least the 13th century, in which she rode naked – covered only by her long hair – through the streets of Coventry to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation that her husband, Leofric, imposed on his tenants. The name &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; for a voyeur originates from later versions of this legend, in which a man named Thomas watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.

== Historical figure ==
Godiva was the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. They had nine children; one son was Ælfgar. Godiva&#x27;s name occurs in charters and the Domesday survey, though the spelling varies. The Old English name or meant &quot;gift of God&quot;; &#x27;Godiva&#x27; was the name&#x27;s Latinised form. Since the name was a popular one, there are contemporaries of the same name.

A woman named Godiva was recorded in the 12th century history (called &quot;&quot;) of Ely Abbey. If that &quot;Godiva&quot; were the same person as [the &quot;legendary figure&quot;] &#x27;Lady Godiva&#x27;, then she would have been a widow when Leofric married her. Both Leofric and Godiva were generous benefactors to religious houses. In 1043, Leofric founded and endowed a Benedictine monastery at Coventry on the site of a nunnery destroyed by the Danes in 1016. Writing in the 13th century, Roger of Wendover credits Godiva as the persuasive force behind this act of generosity. In the 1050s, her name is coupled with that of her husband on a grant of land to the monastery of St. Mary, Worcester, and the endowment of the minster at Stow St Mary, Lincolnshire. She and her husband are commemorated as benefactors of other monasteries at Leominster, Chester, Much Wenlock, and Evesham. She gave Coventry a number of works in precious metal by the famous goldsmith Mannig and bequeathed a necklace valued at 100 marks of silver. Another necklace went to Evesham, to be hung around the figure of the Virgin Mary accompanying the life-size gold and silver rood she and her husband had donated, and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London received a gold-fringed chasuble. Both Godiva and her husband were among the most munificent of the several large Anglo-Saxon donors of the last decades before the Norman Conquest; the early Norman bishops made short work of their gifts, carrying them off to Normandy or melting them down for bullion. Nevertheless, the memory of Godiva and Leofric survived during the Norman reign and in 1122 their names were commemorated in the mortuary roll of Saint Vitalis of Savigny.

The manor of Woolhope in Herefordshire, along with four others, was given to the cathedral at Hereford before the Norman Conquest by the benefactresses Wulviva and Godiva—usually held to be the Godiva of legend and her sister. The church there has a 20th-century stained glass window representing them.

Her signature, (&quot;I, The Countess Godiva, have desired this for a long time&quot;), appears on a charter purportedly given by Thorold of Bucknall to the Benedictine monastery of Spalding. However, this charter is considered spurious by many historians. Even so, it is possible that Thorold, who appears in the Domesday Book as sheriff of Lincolnshire, was her brother.

After Leofric&#x27;s death in 1057, his widow lived on until her mid-fifties and died sometime between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and 1086. She is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of the few Anglo-Saxons and the only woman to remain a major landholder shortly after the conquest. By the time of this great survey in 1086, Godiva had died and her former lands are listed as held by others.

The place where Godiva was buried has been a matter of debate. According to the , or &quot;Evesham Chronicle&quot;, she was buried at the Church of the Blessed Trinity at Evesham, which is no longer standing. According to the account in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;There is no reason to doubt that she was buried with her husband at Coventry, despite the assertion of the Evesham chronicle that she lay in Holy Trinity, Evesham.&quot; Her husband was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Priory and Cathedral in 1057.

According to William of Malmesbury&#x27;s , Godiva directed in her will that a &quot;circlet of precious stones which she had threaded on a cord in order that by fingering them one after another she might count her prayers exactly were to be placed on a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary,&quot; the oldest known textual reference to the use of a Rosary-like string of prayer-beads.

William Dugdale (1656) stated that a window with representations of Leofric and Godiva was placed in Trinity Church, Coventry, about the time of Richard II.

== Legend ==
The legend of the nude ride is first recorded in the 13th century, in the and the adaptation of it by Roger of Wendover. Despite its considerable age, it is not regarded as plausible by modern historians, nor is it mentioned in the two centuries after Godiva&#x27;s death, whereas her generous donations to the church receive various mentions.
According to the typical version of the story, Lady Godiva took pity on the people of Coventry, who were suffering grievously under her husband&#x27;s oppressive taxation. Lady Godiva appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to lower the taxes. At last, weary of her repeated requests, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town. Lady Godiva took him at his word, and after issuing a proclamation that all persons should stay indoors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. Just one person in the town, a tailor ever afterwards known as &#x27;Peeping Tom&#x27;, disobeyed her proclamation in what is the most famous instance of voyeurism. In most versions of the story, Tom is struck blind or dead for his transgression.

Some historians have discerned elements of pagan fertility rituals in the Godiva story, whereby a young &quot;May Queen&quot; was led to the sacred Cofa&#x27;s tree, perhaps to celebrate the renewal of spring. The oldest form of the legend has Godiva passing through Coventry market from one end to the other while the people were assembled, attended only by two knights. This version is given in by Roger of Wendover (died 1236), a somewhat gullible collector of anecdotes. In a chronicle written in the 1560s, Richard Grafton claimed the version given in originated from a &quot;lost chronicle&quot; written between 1216 and 1235 by the Prior of the monastery of Coventry.

A modified version of the story was given by printer Richard Grafton, later elected MP for Coventry. According to his &quot;Chronicle of England&quot; (1569), &quot;Leofricus&quot; had already exempted the people of Coventry from &quot;any maner of Tolle, Except onely of Horses&quot;, so that Godiva (&quot;Godina&quot; in text) had agreed to the naked ride just to win relief for this horse tax. And as a condition, she required the officials of Coventry to forbid the populace &quot;upon a great pain&quot; from watching her, and to shut themselves in and shutter all windows on the day of her ride. Grafton was an ardent Protestant and sanitized the earlier story.

The ballad &quot;Leoffricus&quot; in the Percy Folio () conforms to Grafton&#x27;s version, saying that Lady Godiva performed her ride to remove the customs paid on horses, and that the town&#x27;s officers ordered the townsfolk to &quot;shutt their dore, &amp; clap their windowes downe,&quot; and remain indoors on the day of her ride.

===Peeping Tom===

The story of Peeping Tom, who alone among the townsfolk spied on the Lady Godiva&#x27;s naked ride, probably did not originate in literature, but came about through popular lore in the locality of Coventry. Reference by 17th century chroniclers has been claimed, but all the published accounts are 18th century or later.

According to an 1826 article submitted by someone well versed in local history identifying himself as &#x27;W. Reader&#x27;, there was already a well-established tradition that there was a certain tailor who had spied on Lady Godiva, and that at the annual Trinity Great Fair (now called the Godiva Festival) featuring the Godiva processions &quot;a grotesque figure called Peeping Tom&quot; would be set on display, and it was a wooden statue carved from oak. The author has dated this effigy, based on the style of armour he is shown wearing, from the reign of Charles II (d. 1685). The same writer felt the legend had to be subsequent to William Dugdale (d. 1686) since he made no mention of it in his works that discussed Coventry at full length. (The story of the tailor and the use of a wooden effigy may be as old as the 17th century, but the effigy may not have always been called &quot;Tom&quot;.)

W. Reader dates the first Godiva procession to 1677, but other sources date the first parade to 1678, and on that year a lad from the household of James Swinnerton enacted the role of Lady Godiva.

The English &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (&quot;DNB&quot;) gives a meticulous account of the literary sources. The historian Paul de Rapin (1732) reported the Coventry lore that Lady Godiva performed her ride while &quot;commanding all Persons to keep within Doors and from their Windows, on pain of Death&quot;, but that one man could not refrain from looking and it &quot;cost him his life&quot;; Rapin further reported that the town commemorates this with a &quot;Statue of a Man looking out of a Window.&quot;
Next, Thomas Pennant in &quot;Journey from Chester to London&quot; (1782) recounted: &quot;[T]he curiosity of a certain taylor overcoming his fear, he took a single peep&quot;. Pennant noted that the person enacting Godiva in the procession was not fully naked of course, but wore &quot;silk, closely fitted to her limbs&quot;, which had a colour resembling the skin&#x27;s complexion. (In Pennant&#x27;s time, around 1782, silk was worn, but the annotator of the 1811 edition noted that a cotton garment had since replaced the silk fabric.) According to the &quot;DNB&quot;, the oldest document that mentions &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; by name is a record in Coventry&#x27;s official annals, dating to 11 June 1773, documenting that the city issued a new wig and paint for the wooden effigy.

There is also said to be a letter from pre-1700, stating that the peeper was actually Action, Lady Godiva&#x27;s groom.

Additional legend proclaims that Peeping Tom was later struck blind as heavenly punishment, or that the townspeople took the matter in their own hands and blinded him.

== Degree of nudity ==
While most iterations of the legend describe Godiva riding completely nude, there is much dispute as to the historical authenticity of this notion.

A more plausible rationale for the legend includes one based on the custom at the time for penitents to make a public procession in their shift, a sleeveless white garment similar to a slip today and one which was certainly considered &quot;underwear&quot; in Godiva&#x27;s time. If this were the case, Godiva might have actually travelled through town as a penitent in her shift, likely unshod and stripped of her jewellery which was the hallmark of her upper class rank. It would have been highly unusual to see a noblewoman present herself publicly in such an unadorned state, possibly bringing about the legend which would later be romanticised in folk history. Her &#x27;naked&#x27; ride has also been considered to provide an insight into how women used their sensuality and bodies to wield power in twelfth century England, as well as how her protest formed Coventry&#x27;s civic identity.

Some suggest that the nudity myth originated in Puritan propaganda, designed to blacken the reputation of the notably pious Lady Godiva. Chroniclers of the 11th and 12th centuries mention Godiva as a respectable religious woman of some beauty and do not allude to nude excursions in public. It has also been argued that the story was made up about the pious Lady Godiva in order to attract pilgrims, and therefore, revenue, to Coventry.

== Images in art and society ==
The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry maintains a permanent exhibition on the subject. The oldest painting was commissioned by the County of the City of Coventry in 1586 and produced by Adam van Noort, a refugee Flemish artist. His painting depicts a &quot;voluptuously displayed&quot; Lady Godiva against the background of a &quot;fantastical Italianate Coventry&quot;. In addition the Gallery has collected many Victorian interpretations of the subject described by Marina Warner as &quot;an oddly composed Landseer, a swooning Watts and a sumptuous Alfred Woolmer&quot;. The collection also includes paintings by the Coventry artist David Gee, such as &quot;The Godiva Procession Leaving St Mary&#x27;s Hall.&quot;
A 14th century window depicting Lady Godiva and her husband once existed in Holy Trinity Church, but was removed in 1775. It bore the inscription &#x27;I Luriche for the love of thee Doe make Coventre tol-free.&#x27;

In 1792, Lady Godiva was depicted on the reverse of a Coventry halfpenny Conder token—a privately minted token coinage struck and used in Britain during the late 18th century and the early part of the 19th century (a period of the Industrial Revolution).
Thomas Stevens, the 19th-century Coventry born weaver, famous for his innovation of the woven silk pictures known as stevengraphs, sold an image of the &quot;Lady Godiva Procession&quot; amongst his designs. Another medium used to depict Godiva was linocut printing, with Haydn Reynolds Mackey&#x27;s early 20th century work held in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts.John Collier&#x27;s painting &quot;Lady Godiva&quot; (1897) was bequeathed by social reformer Thomas Hancock Nunn. When he died in 1937, the Pre-Raphaelite-style painting was offered to the Corporation of Hampstead. He specified in his will that should his bequest be refused by Hampstead (presumably on grounds of propriety) the painting was then to be offered to Coventry. The painting now hangs in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.

St Mary&#x27;s Guildhall in Coventry houses a marble statue by William Calder Marshall of Lady Godiva, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1854. American sculptor Anne Whitney also created a marble sculpture of Lady Godiva, now in the collection of the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas, and another sculpture of Lady Godiva by stonemason John Thomas is held at the Maidstone Museum, Kent.

=== Coventry ===

The Godiva Procession, a commemoration of the legendary ride, was instituted on 31 May 1678 as part of Coventry fair and was celebrated up to the 1960s. The part of Lady Godiva was usually played by a scantily clad actress or dancer, and the occasion often attracted controversy. For instance, in 1854, the Bishop of Worcester protested against &quot;a Birmingham whore being paraded through the streets as Lady Godiva.&quot; These annual processions were enlivened by constant rumours, beforehand, that the girl playing the part of Lady Godiva would actually appear nude, like the original. These hopes were eventually realised in a play staged in 1974, at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, entitled &quot;The Only True Story of Lady Godiva&quot;, in which Lady Godiva appeared naked, riding a motor bike.

The wooden effigy of Peeping Tom which, from 1812 until World War II looked out on the world from a hotel at the northwest corner of Hertford Street, Coventry, can now be found in Cathedral Lanes Shopping Centre. It represents a man in armour and was probably an image of Saint George. Nearby, in the 1950s rebuilt Broadgate, an animated Peeping Tom watches over Lady Godiva as she makes her hourly ride around the Godiva Clock.

From the mid-1980s a Coventry resident, Pru Porretta, has adopted a Lady Godiva role to promote community events and good works in the city. Porretta retains the status of Coventry&#x27;s unofficial ambassador. Each September Poretta marks the occasion of Lady Godiva&#x27;s birthday by leading a local pageant focusing on world peace and unity known as The Godiva Sisters. In August 2007, the Godiva Sisters was performed in front of 900 delegates from 69 countries attending the World Council for Gifted and Talented Children Biennial Conference held at the University of Warwick. In the 2010 New Year Honours Porretta was appointed a Member of the Order of The British Empire &quot;for services to the city of Coventry community and tourism services&quot;.

In 1999, Coventry councillors considered eliminating Godiva from the city&#x27;s public identity, however, the Coventry City Council logo unveiled in 2000 features Lady Godiva and her horse. The previous logo also featured Godiva.

In 2010 an arts project, &quot;Godiva Awakes&quot;, involving a 32 foot (10-metres) tall puppet version of Lady Godiva, powered by 50 bicycles, leading a procession from Coventry to London, was proposed by the independent company Imagineer productions (best known locally for reviving the Coventry Mystery Plays and reimagining the Coventry Carnival as the Godiva Festival).

<text>Chinle () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Apache County, Arizona, United States. The name in Navajo means and is a reference to the location where the water flows out of the Canyon de Chelly. The population was 4,518 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
In the Spanish colonial period, Chinle was a base for both trade and war. After acquisition of this area by the United States following the Mexican–American War, relations between the peoples deteriorated in the 1860s.

The United States conducted a peace conference through their representative Kit Carson and the Navajo people in order to end the war between the Navajo and the U.S. The first trading post operated out of a tent and was established here in 1882. By 1885 a full-sized camp had developed.

The Chinle Boarding School was established in 1910 by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Khalil Anthony Johnson Jr., a PhD candidate at Yale University, wrote an article in 2014 that said, with this school, the federal government &quot;established a permanent presence in [Chinle]&quot;, and that the BIA &quot;effectively governed the town thereafter.&quot;

Initially anglicized as Chin Lee, the spelling of the name was changed to Chinle on April 1, 1941.

Chinle serves as a gateway community for Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The monument was established in 1931 primarily to preserve the archaeological sites and record of ancient human history. Canyon de Chelly is unique among the National Park Service units because the park is located entirely on Navajo tribal land, and it has a residential community in the canyon.

In the 1950s Chinle had a population with a variety of ethnicities, who tended to settle in separate areas. In addition to Navajo and non-Navajo Native Americans, there were Anglo white and Black people, and some of other races. The total population was under 200. Employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), one of the major employers, and school employees lived in their own compounds. The Chinle Boarding School and a public health clinic were the other two major employers.

By the 1950s the community had an issue with numerous stray dogs, who were not neutered nor spayed. Chinle had no leash law. On April 8, 1956, BIA authorities rounded up and shot stray dogs without warning, leaving some remains at people&#x27;s doorsteps. The community protested when another dog shooting was ordered on September 23, 1956. G. Warren Spaulding, the General Superintendent of the Navajo Agency, ordered the dog shot anyway, and did not notify the residents of his reason for rejecting their protest. Community outcry led to the installation of a gas chamber to euthanize unclaimed dogs.

Chinle&#x27;s population was 150 in the 1960 census.

In 2019, the television series &quot;Basketball or Nothing&quot;, featuring Chinle High School&#x27;s basketball team, premiered on Netflix.

Gabrielle Durcharme of Cronkite News stated that the COVID-19 pandemic in Arizona &quot;was hard on the community.&quot;

<text>Eagar () is a town in Apache County, Arizona, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the town was 4,885.

The area was the home of the Apache people. The town of Eagar was first settled by European Americans in 1871.

==History==
Brothers William Walter, John Thomas, and Joel Sixtus settled the area under the direction of The Mormon prophet Brigham Young. They each acquired 160 acres of land under the homestead act. Once they received the deeds to their properties, again under the direction of Brigham Young, they each subdivided their properties to sell at a discounted rate to other church members who were also settling the area.

The first postmistress, Emma Goldsbrough Udall, wanted to name the town &quot;Union&quot;, in a desire for eventually combining the town with other towns such as Amity and Springerville, to unite the small community. However, the US postmaster general rejected the name as too common. Therefore, she submitted the name &quot;Eagarville&quot; to honor the Eagar brothers. However, that name was also changed by the postmaster general to just &quot;Eagar&quot; sometime before December 1892 when the school district was renamed.

A battle took place near what is now the town cemetery in which 9 members of the Snyder gang were killed.

The town of Eagar was incorporated in 1948.

<doc id="105941" wikidata="Q323066" url="?curid=105941" title="William Gaines">
<text>William Maxwell &quot;Bill&quot; Gaines (; March 1, 1922 – June 3, 1992) was an American publisher and co-editor of EC Comics. Following a shift in EC&#x27;s direction in 1950, Gaines presided over what became an artistically influential and historically important line of mature-audience comics. He published the satirical magazine &quot;Mad&quot; for over 40 years.

He was posthumously inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame (1993) and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame (1997). In 2012, he was inducted into the Ghastly Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Gaines was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish household. His father was Max Gaines, who as publisher of the All-American Comics division of DC Comics was also an influential figure in the history of comics. The elder Gaines tested the idea of packaging and selling comics on newsstands in 1933, and Gaines accepted William Moulton Marston&#x27;s proposal in 1941 for the first successful female superhero, Wonder Woman.

As World War II began, Gaines was rejected by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy, so he went to his local draft board and requested to be drafted. He trained as an U.S. Army Air Corps photographer at Lowry Field in Denver. However, when he was assigned to an Oklahoma City field without a photographic facility, he wound up on permanent KP duty. As he explained in 1976 to Bill Craig of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, &quot;Being an eater, this assignment was a real pleasure for me. There were four of us, and we always found all the choice bits the cooks had hidden away. We&#x27;d be frying up filet mignon and ham steaks every night. The hours were great, too. I think it was eight hours on and 40 off.&quot; Stationed at DeRidder Army Airfield in Louisiana, he was reassigned to Marshall Airfield in Kansas and then to Governors Island, New York. Leaving the service in 1946, he returned home to complete his chemistry studies at Brooklyn Polytechnic, but soon transferred to New York University, intent on obtaining a teaching certificate. In 1947, he was in his senior year at NYU when his father was killed in a motorboat accident on Lake Placid. Instead of becoming a chemistry teacher, he took over the family business, EC Comics.

==Career==
===Senate Subcommittee investigation===
With the publication of Dr. Fredric Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, comic books like those that Gaines published attracted the attention of the U.S. Congress. In 1954, Gaines testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. In the following exchanges, he is addressed first by Chief Counsel Herbert Beaser, and then by Senator Estes Kefauver:

===End of EC Comics and conversion of &quot;Mad&quot; format===
Gaines converted &quot;Mad&quot; to a magazine in 1955, partly to retain the services of its talented editor Harvey Kurtzman, who had received offers from elsewhere. The change enabled &quot;Mad&quot; to escape the strictures of the Comics Code Authority. Kurtzman left Gaines&#x27;s employ a year later anyway and was replaced by Al Feldstein, who had been Gaines&#x27;s most prolific editor during the EC Comics run. (For details of this event and the subsequent debates about it, see Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s editorship of Mad.) Feldstein oversaw &quot;Mad&quot; from 1955 through 1986, as Gaines went on to a long and profitable career as a publisher of satire and enemy of bombast.

To celebrate a circulation milestone of 1 million magazines, Gaines took his staff to Haiti. In Haiti the magazine had a single subscriber. Gaines personally delivered his subscription renewal card.

Despite his largesse, Gaines had a penny-pinching side. He would frequently stop meetings to find out who had called a particular long-distance phone number. Longtime &quot;Mad&quot; editor Nick Meglin called Gaines a &quot;living contradiction&quot; in 2011, saying, &quot;He was singularly the cheapest man in the world, and the most generous.&quot; Meglin described his experience of asking Gaines for a raise of $3 a week; after rejecting the request, the publisher then treated Meglin to an expensive dinner at one of New York&#x27;s best restaurants. Recalled Meglin: &quot;The check came, and I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the whole raise!&#x27; &quot;And Bill said, &#x27;I like good conversation and good food. I don&#x27;t enjoy giving raises.&#x27;&quot;

(According to veteran Golden Age comics artist Sheldon Moldoff, Gaines was not too fond of paying percentages, either.)
In his memoir &quot;Good Days and Mad&quot; (1994), &quot;Mad&quot; writer Dick DeBartolo recalls several anecdotes that characterize Gaines as a generous gourmand who liked practical jokes, and who enjoyed good-natured verbal abuse from his staffers.

===1960–1992===

In 1961, Gaines sold &quot;Mad&quot; to Premier Industries, a maker of venetian blinds, but remained publisher until the day he died, and served as a buffer between the magazine and its corporate interests. He largely stayed out of the magazine&#x27;s production, often viewing content just before the issue was shipped to the printer. &quot;My staff and contributors create the magazine,&quot; declared Gaines. &quot;What I create is the atmosphere.&quot; Around 1964, Premier sold Mad to Independent News, a division of National Periodical Publications, the publisher of DC Comics. In 1967, Kinney National Company purchased National Periodical, and then in 1969, they bought Warner Brothers. In 1972, Kinney became Warner Communications.

One of Gaines&#x27; last televised interviews was as a guest on the December 7, 1991, episode of &quot;Beyond Vaudeville&quot;.

Circa 2008, director John Landis and screenwriter Joel Eisenberg planned a biopic called &quot;Ghoulishly Yours, William M. Gaines&quot;, with Al Feldstein serving as a creative consultant. The film, however, did not get past pre-production.

==Death==
On June 3, 1992, Gaines died in his sleep at his home in New York at the age of 70. He had been in ill health in recent years and used a pacemaker.

==Personal life==
Gaines&#x27;s first marriage was arranged by his mother. He was married to his second cousin Hazel Grieb. They announced their plans to divorce in August 1947. According to &quot;Completely Mad: A History of the Comic Book and Magazine&quot; by Maria Reidelbach, Gaines married Nancy Siegel in 1955. They had three children, Cathy (1958), Wendy (1959), and Christopher (1961). They divorced in 1971. In 1987 he married Anne Griffiths. They remained married until his death in 1992.

Gaines was an atheist since the age of 12; he once told a reporter that his was probably the only home in America in which the children were brought up to believe in Santa Claus, but not in God.

<text>Lorenzo Jerald Patterson (born June 16, 1969), known professionally by his stage name MC Ren, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer from Compton, California. He is the founder and owner of the independent record label Villain Entertainment.

MC Ren began his career as a solo artist signed to Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records in early 1987, while still attending high school. By the end of 1987, after having written nearly half of &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;, he became a member of N.W.A. After the group disbanded in 1991, he stayed with Ruthless, releasing three solo albums including the controversial &quot;Shock of the Hour&quot; before leaving the label in 1998.

In 2016, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A.

In 2024, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of N.W.A. He showed up to the ceremony to accept the award along with Ice Cube, DJ Yella, The D.O.C and Lil Eazy E.

==Early life==
Lorenzo Jerald Patterson was born in Compton, California, on June 16, 1969, and raised in Pannes Ave. around Kelly Park. He grew up with his parents, two brothers and a sister. His father used to work for &quot;the government&quot;, until he later opened up his own barber shop. Patterson joined the Kelly Park Compton Crips (of which Eazy-E would also become a member) in attempt to make money, but soon departed and turned to drug dealing as he felt it was more lucrative. Following a raid on his childhood friend MC Chip&#x27;s house, Patterson quit dealing and focused thereafter on making music.

Patterson attended Dominguez High School, where he met his future collaborator, DJ Train. At this time, he developed an interest in hip hop music, and began writing songs with MC Chip, with whom he formed the group Awesome Crew, and performed at parties and nightclubs. Patterson officially began his rap career upon joining forces with another childhood friend, Eric &quot;Eazy-E&quot; Wright, in 1985. Patterson graduated from high school in 1987 and he planned to join the United States Army after graduation, but changed his mind after watching the 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.

==Music career==
===Career beginnings: 1987–1991===
In 1987, Patterson was signed as a solo artist to Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records, while still attending high school. However, when Ice Cube went to study for a year, Ren was asked to write songs for the in-progress &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;. After writing much of the album, MC Ren was asked to join the group N.W.A. They immediately started on the album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. With a budget of US$8,000, the album was finished in four weeks and released in January 1989. Propelled by &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, the album became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours. The FBI sent Ruthless a warning letter in response to the song&#x27;s content.
One month after &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot; was released, with lyrics largely written by Patterson, with contributions from Ice Cube and The D.O.C.

Following Ice Cube&#x27;s departure from the group in 1989, N.W.A quickly released the EP &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot; with lyrics written by Patterson, with contributions by The D.O.C. The group&#x27;s second full-length studio album, &quot;Niggaz4Life,&quot; was released the next year. Selling 955,000 copies in the 1st week and was certified as Platinum, it became the first rap album to enter #1 on the Billboard charts. This album would become the group&#x27;s final, as Dr. Dre left the group over financial disputes with Jerry Heller.

According to Patterson, it was common opinion that Heller was the one receiving their due:
===Solo career: 1992–present===
As N.W.A disbanded, Patterson started recording his first solo release titled &quot;Kizz My Black Azz&quot;. The 6-track EP was entirely produced by DJ Bobcat, except for one song that Patterson produced himself. Released in summer 1992, the EP was a hit, commercially and critically. Without any radio play, the EP went Platinum within 2 months.

Patterson began recording for his debut album, at that time called &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, in late 1992. During the recording process, Patterson joined The Nation of Islam with guidance from DJ Train. This caused him to scrap &quot;Life Sentence&quot;, and &quot;Shock of the Hour&quot; was released in late 1993. The album debuted at #1 on the R&amp;B charts, selling 321,000 copies in its first month. &quot;Shock of the Hour&quot; was regarded as being more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides; the first half deals with social issues like ghetto life, drug addiction, racism and poverty. The second half shows Patterson&#x27;s political side, as that half was recorded after he joined the Nation of Islam. The album features the hit singles &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Shit&quot; and &quot;Mayday on the Frontline&quot;.

After 2 years of not talking to each other, Patterson reunited with Eazy-E in 1994 to produce their duet song &quot;Tha Muthpukkin&#x27; Real&quot; produced by DJ Yella, with Patterson co-producing. Three months later; on March 26, 1995, Eazy-E would die from complications of AIDS. The song &quot;Tha Muthpukkin&#x27; Real&quot; was released as a single in 1995.

Patterson soon fell on hard times when both DJ Train and Eazy-E died before the release of &quot;The Villain in Black&quot;. The album, which was released in early 1996 and represented Patterson&#x27;s first attempt at imitating the G-funk sound of Dr. Dre&#x27;s The Chronic, was not well received by critics. It was also heavily criticized for what many saw as Patterson&#x27;s pandering to gangsta rap at the cost of a reduction in the sociopolitical content found on his earlier releases. The album debuted at #31 on the pop-charts, with the first week&#x27;s sales of 31,000 copies. By the second month it had sold 131,000 copies.

Before leaving Ruthless, Patterson released &quot;Ruthless for Life&quot; in 1998, which proved a small comeback, selling moderately well. The album features Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, RBX and 8Ball &amp; MJG, and others. This was the first time Patterson worked with new producers. By the end of 1998, Patterson had left Ruthless.

On October 31, 2009, Patterson released his fourth studio album entitled &quot;Renincarnated&quot;, which was released under his own record label &quot;Villain&quot;. &quot;Renincarnated&quot; was only released in the US.

In 2015, Patterson stated that he had been working on his second EP, titled &quot;Rebel Music&quot; and released two singles: the title track, &quot;Rebel Music&quot;, and &quot;Burn Radio Burn&quot;. The official remix for &quot;Rebel Music&quot; was released in June 2014, and features Ice Cube. It was originally expected to be released by the end of 2015 but remained unreleased until 2022 when he canceled the project and followed it up with a new EP, &quot;Osiris&quot; via Twitter.

On May 22, 2022, he announced the track list of &quot;Osiris&quot;, and released the EP on June 3, 2022. The eight-track EP is entirely produced by Tha Chill and features guest appearances from Kurupt, Kokane, Cold 187um, Ras Kass and others.

===Collaborations: 1987–present===
In 1988, Patterson contributed to &quot;Eazy-Duz-It&quot;. Although officially released as a solo album by Eazy-E, numerous artists contributed. Patterson; the only guest rapper on the album, features raps of his own on almost half of the album. The album was produced by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, while Patterson, Ice Cube and The D.O.C. wrote the lyrics.

In 1990, Patterson produced the debut album for his protege group CPO, titled &quot;To Hell and Black&quot;. The group consisted of CPO Boss Hogg, DJ Train, and Young D. After the release of their debut album, the group dissolved. CPO Boss Hogg went to have a solo career, featuring on high-profile albums of N.W.A, Dr. Dre and Tupac, while DJ Train stayed with Patterson.

In 1993, Patterson introduced a new group called &quot;The Whole Click&quot;. The group featured Patterson&#x27;s longtime collaborator Bigg Rocc, Grinch, Bone and Patterson&#x27;s brother, Juvenile. The group first appeared on Patterson&#x27;s debut album &quot;Shock of the Hour&quot;. The collective later split up. Bigg Rocc continued to collaborate with Patterson, featuring him on all his solo albums.

In 2000, he appeared on the song &quot;Hello&quot;, which featured Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;War &amp; Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)&quot; album. He joined the &quot;Up in Smoke Tour&quot; that same year to rap his verse on the track. He also appeared on the posse cut &quot;Some L.A. Niggaz&quot; from Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;2001&quot; album.

Patterson&#x27;s recent work has appeared on some more politically oriented projects with Public Enemy, specifically Paris&#x27;s album &quot;Hard Truth Soldiers Vol. 1&quot; as well as on Public Enemy&#x27;s album &quot;Rebirth of a Nation&quot;. Paris stated in an interview with rapstation.com that: &quot;MC Ren is retired and won&#x27;t be doing a full-length album as far as I know. I get at him for verses, that&#x27;s about it.&quot;

In April 2016, Patterson reunited with the former members of N.W.A at Coachella.

==Other ventures==
===Film career===
In 1992, Patterson was offered the role for A-Wax in &quot;Menace II Society&quot;. Despite accepting the role, Patterson later changed his mind and the role was given to MC Eiht.

In 2004, Patterson released the straight-to-DVD film &quot;Lost in the Game&quot;. The movie was produced, written and directed by Patterson, with Playboy T assisting. It was an independent movie released by Patterson&#x27;s company &quot;Villain&quot;.

Patterson was portrayed by Aldis Hodge in the 2015 N.W.A biopic &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.

==Personal life==
In June 1993, he married Yaasamen Alaa, with whom he has five children. His oldest son, Anthony, is an aspiring rapper under the name &quot;Waxxie&quot;, and has collaborated with other sons of N.W.A members.

In April 1993, Patterson began attending a mosque, and by July he was a fully registered member of the Nation of Islam, known as Lorenzo X. Two years later he left the organization and converted to Sunni Islam.

<doc id="105945" wikidata="Q49196" url="?curid=105945" title="Newton, Massachusetts">
<text>Newton is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It is roughly west of downtown Boston, and comprises a patchwork of thirteen villages. The city borders Boston to the northeast and southeast (via the neighborhoods of Brighton and West Roxbury), Brookline to the east, Watertown and Waltham to the north, and Weston, Wellesley, and Needham to the west. At the 2020 U.S. census, the population of Newton was 88,923.

Newton is home to the Charles River, Crystal Lake, and Heartbreak Hill, among other landmarks. It is served by several streets and highways (including Route 9, Hammond Pond Parkway, and the Mass Pike), as well as the Green Line D branch run by the MBTA.

Historically, the area that is now Newton was settled in 1639, and was originally first part of Cambridge (then called &quot;the newe towne&quot;). It split from Cambridge in 1681, and became known by its present name of Newton in 1766. It then became a city in 1874.

==History==
===17th century===
Newton was originally part of &quot;the newe towne&quot;, which was settled in 1630 and renamed Cambridge in 1638. The first English settlement of what is now Newton began in 1639. Roxbury minister John Eliot persuaded the Native American people of Nonantum, a sub-tribe of the Massachusett led by a sachem named Waban, to relocate to Natick in 1651, fearing that they would be exploited by colonists. Newton was incorporated as a separate town, known as Cambridge Village, on December 15, 1681, then renamed Newtown in 1691, and finally Newton in 1766. It became a city on January 5, 1874. Newton is known as &quot;The Garden City&quot;.

In the early 1600s, Watertown had claimed a large area of land on the south side of the Charles River (modern-day Newton). They gave it up to Newtown, except for a strip &quot;two hundred rods long and sixty rods wide&quot; to &quot;protect their fishing privileges&quot;.

===18th century===
In &quot;Reflections in Bullough&#x27;s Pond&quot;, Newton historian Diana Muir describes the early industries that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a series of mills built to take advantage of the water power available at Newton Upper Falls and Newton Lower Falls. Snuff, chocolate, glue, paper and other products were produced in these small mills but, according to Muir, the water power available in Newton was not sufficient to turn Newton into a manufacturing city, although it was, beginning in 1902, the home of the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, the maker of the Stanley Steamer.

===19th century===
Nineteenth-century Newton, following the American Civil War, was a patchwork of villages. The northern villages of Auburndale, Newton Corner, Newtonville, and West Newton were the most affluent. In contrast, both Waban and Chestnut Hill were sparsely populated.

Several village-based &quot;improvement societies&quot; were founded by residents between 1878 and 1904. No citywide improvement society was ever founded.

Newton, according to Muir, became one of North America&#x27;s earliest commuter suburbs. The Boston and Worcester, one of North America&#x27;s earliest railroads, reached West Newton in 1834. Wealthy Bostonian businessmen took advantage of the new commuting opportunity offered by the railroad, building gracious homes on erstwhile farmland of West Newton hill and on Commonwealth Street. Muir points out that these early commuters needed sufficient wealth to employ a groom and keep horses, to drive them from their hilltop homes to the station.

===20th century===
Further suburbanization came in waves. One wave began with the streetcar lines that made many parts of Newton accessible for commuters in the late nineteenth century. The next wave came in the 1920s when automobiles became affordable to a growing upper middle class. Even then, however, Oak Hill continued to be farmed, mostly market gardening, until the prosperity of the 1950s made all of Newton more densely settled.

===21st century===
Two of the hijackers of the September 11 attacks stayed in Newton the night before the attacks. The hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 spent their last night in Newton&#x27;s Park Inn, an economy motel across the street from the Chestnut Hill Mall and within walking distance of The Atrium.

Each April on Patriots&#x27; Day, the Boston Marathon is run through the city, entering from Wellesley on Route 16 (Washington Street) where runners encounter the first of the four infamous &quot;Newton Hills&quot;. It then turns right onto Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue) for the long haul into Boston. There are two more hills before reaching Centre Street, and then the fourth and most noted, Heartbreak Hill, rises shortly after Centre Street. Residents and visitors line the race route along Washington Street and Commonwealth Avenue to cheer on the runners.

== Geography ==

Newton is a suburban city approximately from downtown Boston, in Middlesex County. It is also bordered by Waltham and Watertown on the north, Needham and the West Roxbury neighborhood of Boston on the south, Wellesley and Weston on the west, and Brookline and the Brighton neighborhood of Boston on the east.

The Charles River flows along the north and west parts of Newton, and Route 128 passes through the western part of the city.

The Mass Pike passes through the more urbanized northern section of the city before heading into Boston. Additional major highways in Newton include Route 9, serving the southern parts of the city, and Hammond Pond Parkway, which is the main north–south route through Chestnut Hill and provides access to Brookline and West Roxbury.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.82%) is water.

===Geological history===
Geologically Newton is located within the topographic lowland of the Boston Basin of the Appalachian Mountain chain. This lowland is surrounded by a ring of highland drumlins which were left after the last glaciation twelve thousand years ago.

There are several unique outcroppings of rocks around Newton where geologic history revealing of how territory have formed and has changed over the past hundreds millions of years of drift supercontinents and ancient oceans, earthquake activity associated with volcanism and related faulting activity and changing climate. There are mainly three types of bedrock: Roxbury Conglomerate, Cambridge Argillite or Slate, and Brighton Volcanics and the Mattapan Volcanics pre-Cambrian foundation of Dedham Granodiorite. The Boston Border Fault and the Shawmut anticline of Newton formed as the alpine mountains of east-central Massachusetts were created. Unique outcroppings rocks exposure has steadily declined as Newton area has become increasingly developed.

===Topography===

Newton has grown around a formation of seven hills. &quot;The general features of Newton are not without interest. Seven principal elevations mark its surface, like the seven hills of ancient Rome, with the difference that the seven hills of Newton are much more distinct than the seven hills of Rome: Nonantum Hill, Waban Hill, Chestnut Hill, Bald Pate Hill, Oak Hill, Institution Hill and Mount Ida.&quot;

===Villages===

Rather than having a single city center, Newton is a patchwork of thirteen villages, many boasting small downtown areas of their own. The 13 villages are: Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, Newton Lower Falls, Newton Upper Falls (both on the Charles River, and both former small industrial sites), Newtonville, Nonantum (also known as Silver Lake or &quot;The Lake&quot;), Oak Hill, Thompsonville, Waban and West Newton. Oak Hill Park is a place within the village of Oak Hill that itself is shown as a separate and distinct village on some city maps (including a map dated 2010 on the official City of Newton website), and Four Corners is also shown as a village on some city maps. Although most of the villages have a post office, they have no legal definition and no firmly defined borders. This village-based system often causes some confusion with addresses and for first-time visitors.

===Climate===

The record low temperature was in February 1934; the record high temperature was in August 1975.

====Newton Junior College====
Newton Junior College, operated by the Newton Public Schools, opened in 1946 to serve the needs of returning veterans who otherwise would not have been able to continue their education due to the overcrowding of colleges and universities at that time. It used the facilities of Newton High School (now Newton North High School) until its own adjacent campus was built. It closed in 1976 due to declining enrollment and increased costs. The availability of such places as UMass Boston contributed to its demise. According to the city, its former campus is now &quot;Claflin Park,&quot; a 25-unit multi-family development.

Fig City News is a free, online community news resource founded by resident volunteers to cover local news and community events in Newton. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; occasionally covers Newton.

===Television===
Residents of Newton have access to a state-of-the-art television studio and community media center, NewTV, located at 23 Needham Street in Newton Highlands. Newton is also home to NECN, a regional news network owned by NBC.

===Radio===
From 1968 to 2017, the studios and transmitter of WNTN AM-1550 were on Rumford Avenue in Auburndale.

==Infrastructure==
===Hospital===
Newton-Wellesley Hospital is located at 2014 Washington Street in Newton. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks the hospital 13th best in the Boston metro area.

===Transportation===
Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service. The Green Line D branch, (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away, terminating in Newton Lower Falls. The Green Line B branch ends across from Boston College on Commonwealth Avenue, virtually at the border of Boston&#x27;s Brighton neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred to as Chestnut Hill). The MBTA Worcester commuter rail, serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston. It runs from every half-an-hour during peak times to every couple of hours otherwise. The northern villages are also served by frequent express buses that go to downtown Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike as well as Waltham.

Newton Centre, which is centered around the MBTA station of the same name, has been lauded as an example of transit-oriented development.

The Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), which basically follows the old Boston and Albany Railroad main line right-of-way, runs east and west through Newton, while Route 128 (Interstate 95) slices through the extreme western part of the city in the Lower Falls area. Route 30 (Commonwealth Avenue), Route 16 (Watertown Street west to West Newton, where it follows Washington Street west) and route 9 (Worcester Turnpike or Boylston Street) also run east and west through the city. Another major Boston (and Brookline) street, Beacon Street, runs west from the Boston city line to Washington Street west of the hospital, where it terminates at Washington Street.

There are no major north–south roads through Newton: every north–south street in Newton terminates within Newton at one end or the other. The only possible exception is Needham Street, which is north–south at the border between Newton and Needham, but it turns east and becomes Dedham Street, and when it reaches the Boston border, it goes south-east.

There are some north–south streets that are important to intra-Newton traveling. Centre Street runs south from the Watertown town line to Newton Highlands, where it becomes Winchester Street and terminates at Nahanton Street. Walnut Street runs south from Newtonville, where it starts at Crafts Street, down to Newton Highlands, where it ends at Dedham Street.

===Public safety===
The City of Newton Police Department has 139 sworn officers. The Newton Fire Department is fully paid and operates six engine companies, three ladder companies, and one rescue company from six stations.

<text>Satyricon is a Norwegian black metal band formed in Oslo in 1991. Satyr and Frost have been the band&#x27;s core members since 1993, and its only official members since 1997. The band&#x27;s first three albums typify the Norwegian black metal style. Since its fourth album in 1999, the band has strayed from this style and included elements of traditional heavy metal in their sound. Satyricon was the first Norwegian black metal band to join a multi-national record label (EMI).

==History==

The band were formed in 1990 as Eczema by the bassist Wargod and drummer Exhurtum. In 1991, they decided to start playing black metal and change the band name to Satyricon. Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) then joined the band. After the first demo &quot;All Evil&quot;, Exhurtum was kicked out of the band because he &quot;preferred hanging out with [his] girl at the time rather than kicking down gravestones together with the band&quot;, while Wargod left the music scene and became a UN soldier afterwards. Remaining members Satyr and Lemarchand hired the drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) as a session musician and recorded their second and last demo, &quot;The Forest Is My Throne&quot;. Shortly after this, Lemarchand also left the band. But before leaving the band he recorded guitars (uncredited on the booklet) for the first full-length album, &quot;Dark Medieval Times&quot;. In the meantime, Frost was being &quot;promoted&quot; as a permanent member and had recorded drums for the aforementioned album. Satyricon have—with two exceptions—been a two-man band ever since: from 1993–1996, Tomas Thormodsæter &#x27;Samoth&#x27; Haugen from Emperor was the bassist and guitarist of Satyricon, and participated in the recording of their second album, &quot;The Shadowthrone&quot;; and later, in 1996, Darkthrone member Nocturno Culto (Ted Skjellum, known as &quot;Kveldulv&quot; during Satyricon&#x27;s period) became guitarist on the third full-length Satyricon album, &quot;Nemesis Divina&quot;.

&quot;Rebel Extravaganza&quot;, Satyricon&#x27;s fourth album, was released in 1999. During this period Satyr drastically changed his look by shaving off his hair, as seen in the photoshoot for the album as well as their live performances around this time.

In April and May 2000, Satyricon toured as a supporting band for Pantera. Phil Anselmo has spoken of his love for black metal numerous times, and has participated in Eibon with Satyricon frontman Satyr. They used to be signed with Daron Malakian&#x27;s music label EatUrMusic.
Their fifth studio album &quot;Volcano&quot; was released in 2002 and won four awards: the Norwegian Grammy for Best Metal Album, an Alarm award for the track &quot;Fuel for Hatred&quot; in the category Song of the Year, the Alarm Award for Metal Album of the Year and The Oslo award for Best Overall Album.

Satyricon participated in the Darkthrone tribute &quot;Darkthrone Holy Darkthrone&quot;, released by Moonfog Productions in 1998, covering the song &quot;Kathaarian Life Code&quot;. In the same year, Satyricon participated in the Bathory tribute &quot;In Conspiracy with Satan – A Tribute to Bathory&quot;, released by Hellspawn Records/No Fashion Records, featuring the song &quot;Born for Burning&quot; originally released on &quot;Crusade from the North&quot; in 1996.

In 2006, Satyricon released &quot;Now, Diabolical&quot;.

In March 2008, the band headlined the Inferno Metal Festival in Oslo for the first time.

The EP &quot;My Skin Is Cold&quot; was released before their seventh album, &quot;The Age of Nero&quot;, which was released on 3 November 2008.

Satyricon released their self-titled eighth full-length album on 9 September 2013.

The band released their first ever Full Length live CD/DVD set titled &quot;Live at the Opera&quot; which took place in September 2013, alongside the Norwegian National Opera, on 4 May 2015.

A fully remastered 20th anniversary edition of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Nemesis Divina&quot; was released on 20 May 2016.

According to Satyricon&#x27;s official Facebook page, they entered the studio in March 2017 to record their ninth full-length studio album titled &quot;Deep Calleth Upon Deep&quot;, which was completed in Summer 2017 and was released on 22 September. Frost had stated in recent interviews that once the new album was released, they would then complete work on their first ever covers album &quot;Formative Oddities&quot;, though they have yet to announce its release date. The band also revealed plans to release a new studio album with original material in 2022. However, this was later pushed back to a May 2024 release, but again the album did not surface by this point. As of 2025 it is still not known when the new studio album will surface.

On June 8, 2022, the band announced their new album, &quot;Satyricon &amp; Munch&quot;, would be released digitally on June 10, with physical releases to follow sometime in the future. The album features music created for the Satyricon &amp; Munch exhibition held since April 29 at the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway, which celebrates the life and works of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch.

== Musical style ==
The band&#x27;s first album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Dark Medieval Times&quot;, showed off the fascination Satyricon had with the Middle Ages and featured raw black metal blast beats produced by Frost, mixed with acoustic guitar and flute. On their next album, &quot;The Shadowthrone&quot;, this medieval spirit was continued. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann wrote that Satyricon reached their &quot;very early zenith&quot; with that album and &quot;Nemesis Divina&quot;.

Describing their fifth studio album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Volcano&quot;, frontman Satyr stated in a press release and biography on their homepage that &quot;the music is rock based but more extreme; it is black metal pushing the boundaries that began with bands like Venom and Bathory. Reinventing ourselves based on a foundation of rock-oriented black metal is our philosophy.&quot; Mühlmann wrote that Satyricon&#x27;s path after their zenith was reached with their second and third album has only a limited connection to black metal, whereas &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; journalist Robert Müller described Satyr as a &quot;latently arrogant guy who, along the way, makes great music that constantly tests the borders of the genre&quot;.

<doc id="105948" wikidata="Q378154" url="?curid=105948" title="Essential fatty acid">
<text>Essential fatty acids, or EFAs, are fatty acids that are required by humans and other animals for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body.⁠ As they are not synthesized in the body, the essential fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid must be obtained from food or from a dietary supplement. Essential fatty acids are needed for various cellular metabolic processes and for the maintenance and function of tissues and organs. These fatty acids also are precursors to vitamins, cofactors, and derivatives, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, lipoxins, and others.

Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega−3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega−6 fatty acid). These are supplied to the body either as the free fatty acid, or more commonly as some glyceride derivative. ALA can be converted into eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, but the conversion amount is small, requiring intake from food or supplements. Deficiency in omega−3 fatty acids are very common. The average American has a dietary ratio between omega−6 fatty acids and omega−3 fatty acids of 20:1.

When the two EFAs were discovered in 1923, they were designated &quot;vitamin F&quot;, but in 1929, research on rats showed that the two EFAs are better classified as fats rather than vitamins.

==Functions==

In the body, essential fatty acids serve multiple functions. In each of these, the balance between dietary ω−3 and ω−6 strongly affects function.
* They are modified to make
** the classic eicosanoids (affecting inflammation and many other cellular functions)
** the endocannabinoids (affecting mood, behavior and inflammation)
** the lipoxins which are a group of eicosanoid derivatives formed via the lipoxygenase pathway from ω−6 EFAs and resolvins from ω−3 (in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid, downregulating inflammation)
** the isofurans, neurofurans, isoprostanes, hepoxilins, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and neuroprotectin D
* They form lipid rafts (affecting cellular signaling)
* They act on DNA (activating or inhibiting transcription factors such as NF-κB, which is linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine production)

==Nomenclature and terminology==

Fatty acids comprise an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain plus a carboxyl group (–COOH) at one end, and terminated by a methyl group (–CH3) at the other end. They are almost always straight-chained. The carbon next to the carboxylate is known as α, the next carbon β, and so forth. Since biological fatty acids can be of diverse lengths, the last position is often labelled as &quot;ω&quot;, the last letter in the Greek alphabet. In the expression &quot;ω−x&quot;, the minus symbol represents subtraction, indicating how many carbons away from the terminal end (ω) of the chain that the first unsaturated carbon-carbon bond appears. Typically, the number of carbons and the number of double bonds are also listed in short descriptions of unsaturated fatty acids. For instance, ω−3 18:4, or 18:4 ω−3, or 18:4 n−3 indicate stearidonic acid, an 18-carbon chain with 4 double bonds, and with a double bond between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the CH3 end. Double bonds are &quot;cis&quot; and separated by a single methylene (CH2) group unless otherwise noted. In free fatty acid form, the chemical structure of stearidonic acid is:

===Examples===
Polyunsaturated fatty acids with 16- and 18-carbon chains are sometimes classified as short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SC-PUFA), as opposed to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), which have more than 18 carbon atoms.

Both the essential fatty acids are SC-PUFA with an 18-carbon chain:
* ω−3 fatty acid:
** α-linolenic acid or ALA (18:3n−3)
* ω−6 fatty acid:
** linoleic acid or LA (18:2n−6)
These two fatty acids cannot be synthesized by humans because humans lack the desaturase enzymes required for their production.

They form the starting point for the creation of more desaturated fatty acids, most of which also have a longer carbon chain:
* ω−3 fatty acids:
** eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (20:5n−3)
** docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (22:6n−3)
* ω−6 fatty acids:
** gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (18:3n−6)
** dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid or DGLA (20:3n−6)
** arachidonic acid or AA (20:4n−6)
Except for GLA, which has a short 18-carbon chain, these fatty acids have more than 18 carbon atoms and are typically classified as LC-PUFA.

ω−9 fatty acids are not essential in humans because they can be synthesized from carbohydrates or other fatty acids.

==Essentiality in human diet==
Mammals lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbon 9 and 10, hence the omega−6 linoleic acid (18:2n−6; LA) and the omega−3 alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n−3; ALA) are essential for humans in the diet. However, humans can convert both LA and ALA to fatty acids with longer carbon chains and a larger number of double bonds, by alternative desaturation and chain elongation.

In humans, arachidonic acid (20:4n−6; AA) can be synthesized from LA. In turn, AA can be converted to an even longer fatty acid, the docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n−6; DPA). Similarly, ALA can be converted to docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n−3; DHA), although the latter conversion is limited, resulting in lower blood levels of DHA than through direct ingestion. This is illustrated by studies in vegans and vegetarians. If there is relatively more LA than ALA in the diet it favors the formation of DPA from LA rather than DHA from ALA. This effect can be altered by changing the relative ratio of LA:ALA, but is more effective when total intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids is low.

In preterm infants, the capacity to convert LA to AA and ALA to DHA is limited, and preformed AA and DHA may be required to meet the needs of the developing brain. Both AA and DHA are present in breastmilk and contribute along with the parent fatty acids LA and ALA to meeting the requirements of the newborn infant. Many infant formulas have AA and DHA added to them with an aim to make them more equivalent to human milk.

&quot;Essential nutrients&quot; are defined as those that cannot be synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; in sufficient quantities for normal physiological function. This definition is met for LA and ALA but not the longer chain derivatives in adults. The longer chain derivatives particularly, however, have pharmacological properties that can modulate disease processes, but this should not be confused with dietary essentiality.

One study demonstrated linoleic acid deficiency in adults. They found that patients undergoing intravenous nutrition with glucose became isolated from their fat supplies and rapidly developed biochemical signs of essential fatty acid deficiency (an increase in 20:3n−9/20:4n−6 ratio in plasma) and skin symptoms. This could be treated by infusing lipids, and later studies showed that topical application of sunflower oil would also resolve the dermal symptoms. Linoleic acid has a specific role in maintaining the skin water-permeability barrier, probably as constituents of acylglycosylceramides. This role cannot be met by any ω−3 fatty acids or by arachidonic acid.

The main physiological requirement for ω−6 fatty acids is attributed to arachidonic acid, which is the major precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes that play a vital role in cell signaling, and an endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. Metabolites from the ω−3 pathway, mainly from eicosapentaenoic acid, are mostly inactive.

Reviews by the European Food Safety Authority made recommendations for minimal intakes of LA and ALA and have also recommended intakes of longer chain ω−3 fatty acids based on the association of oily fish consumption with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.

==Food sources==

Some of the food sources of ω−3 and ω−6 fatty acids are fish and shellfish, seaweed oil, flaxseed (linseed) and flaxseed oil, hemp seed, olive oil, soya oil, canola (rapeseed) oil, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, leafy vegetables, and walnuts.

Essential fatty acids play a part in many metabolic processes, and there is evidence to suggest that low levels of essential fatty acids, or the wrong balance of types among the essential fatty acids, may be a factor in a number of illnesses, including osteoporosis.

Fish is the main source of the longer omega−3 fats; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), though they initially acquire these fats through the consumption of algae and seaweed. Some plant-based foods contain omega−3 in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which appears to have a modest benefit for cardiovascular health. The human body can (and in case of a purely vegetarian diet often must unless certain algae or supplements derived from them are consumed) convert ALA to EPA and subsequently DHA. This elongation of ALA is inefficient. Conversion to DHA is higher in women than in men; this is thought to reflect the need to provide DHA to the fetus and infant during pregnancy and breast feeding.

The &quot;IUPAC Lipid Handbook&quot; provides a very large and detailed listing of fat contents of animal and vegetable fats, including ω−3 and −6 oils. The National Institutes of Health&#x27;s EFA Education group publishes &quot;Essential Fats in Food Oils&quot;. This lists 40 common oils, more tightly focused on EFAs and sorted by n−6:3 ratio. &quot;Vegetable Lipids as Components of Functional Food&quot; lists notable vegetable sources of EFAs as well as commentary and an overview of the biosynthetic pathways involved. However, these sources are not in perfect agreement. EFA content of vegetable sources varies with cultivation conditions. Animal sources vary widely, both with the animal&#x27;s feed and that the EFA makeup varies markedly with fats from different body parts.

==Human health==

Essential fatty acids play an important role in the life and death of cardiac cells. Additionally, essential fatty acids are crucial for the development of several endocannabinoids with a multitude of functions in the body, such as docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHA-EA/synaptamide).

=== Reference intake values ===
Reference intake values for as published by the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
In the United States, the Adequate Intake (AI) for omega−3 fatty acids is for ALA. It is based on the median intake, and for adults the values are 1.6 g/day for men and 1.1 g/day for women. EPA and DHA contribute about 10 percent of total omega−3 intake. The AI for omega−6 fatty acids is for linoleic acid and is also based on the median intake: 17 g/day for younger men, dropping to 14 g/day for men over 50 years old; for younger women 12 g/d, and 11 g/day for women over 50. Studies have shown that smaller intakes reverse the symptoms of deficiency, but there is inadequate information to set an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for either.

===Essential fatty acid deficiency===
&quot;Essential fatty acid deficiency&quot; results in a dermatitis similar to that seen in zinc or biotin deficiency.

<text>Abū Jaʿfar ʿAbd Allāh ibn [[Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah|Muḥammad]] al-Manṣūr (; ‎; 95 AH – 158 AH/714 CE – 6 October 775 CE) usually known simply as by his laqab al-Manṣūr (المنصور) was the second Abbasid caliph, reigning from 136 AH to 158 AH (754 CE – 775 CE) succeeding his brother al-Saffah (). He is known for founding the &#x27;Round City&#x27; of Madinat al-Salam, which was to become the core of imperial Baghdad.

Modern historians regard al-Mansur as the real founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, one of the largest polities in world history, for his role in stabilizing and institutionalizing the dynasty.

==Background and early life==
According to al-Suyuti&#x27;s &quot;History of the Caliphs&quot;, al-Mansur lived 95 AH – 158 AH (714 CE – 6 October 775 CE). Al-Mansur was born at the home of the Abbasid family in Humeima (modern-day Jordan) after their emigration from the Hejaz in 714 (95 AH). His mother was Sallamah, a slave woman. Al-Mansur was a brother of al-Saffah. Both were named Abd Allah, and to distinguish between them, al-Saffah was referred to by his &quot;kunya&quot; Abu al-Abbas.

Al-Mansur was a great great-grandson of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, an uncle of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Al-Mansur&#x27;s brother al-Saffah began asserting his claim to become caliph in the 740s and became particularly active in Khorasan, an area where non-Arab Muslims lived. After the death of the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 743 a period of instability followed. Al-Saffah led the Abbasid Revolution in 747 and his claim to power was supported throughout Iraq by Muslims. He became the first caliph of the Abbasid caliphate in 750 after defeating his rivals.

Shortly before the overthrow of the Umayyads by an army of rebels from Khorasan that were influenced by propaganda spread by the Abbasids, the last Umayyad Caliph Marwan II, arrested the head of the Abbasid family, Al Mansur&#x27;s other brother Ibrahim. Al-Mansur fled with the rest of his family to Kufa where some of the Khorasanian rebel leaders gave their allegiance to his brother al-Saffah. Ibrahim died in captivity and al-Saffah became the first Abbasid Caliph. During his brother&#x27;s reign, al-Mansur led an army to Mesopotamia where he received a submission from the governor after informing him of the last Umayyad Caliph&#x27;s death. The last Umayyad governor had taken refuge in Iraq in a garrison town. He was promised a safe-conduct by al-Mansur and the Caliph al-Saffah, but after surrendering the town, he was executed with a number of his followers.

According to &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot;, a history book in Arabic written around 947 CE, al-Mansur&#x27;s dislike of the Umayyad dynasty is well documented and he has been reported saying:
&quot;The Umayyads held the government which had been given to them with a firm hand, protecting, preserving and guarding the gift granted them by God. But then their power passed to their effeminate sons, whose only ambition was the satisfaction of their desires and who chased after pleasures forbidden by Almighty God...Then God stripped them of their power, covered them with shame and deprived them of their worldly goods&quot;.
Mansur&#x27;s first wife was a Yemeni woman from a royal family; his second was a descendant of a hero of the early Muslim conquests; his third was an Iranian servant. He also had a minimum of three concubines: an Arab, a Byzantine, nicknamed the “restless butterfly,&quot; and a Kurd.

==Caliphate ==
Al-Saffah died after a short five-year reign and al-Mansur took on the responsibility of establishing the Abbasid caliphate by holding on to power for nearly 22 years, from Dhu al-Hijjah 136 AH until Dhu al-Hijjah 158 AH (754 – 775). Al-Mansur was proclaimed Caliph on his way to Mecca in the year 753 (136 AH) and was inaugurated the following year. Abu Ja&#x27;far Abdallah ibn Muhammad took the name al-Mansur (&quot;the victorious&quot;) and agreed to make his nephew Isa ibn Musa his successor to the Abbasid caliphate. This agreement was supposed to resolve rivalries in the Abbasid family, but al-Mansur&#x27;s right to accession was particularly challenged by his uncle Abdullah ibn Ali. Once in power as caliph, al-Mansur had his uncle imprisoned in 754 and killed in 764.

==Execution of Abu Muslim and aftermath==

Fearing the increasing power of the Abbasid general Abu Muslim, who gained popularity among the people, al-Mansur carefully planned his assassination. Abu Muslim was conversing with the Caliph when, at an appointed signal, four (some sources say five) of his guards rushed in and fatally wounded the general. John Aikin, in his work &quot;General Biography&quot;, narrates that Mansur, not content with the assassination, committed &quot;outrages on the dead body, and kept it several days in order to glut his eyes with the spectacle.&quot;

The Execution of Abu Muslim caused uproars throughout the province of Khorasan. In 755 Sunpadh, an Iranian nobleman from the House of Karen, led a revolt against al-Mansur, taking the cities of Nishapur, Qumis, and Ray. In Ray, he seized the treasuries of Abu Muslim. He gained many supporters from Jibal and Tabaristan, including the Dabuyid ruler, Khurshid, who was paid with money from the treasures. Al-Mansur ordered a force of 10,000 under Abbasid commander Jahwar ibn Marrar al-lijli to march without delay to Khorasan to fight the rebellion. Sunpadh was defeated and Khorasan reclaimed by the Abbasids.

Al-Mansur sent an official to take inventory of the spoils collected from the battle as a precautionary measure against acquisition by his army. Angered by al-Mansur&#x27;s avarice, general Jahwar gained support from his troops for his plans to split the treasures evenly, and revolted against the caliph. This raised alarm in the caliph&#x27;s court and al-Mansur ordered Mohammad ibn Ashar to march towards Khorasan. Jahwar, knowing his troops were at a disadvantage, retired to Isfahan and fortified in preparation. Mohammad&#x27;s army pressed the rebel forces and Jahwar fled to Azerbaijan. Jahwar&#x27;s forces were defeated, but he escaped Mohammad&#x27;s pursuit. This campaign lasted from 756 to 762 CE (138 to 144 AH). In 759, al-Mansur sent an army under his generals Abu al-Khaṣīb Marzuq and Khazim ibn Khuzayma to Tabaristan to punish Khurshid for his support to Sunpadh. Khurshid was defeated and Abu al-Khasib was appointed as the governor of the region.

After relieving former vizier ibn Attiya al-Bahili, al-Mansur transferred his duties to Abu Ayyub al-Muriyani from Khuzestan. Abu Ayyub was previously a secretary to Sulayman ibn Habib ibn al-Muhallab, who in the past, had condemned al-Mansur to be whipped and flogged to pieces. Abu Ayyub had rescued al-Mansur from this punishment. Nevertheless, after appointing him as vizier, al-Mansur suspected Abu Ayyub of various crimes, including extortion and treachery, which led to the latter&#x27;s assassination. The vacant secretary role was granted to Aban ibn Sadaqa until the death of the caliph al-Mansur.

==Foundation of Baghdad==

In 757 CE, al-Mansur sent a large army to Cappadocia which fortified the city of Malatya. In this same year, he confronted a group of the Rawandiyya from the region of Greater Khorasan that were performing circumambulation around his palace as an act of worship. When in 758/9 the people of Khorasan rioted against al-Mansur in the battle of Al Hashimiya, Ma&#x27;n ibn Za&#x27;ida al-Shaybani, a general from the Shayban tribe and companion of Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari, the Umayyad governor of Iraq, appeared at the scene of the uprising completely masked, and threw himself between the crowd and Mansur, driving the insurgents away. Ma&#x27;n reveals himself to al-Mansur as &quot;he whom you have been searching&quot; and upon hearing this, al-Mansur granted him rewards, robes of honor, rank, and amnesty from previously serving the Umayyad dynasty.
In 762 two descendants of Hasan ibn Ali rebelled in Medina and Basra. Al-Mansur&#x27;s troops defeated the rebels first in Medina and then in Basra. This would be the last major uprising against the caliph al-Mansur.

To consolidate his power al-Mansur founded the new imperial residence and palace city Madinat as-Salam (the city of peace), which became the core of the Imperial capital Baghdad. Al-Mansur laid the foundations of Baghdad near the old capital of al-Mada&#x27;in, on the western bank of the Tigris River, a location acceptable to him and his commanders. The circular city of about 2.4 km diameter was enclosed by a double-thick defensive wall with four gates named Kufa, Syria, Khorasan, and Basra. In the center of the city al-Mansur erected the caliph&#x27;s palace and the main mosque. Al-Mansur had built Baghdad in response to a growing concern from the chief towns in Iraq, Basra, and Kufa that there was lack of solidity within the regime after the death of Abu&#x27;l &#x27;Abbas (later known as al-Saffah). Another reason for the construction of the new capital was the growing need to house and provide stability for a rapidly developing Abbasid bureaucracy forged under the influence of Iranian ideals. The medieval historians al-Tabari and al-Khatib al-Baghdadi would later claim that al-Mansur had ordered the demolition of the Khosrow palace in Ctesiphon so that the material could be used for the construction of the &quot;city of peace&quot;.

Al-Mansur pursued his vision of a powerful centralized caliphate in the new Muslim imperial capital of Baghdad. The city was populated with men and women of different faiths and cultures from all over the Islamic world. The Baghdad populace included Christian, Zoroastrian and Jewish minorities and communicated in Arabic. Al-Mansur pursued Islamization by staffing his administration with Muslims of varied backgrounds. Baghdad became one of al-Mansur&#x27;s lasting achievements. His rule was largely peaceful as he focused on internal reforms, agriculture and patronage of the sciences, thus he paved the way for Baghdad to become a global center of learning and science under the rule of the seventh Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun.

In 764 al-Mansur&#x27;s son al-Mahdi was made the designated heir to the caliphate, taking precedence over al-Mansur&#x27;s nephew Isa ibn Musa, who had been named the designated successor when al-Mansur was crowned caliph. This change in succession was opposed by parts of the Abbasid family and some allies of Isa ibn Musa in Khurasan, but was supported by the Abbasid army. Al-Mansur had cultivated support for his son&#x27;s accession since 754, while undermining Isa ibn Musa&#x27;s position within the Abbasid military.

Al-Tabari writes in his &quot;History of Prophets and Kings&quot;: &quot;Abu Ja&#x27;far had a mirror in which he could descry his enemy from his friend.&quot; Al-Mansur&#x27;s secret service extended to remote regions of his empire, and were cognizant of everything from social unrest to the price of figs, making Mansur very knowledgeable of his domains. He rose at dawn, worked until evening prayer. He set the example for his son and heir. According to historic sources al-Mansur advised his son: “put not off the work of today until tomorrow and attend in person to the affairs of state. Sleep not, for thy father has not slept since he came to the caliphate. For when sleep fell upon his eyes, his spirit remained awake.” Notably frugal, al-Mansur was nicknamed Abu al-Duwaneek (“the Father of Small Change”), kept close tabs on his tax collectors, and made sure public spending was carefully monitored. He is reported as having said “he who has no money has no men, and he who has no men watches as his enemies grow great.”

==Islamic scholars under him==
The Alids, a group descended from Muhammad&#x27;s closest male relative and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, had fought with the Abbasids against the Umayyads. They wanted the power to be given to the Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, a great-grandson of Ali and one of the most influential scholars in Islamic jurisprudence at the time. When it became clear that the Abbasid family had no intention of handing the power to an Alid, groups loyal to Ali moved into opposition. When al-Mansur came to power as second Abbasid caliph he started to suppress what he perceived as extreme elements in the broad Muslim coalition that had supported the Abbasid Revolution. He would be the first Abbasid caliph to uphold Islamic orthodoxy as a matter of public policy. While al-Mansur&#x27;s regime did not intrude into the private realm of elites, orthodoxy was promoted in public worship, for example through the organization of pilgrim caravans. Al-Mansur&#x27;s harsh treatment towards the Alids led to a revolt in 762–763, but they were eventually defeated.

Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq became the victim of harassment by the Abbasid family and in response to his growing popularity among the people was eventually poisoned on the orders of the caliph in the tenth year of al-Mansur&#x27;s reign. According to a number of sources, Abu Hanifa an-Nu&#x27;man, who founded a school of jurisprudence, was imprisoned by al-Mansur. Malik ibn Anas, the founder of another school, was flogged during his rule, but al-Mansur himself did not condone this. Al-Mansur&#x27;s cousin, the governor of Madinah at the time, had ordered the flogging and was punished for doing so. Muhammad and Ibrahim ibn Abdallah, the grandsons of Imam Hassan ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad, were persecuted by al-Mansur after rebelling against his reign. They escaped his persecution, but al-Mansur&#x27;s anger fell upon their father Abdallah ibn Hassan and others of his family. Abdallah&#x27;s sons were later defeated and killed.

==Patronage for translations and scholarship ==

Al-Mansur was the first Abbasid caliph to sponsor the Translation Movement. Al-Mansur was particularly interested in sponsoring the translations of texts on astronomy and astrology. Al-Mansur called scientists to his court and became noted as patron of astronomers. When al-Mansur&#x27;s Baghdad court was presented with the &quot;Zij al-Sindhind&quot;, an Indian astronomical handbook that included tables to calculate celestial positions, al-Mansur ordered for this major Indian work on astronomy to be translated from Sanskrit to Arabic. The astronomical tables in the Arabic translation of &quot;Zij al-Sindhind&quot; became widely adopted by Muslim scholars. During al-Mansur reign Greek works were also translated, such Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

Al-Mansur had Persian books on astronomy, mathematics, medicine, philosophy and other sciences translated in a systematic campaign to collect knowledge. The translation of Persian books was part of a growing interest in ancient Iranian heritage and a Persian revivalist movement which al-Mansur sponsored. The translation and study of works in Pahlavi, a pre-Islamic language of Persia, became fashionable among intellectuals and authors who supported the Abbasid caliphate. Government secretaries of Persian descent in al-Mansur&#x27;s administration sponsored translations of Pahlavi texts on the history and principles of royal administration. Popular Arabic translations were produced by Ibn al-Muqaffa of texts that documented the systems and hierarchies of the Sasanian Empire.

Al-Mansur was greatly interested in the quality of the translation and paid al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar to translate Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; twice. Al-Mansur paid for the physician Jabril ibn Bukhtishu to write Arabic translations of medical books, while the first Arabic translations of medical texts written by Galen and Hippocrates were done by al-Mansur&#x27;s official translator. In 765 al-Mansur suffered from a stomach ailment and called the Christian Syriac-speaking physician Jurjis ibn Bukhtishu from Gundeshapur to Baghdad for medical treatment. In doing so al-Mansur started the tradition among Abbasid caliphs, who would pay physicians of the Nestorian Christian Bukhtishu family to attend to their needs and to write original Arabic medical treatises, as well as translate medical texts into Arabic.

==Foreign policy==

In 751 the first Abbasid caliph al-Saffah had defeated the Chinese Tang dynasty in the Battle of Talas. Chinese sources record that al-Mansur sent his diplomatic delegations regularly to China. Al-Mansur&#x27;s delegations were known in China as &quot;Heiyi Dashi&quot; (&quot;Black Clothed Arabs&quot;). In 756 al-Mansur sent 3,000 mercenaries to assist Emperor Suzong of Tang in the An Lushan rebellion. A massacre of foreign Arab and Persian Muslim merchants by former Yan rebel general Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760),

The Byzantine emperor Constantine V had used the weakness of the Umayyad caliphate to regain land from Muslim rulers. After the Umayyad caliphate was defeated by al-Mansur&#x27;s predecessor al-Saffah, Constantine V invaded Armenia and occupied parts of it throughout 751 and 752. Under al-Mansur&#x27;s rule Muslim armies conducted raids on Byzantine territory. Al-Mansur was the first Abbasid caliph to hold a ransom meeting with the Byzantine Empire. Diplomats in the service of Constantine V and al-Mansur first negotiated the exchange of prisoners in 756.

In 763 al-Mansur sent his troops to conquer al-Andalus for the Abbasid empire. But the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman I successfully defended his territory. Al-Mansur withdrew and thereafter focused his troops of holding the eastern part of his empire on lands that were once part of Persia.

Some historians credit al-Mansur with starting the Abbasid–Carolingian alliance. In fact, it was the first Carolingian king Pippin III who initiated a new era of Franconian diplomacy by sending diplomatic envoys to al-Mansur&#x27;s Baghdad court in 765. It is probable that Pippin III sought an alliance with al-Mansur against their common enemies, the Emirate of Córdoba. In 768 the envoys of Pippin III returned to Francia along with caliph al-Mansur&#x27;s ambassadors. Pippin III received al-Mansur&#x27;s delegation in Aquitaine and gifts were exchanged as a sign of the new alliance. This alliance was solidified when between 797 and 807 king Charlemagne and caliph Harun al-Rashid established embassies.

Al-Mansur&#x27;s treatment of his Christian subjects was severe; he &quot;collected from them capitation with much vigor and impressed upon them marks of slavery.&quot;

==Family==
Al-Mansur&#x27;s first wife was Arwa known as Umm Musa, whose lineage went back to the 
kings of Himyar. Her father was Mansur al-Himyari. She had a brother named Yazid. She had two sons, Muhammad (future Caliph al-Mahdi) and Ja&#x27;far. She died in 764. Another wife was Hammadah. Her father was Isa, one of al-Mansur&#x27;s uncles. She died during al-Mansur&#x27;s caliphate. Another wife was Fatimah. Her father was Muhammad, one of the descendants of Talhah ibn Ubaydullah. She had three sons, Sulayman, Isa, and Ya&#x27;qub. One of his concubines was a Kurdish woman. She was the mother of al-Mansur&#x27;s son Ja&#x27;far &#x27;Ibn al-Kurdiyyah&#x27; (Nasab translating to &quot;Son of the Kurdish woman&quot;). Unlike his other adult half-brothers, little is known of Ja&#x27;far and he likely was not involved in politics or had marriage or issue. However, his death is recorded at 802 AD by palace records suggesting he lived into adulthood and continued to live at court rather than having been banished or dying before adulthood. Another concubine was Qali-al Farrashah. She was a Greek, and was the mother of al-Mansur&#x27;s son Salih al-Miskin. Another concubine was Umm al-Qasim, whose son al-Qasim died at aged ten. Al-Masnur&#x27;s only daughter Aliyah was born to an Umayyad woman. She married Ishaq ibn Sulayman.

==Death==
Al-Mas&#x27;udi writes that Mansur died on Saturday 6, Dhu al-Hijja 158 AH/775 CE. There are varying accounts of the location and circumstances of al-Mansur&#x27;s death. One account narrates that al-Mansur was on a pilgrimage to Mecca and had nearly reached, when death overtook him at a location called the Garden of the Bani Amir on the high road to Iraq at the age of sixty-three. According to this narration, he was buried in Mecca with his face uncovered because he was wearing the ihram clothing. 100 graves were dug around Mecca with the intention to thwart any attempt to find and violate his bones.

A different narration from Fadl ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, who claimed to have been with Mansur at his time of death, states that he died at al-Batha&#x27; near the Well of Maimun in which he would have been buried at al-Hajun at sixty-five years of age. In this narration, Mansur was sitting in a domed room hallucinating about ill-omen writings on the wall. When al-Rabiah replied &quot;I see nothing written on the wall. Its surface is clean and white,&quot; al-Mansur replied, &quot;my soul is warned that she may prepare for her near departure.&quot; After reaching the Well of Maimun, he reportedly said &quot;God be praised&quot; and succumbed to death that very day.

When al-Mansur died, the caliphate&#x27;s treasury contained 600,000,000 dirhams and fourteen million dinars. On his deathbed, Mansur said, “We have sacrificed the life to come for a mere dream!”

<doc id="105952" wikidata="Q150440" url="?curid=105952" title="Hexane">
<text>Hexane () or &quot;n&quot;-hexane is an organic compound, a straight-chain alkane with six carbon atoms and the molecular formula C6H14.

Hexane is a colorless liquid, odorless when pure, and with a boiling point of approximately . It is widely used as a cheap, relatively safe, largely unreactive, and easily evaporated non-polar solvent, and modern gasoline blends contain about 3% hexane.

The term hexanes refers to a mixture, composed largely (&gt;60%) of &quot;n&quot;-hexane, with varying amounts of the isomeric compounds 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane, and possibly, smaller amounts of nonisomeric C5, C6, and C7 (cyclo)alkanes. These &quot;hexanes&quot; mixtures are cheaper than pure hexane and are often used in large-scale operations not requiring a single isomer (e.g., as cleaning solvent or for chromatography).

==Isomers==

==Uses==
In industry, hexanes are used in the formulation of glues for shoes, leather products, and roofing. They are also used to extract cooking oils (such as canola oil or soybean oil) from seeds, for cleansing and degreasing a variety of items, and in textile manufacturing.

A typical laboratory use of hexanes is to extract oil and grease contaminants from water and soil for analysis. Since hexane cannot be easily deprotonated, it is used in the laboratory for reactions that involve very strong bases, such as the preparation of organolithiums. For example, butyllithiums are typically supplied as a hexane solution.

Hexanes are commonly used in chromatography as a non-polar solvent. Higher alkanes present as impurities in hexanes have similar retention times as the solvent, meaning that fractions containing hexane will also contain these impurities. In preparative chromatography, concentration of a large volume of hexanes can result in a sample that is appreciably contaminated by alkanes. This may result in a solid compound being obtained as an oil and the alkanes may interfere with analysis.

As an internal combustion engine fuel, n-hexane has low research and motor octane numbers of 25 and 26 respectively. In 1983 its share in Japanese gasoline varied around 6%, in 1992 it was present in American gas between 1 and 3%, and in Swedish automobile fuel in the same year the share was consistently under 2%, often below 1%. By 2011 its share in US gas stood between 1 and 7%.

==Production==
Hexane is chiefly obtained by refining crude oil. The exact composition of the fraction depends largely on the source of the oil (crude or reformed) and the constraints of the refining. The industrial product (usually around 50% by weight of the straight-chain isomer) is the fraction boiling at .

==Physical properties==
All alkanes are colorless. The boiling points of the various hexanes are somewhat similar and, as for other alkanes, are generally lower for the more branched forms. The melting points are quite different and the trend is not apparent.

Hexane has considerable vapor pressure at room temperature:

==Reactivity==
Like most alkanes, hexanes characteristically exhibit low reactivity and are suitable solvents for reactive compounds. Commercial samples of &quot;n&quot;-hexane however often contains methylcyclopentane, which features tertiary C-H bonds, which are incompatible with some radical reactions.

== Safety ==
Inhalation of &quot;n&quot;-hexane at 5000 ppm for 10 minutes produces marked vertigo; 2500-1000 ppm for 12 hours produces drowsiness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and paresthesia in the distal extremities; 2500–5000 ppm produces muscle weakness, cold pulsation in the extremities, blurred vision, headache, and anorexia. Chronic occupational exposure to elevated levels of &quot;n&quot;-hexane has been demonstrated to be associated with peripheral neuropathy in auto mechanics in the US, and neurotoxicity in workers in printing presses, and shoe and furniture factories in Asia, Europe, and North America.

The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for hexane isomers (not &quot;n&quot;-hexane) of 100 ppm () over an 8-hour workday. However, for &quot;n&quot;-hexane, the current NIOSH REL is 50 ppm () over an 8-hour workday. This limit was proposed as a permissible exposure limit (PEL) by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1989; however, this PEL was overruled in US courts in 1992. The current n-hexane PEL in the US is 500 ppm ().

Hexane and other volatile hydrocarbons (petroleum ether) present an aspiration risk. &quot;n&quot;-Hexane is sometimes used as a denaturant for alcohol, and as a cleaning agent in the textile, furniture, and leather industries. It is slowly being replaced with other solvents.

Like gasoline, hexane is highly volatile and is an explosion risk. The 1981 Louisville sewer explosions, which destroyed over of sewer lines and streets in Kentucky, were caused by ignition of hexane vapors which had been illegally discharged from a soybean processing plant owned by Ralston-Purina. Hexane was attributed as the cause of an explosion that occurred in the National University of Río Cuarto, Argentina on 5 December 2007, due to a hexane spill near a heat-producing machine that exploded, producing a fire that killed one student and injured 24 more.

===Incidents===
Occupational hexane poisoning has occurred with Japanese sandal workers, Italian shoe workers, Taiwan press proofing workers, and others. Analysis of Taiwanese workers has shown occupational exposure to substances including &quot;n&quot;-hexane. In 2010–2011, Chinese workers manufacturing iPhones were reported to have suffered hexane poisoning.

===Biotransformation===
&quot;n&quot;-Hexane is biotransformed to 2-hexanol and further to 2,5-hexanediol in the body. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome P450 utilizing oxygen from air. 2,5-Hexanediol may be further oxidized to 2,5-hexanedione, which is neurotoxic and produces a polyneuropathy. In view of this behavior, replacement of &quot;n&quot;-hexane as a solvent has been discussed. &quot;n&quot;-Heptane is a possible alternative.

<text>The crab louse or pubic louse (&quot;Pthirus pubis&quot;) is an insect that is an obligate ectoparasite of humans, feeding exclusively on blood. The crab louse usually is found in the person&#x27;s pubic hair. Although the louse cannot jump, it can also live in other areas of the body that are covered with coarse hair, such as the perianal area, the entire body (in men), and the eyelashes (in children).

Humans are the only known hosts of the crab louse, although a closely related species, &quot;Pthirus gorillae&quot;, infects gorillas. The human parasite is thought to have diverged from &quot;Pthirus gorillae&quot; approximately 3.3 million years ago. It is more distantly related to the genus &quot;Pediculus&quot;, which contains the human head and body lice and lice that affect chimpanzees and bonobos.

==Description==
An adult crab louse is about 1.3–2 mm long (slightly smaller than the body louse and head louse), and can be distinguished from those other species by its almost round body. Another distinguishing feature is that the second and third pairs of legs of a crab louse are much thicker than the front legs and have large claws.

==Life cycle==
The eggs of the crab louse are laid usually on the coarse hairs of the genital and regions of the human body. The female lays about three eggs a day. The eggs take 6–8 days to hatch, and there are three nymphal stages which together take 10–17 days before the adult develops, making a total life cycle from egg to adult of 16–25 days. Adults live for up to 30 days. Crab lice feed exclusively on blood, and take a blood meal 4–5 times daily. Outside the host they can survive for 24–48 hours. Crab lice are transmitted from person to person most commonly via sexual contact, although (bedding, clothing) may play a minor role in their transmission.

==Infestation of humans==


Infestation of the eyelashes is referred to as pediculosis ciliaris or phthiriasis palpebrarum.

The main symptom of infestation with crab lice is itching, usually in the pubic-hair area, resulting from hypersensitivity to louse saliva, which can become stronger over two or more weeks following initial infestation. In some infestations, a characteristic grey-blue or slate coloration appears (&quot;maculae caeruleae&quot;) at the feeding site, which may last for several days.

The prevalence varies between 0.3% to 4.6% with an estimated average of 2% with an increase during war, disasters and in overcrowding. Crab louse infestations are not considered a reportable condition by many health authorities, and many cases are self-treated or treated discreetly by physicians.

It has been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans removing their pubic hair, especially in women, has led to reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world.
While crab lice are not known to transmit disease, the possibility has been raised they may be a vector for Bartonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp which might require further study. In infested individuals an average of a dozen lice can be found. Although they are typically found attached to hair in the pubic area, sometimes they are also found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, moustache, chest, armpits, etc.). They do not generally occur on the finer hair of the scalp. Crab lice attach to pubic hair that is thicker than other body hair because their claws are adapted to the specific diameter of pubic hair and other thick hairs of the body. Crab louse infestations (pthiriasis) are usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. The crab louse can travel up to on the body. Crab louse infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races and ethnic groups and in all socio-economic levels. Occasionally they may be also transmitted by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linen, and towels that have been used by an infested person.

Crab lice found on the head or eyelashes of children may be an indication of sexual exposure or abuse. Symptoms of crab louse infestation in the pubic area include itching, redness and inflammation. Crab lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection can occur from scratching of the skin.

Crab louse infestation can be diagnosed by identifying the presence of active stages of the louse, as well as of eggs (nits) on the pubic hair and other hairs of the body. When infestation is diagnosed, other family members and contact persons should also be examined. A magnifying glass or dermoscope could be used for better identification.

<text>Amway North America (formerly known as [[Quixtar]] North America) is an American worldwide multi-level marketing (MLM) company, founded 1959 in Ada, Michigan, United States. It is privately owned by the families of Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel through Alticor which is the holding company for businesses including Amway, Amway Global, Fulton Innovation, Amway Hotel Corporation, Hatteras Yachts, and manufacturing and logistics company Access Business Group. After the launch of Amway Global (originally operating under the name Quixtar), it replaced the Amway business in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, with the Amway business continuing to operate in other countries around the world. On May 1, 2009, Quixtar made the name change to Amway Global and fused the various different entities of the parent company.

Amway Global is a member of the Direct Selling Association and the Better Business Bureau.

==History==
Rich DeVos and Jay Van Andel initially founded the Ja-Ri Corporation, a multi-level marketing distributorship for Nutrilite products, in 1949. Ja-Ri was incorporated in 1959 and changed its name to &quot;Amway&quot; (American Way) in 1963. , Amway operates in more than 100 countries around the world. In 1999, the founders of the Amway corporation launched a sister Internet-based company named Quixtar. The Alticor corporation owns both Amway and Quixtar, plus several other concerns. Quixtar replaced the North American business of Amway in 2001 after the majority of the distributors moved to Quixtar, with Amway operating in the rest of the world.

The move unified the various Amway companies worldwide. &quot;We&#x27;re now reintroducing our brands in North America, moving away from Quixtar and going back to the Amway name,&quot; said Steve Lieberman, managing director of Amway Global. &quot;We decided there were a number of roads we had to go down in order to recreate awareness for a brand that, quite frankly, a lot of people felt had gone away.&quot;

==Products==
Quixtar is the exclusive distributor of Alticor products in the United States and Canada, including Nutrilite dietary supplements, XS Energy Drinks, personal care, home care, air and water purifiers and Artistry cosmetics.

==Business model==
Quixtar relies primarily on person-to-person referral rather than advertisements for the sale of products; however, Quixtar announced the launch of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign in 2012. A large part of the marketing budget is spent on paying bonuses to distributors. Independent Business Owners (IBOs) were paid more than $370.1 million in bonuses and incentives in the fiscal year 2006. Bonuses are paid for individual sales and sales generated by people one sponsor but not for sponsoring itself.

In 2001, after the majority of Amway IBOs had transferred to the new company, Quixtar completely replaced Amway as the marketing venture for Amway/Alticor products in North American regions. The Quixtar business model differs from the earlier Amway business model in many aspects, such as the way distribution is performed as well as the products and services offered through partner stores. Rather than ordering a product from a distributor who delivers them in person, Quixtar customers can place orders online and have the products shipped to them directly. In mid-2007, however, Quixtar announced they were phasing back in the Amway name over two years and discarding the Quixtar name. Along with the re-branding campaign, Amway Global is investing over 580 million dollars into both increased compensation for IBOs and extensive advertising of the new brand name.

Individuals may buy products through Quixtar&#x27;s web site with a referral number from an IBO. Quixtar also gives IBOs the option to create free personal websites that can be personalized to focus on health, beauty, health and beauty, and/or gift and incentive products. The referring IBO then receives the retail/wholesale profit (usually 30%), and a percentage (&quot;bonus&quot;) of the cost of the sold goods (from 3% up to 31% depending on total PV generated), with Quixtar-exclusive products yielding a higher bonus per dollar in Point Value and Business Value (PV/BV). Quixtar offers a wide range of products for its IBOs to purchase for personal use and/or to sell to customers through Quixtar.com and IBO personal e-commerce sites.

IBOs pay a registration fee and build their businesses through retail sales to customers, referring business to Quixtar.com, and by helping other IBOs build similar businesses. Their earnings are based on their business&#x27;s sales and the volume of sales and purchases of IBOs registered by them.

===Income of Quixtar IBOs===

Quixtar IBOs earn income in different forms in various categories, including IGP (Immediate Gross Profit), Performance Bonus, Leadership Bonus, and other Growth incentives. IGP is the profit made when customers of an IBO buy products and services from Quixtar at retail price. Performance bonus on a scale of 3% to 25% of the group volume (total BV of the sale made by the group) is paid if the PV level of the IBO is more than 100 PV in a month. The leadership bonus is paid at 4% of BV of each qualifying leg, which is at 25% or 7500 PV. Growth incentives are announced by Quixtar every year in the form of bonuses and paid trips at various levels. These bonuses are awarded to IBOs who are at Platinum or higher achievement levels.

Quixtar reports that the average income for an &quot;active&quot; Quixtar IBO in 2005 was $115 a month ($1,380 annually), as documented in &quot;The Quixtar IBO Compensation Plan&quot; and on a Quixtar website. The average annual Quixtar income for an IBO that qualified at the &quot;Platinum&quot; level in 2005 (0.1683% of IBOs) was $47,472 and for a &quot;Diamond&quot; (.0120% of IBOs) it was $146,995. The largest single annual bonus (in addition to monthly incomes) for a Diamond was $1,083,421.

This said, according to Inter@ctive Week, &quot;The commissions aren&#x27;t all that great, even though they can add up to greater than 50 percent of the cost of the goods sold. If privately held Amway generated $6 billion in sales in 1998 as estimated, then each of its 1 million distributors would have pulled in, on average, only $6,000. It&#x27;s nice extra income, but a livelihood only for the most talented, hardworking or aggressive. Or, for those with a large personal family tree.

That&#x27;s because this form of marketing relies on what Ken McDonald, regional vice president at Amway North America, calls &quot;high touch.&quot; This is what amounts to the need for agents or distributors to reach out and touch people they personally know, in order to make a sale. Almost all Amway sales start with face-to-face contact between people familiar with each other&quot; (Inter@ctive Week).

An &quot;active&quot; IBO is qualified on the IBO Registration form: &quot;Based on an independent survey during 2001, “Active” means an IBO attempted to make a retail sale, or presented the Independent Business Ownership Plan, or received bonus money, or attended a company or IBO meeting in the year 2000. Approximately 66% of all IBOs of record were found to be &quot;Active.&quot;&quot;

===IBO Association International===

The IBO Association International (IBOAI) was founded in 1959 as the American Way Association with the goal of &quot;serving the common interests of Independent Business Owners throughout North America.&quot; Members are served by an 18-member Board of Directors who are supported by seven full-time staff. The Association&#x27;s board members are &quot;elected by its voting members&quot;.

===Accreditation===
In 2006, Quixtar, in partnership with the IBOAI (IBO Association International) launched the &quot;Quixtar Accreditation&quot; program in order to address concerns about the companies that provide Business Support Materials to Quixtar IBOs. North American &quot;Diamonds&quot; (high-level IBOs) and their associated training companies may apply to Quixtar to be accredited by the corporation. Among other things, accreditation specifically states that promotion of particular religious or political viewpoints is unacceptable. Additionally, accredited programs must agree to a range of other guidelines, including &quot;full&quot; transparency in any compensation paid for Business Support Materials. The &quot;full&quot; transparency only applies to the IBO&#x27;s who are participants in the BSM income, for most groups this means Platinums and above, representing a very small percentage of IBO&#x27;s. Accreditation lasts two years and is enforced through reviews of materials and surveys of IBOs. The full guidelines are listed in the &quot;IBO Communications Platform&quot;. In April 2006 &quot;eFinity&quot; became the first Quixtar affiliated support organization to receive accredited status.

==Sales and ranking==
Forbes ranked Alticor, as America&#x27;s 27th largest privately owned company with estimated revenue of $7.29 billion. In 2006, Internet Retailer ranked Quixtar.com as the number one site in the &quot;health and beauty&quot; category and 18th largest e-commerce site (for revenue) overall.

Quixtar-powered IBOs generated revenues of $1.118 billion for Quixtar for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the fourth consecutive year in which the company surpassed the billion-dollar mark. IBOs also generated record $84.6 million in revenues for Quixtar’s Partner Stores in 2006.

===Promotion===
Athletes who have promoted Quixtar or its products include Jamaican Olympic sprinter Asafa Powell, American pole vaulter Jennifer Stuczynski, American Olympic sprinter Sanya Richards, U.S. Olympian Shaun White, Cinematographer Wes Anderson, Chinese Olympic hurdler Liu Xiang; Brazilian soccer player Ronaldinho, heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield, and Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne. Tim Foley, a member of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, is a Quixtar Founders Crown Ambassador.

Author John C. Maxwell, who writes leadership books including &quot;The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership&quot;, co-authored &quot;Becoming a Person of Influence&quot; with Jim Dornan, Quixtar Founders Crown Ambassador and founder of Quixtar support organization Network TwentyOne. Orrin Woodward and Chris Brady, both former IBOAI board members for Quixtar, co-authored the #1 bestseller, &quot;Launching a Leadership Revolution&quot;. Both Woodward and Brady were terminated by Quixtar and participated in a class action lawsuit against Quixtar alleging that Quixtar operated as an illegal recruitment scheme.

As a guest speaker at the Quixtar LIVE! conference in 2003, Phil McGraw (&quot;Dr. Phil&quot;) reportedly described Quixtar as &quot;one of the greatest success stories in American business history.&quot; In a 2006 settlement involving a class-action lawsuit brought against McGraw and his Shape-Up diet products, plaintiffs received a share of $6.0 million in Quixtar-brand Nutrilite vitamins and $4.5 million in cash.

===Sports Interests===

====Orlando Arena naming rights====
In December 2006, Amway secured the naming rights for the Orlando Arena, home to the NBA&#x27;s Orlando Magic, which was formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre. In the deal, the arena became known as Amway Arena. As part of the contract, Amway also had the exclusive right to first negotiations for the naming rights of the arena&#x27;s successor, and secured in early August 2009 a 10-year deal to name the new facility Amway Center.

On December 20, 2023, Amway Center was formally renamed the Kia Center in partnership with Kia America. 

====San Jose Earthquakes====
Prior to the 2009 Major League Soccer season, Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the San Jose Earthquakes to become the team&#x27;s official jersey sponsor.

A major part of the partnership is focused on community initiatives in the Bay Area. As a result, Amway Global is now also the official sponsor of the team&#x27;s &quot;Kicks for Kids&quot; program that focuses on fitness and healthy lifestyles, as well as bringing underprivileged children to Earthquakes games.

The partnership also saw the creation of the Amway Global Street Team, which appears at all Earthquakes home games and at a number of soccer and non-soccer events throughout the Bay Area. The members of the Amway Global Street Team give away Earthquakes-branded merchandise and provide soccer skills demonstrations at each event.

, Amway officially ended their 3-year contract with the Earthquakes to be their official sponsor.

====Los Angeles Sol====
In March 2009, Amway Global signed a multi-year deal to become the official presenting partner of the Los Angeles Sol of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer. That deal would last only one year, as the Sol folded after the 2009 season.

==Controversies==

===Litigation===
For several years Quixtar was involved in litigation with the tools businesses of former Crown Distributor Kenny Stewart and Double Diamond Brig Hart. In February 2008 a federal judge dismissed the case.

A class action lawsuit was filed in 2007 against Quixtar and some of its top-level distributors in California, alleging fraud, racketeering, and that the products business and the tools business are pyramid schemes. A similar case filed in California in August 2007 by TEAM affiliated IBOs whose contracts had been terminated was dismissed. On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56 million to settle the class action, $34 million in cash and $22 million in products, and while denying any wrongdoing or liability, acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which is expected in early 2011. The total economic value of the settlement, including the changes to the business model, is $100 million.

In his online book &quot;Merchants of Deception&quot;, former Quixtar IBO Eric Scheibeler stated that he and his family received death threats from his uplines during a business meeting and from an anonymous phone call. In 2006, a Swedish newspaper published statements attributed to Scheibeler which implied that Amway/Quixtar employees were responsible for these threats. Amway and Quixtar sued Scheibeler on February 27, 2007 for defamation. In July 2007, Scheibeler wrote a letter to an attorney for Amway and Quixtar clarifying among other things that, to his knowledge, Doug DeVos or Amway/Quixtar employees never made any death threats to him.

===FTC investigations===
The Federal Trade Commission offers advice for potential MLM members to help them identify those which are likely to be pyramid schemes.

In the 1979 ruling &quot;In re. Amway Corp.&quot;, the Federal Trade Commission determined that Quixtar predecessor Amway was not an illegal pyramid scheme because no payments were made for recruitment. In addition, Amway (and later Quixtar) rules required distributors to sell to at least 10 retail customers per month, or have $100 in product sales, or a total of 50 PV from customer purchases in order to qualify for bonuses on downline volume. Quixtar IBOs are required to report this customer volume on Quixtar.com or they do not receive bonuses on downline volume. Furthermore, an IBO must also personally sell or use at least 70% of the products personally purchased each month. The FTC established that these rules help prevent inventory loading and other potential abuses of the marketing model.

In 1986 Amway Corp. agreed, under a consent decree filed in federal court, to pay a $100,000 civil penalty to settle Commission charges it violated a 1979 Commission order that prohibits Amway from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve. According to a complaint filed with the consent decree, Amway violated the 1979 order by advertising earnings claims without including in it clear and conspicuous disclosures of the average earnings or sales of all distributors in any recent year or the percent of distributors who actually achieved the results claimed.

The FTC has required the information on average income to be provided to all prospective Quixtar business owners since the above 1979 FTC ruling clearing the Amway business model as legal.

===Income from tools and business support materials===
In 1983, Rich DeVos, one of Amway&#x27;s founders, made recordings which, among other things, communicated his displeasure with several issues regarding some of the high ranking distributors/IBOs. These recordings are entitled &quot;Directly Speaking&quot; and were addressed to Direct Distributors (now called Platinums), who are considered leaders with various responsibilities for their downline group. In January 1983 Rich DeVos announced that Amway would pay Business Volume (BV) on Amway produced tapes. He expressed concern about the level of income from the sale of Business Support Materials (BSM; tapes, CDs, books, and business conferences/functions) compared to the income the high level distributors were making from Amway products. He stated his legal team was concerned if the tool income exceeded 10% of their Amway income, and stated that BV payouts on tapes can never exceed 20% of the distributor&#x27;s total Business Volume.

A 1985 &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine article quoted Dexter Yager, an IBO, as stating that about 2/3 of his income is from BSMs.

In 2004, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; aired a report, alleging that some high-level Quixtar IBOs make most of their money from selling motivational materials rather than Quixtar products. Quixtar published an official Quixtar Response website where it showed &#x27;&quot;Interviews Dateline Didn&#x27;t Do&quot;&#x27;. Quixtar also states on its response site that &quot;Dateline&quot; declined their request to link to the site.

During the registration process for a new IBO, Quixtar contracts clearly inform prospective IBOs that BSM are optional and that the producers and sellers of the BSM may make profit or loss from their sale (like any other business). This is also publicized on Quixtar websites. Quixtar&#x27;s Business Support Materials Arbitration Agreement (SMAA) requires the immediate seller of BSMs to buy-back materials, which were purchased only for personal consumption within a 180-day time frame, on commercially reasonable terms, upon request of the purchaser. BSMs purchased for inventory or to be sold to others downline are not covered by the buy back policy.

===Disputes with TEAM===

On August 9, 2007, a group of Quixtar distributors, including founders of the TEAM training organization, filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin Quixtar from enforcing its distributor contracts, including the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions. The plaintiffs alleged that the company knowingly operates as a pyramid scheme, and prevents its distributors from leaving the organization through the aforementioned provisions.

On August 10, 2007, Quixtar announced that it had terminated the businesses of fifteen of the plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit, and sought and received a temporary restraining order and preliminary order of injunction in a Michigan court preventing them from interfering with the LOS, soliciting IBOs for their new company, or disparaging Quixtar or the business in any way. In mid October 2007, Quixtar argued that the former distributors were in violation of the court order since TEAM continued to have meetings and sell motivational materials. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, Quixtar argued that TEAM was using Quixtar&#x27;s proprietary information to promote its meetings and sell materials. The court held in favor of Woodward and Brady and allowed TEAM to continue to operate.

To enforce the injunction, Quixtar filed an action against 30 anonymous bloggers. Specifically, Quixtar was seeking to discover if Woodward and Brady were involved in a blogging campaign to disparage the company. The California lawsuit was dismissed on October 5, 2007.

In 2009, Woodward and his wife Laurie were found liable in an arbitration case for soliciting other distributors to resign from Quixtar and join its competitor MonaVie, The Woodwards were ordered to pay a settlement of $12,736,659. TEAM Co-defendants Chris and Terri Brady ordered to pay $9,578,756 and Tim and Amy Marks, $3,533,230.

==Google bombing==

In the summer of 2004, some Quixtar leaders and IBOs allegedly launched a Web initiative designed to make their web pages more prominent in search results, aka Google Bombing.

<doc id="105956" wikidata="Q754831" url="?curid=105956" title="Palindromic number">
<text>A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16361) that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it has reflectional symmetry across a vertical axis. The term &quot;palindromic&quot; is derived from palindrome, which refers to a word (such as &quot;rotor&quot; or &quot;racecar&quot;) whose spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed. The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal) are:
: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, ... .

Palindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics. A typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property &quot;and&quot; are palindromic. For instance:
* The palindromic primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, ... .
* The palindromic square numbers are 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, ... .

It is obvious that in any base there are infinitely many palindromic numbers, since in any base the infinite sequence of numbers written (in that base) as 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, etc. consists solely of palindromic numbers.

==Formal definition==
Although palindromic numbers are most often considered in the decimal system, the concept of palindromicity can be applied to the natural numbers in any numeral system. Consider a number &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 in base &quot;b&quot; ≥ 2, where it is written in standard notation with &quot;k&quot;+1 digits &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; as:
:formula_1
with, as usual, 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; and &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; ≠ 0. Then &quot;n&quot; is palindromic if and only if &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;−&quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;. Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.

==Decimal palindromic numbers==
All numbers with one digit are palindromic, so in base 10 there are ten palindromic numbers with one digit:
:{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

There are 9 palindromic numbers with two digits:
:{11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}.

All palindromic numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by 11.

There are 90 palindromic numbers with three digits (Using the rule of product: 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit):
:{101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, ..., 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989, 999}

There are likewise 90 palindromic numbers with four digits (again, 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit. The other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two):
:{1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, ..., 9009, 9119, 9229, 9339, 9449, 9559, 9669, 9779, 9889, 9999},
so there are 199 palindromic numbers smaller than 104.

There are 1099 palindromic numbers smaller than 105 and for other exponents of 10n we have: 1999, 10999, 19999, 109999, 199999, 1099999, ... . The number of palindromic numbers which have some other property are listed below:
===Perfect powers===
There are many palindromic perfect powers &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number and &quot;k&quot; is 2, 3 or 4.
* Palindromic squares: 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, 14641, 40804, 44944, ... 
* Palindromic cubes: 0, 1, 8, 343, 1331, 1030301, 1367631, 1003003001, ... 
* Palindromic fourth powers: 0, 1, 14641, 104060401, 1004006004001, ... 

The first nine terms of the sequence 12, 112, 1112, 11112, ... form the palindromes 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ... 

The only known non-palindromic number whose cube is a palindrome is 2201, and it is a conjecture the fourth root of all the palindrome fourth powers are a palindrome with 100000...000001 (10n + 1).

Gustavus Simmons conjectured there are no palindromes of form &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 4 (and &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1).

==Other bases==
Palindromic numbers can be considered in numeral systems other than decimal. For example, the binary palindromic numbers are those with the binary representations:
:0, 1, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 1111, 10001, 10101, 11011, 11111, 100001, ... 
or in decimal:
:0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 21, 27, 31, 33, ... 
The Fermat primes and the Mersenne primes form a subset of the binary palindromic primes.

Any number formula_2 is palindromic in all bases formula_3 with formula_4 (trivially so, because formula_2 is then a single-digit number), and also in base formula_6 (because formula_2 is then formula_8). Even excluding cases where the number is smaller than the base, most numbers are palindromic in more than one base. For example, formula_9, formula_10. A number formula_2 is never palindromic in base formula_3 if formula_13. Moreover, a prime number formula_14 is never palindromic in base formula_3 if formula_16.

A number that is non-palindromic in all bases &quot;b&quot; in the range 2 ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; − 2 can be called a &quot;strictly non-palindromic number&quot;. For example, the number 6 is written as &quot;110&quot; in base 2, &quot;20&quot; in base 3, and &quot;12&quot; in base 4, none of which are palindromes. All strictly non-palindromic numbers larger than 6 are prime. Indeed, if formula_17 is composite, then either formula_18 for some formula_19, in which case &quot;n&quot; is the palindrome &quot;aa&quot; in base formula_20, or else it is a perfect square formula_21, in which case &quot;n&quot; is the palindrome &quot;121&quot; in base formula_22 (except for the special case of formula_23).

The first few strictly non-palindromic numbers are:

:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 19, 47, 53, 79, 103, 137, 139, 149, 163, 167, 179, 223, 263, 269, 283, 293, 311, 317, 347, 359, 367, 389, 439, 491, 563, 569, 593, 607, 659, 739, 827, 853, 877, 977, 983, 997, ...

==Antipalindromic numbers==
If the digits of a natural number don&#x27;t only have to be reversed in order, but also subtracted from formula_20 to yield the original sequence again, then the number is said to be &quot;antipalindromic&quot;. Formally, in the usual decomposition of a natural number into its digits formula_25 in base formula_3, a number is antipalindromic iff formula_27.

==Lychrel process==
Non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of operations. First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called &quot;a delayed palindrome&quot;.

It is not known whether all non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic numbers in this way. While no number has been proven to be unpaired, many do not appear to be. For example, 196 does not yield a palindrome even after 700,000,000 iterations. Any number that never becomes palindromic in this way is known as a Lychrel number.

On January 24, 2017, the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as and announced &quot;The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome&quot;. The sequence of 125 261-step most delayed palindromes preceding 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 and not reported before was published separately as .

==Sum of the reciprocals==
The sum of the reciprocals of the palindromic numbers is a convergent series, whose value is approximately 3.37028... .

==Scheherazade numbers==
Scheherazade numbers are a set of numbers identified by Buckminster Fuller in his book &quot;Synergetics&quot;. Fuller does not give a formal definition for this term, but from the examples he gives, it can be understood to be those numbers that contain a factor of the primorial &quot;n&quot;#, where &quot;n&quot;≥13 and is the largest prime factor in the number. Fuller called these numbers &quot;Scheherazade numbers&quot; because they must have a factor of 1001. Scheherazade is the storyteller of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, telling a new story each night to delay her execution. Since &quot;n&quot; must be at least 13, the primorial must be at least 1·2·3·5·7·11·13, and 7×11×13 = 1001. Fuller also refers to powers of 1001 as Scheherazade numbers. The smallest primorial containing Scheherazade number is 13# = 30,030.

Fuller pointed out that some of these numbers are palindromic by groups of digits. For instance 17# = 510,510 shows a symmetry of groups of three digits. Fuller called such numbers &quot;Scheherazade Sublimely Rememberable Comprehensive Dividends&quot;, or SSRCD numbers. Fuller notes that 1001 raised to a power not only produces &quot;sublimely rememberable&quot; numbers that are palindromic in three-digit groups, but also the values of the groups are the binomial coefficients. For instance,
:formula_28

This sequence fails at (1001)13 because there is a carry digit taken into the group to the left in some groups. Fuller suggests writing these &quot;spillovers&quot; on a separate line. If this is done, using more spillover lines as necessary, the symmetry is preserved indefinitely to any power. Many other Scheherazade numbers show similar symmetries when expressed in this way.

== Sums of palindromes ==
In 2018, a paper was published demonstrating that every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.

<text>Desiré Delano Bouterse (; 13 October 1945 – 23 December 2024) was a Surinamese military officer, politician, convicted murderer, and drug trafficker who served as the President of Suriname from 2010 to 2020. From 1980 to 1987, he was Suriname&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader after conducting a military coup and establishing a period of military rule. In 1987, Bouterse founded the National Democratic Party (NDP). On 25 May 2010, Bouterse&#x27;s political alliance, the &quot;Megacombinatie&quot; (&quot;Mega combination&quot;), which included the NDP, won the parliamentary elections, and on 19 July 2010, Bouterse was elected as President of Suriname with 36 of 50 parliament votes. He was inaugurated on 12 August 2010.

Bouterse was a controversial figure, held responsible by some for numerous human rights violations committed during his military rule in the 1980s. Most notable were the December murders in 1982. He was prosecuted for the murders, and a trial was initiated, but the National Assembly extended amnesty to him in 2012. After the trial was forced to continue, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on 29 November 2019. He was also suspected of having directed the Moiwana massacre in 1986 against a village of Maroons during the Surinamese Interior War which pitted his government first against the maroon guerrilla group Jungle Commando, led by his former bodyguard, Ronnie Brunswijk, and then against the indigenous group Tucayana Amazonas.

On 16 July 1999, Bouterse was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; in the Netherlands to 11 years&#x27; imprisonment after being convicted of trafficking of cocaine. Bouterse always maintained his innocence. He claimed the star witness in the case, Patrick van Loon, was bribed by the Dutch government. According to the United States diplomatic cables leak released in 2011, Bouterse was active in the drug trade until 2006. Europol has issued a warrant for his arrest. At that time, he could not be arrested in Suriname, because he was still president. As he was convicted of the drug offense before his election in 2010 as head of state, he risked arrest if he left Suriname.

In 2023, he was sentenced to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment for the 1982 murders of fifteen political dissidents. He was reported missing by the Surinamese authorities in January 2024 after refusing to report to prison. He was considered a fugitive until his death.

Bouterse died on 23 December 2024, at the age of 79, while on the run following his conviction.

== Early life==
Bouterse was born on 13 October 1945 in Domburg, located in Suriname&#x27;s Wanica District. He was born in a Multiracial family of Amerindian, African, Dutch, French, and Chinese ancestry. As a young boy he moved from Domburg to the capital Paramaribo, where he was raised by an aunt. He attended St. Jozefschool (a boarding school) and later the &quot;Middelbare Handelsschool&quot; (roughly equivalent to junior secondary general education), which he did not finish.

In 1968, Bouterse moved to the Netherlands, where he was conscripted into the armed forces of the Netherlands (&quot;Nederlandse Krijgsmacht&quot;). After completing his military service, he signed up to train as a non-commissioned officer at the &quot;Koninklijke Militaire School&quot; in Weert. In this period, Bouterse became known as an athlete, and he was chosen as head of the basketball team.

In 1970, Bouterse married Ingrid Figueira, whom he had known as a teenager in Suriname. They had two children: Peggy and Dino. Shortly after the marriage, Bouterse was assigned to the Dutch military base in Seedorf, Germany.

On 11 November 1975, Bouterse returned with his family to Suriname after it gained independence from the Netherlands. He wanted to help establish the Surinamese army. In 1979, Bouterse accepted a request by Roy Horb to become chairman of a new Surinamese military union (union BoMiKa; &quot;Bond voor Militair Kader&quot;).

== Sergeants Coup ==
On 25 February 1980, Bouterse, Horb, and fourteen other sergeants overthrew the Henck Arron government with a violent military coup d&#x27;état, now known as the Sergeants Coup. The sergeants who accomplished this coup were known as the &quot;Groep van zestien&quot; (Group of Sixteen), led by Bouterse. After the coup, he became chairman of the National Military Council of Suriname and as such the &quot;de facto&quot; dictator of Suriname. From then until 1988, Bouterse was the power behind puppet presidents installed by him.

The military takeover, which was widely supported by the population, was officially aimed at fighting corruption and unemployment (which at the time affected 18 per cent of the working population), and at restoring order in public affairs. However, &quot;the political plans were vague, no ideological discussions had taken place in preparation for the coup,&quot; notes historian Rosemarijn Hoefte.

On the day of the coup, Bouterse&#x27;s soldiers burned down the Central Police Station of Suriname. The remains of this building now form the &quot;monument of the Revolution&quot;. Annually, on 25 February, the coup is commemorated.

The military dictatorship imposed an evening curfew, and curtailed freedom of press (only one newspaper, &quot;de Ware Tijd&quot;, was allowed to continue publishing, but was subject to heavy censorship). In 1985, it banned political parties and restricted freedom of assembly. It was characterized by a high level of government corruption and the summary executions of political opponents. After the December murders of fifteen opponents in 1982, Bouterse closed the University of Suriname.

He established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Cuba and North Korea, but his regime did not show any Communist orientation. The Netherlands suspended development aid to its former colony, destabilizing the Surinamese economy. At the same time, the fall in bauxite prices, Suriname&#x27;s main export, accentuated the economic crisis. The regime was quickly confronted with several uprisings, sometimes led by part of the army, sometimes by civilians. In 1983, in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Grenada, Suriname drew closer to Washington and expelled Cuban diplomats, perhaps for fear of U.S. aggression.

== December murders ==
On 7 and 8 December 1982, fifteen prominent Surinamese men who had criticized Bouterse&#x27;s military dictatorship or were connected with the coup d&#x27;état attempt on 11 March 1982, were brought to Fort Zeelandia (then Bouterse&#x27;s headquarters), where they were tortured and shot dead. These killings are known as the December murders.

The 15 victims were:

*John Baboeram, lawyer
*Bram Behr, journalist
*Cyrill Daal, union leader
*Kenneth Gonçalves, lawyer
*Eddy Hoost, lawyer
*André Kamperveen, journalist and businessman
*Gerard Leckie, university teacher
*Sugrim Oemrawsingh, scientist
*Lesley Rahman, journalist
*Surendre Rambocus, military
*Harold Riedewald, lawyer
*Jiwansingh Sheombar, military
*Jozef Slagveer, journalist
*Robby Sohansingh, businessman
*Frank Wijngaarde, journalist (with Dutch citizenship)
On 10 December 1982 Bouterse stated on STVS television channel that 15 arrested &quot;suspects who were plotting to overthrow the government later in December were shot dead while trying to flee Fort Zeelandia&quot;. Years later Bouterse said that he was not present at the killings. In 2000 he stated that the decision for these killings was made by the commander of the battalion, Paul Bhagwandas, who died in 1996. Bouterse accepted political responsibility as leader, but still denied any direct involvement.

The trials for the December murders did not take place in Suriname until 30 November 2007. Among the 25 indicted suspects, Bouterse is the chief figure. Since the trial began, Bouterse never went to court. In a speech, Bouterse said “I want to apologize to all the relatives of the victims. But to think you can lock me up? Never, niemals, jamais, nunca.” In an interview with &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; in 2009, Bouterse said that the trial was being used by his political opponents to prevent him from running for office again and for their own political gain. In April 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial was expected, Bouterse&#x27;s party member Andre Misiekaba said, during a debate in the Surinamese parliament, that: &quot;The December Murders trial is a political trial which has the purpose to eliminate Bouterse from the political arena and therefore the Amnesty Act is needed.&quot; 

=== Amnesty ===

On 1 February 2012, Ruben Rozendaal, one of the military suspects, announced in local media that it was time for him to come forward with the truth about the December Murders because he wanted to clear his name before he died: he was suffering from a severe kidney disease, and the doctors had told him he did not have much time left to live. After consulting with his lawyer, Rozendaal decided to withdraw the testimony he had given in 2010. After the last suspects and witnesses in the December Murders case were heard, the court-martial decided to hear Rozendaal again, and this hearing was set for 23 March 2012.

On 19 March, five members of Bouterse&#x27;s political party &quot;Megacombinatie&quot; and one member of Paul Somohardjo&#x27;s party &quot;Pertjajah Luhur&quot; proposed a law in the parliament which in effect would grant amnesty for the suspects in the December Murders, including Dési Bouterse. The amnesty law would also cause immediate termination of the trial. The parliamentary voting was to be held on 23 March, the same day Ruben Rozendaal testified in court that Bouterse personally killed two of the fifteen men: union leader Cyrill Daal and military member Soerindre Rambocus. That day there was no quorum in the parliament, and the voting did not continue.

On 4 April 2012, after three days of debate, the Assembly passed the amnesty law with 28 votes in favor and 12 votes opposed. The political parties Nieuw Suriname and BEP, both members of Bouterse&#x27;s coalition, left the room when the voting started because they &quot;did not believe that they should support a law which is being opposed by a large part of the Surinamese community.&quot; The chair of the Surinamese parliament, Jennifer Simons, who is also a member of Bouterse&#x27;s party, voted for the law.

The controversial law granted amnesty to Bouterse and the 24 other suspects. This could also mean that the ongoing December Murders trial will face an immediate stop.

On 13 April 2012, the public prosecutor in the December Murders trial formulated the demanded sentence against five suspects, including the main suspect, Bouterse. His defense lawyer, Irwin Kanhai, requested that the trial would be declared moot because of the amnesty law. On 11 May 2012, the court decided whether the trial would continue or not.

Edgar Ritfeld, one of the 25 suspects, said that he did not want amnesty because he knows he is innocent. He wanted the trial to be continued so that his innocence could be proven. Ruben Rozendaal and Wim Carbiere, both suspects, also asked for continuation of the trial.
The controversial amnesty law was protested both nationally and internationally. Organizations such as the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the law and urged the Surinamese judges and the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office to continue the trial. On 19 April 2012, Human Rights Watch demanded an immediate retraction of the law.

=== Reaction from the Netherlands ===
After passage of the amnesty law, the Netherlands immediately stopped the 20 million euro aid set aside for Suriname. President Bouterse was unmoved by this decision, saying, &quot;I never asked you for 20 million euros. We have economic reserves of almost 800 million dollars&quot;. The Dutch Labour Party and the then ruling People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) believed that this sanction was not enough. They called for more penalties such as economic sanctions, expulsion of the Surinamese ambassador (who is the daughter of MP Rashied Doekhi, one of the 28 MPs who voted in favour of the law), and a ban on European travel for all the Surinamese parliamentarians who voted for the amnesty law. Dutch minister of foreign affairs Uri Rosenthal did not agree with these requests.

On 8 April 2012, the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said it was &quot;indigestible&quot; that amnesty was granted to the suspects in this stage of the trial (the amnesty law was passed two months before the verdict in the trial).

=== 2019 conviction by the military court ===
The amnesty law was later overturned by a military court in 2016, and in November 2019 the military court convicted Bouterse to 20 years imprisonment for the December killings. On 22 January 2020, Bouterse appeared before the court, in military uniform, to appeal this decision. On 20 December 2023, Suriname&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld Bouterse&#x27;s conviction. He could still request a pardon to Suriname&#x27;s president Chan Santokhi, who investigated the December killings as a police commissioner, and later pushed for the investigation to continue as justice minister. 

On 8 January 2024, Bouterse filed another appeal against his conviction, which was rejected the next day by the Attorney-General. On 12 January, a manhunt was launched against Bouterse after he failed to turn himself in to prison authorities.

== Moiwana massacre ==

Moiwana is a Maroon village in the Marowijne District in the east of Suriname.

The Suriname Guerrilla War (1986–1990), also known as a civil war, was between the Surinamese military regime, headed by Dési Bouterse, and the Surinamese Liberation Army, a guerrilla Maroon group better known as the Jungle Commando, led by Bouterse&#x27;s former bodyguard Ronnie Brunswijk. On 29 November 1986, members of the national military massacred at least 39 villagers of Moiwana, Brunswijk&#x27;s home village, killing mostly women and children. The soldiers also burned down the village dwellings, including Brunswijk&#x27;s house. The survivors fled as refugees with hundreds of other inland inhabitants across the Marowijne River to neighbouring French Guiana.

The human rights organisation &#x27;Moiwana &#x27;86&#x27; has committed itself to achieving justice with regard to this event. It is seeking to hold military officers and the government as responsible for the massacre.

Herman Gooding, a chief inspector of the police, was assassinated in August 1990 during his investigation of the massacre. Reportedly he was forced out of his car near Fort Zeelandia and shot in the head. His body was left outside the office of Desi Bouterse. Other police investigators fled the country for safety, stalling the progress of the investigation.

The government has stated that it is still continuing its investigation of the massacre. It claimed that prospective witnesses had either moved, died, or were uncooperative. It has also said that an investigation of the murder of Herman Gooding was continuing.

In August 2005, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Suriname to pay US$3 million in compensation to 130 survivors of the massacre, and to establish a US$1.2 million fund for the development of Moiwana. The Inter-American Court of Human rights has judged that the responsible persons have to be prosecuted and punished; however, previous governments, including Bouterse&#x27;s government, have failed to do so.

==Transition to democracy==
Later in 1985, the government lifted the ban on opposition parties, beginning a transition to civilian rule. A new constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a 30 September 1987 referendum. Elections were held two months later, and Ramsewak Shankar, an opponent of Bouterse, was elected president in January 1988.

However, Bouterse retained much power as army commander. He scuttled a number of government efforts to negotiate with the Jungle Commando, and a number of Bouterse&#x27;s opponents were murdered or disappeared. Matters came to a head when Bouterse was detained at Schiphol Airport while returning to Suriname on a personal trip to Ghana and Switzerland. Angered that Shankar, who happened to be on the same flight to Amsterdam, didn&#x27;t protest, Bouterse resigned as army commander. The following day, Ivan Graanoogst, who was serving as acting army commander, called Shankar and forced his resignation. By all accounts, however, Bouterse was the mastermind of what became known as the Telephone Coup. A year later, new elections were held that returned the country to civilian rule.

== Drug trafficking ==
On 16 July 1999, Bouterse was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; in the Netherlands to 11 years in prison for trafficking 474 kilograms of cocaine. Bouterse always proclaimed his innocence. He claimed that the star witness in his case, Patrick van Loon, was bribed by the Dutch government. Bouterse is believed by law enforcement officials to have been the leader of the so-called &quot;Suri kartel&quot;, which is held responsible for the trafficking and smuggling of large amounts of cocaine from Suriname and Brazil into Europe (especially into the Netherlands) in the 1980s and 90s.

Since 1999 Europol has maintained an international warrant for his arrest. According to the &quot;United Nations Convention against illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances&quot;, since Bouterse was convicted before his election as head of state in 2010, he has no immunity under international law. This was confirmed by various specialists in international law.

In April 2012, Ruben Rozendaal, former fellow soldier of Bouterse and also a suspect in the December 1982 murders, said that in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bouterse supplied the FARC of Colombia with weapons in exchange for cocaine. A 2006 document from the American embassy reported a possible connection between Bouterse and the FARC.

Bouterse&#x27;s son Dino Bouterse was sentenced in 2005 to eight years&#x27; imprisonment in a Surinamese court for narcotics trafficking, weapons trafficking, and theft of luxury vehicles. He was released early for good behavior. The government&#x27;s counter-terrorism department appointed him to a senior role.

On 29 August 2013, Dino was arrested by the U.S. government&#x27;s Drug Enforcement Administration in Panama while traveling on a diplomatic passport. He was extradited to the United States and taken to New York City. He was prosecuted and in March 2015, he was sentenced to a 16-year prison term on convictions of drug smuggling and trying to help Hezbollah set up a base in Suriname. In a letter, Dino Bouterse insisted he had no terrorist leanings and was motivated only by profit. Bouterse was arrested after an elaborate international sting in which he was recorded meeting in Greece and Panama with DEA operatives posing as Hezbollah and Mexican drug traffickers.

== President of Suriname (2010–2020)==
After the return of democratic government, led in succession by Ronald Venetiaan, Jules Wijdenbosch, and Venetiaan again, Bouterse tried repeatedly to return to power through elections. In the 2010 Surinamese legislative election, Bouterse and his coalition, the Mega Combination (&quot;Mega Combinatie&quot;) became the largest bloc in the National Assembly, gaining 23 of the 51 seats. The coalition failed to gain an absolute majority in the parliament by three seats (the half of 50 plus 1 was needed). In order to secure the necessary two-thirds supermajority to become president, Bouterse cooperated with the party of his former opponent, Ronnie Brunswijk, which had 7 seats; and the Peoples Alliance party (&quot;Volks Alliantie&quot;) of Paul Somohardjo (6 seats), who had left the ruling New Front party before the election.

On 19 July 2010, Bouterse was elected president with 36 of the 51 votes; he assumed office on 12 August 2010. His running mate Robert Ameerali became Vice President of Suriname.

During his presidency Dési Bouterse introduced universal health care, free school meals, a minimum wage and a national pension scheme. At the same time, rising government expenditures led to large budget deficits and rampant inflation, while the Surinamese dollar was devalued several times in 2016 by more than half of its value.

His cabinet consisted of the following members:

The first minister of Spatial Planning Martinus Sastroredjo (KTPI) had been relieved of his duties at the end of 2010 due to his life partner asking for a piece of land with the help of a ministry official. He was succeeded by Simon Martosatiman, also a member of the political party KTPI. The second minister to leave office for personal reasons was Miss Wonnie Boedhoe, the first minister of Finance &amp; Planning of this cabinet.

By the end of April 2011, several ministers had been dismissed due to political changes in the cabinet. They included Paul Abena (Sport- &amp; Youth Affairs), Martin Misiedjan (Justice &amp; Police), Celsius Waterberg (Public Health), Linus Diko (Regional Development), and Simon Martosatiman. The ministers Raymond Sapoen, Michael Miskin and Ginmardo Kromosoeto were assigned to new posts. In addition to the newly formed cabinet, two deputy ministers were installed. Mahinder Gopie had served as the secretary of the president and was made the deputy minister of Regional Development. Abigail Lie A Kwie, a loyalist of Pertjajah Luhur chairman Paul Somohardjo, started as the deputy minister of Public Works &amp; Traffic, but was moved in October 2012 to the ministry of Agriculture.

The president&#x27;s four top advisors were Jules Wijdenbosch, who handles the country&#x27;s administrative and constitutional affairs; Errol Alibux, who advises the president about foreign affairs and international laws; Eddy Jozefzoon, who deals with the country&#x27;s social and educational issues; and Andy Rusland, who oversees the nation&#x27;s economy. The president appointed Cliffton Limburg as his press secretary and cabinet&#x27;s spokesman; he was a propagandist for Bouterse and a talkshow host. Bouterse installed Gillmore Hoefdraad, a former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official, as the new governor of the Central Bank of Suriname.

After the 2015 Surinamese legislative election, Bouterse&#x27;s NDP won 26 seats; he was reelected unopposed on 14 July 2015.

On 23 June 2020, Bouterse announced that he did not want to take his seat in the National Assembly even though he had been elected in the 2020 Surinamese general election. As such, Soewarto Moestadja, who was on seventh place on the NDP list, had become eligible for taking the seat in the National Assembly. Moestadja, being the oldest member, chaired the first meeting of the Assembly. Bouterse was not a candidate for the presidency in the 2020 elections, and as no other candidates other than Chan Santokhi had been nominated by the deadline of 8 July 2020 at 15:00 (UTC−3), Santokhi was elected as his successor on 13 July in an uncontested election. Bouterse announced his retirement from politics on 16 July 2020.

=== Honouring of the coup and handling of the December murders===
After his inauguration as president, Bouterse immediately honoured the nine surviving conspirators, who together with him had conducted the violent 1980 Surinamese coup d&#x27;état; he awarded them the Grand Cordon of the Honorary Order of the Yellow Star, the highest honor of Suriname. This action was met with international outrage, all nine (and Bouterse) having been involved with the December murders. 

After becoming president, Bouterse designated 25 February, the anniversary of the coup d&#x27;état, as a national holiday. Former president Ronald Venetiaan has said that 25 February should not be a holiday, but a national day of mourning.

Bouterse also awarded suspects in the December murders with high-level government positions. During his presidency, he publicly threatened judges investigating the case and unsuccessfully tried to remove the attorney-general.

=== Pardons ===
In December 2011, President Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son Romano Meriba, who in 2005 was convicted to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment for the 2002 murder and robbery of a Chinese trader. Meriba was also convicted for throwing a hand grenade at the house of the Dutch ambassador. Judge Valstein-Montnor ruled that the evidence proved that Meriba tried to commit a robbery at the ambassador&#x27;s house similar to that of the trader. After it was prevented by guards from the Dutch embassy, Meriba threw a hand grenade from a car at the ambassador&#x27;s residence.

The pardon was controversial, as it is the first time a Surinamese President has pardoned someone convicted of murder and robbery. &quot;People that have committed such heavy offends should not get a pardon&quot; said former justice minister Chan Santokhi. &quot;Besides, the requirement that a thorough investigation must be conducted and that the decision should be based on the advice by the judge who passed the sentence was ignored.&quot; Bouterse&#x27;s staff said that Meriba&#x27;s status as the foster son of President Bouterse was not part of the decision, and that there were strong legal arguments for the pardon. According to rumors, after Meriba was released from jail, he was hired by the heavily armed Counter Terror Unit (CTU). Dino Bouterse, son of President Bouterse, was appointed to head this unit.

Bouterse hired other convicts. His delegation that visited a South American summit had two members besides Bouterse who had criminal drug records: former military and Hans Jannasch. Ronald Venetiaan, former president of Suriname, said &quot;Such people now circulate around the state power&quot;.

Meriba was arrested again on 23 March 2012 in Paramaribo on charges of assaulting a citizen and police officer the night before in a nightclub. He was not long held in police custody because the complaint was retracted the following day.

== Illness and death ==
During his presidency, Bouterse underwent routine medical checkups in Cuba. After returning from a month-long stay in the island in September 2017, his office acknowledged that he had undergone surgery for an undisclosed condition. 

Bouterse died following a short illness on 23 December 2024, at the age of 79, while he was in hiding at an undisclosed location in Suriname to avoid imprisonment for his conviction in the December murders. An autopsy later found that he had died from a &quot;liver failure complication from serious liver fibrosis caused by chronic alcohol consumption&quot;. Dutch news outlets reported that Bouterse hid in the Copi Nature Reserve, 50 kilometers from Paramaribo. His body was subsequently taken to his residence in Paramaribo on 25 December. Following his death, President Chan Santokhi announced that no period of national mourning or a state funeral was to be held, although Foreign Minister Albert Ramdin said that flags in government buildings were to be set at half-mast on the day of his funeral out of respect for Bouterse being a former president. Bouterse&#x27;s National Democratic Party said that his remains would be cremated.

<text>William Alexander &quot;Bud&quot; Abbott (October 2, 1897 – April 24, 1974) was an American comedian, actor and producer. He was best known as the straight man half of the comedy duo Abbott and Costello.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on October 2, 1897, into a show business family. His parents, Rae Fisher and Harry Abbott, had met while working for the Barnum and Bailey Circus. She was a bareback rider of German Jewish background and he was a concessionaire and forage agent. Bud was the third of the couple&#x27;s four children. When Bud was a toddler, the family relocated to Harlem, then to the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, and his father became a longtime advance man for the Columbia Burlesque Wheel.

During the summer, when burlesque was on hiatus, his father worked at Dreamland Park in Coney Island. Bud dropped out of grammar school to work at the park. In his teens, Abbott signed on as a cabin boy on a Norwegian steamer, but was soon forced to shovel coal. He worked his way back to the United States a year later.

==Career==
In his late teens, Abbott began working in the box office of the Casino Theatre in Brooklyn, a burlesque house on the Columbia wheel. He spent the next few years in burlesque box offices, rising to treasurer. In 1918, while working in Washington, D.C., he met and married Jenny Mae Pratt (1902–1981), a burlesque dancer and comedienne who performed as Betty Smith. They remained together until his death 55 years later. Betty performed on the Columbia Wheel, while Bud mostly remained behind the scenes. In 1923, he produced a cut-rate vaudeville tab show called &quot;Broadway Flashes&quot;, which toured on the small-time Gus Sun circuit. Abbott began performing as a straight man in the show when he could no longer afford to pay one. He continued producing and performing in burlesque shows on the Mutual Burlesque wheel, and as his reputation grew, he began working with veteran comedians like Harry Steppe and Harry Evanson.

===Lou Costello and Hollywood===
Abbott crossed paths with Lou Costello in the early 1930s, when Abbott was producing and performing in Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque shows in New York, and Costello was a rising comic. They worked together for the first time in 1935 at the Eltinge Theatre on 42nd Street, after an illness sidelined Costello&#x27;s regular partner. They formally teamed up in 1936, and performed together in burlesque, minstrel shows, what was left of vaudeville, and stage shows.

In 1938, they received national exposure as regulars on the &quot;Kate Smith Hour&quot; radio show, which led to roles in a Broadway musical, &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot; in 1939. In 1940, Universal signed the team for their first film, &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot;. Despite having minor roles, Abbott and Costello stole the film with several classic routines, including an abbreviated version of &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; Universal signed the team to a two-picture deal, and the first film, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; (1941), became a major hit and led to a long-term contract with the studio.

Arthur Lubin, who directed the team&#x27;s first five starring films, later said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there has ever been a finer straight man in the business than Bud Abbott. Lou would go off the script – because he was that clever with lines – and Bud would bring him right back.&quot;

During World War II, Abbott and Costello were among the most popular and highest-paid stars in the world. Between 1940 and 1956, they made 36 films and earned a percentage of the profits on each. They were among the Top 10 box office stars from 1941 through 1951, and placed No. 1 in 1942. They also had their own radio program (&quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;) throughout the 1940s, first on NBC from 1942 to 1947, and from 1947 to 1949 on ABC. During a 35-day tour in the summer of 1942, the team sold $85 million worth of War Bonds.

In the 1950s, they introduced their comedy to live television on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, and launched their own half-hour filmed series, &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; (1952–54).

===Strain and split===
Relations between Abbott and Costello were strained by egos and salary disputes. In burlesque, they split their earnings 60/40, favoring Abbott, because the was always viewed as the more valuable member of the team. This was eventually changed to 50/50, but after a year in Hollywood, Costello insisted on a 40/60 split in his favor. It remained 40/60 for the rest of their careers. Costello also demanded that the team be renamed &quot;Costello and Abbott,&quot; but this was rejected by Universal because the studio had been promoting &quot;Abbott and Costello&quot; for years. Abbott&#x27;s top billing resulted in a &quot;permanent chill&quot; between the two partners, according to Lou&#x27;s daughter Chris Costello in her biography &quot;Lou&#x27;s on First&quot;. Their relationship was further strained by Abbott&#x27;s alcohol abuse, a habit motivated by his desire to stave off epileptic seizures.

In mid-1945, the comedians were not on speaking terms after Costello fired a maid and Abbott, having no grievance with the maid, hired her. As Costello recalled in 1958: &quot;She went to work for Abbott. I explained to Bud why I let her go, and asked him to fire her, but he wouldn&#x27;t.&quot; Costello refused to speak to Abbott except when they were working. In 1946, the team&#x27;s box office ranking dropped out of the Top 10 and the studio, with Costello&#x27;s assent, split the team in character roles in two films: &quot;Little Giant&quot; and &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;. &quot;Bud didn&#x27;t like doing them at all,&quot; said Abbott&#x27;s nephew Norman Abbott. &quot;He felt that Lou wanted to go on and be a different kind of comedian, that he didn&#x27;t want to be a team anymore. So the parts were written that way in couple of pictures, and it didn&#x27;t work.&quot; Abbott resolved their personal situation when he suggested that the team&#x27;s ongoing plans to build a civic center for underprivileged children be named after Costello&#x27;s son, who drowned before his first birthday. The Lou Costello, Jr. Youth Foundation opened in Los Angeles in 1947 and is still serving the community.

The team&#x27;s popularity waned in the mid-1950s, and the IRS demanded substantial back taxes, forcing the partners (both of whom had been free spenders and serious gamblers) to sell most of their assets, including the rights to many of their films. When the team&#x27;s long-term contract with Universal was up in 1954, they demanded more money than the studio was willing to pay, and they were dropped after 14 years at the studio.

In November 1956, Costello was the subject of the Ralph Edwards–produced TV show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. A month later the team opened in Las Vegas. The act went badly. Witnesses differ on exactly what happened (one version has Costello leading a drunk Abbott off the stage), but the accounts agree that Abbott&#x27;s timing had slowed down noticeably, throwing Costello&#x27;s responses off and embarrassing him.

Abbott and Costello split in 1957, shortly before Costello appeared on Steve Allen&#x27;s variety show. Costello made solo appearances on several TV shows, including the Steve Allen show, and did one film, &quot;The Thirty-Foot Bride of Candy Rock&quot; (released posthumously in 1959). Costello died on March 3, 1959.

===Later years===
Abbott faced financial difficulties in the late 1950s when the IRS disallowed $500,000 in tax exemptions which forced him to sell his home and come out of semi-retirement.

In 1960, Abbott began performing with a new partner, Candy Candido, to good reviews. But Abbott called it quits, remarking that &quot;No one could ever live up to Lou.&quot; The following year, Abbott played a straight role in a dramatic television episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Joke&#x27;s on Me&quot;. In 1962, he was interviewed by NBC&#x27;s Jack Lescoulie, in a nostalgic segment. That year, as it&#x27;s reported, Abbott was considered for a cameo in Stanley Kramer&#x27;s comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. In 1964, he suffered the first in a series of strokes and recuperated at the Motion Picture Country Home. The following year, he was filmed on the set of the Elvis Presley movie, &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;, with Barbara Stanwyck, Frank Sinatra and other celebrities when Presley donated $50,000 to the Motion Picture Relief Fund to help its $40 million building and endowment drive. In 1967, Abbott provided his own voice for the Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show&quot;. Stan Irwin provided the voice of Lou Costello.

==Personal life==

Abbott suffered from epilepsy starting from about 1926.

Bud and Betty Abbott were married for 55 years. The couple adopted two children: Bud Jr. (August 23, 1939 – January 19, 1997) in 1942 and Rae Victoria (Vickie) (March 27, 1942 – April 28, 2021) in 1949.

Norman and Betty Abbott, the children of Bud&#x27;s older sister, Olive, started their careers in Hollywood working behind the scenes on the Abbott and Costello films. Betty became Blake Edwards&#x27; longtime script supervisor, and Norman directed many episodic television series, including &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;.

Bud has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: the radio star is located at 6333 Hollywood Boulevard, the motion pictures star is located at 1611 Vine Street, and the television star is located at 6740 Hollywood Boulevard.

Abbott was a Freemason via Daylight Lodge No. 525 in Michigan.

==Death==
Abbott died of cancer at age 76 on April 24, 1974, at his home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. He was cremated at Grandview Crematory in Glendale, California, and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean three miles out from Santa Monica.

His widow, Betty, died on September 12, 1981.

When asked about Abbott shortly after his death, Groucho Marx replied that Abbott was &quot;the greatest straight man that ever lived.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
Abbott and Costello are among the few non-baseball personnel to be memorialized in the Baseball Hall of Fame, although they are not inductees of the Hall itself. A plaque and a gold record of the &quot;Who&#x27;s On First?&quot; sketch have been on permanent display there since 1956, and the routine has run on an endless video loop in the exhibit area since 1967.

Abbott and Costello each have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their work in radio, television and motion pictures.

In 1942, they were voted the country&#x27;s No. 1 Box Office Stars by exhibitors. They ranked among the Top Ten in 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.

Abbott received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Acting (posthumously) from the Garden State Film Festival in 2006; it was accepted on his behalf by his daughter Vickie Abbott Wheeler.

Abbott is a 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

<text>Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA, ) is the main international airport serving Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. It is located in the Sepang District of Selangor, approximately south of downtown Kuala Lumpur and serves the city&#x27;s greater conurbation.

Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Malaysia and is recognised as a mega hub. In 2023, it handled 47.2 million passengers, 980,040 tonnes of cargo and 819,026 aircraft movements, ranking as the 35th-busiest airport by total passenger traffic.

In 2024, KLIA is the ranked first by OAG (by ratio of connection flight frequency to destinations served) in the Global Low-Cost Megahubs index by with 11,188 possible low-cost connections across over 137 destinations.

OAG also ranked KLIA is the world&#x27;s second most connected airport (by ratio of connection flight frequency to destinations served) in 2024, with 33,411 possible connections, according to the OAG Megahub Index, second to London-Heathrow and followed by Tokyo–Haneda, Amsterdam and Seoul–Incheon in the top five.

AirAsia is the dominant air carrier in Malaysia, based in KLIA and serving 14,583 low-cost connections, with a 34% share of flights, followed by Malaysia Airlines MAS.

The airport is operated by Malaysia Airports (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd and is the major hub of Malaysia Airlines, MASkargo, Batik Air Malaysia, UPS Airlines and World Cargo Airlines, AirAsia and AirAsia X.

==History==
===Background===
The groundbreaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993 when the government under Mahathir Mohamad decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then known as Subang International Airport (now Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport) could not handle future demand. The construction of the airport was done mainly by a few state owned construction companies as well as Ekovest Berhad – helmed by Tan Sri Datuk Lim Kang Hoo. It was created as part of the Multimedia Super Corridor, a grand development plan for Malaysia. The chief architect who designed the new airport terminal was the Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa.

Upon KLIA&#x27;s completion, Subang Airport&#x27;s Terminal 1 building was demolished. Malaysia Airports agreed to redevelop the remaining Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes surrounded by a residential area and a business park. The IATA airport code KUL was transferred from Subang Airport, which currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military aircraft.

===Current site===
The airport&#x27;s site spans 2 of former agricultural land and is one of the world&#x27;s largest airport sites. An ambitious three-phase development plan anticipates KLIA to have three runways and two terminals each with two satellite terminals. Phase One involved the construction of the main terminal and one satellite terminal, giving a capacity of 25 million passengers, and two full service runways. The Phase One airport had 60 contact piers, 20 remote parking bays with 80 aircraft parking positions, four maintenance hangars and fire stations. Phase Two, designed to increase capacity to 35 million passengers per year, is largely complete. Phase Three is anticipated to increase capacity to 100 million passengers per year.

===Inauguration===
Kuala Lumpur International Airport was officially inaugurated by the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar of Negeri Sembilan, on 27 June 1998, shortly before the 1998 Commonwealth Games.

The inauguration of the airport was marked with numerous problems. The aerobridge and bay allocation systems broke down, with queues building up throughout the airport and the baggage handling breaking down. Bags were lost, and there were waits of over five to seven hours. Most of these issues were remedied eventually, though the baggage handling system was plagued with problems until it was put up for a complete replacement tender in 2007.

The airport suffered greatly reduced traffic with the general reduction in economic activity brought about by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, September 11 attacks, SARS, bird flu epidemic (Avian flu), the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport is also largely overshadowed by the more internationally renowned Changi Airport located approximately to the southeast in Singapore, especially in regards to connecting flights by various airlines or Malaysians especially living in the southern parts of the country (e.g. Johor) preferring to travel via Changi rather than at KLIA.

The first year of opening immediately saw reduction of passenger numbers as some airlines, including All Nippon Airways (resumed on 1 September 2015), British Airways (reinstated on 28 May 2015 until 28 March 2021), Lufthansa (resumed between 28 March 2004 until 28 February 2016) discontinued their flights. Qantas moved their Sydney-Kuala Lumpur route to their low-cost subsidiary Jetstar, which continued to operate the route until 2008. Aeroflot terminated their Moscow-Kuala Lumpur via Singapore route in 2001, although there had been discussions about Aeroflot resuming the Kuala Lumpur route, no progress was made, and Northwest Airlines terminated their loss-making route from Osaka to Kuala Lumpur in 2001. KLIA&#x27;s first full year of operations in 1999, in its Phase One manifestation (capacity of 25 million passengers per year), saw only 13.2 million passengers. Passenger numbers eventually increased to 21.1 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2013 — though short of the originally estimated 25 million passengers per year by 2003.

=== Rebranding ===
On 9 February 2023, transport minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook announced that the government and MAHB had agreed to rebrand KLIA and klia2 to KLIA Terminal 1 and KLIA Terminal 2 respectively. The costs associated with the rebranding will be fully borne by MAHB.

==Runways==
Kuala Lumpur International Airport has three parallel runways (14L/32R; 14R/32L; 15/33), which all three of which are over long and wide. The length of Runway 14L/32R is , runway 14R/32L is , while runway 15/33 is . Each runways had at least nine taxiways exits ranging from 2 minutes to 11 minutes.

The current three runway system is capable of handling 78 landings per hour and was expected to increase to 108 landings per hour once upgrading of the Kuala Lumpur Flight Information Region had been completed in 2019. The airport has CAT II Precision Landing ILS (runways 14L/32R and 14R/32L) to guide landing aircraft safely under all weather conditions with visibility as low as 350 metres (1,150 ft) whilst runway 15/33 has CAT I Precision Landing ILS that guide safe landings under all situations with lowest possible visibility at 900 metres (2 953 ft). These runways operate on different departure/arrival modes according to the air traffic requirements.

==Operations and infrastructure==

Kuala Lumpur International Airport features a number of modern design features that assist in the efficient operation of the airport. It is one of the first Asia Pacific airports to become 100% Bar Coded Boarding Pass capable. Malaysia Airlines; AirAsia; MASkargo, a cargo airline; and Malaysia Airports, the Malaysian Airports operator and manager; are headquartered on the property of KLIA. Malaysia Airlines also operates its Flight Management Building at KLIA.

===Air traffic control tower===

There are two air traffic control towers at Kuala Lumpur International Airport: the two main control towers (Tower East and Tower West) and the apron control tower. Tower East is the original control tower which stands since the start, towering at 130 metres tall and control the traffic of both initial two runways. Tower West is 133.8 metres tall and is the tallest air traffic control tower in the world, followed by Suvarnabhumi Airport&#x27;s control tower and Tower East during its inauguration which now being beaten by King Abdulaziz International Airport which possess a 136 metres tall air traffic control tower. Both shaped like an Olympic torch, it houses the air traffic control systems and radar equipment.

The 55-metre apron control tower is responsible for providing Air Traffic Service to aircraft and vehicle movement in the northern and southern parts of the Satellite Terminal building and the cargo apron areas.

===Baggage handling system===
The airport&#x27;s baggage handling system (BHS) features baggage common check-in at any of the 216 counters on a 24-hour basis and incorporates automatic bar-code sorting control, 4 level in-line baggage security screening and high speed conveyor belts.
The BHS was built by Toyo Kanetsu with lots of new mechanism such as Belt Carry Sorter, Triplanar, Hinged Diverter, Horizontal Sliding Belt Diverter, and FOD (foreign object debris) Detection System. In 2006, a contract to extend the system from the satellite building to the ERL (Express Rail Link) platform in the Main Terminal Building was awarded to Siemens. The new system from Siemens will transport baggage between the two terminals at speeds of up to 36 km per hour, compared to the previous rate of 7.2 km per hour. The new system uses a high-speed tray conveyor system in which bags are placed on individual trays for better control and tracking at high speed compared to conventional belt conveyors enables the baggage to be checked-out in KL Sentral once the operator of KLIA Express, ERL Berhad introduce the new facility.

Some of the facilities of the baggage handling system in terminal 1 include:
*8 short-term car park baggage check-in counters 
*8 bus and train stations baggage check-in counters 
*3 stage baggage security screening system 
*Early check-in baggage storage (1,200 bags capacity) 
*17 baggage reclaim carousels together with LCCT
*33 km total length of conveyor belts 
*Part of the belts travel through a 1.1 km tunnel from the Main Terminal Building to the Satellite Building

Meanwhile, in terminal 2, the baggage handling system being implemented by BCS Group from Norway and upgraded by Daifuku Airport Technologies From Japan until its opening in May 2014, costing RM 60 million. The BHS in terminal 2 is as follows:
* 128 check-ins
* Over 10km in aggregate length for over 1,200 conveyors
* Over 2km in aggregate length for 21 carousels
* CCTV system for the complete baggage system
* 2 high speed tilt tray sorters
* 14 inline screening X-ray machines on the conventional baggage system plus 5 for the out of gauge lines
* 250 barcode readers
* EBS infrastructure for early bags

Several companies handle the baggage systems in KLIA. For the homebase airlines, Malaysia Airlines operates the BHS through AeroDarat Services, Airasia uses Ground Team Red, and Malindo has their own baggage crews. There are also two more baggage handlers operate under Kuala Lumpur Airport System (KLAS) which are Pos Aviation and ProSky Services.

IATA had agreed to facilitate the usage of RFID tags between KL International Airport and Hong Kong Airport after the launch of the world&#x27;s smallest multiband RFID chip in Kuala Lumpur. KLIA will be the second airport to use RFID
The RFID baggage tagging trial between Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Hong Kong International Airport is completed. Baggage tags are being issued at both Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific check-in counters. The trial was delayed due to problems obtaining printers. Furthermore, KLIA is now awaiting reports from IATA which scheduled to be released first quarter of 2008.

In 2017, there was a mishap of baggage handling which caused 50 flights delays and affected 1500 passengers which later managed to be solved. The increasing passengers traffics and non-optimized system due to never being replaced gave a signal for MAHB to implement BHS upgrade in 2019 which predictably will cost RM 500-600 million. There are four Bursa Malaysia company with joining in force with six multinational company were competing for the tender. The project was being given to T7 Kemuncak Sdn. Bhd. with the joint venture with Siemens Logistics.

The AMS houses a Meteorological Data Processing System (MDPS) for weather data collection, processing, storage and analytical needs. AMS constantly make weather observations using radiosonde instrument to measure atmospheric profiles such as wind speed, wind direction, pressure, temperature and humidity at every level up to an altitude of about 30 kilometres before issuing aerodrome warnings on adverse weather for protection of aerodrome facilities and aircraft on the ground.

==Terminals==
Kuala Lumpur International Airport comprises two main terminals: the original terminal, Terminal 1, previously known simply as &quot;KLIA&quot;; and the newer Terminal 2 (formerly KLIA2). Terminal 1 was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa, who also designed the Domestic Terminal (T2) at Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport, with an emphasis of natural lighting within the airport complex. Spanning 38.4m along a grid pattern allowing for future expansions, the abstract symbolic architecture by the late Kisho Kurokawa encompasses the Islamic geometry and cutting-edge technology with the tropical rainforest in mind.

===KLIA Terminal 1===
====Main Terminal Building====
The KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) now also referred to as KLIA Main is located in between the two runways. The floor area of the terminal covers and the building consists of 39 square roof units, which enables future expansion of the building. There are a total of 216 check-in counters, located in 6 different islands, identified by the letters A – M (excluding I). Multi check-in services are available, designed for the use of all passengers arriving, departing or in transit. Self check in facilities are available in this airport since 2007, and KLM was the first airline to use the Common-use self-service kiosks.
The contact pier is an extension of the main terminal building with gates marked with prefix A and B for domestic departures, G and H for international flights. The gate allocation is based on operational requirements, although it has been observed that Malaysia Airlines has been operating most of its operations out from the contact pier.

====Satellite Terminal A====
The satellite building accommodates international flights departing and arriving at KLIA T1. Passengers taking flights parked at the satellite terminal are transported by bus from the main terminal; as of March 2023, the Aerotrain that connects this building with the main terminal has been suspended for repairs and rolling stock replacement and is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2025.

There is a wide array of duty-free shops and prestige brand boutiques in the satellite building. This includes international brands such as Burberry, Harrods, Montblanc, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Hermes. Among all international labels available within the terminal, some boutiques such as Harrods are only available in the airport. A number of restaurants and international airlines&#x27; lounges are available as well as an Airside Transit Hotel.
Within the terminal, wireless internet (Wi-Fi) is provided free of charge. The terminal also has prayer rooms, showers and massage service. Various lounge areas are provided, some including children&#x27;s play areas and movie lounge, broadcasting movie and sport channels. The terminal also features a natural rainforest in the middle of the terminal, exhibiting the Malaysian rainforests.

Under Malaysia Airports Berhad retail optimisation plan, the retail space in satellite terminal A will be further optimised to increase its revenue derived from commercial space rental and a percentage of sale receipts to 50% by year 2010 which currently stands at 35%. Some notable improvements that will be seen after the refurbishments will be the Jungle Boardwalk which will be the first of its kind in the world and larger mezzanine floor to accommodate F&amp;B outlets and viewing galleries.

The gates in Satellite Terminal A have the prefix C. The Satellite A terminal has 27 boarding gates altogether.

===KL City Air Terminal===
KL City Air Terminal, sometimes known as Kuala Lumpur City Air Terminal or KL CAT, located at KL Sentral, is a virtual extension of KL International Airport where city check-in services are provided. KL City Air Terminal is recognised by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and carries the IATA designation XKL. Currently there are only three airlines providing city check-in services: Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines and Batik Air Malaysia.

===KLIA Terminal 2 (formerly known as KLIA2)===
Built at a cost of approximately RM4 billion, it is the largest purpose-built terminal optimised for low-cost carriers, like AirAsia in response to the exponential growth of low-cost travel in the region. It was built to replace the previous Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT). KLIA T2 began its operations on 2 May 2014, and all flight operations at LCCT were moved to KLIA T2 by 9 May 2014.

As part of its development, a third runway (Runway 15/33) and a new air traffic control tower (Tower West) were built to support its operation. KLIA T2 has an initial capacity of 45 million passengers per year. The terminal has a built-up area of 257,845 sqm with 68 departure gates, 10 remote stands, 80 aerobridges, includes a retail space of 32,000 sqm to accommodate a total of 220 retail outlets. The main terminal building of KLIA T2 is connected with its satellite piers with a skybridge, making it the first airport in Asia with such facility. KLIA T2 is certified with Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED).
Check-in counters are divided into 8 rows located in 4 islands, each row identified by the letters S – Z. Boarding gates are located in 5 piers, indicated by the letters J and K for domestic flights, and L, P and Q for international flights. Piers J, K and L are connected directly to the main terminal building, while Piers P and Q are accessible via the skybridge. Piers K and L are physically the same pier and share the same gates, but with waiting lounges on different levels (Level 1A for K and Level 2 for L). For international flights, the access door from Pier K is sealed off, while for domestic flights, the access door from Pier L is sealed off instead.

At present, inter-terminal connection is provided on the landside at Gateway@klia2 complex and there are provisions for future airside inter-terminal connection.

====Gateway@klia2====

Gateway@klia2 is an integrated shopping complex that is connected to the main KLIA T2 terminal building. It has a 350,000 square feet of net lettable space spanning over four levels. The transport hub at Gateway@klia2 links klia2 to the KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit service, with allotted pick-up and drop-off areas for coaches, taxis, rented vehicles and private transportation.

Gateway@klia2 hosts an 8-storey car park that directly adjoins KLIA T2. There are 6,000 covered parking lots at Blocks A and B and another 5,500 lots at car park D (KLIA2 parking rate). Shuttle buses are available to take the public from the car park D to the terminal. The first capsule transit hotel in Asia, the Capsule by Container Hotel, is also located at Gateway@klia2. Gateway@klia2 is managed by WCT Holdings Berhad.

===Former Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT)===
The now defunct low cost carrier terminal (LCCT) was opened at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on 23 March 2006 to cater for the growing number of users of low-cost airlines, especially the passengers of Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;no-frills&quot; airline AirAsia. The terminal was designed and built in accordance to the low cost carrier business model, with limited terminal amenities. As requested by the low-cost airlines, the terminal did not provide aerobridges, nor were there transfer facilities, rail connections, and the other facilities provided in a fully fledged terminal. LCCT was located within the Air Support Zone; it ceased operations on 9 May 2014, and all low-cost carrier flights subsequently operated out of KLIA T2. 
===Future Expansion Plans===
Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) has announced plans to expand the Kuala Lumpur International Airport to accommodate the increasing number of air travelers. Transport Minister, Anthony Loke Siew Fook stated that the proposal includes increasing the capacity of KLIA Terminal 1 from 30 million passengers per annum (mppa) to 59 mppa and KLIA Terminal 2 from 45 mppa to 67 mppa. The expansion plan also considers constructing a fourth runway and a new Terminal 3 in the future.

In addition to the long-term plans, short-term measures have been introduced to improve the passenger experience, such as the installation of self-check-in kiosks and the addition of 20 new immigration autogates. Furthermore, MAHB plans to build a Private Premium Terminal designed for passengers seeking premium services, offering expedited immigration and customs processes and accommodating up to 100 users at a time. This project is currently in the planning stage and is expected to begin in 2025.

MAHB also aims to establish a Hajj and Umrah Terminal with a capacity of five mppa, specifically catering to Muslim pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia. This terminal would enable Saudi Arabia&#x27;s immigration pre-clearance procedures to be conducted at KLIA, reducing waiting times at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah. However, this development is contingent on approval from the Saudi Arabian government.

==Other buildings==
Malaysia Airlines has its head office in the Southern Support Zone. The head office moved there in December 2015.

The Air Asia head office is located on the airport property. AirAsia planned to move its head office to a new , RM140mil facility constructed at klia2. Until the new head office opened, the airline&#x27;s head office remained at LCCT. The new klia2 head office was scheduled to open in the end of 2015. It is scheduled to hold about 2,000 AirAsia and AirAsia X employees. Aireen Omar, the AirAsia Country CEO of Malaysia, stated that the headquarters needed to be redesigned because in the klia2 plans the location of the control tower had been changed. Construction on the facility was scheduled to begin in July 2014. Malaysia Airports Holdings is leasing the land that will be occupied by the headquarters. A Philippines AirAsia X flight attendant, January Ann Baysa gave the building the name &quot;RedQuarters&quot; or &quot;RedQ&quot;, and its groundbreaking ceremony was held in November 2014. The project was completed and opened on 7 November 2016.

MASkargo has its head office at 1M, Zone C in the Advanced Cargo Centre in the KLIA Free Commercial Zone in the Southern Support Zone Malaysia Airports has its head office in the Malaysia Airports Corporate Office in the Persiaran Korporat KLIA. Malaysia Airlines operates its Flight Management Building at KLIA. It includes the head office of MAS Golden Boutiques Sdn. Bhd.

==Ground transportation==

===Inter-terminal transportation===
The Aerotrain, currently out of service for repairs, is an automated people mover (APM) that connects the airside of KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) and the Satellite Building. Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56 km/h (35 mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and five-minute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.

No airside connection currently exists between the Main Terminal Building and Terminal 2; connecting passengers must clear Malaysian immigration and customs checks before taking a landside transportation option (Express Rail Link, bus or taxi).

===External connections===

==Expansion and developments==

===Plans===
With the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2&#x27;s satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2&#x27;s satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1&#x27;s (the current Main Terminal) satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.

On 12 December 2024, Transport Minister, Anthony Loke Siew Fook announced that plans to expand KLIA are in the pipeline to cater for the increasing flight passengers. The proposal includes increasing the capacity of T1 from 30 million passengers per annum to 59 million and T2 from 45 million to 67 million. A fourth runway and a new terminal, T3 are also in consideration.

===A380 upgrades===

<text>Louis Francis Cristillo (March 6, 1906 – March 3, 1959), better known as Lou Costello, was an American comedian, actor and producer. He was best known for his double act with Bud Abbott and their routine &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;.

Abbott and Costello, who teamed in burlesque in 1936, were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. During a national tour in 1942, they sold $85 million in war bonds in 35 days. By 1955, their popularity waned from , and their film and television contracts lapsed. Their partnership ended in 1957.

==Early life==
Louis Francis Cristillo was born on March 6, 1906, in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Sebastiano Cristillo, an insurance sales agent, and Helen Rege, a silk weaver. His father was Italian, from Caserta, while his mother was an American of Italian, French and Irish ancestry, with her grandfather Francesco Rege being a native of Piedmont, Italy.

Costello attended Public School 15 in Paterson and was considered a gifted athlete. He excelled in basketball and reportedly was twice Paterson&#x27;s free-throw champion. His basketball prowess can be seen in &quot;Here Come the Co-Eds&quot; (1945), in which he performs his own trick basketball shots. He also fought as a boxer under the name of Lou King.

==Career==
Costello was a great admirer of silent-film comedian Charlie Chaplin. In 1927, Costello hitchhiked to Hollywood to become an actor, but could only find work as a laborer or extra at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Hal Roach Studios. His athletic skill brought him occasional work as a stunt man, notably in &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98&quot; (1928). He can also be spotted sitting ringside in the Laurel and Hardy film &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; (1927). He said that he took his professional name from actress Helene Costello, although by this time his brother Anthony (Pat) had used the name in his career as a professional musician.

===Burlesque and Bud Abbott===
In 1928, with the advent of talking pictures, Costello headed back east intending to acquire theatrical experience. Stranded in St. Joseph, Missouri, he persuaded a local burlesque producer to hire him as a &quot;Dutch&quot; comic, a corruption of &quot;Deutsch,&quot;meaning &quot;German&quot; in this context. (See also Joe Weber and Lew Fields.) By the end of 1928, Costello was back in New Jersey. He began working in burlesque on the Mutual Burlesque wheel in 1929.

After the Mutual Wheel collapsed during the Great Depression, Costello worked for several stock burlesque impresarios, including the Minskys, where he crossed paths with talented producer and straight man Bud Abbott. They did not work together until 1935 at the Eltinge Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City after Costello&#x27;s straight man fell ill. They formally teamed in 1936.

===Radio and Hollywood===

Abbott and Costello were signed by the William Morris talent agency, which landed them featured roles and national exposure on &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot;, a popular radio variety show, in 1938. The team&#x27;s signature routine, &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;, made its radio debut on Smith&#x27;s show early that year. Many of the team&#x27;s sketches were further polished by John Grant, who was hired soon after the team joined the program. Their success on the Smith show led to their appearance in a Broadway musical in 1939, &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot;.

Abbott and Costello were hosting a summer replacement series for &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; in 1940 when they were signed by Universal Pictures for supporting roles in &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot; (1940). They stole the film with their classic routines, including a shortened version of &quot;Who&#x27;s On First?&quot; (the complete version was performed in &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot;, released in 1945). The team&#x27;s breakthrough picture was &quot;Buck Privates&quot;, released early in 1941. Three more films followed in 1941, and they were voted the No. 3 box-office stars that year.

That year they became regulars on Edgar Bergen&#x27;s &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Program&quot;, and in October 1942 launched their own series, &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; on NBC. The show ran on NBC through the spring of 1947, then ABC through the spring of 1949.

===Fame and tragedy===
As their careers grew more successful, serious cracks began to appear in Abbott and Costello&#x27;s relationship. Reportedly their first disagreement occurred in 1936 over a booking in a minstrel show at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Costello wanted to accept the gig, which was outside their usual burlesque venues, but Abbott was hesitant. Costello offered Abbott a larger split of their salary, and Abbott agreed. At the end of 1941, Costello insisted that the team split their income 60/40 in Costello&#x27;s favor, and Abbott agreed.

Abbott and Costello appeared in 36 films from 1940 to 1956 and were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. Among their most popular films are &quot;Buck Privates&quot;, &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;, &quot;Who Done It?&quot;, &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot;, &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;, &quot;Buck Privates Come Home&quot;, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man&quot;.

In the summer of 1942, Abbott and Costello embarked on a 35-day cross-country tour to promote and sell war bonds. The Treasury Department credited them with the sale of $85 million in bonds.

In March 1943, after completing a winter tour of army bases, Costello suffered an attack of rheumatic fever and was unable to work for six months. On November 4 of that year, he returned to the team&#x27;s popular radio show, but while rehearsing at their NBC studio, Costello received word that his infant son Lou Jr. had accidentally drowned in the family pool. Unnoticed by the nanny, the baby had worked loose the slats in his playpen and fallen into the pool.

The baby was just two days short of his first birthday. Costello had asked his wife to keep Lou Jr. up to hear his father on the radio for the first time. Rather than cancel the broadcast, Costello said, &quot;Wherever he is tonight, I want him to hear me,&quot; and proceeded with the show. No one in the audience knew of the death until after the show, when Bud Abbott explained the sad events of the day and how Costello epitomized the phrase &quot;the show must go on&quot; that night. Maxene Andrews of the Andrews Sisters said that Costello&#x27;s demeanor changed after the loss of his son: &quot;He didn&#x27;t seem as fun-loving and as warm... He seemed to anger easily... there was a difference in his attitude.&quot;

In 1945, when Costello fired a maid and Abbott hired her, Costello announced that he would no longer work with Abbott. They remained under contract to Universal and were required to complete two films in 1946, which became &quot;Little Giant&quot; and &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;. The two men did not appear together much in either film and rarely spoke to one another off-camera. Abbott attempted to heal their relationship by suggesting that the foundation that they had founded for rheumatic fever sufferers be named the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation, which touched Costello deeply. The youth foundation still exists in Los Angeles.

Their radio program moved to ABC, the former NBC Blue Network, from 1947 to 1949 and was prerecorded.

In 1951, the duo began to appear on live television, joining the rotating hosts of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour.&quot; Eddie Cantor, Martin and Lewis and Bob Hope were among the others. In 1952, their filmed situation comedy &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; began running in syndication nationwide. Costello owned the half-hour series, with Abbott working on salary. The show, which was loosely adapted from their radio program and films, ran for two seasons from 1952 to 1954 but found long life in syndicated reruns.

Abbott and Costello were forced to withdraw from &quot;Fireman Save My Child&quot; in 1954 after Costello suffered a relapse of rheumatic fever. They were replaced by studio contract players Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Buddy Hackett.

Costello was surprised and honored by Ralph Edwards on NBC&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1956.

===Abbott and Costello split===
By the mid-1950s, Abbott and Costello no longer ranked among the top box-office stars. They were undermined by overexposure in concurrent film and television appearances, and were eclipsed by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who were as popular in the 1950s as Abbott and Costello had been a decade earlier. In 1955 the team could not reach a contract agreement with Universal and left the studio after 15 years.

In the early 1950s, troubles with the Internal Revenue Service forced both men to sell their large homes and the rights to some of their films. Abbott and Costello&#x27;s final film together, &quot;Dance with Me, Henry&quot; (1956), was a box-office disappointment and received mixed critical reviews.

Abbott and Costello dissolved their partnership amicably early in 1957. Costello worked with other comedians, including Sidney Fields in Las Vegas, and sought film and television projects. He appeared several times on Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, most often performing his old routines with Louis Nye or Tom Poston in the straight-man role. In 1958, he played a dramatic role in the episode &quot;The Tobias Jones Story&quot; of &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

==Death==

Shortly after completion of &quot;The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock&quot;, his only film after the partnership with Abbott ended, Costello suffered a heart attack. He died at Doctors Hospital in Beverly Hills on March 3, 1959, three days before his 53rd birthday. Sources conflict on the circumstances of his last day and final words. According to some accounts, he told visitors that the strawberry ice cream soda that he had just finished was &quot;the best I ever tasted&quot; and then died.

By other reports, including those of several contemporaneous obituaries, the ice-cream soda exchange occurred earlier in the day. Later, after his wife and friends had departed, he asked his nurse to adjust his position in bed just before suffering a fatal cardiac arrest.

After a funeral Mass at his Catholic parish, St. Francis de Sales in Sherman Oaks, Costello was interred at the Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles on March 8. His wife Anne died from an apparent heart attack nine months later on December 5, 1959, at age 47.

==Family==
On January 30, 1934, Costello married Anne Battler, a burlesque chorus dancer. Their first child, Patricia &quot;Paddy&quot; Costello, was born in 1936, followed by Carole on December 23, 1938, and Lou Jr. (nicknamed &quot;Butch&quot;) on November 6, 1942, who died in a drowning incident a year later. Their last child, Christine, was born on August 15, 1947.
Costello&#x27;s elder brother Pat Costello was a musician who led his own band before moving to Hollywood, where he was enlisted to perform stunts in Lou&#x27;s place in the first ten Abbott and Costello films. He later appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot; (1948).
Costello&#x27;s sister Marie Katherine Cristillo (1912–1988) was married to actor Joe Kirk (Nat Curcuruto), who portrayed Mr. Bacciagalupe on the Abbott and Costello radio and television shows and appeared in supporting roles in several of the team&#x27;s films.

Costello&#x27;s daughter Carole appeared in uncredited baby roles in a few Abbott and Costello films. She would later become a contestant coordinator for the game show &quot;Card Sharks&quot; as well as a nightclub singer. She died of a stroke on March 29, 1987, aged 48, while married to Craig Martin, eldest son of Dean Martin. Carole&#x27;s daughter Marki Costello is an actress, director and producer in film and television.

Costello&#x27;s daughter Chris published a biography titled &quot;Lou&#x27;s on First&quot; in 1981.

==Memorials==

In 1946, Costello was joined by Abbott to fund the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation, a 3.3-acre recreation center on Olympic Blvd. in the Boyle Heights district of Los Angeles. Opened on May 3, 1947, it included a baseball field and swimming pool. In 1951 the center was sold to the city for less than one-third of its cost, and the name was changed to the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Recreation Center.

On June 26, 1992, the city of Paterson, New Jersey, in conjunction with the Lou Costello Memorial Association, erected a statue of Costello in the newly named Lou Costello Memorial Park in the city&#x27;s historic downtown section. It shows Costello holding a baseball bat, a reference to the team&#x27;s most famous routine, &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;. The statue has been shown in two episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and in the film &quot;Paterson&quot; (2016). In 2005, Madison Street, in the Sandy Hill section of Paterson where Costello was born, was renamed Lou Costello Place.

The centennial of Costello&#x27;s birth was celebrated in Paterson in March 2006. From June 24 to 26, 2006, the Fort Lee Film Commission held a centennial film retrospective at the Fine Arts Theatre in Hollywood. Films screened included the premiere of a digital film produced by the teenagers of the present-day Lou Costello Jr. Recreation Center in East Los Angeles. Also premiered was a 35 mm restored print of the Costello-produced 1948 short film &quot;10,000 Kids and a Cop&quot;, which was shot at the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Center in East Los Angeles.

In 2009, Costello was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

Abbott and Costello are among the few non-baseball personnel to be memorialized in the Baseball Hall of Fame, although they are not formal inductees. A plaque and a gold record of the &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; sketch have been on permanent display there since 1956, and a video of the routine loops endlessly in the exhibit area.

<doc id="105967" wikidata="Q179208" url="?curid=105967" title="Cayley's theorem">
<text>In group theory, Cayley&#x27;s theorem, named in honour of Arthur Cayley, states that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group. 
More specifically, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group formula_1 whose elements are the permutations of the underlying set of .
Explicitly,
* for each formula_2, the left-multiplication-by- map formula_3 sending each element to is a permutation of , and
* the map formula_4 sending each element to formula_5 is an injective homomorphism, so it defines an isomorphism from onto a subgroup of formula_1.
The homomorphism formula_4 can also be understood as arising from the left translation action of on the underlying set .

When is finite, formula_1 is finite too. The proof of Cayley&#x27;s theorem in this case shows that if is a finite group of order , then is isomorphic to a subgroup of the standard symmetric group formula_9. But might also be isomorphic to a subgroup of a smaller symmetric group, formula_10 for some formula_11; for instance, the order 6 group formula_12 is not only isomorphic to a subgroup of formula_13, but also (trivially) isomorphic to a subgroup of formula_14. The problem of finding the minimal-order symmetric group into which a given group embeds is rather difficult.

Alperin and Bell note that &quot;in general the fact that finite groups are imbedded in symmetric groups has not influenced the methods used to study finite groups&quot;.

When is infinite, formula_1 is infinite, but Cayley&#x27;s theorem still applies.

== History ==
While it seems elementary enough, at the time the modern definitions did not exist, and when Cayley introduced what are now called &quot;groups&quot; it was not immediately clear that this was equivalent to the previously known groups, which are now called &quot;permutation groups&quot;. Cayley&#x27;s theorem unifies the two.

Although Burnside 
attributes the theorem 
to Jordan, 
Eric Nummela 
nonetheless argues that the standard name—&quot;Cayley&#x27;s Theorem&quot;—is in fact appropriate. Cayley, in his original 1854 paper, 
showed that the correspondence in the theorem is one-to-one, but he failed to explicitly show it was a homomorphism (and thus an embedding). However, Nummela notes that Cayley made this result known to the mathematical community at the time, thus predating Jordan by 16 years or so.

The theorem was later published by Walther Dyck in 1882 and is attributed to Dyck in the first edition of Burnside&#x27;s book.

== Background ==

A &quot;permutation&quot; of a set is a bijective function from to . The set of all permutations of forms a group under function composition, called &quot;the symmetric group on&quot; , and written as formula_16.
In particular, taking to be the underlying set of a group produces a symmetric group denoted formula_1.

== Proof of the theorem ==
If &quot;g&quot; is any element of a group &quot;G&quot; with operation ∗, consider the function , defined by . By the existence of inverses, this function has also an inverse, formula_18. So multiplication by &quot;g&quot; acts as a bijective function. Thus, &quot;f&quot;&quot;g&quot; is a permutation of &quot;G&quot;, and so is a member of Sym(&quot;G&quot;).

The set is a subgroup of Sym(&quot;G&quot;) that is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;. The fastest way to establish this is to consider the function with for every &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. &quot;T&quot; is a group homomorphism because (using · to denote composition in Sym(&quot;G&quot;)):

:formula_19
for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, and hence:
:formula_20
The homomorphism &quot;T&quot; is injective since (the identity element of Sym(&quot;G&quot;)) implies that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, and taking &quot;x&quot; to be the identity element &quot;e&quot; of &quot;G&quot; yields , i.e. the kernel is trivial. Alternatively, &quot;T&quot; is also injective since implies that (because every group is cancellative).

Thus &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the image of &quot;T&quot;, which is the subgroup &quot;K&quot;.

&quot;T&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;regular representation of&quot; &quot;G&quot;.

=== Alternative setting of proof ===
An alternative setting uses the language of group actions. We consider the group formula_21 as acting on itself by left multiplication, i.e. formula_22, which has a permutation representation, say formula_23.

The representation is faithful if formula_24 is injective, that is, if the kernel of formula_24 is trivial. Suppose formula_26. Then, formula_27. Thus, formula_28 is trivial. The result follows by use of the first isomorphism theorem, from which we get formula_29.

==Remarks on the regular group representation==
The identity element of the group corresponds to the identity permutation. All other group elements correspond to derangements: permutations that do not leave any element unchanged. Since this also applies for powers of a group element, lower than the order of that element, each element corresponds to a permutation that consists of cycles all of the same length: this length is the order of that element. The elements in each cycle form a right coset of the subgroup generated by the element.

==Examples of the regular group representation==
formula_30 with addition modulo 2; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (12) (see cycle notation). E.g. 0 +1 = 1 and 1+1 = 0, so formula_31 and formula_32 as they would under a permutation.

formula_33 with addition modulo 3; group element 0 corresponds to the identity permutation e, group element 1 to permutation (123), and group element 2 to permutation (132). E.g. 1 + 1 = 2 corresponds to (123)(123) = (132).

formula_34 with addition modulo 4; the elements correspond to e, (1234), (13)(24), (1432).

The elements of Klein four-group {e, a, b, c} correspond to e, (12)(34), (13)(24), and (14)(23).

S3 (dihedral group of order 6) is the group of all permutations of 3 objects, but also a permutation group of the 6 group elements, and the latter is how it is realized by its regular representation.


== More general statement==

Theorem: 
Let be a group, and let be a subgroup.
Let formula_35 be the set of left cosets of in .
Let be the normal core of in , defined to be the intersection of the conjugates of in . 
Then the quotient group formula_36 is isomorphic to a subgroup of formula_37.

The special case formula_38 is Cayley&#x27;s original theorem.

<doc id="105968" wikidata="Q525433" url="?curid=105968" title="Earl of Albemarle">
<text>Earl of Albemarle is a title created several times from Norman times onwards. The word &quot;Albemarle&quot; is derived from the Latinised form of the French county of &quot;Aumale&quot; in Normandy (Latin: &quot;Alba Marla&quot; meaning &quot;White Marl&quot;, marl being a type of fertile soil), other forms being &quot;Aubemarle&quot; and &quot;Aumerle&quot;. It is described in the patent of nobility granted in 1697 by William III to Arnold Joost van Keppel as &quot;a town and territory in the Dukedom of Normandy.&quot;

The family seat is Hurst Barns Farm, near East Chiltington, East Sussex.

==Early creations==
Aumale was raised by William the Conqueror into a county for his half-sister, Adelaide, and in England translated to an earldom for her husband and their descendants. The earldom became extinct with the death of Aveline, daughter of the 4th earl, in 1274. The title was twice raised to a dukedom, in 1385 and in 1397, before being recreated as an earldom in 1412 for Thomas, 2nd son of Henry IV.

In 1660 the title, anglicized as Albemarle, was revived in the peerage by King Charles II for General George Monck, who became Duke of Albemarle. The title became extinct in 1688, on the death of Christopher, 2nd Duke of Albemarle.

==1697 creation==
In 1697, King William III created his Dutch favourite Arnold Joost van Keppel Earl of Albemarle in the Peerage of England. He was made Baron Ashford, of Ashford in the County of Kent, and Viscount Bury, in the County of Lancaster, at the same time. The motive for choosing this title was probably that, apart from its traditions, it avoided the difficulty created by the fact that the Keppels had as yet no territorial possessions in the British Islands. Lord Albemarle was succeeded by his only son, the second Earl. He was a general in the army and also served as titular Governor of Virginia and as Ambassador to France. Albemarle County in Virginia is named in his honour, even though he never set foot in North America (but, instead, saw plenty of &quot;North Britain&quot; after the Battle of Culloden in 1746). He married Lady Anne Lennox, daughter of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, illegitimate son of King Charles II.

His eldest son, the third Earl, was also a successful military commander, best known as the commander-in-chief of the invasion and occupation of Havana and west Cuba in 1762. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He served as Master of the Buckhounds and as Master of the Horse. His second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl, was also a soldier and fought at the Battle of Waterloo at an early age. He later represented Arundel in the House of Commons. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl who lived on his estate at Drumsna in County Leitrim, Ireland, for much of his life. He also fought at Waterloo in early life and was later promoted to general. Albemarle also sat as Member of Parliament for East Norfolk and Lymington.

His only son, the seventh Earl, was a soldier and politician. At first a Liberal, he held minor office under Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell from 1859 to 1866. In 1876, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Ashford. He had previously joined the Conservative Party and served under Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for War. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He was a colonel in the army and also briefly represented Birkenhead in Parliament.

 the titles are held by his great-grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his grandfather in 1979. Lord Albemarle is also in remainder to the ancient barony of de Clifford as the great-great-great-great-grandson of Elizabeth Southwell, daughter of Edward Southwell, 20th Baron de Clifford, and wife of the fourth Earl of Albemarle.

Several other members of the Keppel family have also gained distinction. Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel, second son of the second Earl, was a prominent naval commander, when he passed his home Elveden Hall to his nephew the 1st Earl Albemarle, who sold it. William Keppel, third son of the second Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the army. Frederick Keppel, fourth son of the second Earl, was Bishop of Exeter. Sir Henry Keppel, fourth son of the fourth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Sir Derek Keppel, second son of the seventh Earl, was a soldier and prominent member of the Royal household. George Keppel, third son of the seventh Earl, was the husband of Alice Edmondstone, one of the many mistresses of King Edward VII, and the father (although his paternity has been questioned) of the writer and socialite Violet Trefusis and of Mrs. Sonia Cubitt. The latter was the grandmother of Queen Camilla.

===Coat of arms===
The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Keppel family is: &quot;Gules, three escallops argent&quot;.

<text>Abbott and Costello were an American comedy duo composed of comedians Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, whose work in radio, film, and television made them the most popular comedy team of the 1940s and 1950s, and the highest-paid entertainers in the world during the Second World War. Their patter routine &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; is considered one of the greatest comedy routines of all time, a version of which appears in their 1945 film &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot;.

Abbott and Costello made their film debut in the 1940 comedy &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot;. The following year, they appeared in three war-themed comedies: &quot;Buck Privates&quot;, &quot;In the Navy&quot;, and &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Flying&quot;. They also appeared in the 1941 horror comedy film &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;, and went on to appear in several other horror comedies, including &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948), &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff&quot; (1949), &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man&quot; (1951), &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1953), and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; (1955). Other films starring the duo include &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot;, &quot;Who Done It?&quot; (both 1942), &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot; (1946), &quot;Buck Privates Come Home&quot; (1947), &quot;Africa Screams&quot; (1949), and &quot;Abbott and Costello Go to Mars&quot; (1953).

==Burlesque==
The two comedians had crossed paths a few times previously, but first worked together in 1935 at the Eltinge Burlesque Theater on 42nd Street in New York City. Their first performance resulted from Costello&#x27;s regular partner becoming ill, and Abbott substituting for him.

Other performers in the show, including Abbott&#x27;s wife, encouraged a permanent pairing. The duo built an act by refining and reworking numerous burlesque sketches with Abbott as the devious straight man and Costello as the dimwitted comic.

Decades later, when AMC moved the old theater further west on 42nd Street to its current location, giant balloons of Abbott and Costello were rigged to appear to pull it.

==Radio==

The team&#x27;s first known radio broadcast was on &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; on February 3, 1938. At first, the similarities between their voices made it difficult for radio listeners (as opposed to stage audiences) to tell them apart during their rapid-fire repartee. As a result, Costello affected a high-pitched, childish voice. &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; was first performed for a national radio audience the following month. They performed on the program as regulars for two years, while also landing roles in a Broadway revue, &quot;The Streets of Paris&quot;, in 1939.
After debuting their own program, &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;, as Fred Allen&#x27;s summer replacement in 1940, Abbott and Costello joined Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; in 1941. Two of their films (&quot;Hold That Ghost&quot; and &quot;Buck Privates&quot;) were adapted for radio that year. &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot; was presented as a half-hour adaptation on August 1, 1941 on Louella Parsons&#x27; &quot;Hollywood Premiere&quot;, and &quot;Buck Privates&quot; was presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; as a one-hour adaptation on October 13, 1941. Their program returned in its own weekly time slot starting on October 8, 1942, with Camel cigarettes as sponsor.

&quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; mixed comedy with musical interludes (by vocalists such as Connie Haines, Ashley Eustis, the Delta Rhythm Boys, Skinnay Ennis, Marilyn Maxwell and the Les Baxter Singers).

Among the show&#x27;s regular and semi-regular performers were Joe Kirk (Costello&#x27;s brother-in-law) as the excitable Sicilian immigrant Mr. Bacciagalupe, Artie Auerbach as Mr. Kitzel, Elvia Allman, Iris Adrian, Mel Blanc, Wally Brown, Sharon Douglas, Verna Felton, Sidney Fields, Frank Nelson, Martha Wentworth and Benay Venuta. Guest stars included Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, The Andrews Sisters and Lucille Ball.

Ken Niles was the show&#x27;s longtime announcer, doubling as an exasperated foil to Costello, who routinely insulted his on-air wife (played by Elvia Allman). Niles was succeeded by Michael Roy, alternating over the years with Frank Bingman and Jim Doyle.

The show went through several orchestras, including those of Ennis, Charles Hoff, Matty Matlock, Matty Malneck, Jack Meakin, Will Osborne, Fred Rich, Leith Stevens and Peter van Steeden.

The show&#x27;s writers included Howard Harris, Hal Fimberg, Parke Levy, Don Prindle, Eddie Cherkose (later known as Eddie Maxwell), Leonard B. Stern, Martin Ragaway, Paul Conlan and Eddie Forman, as well as producer Martin Gosch. Sound effects were handled primarily by Floyd Caton.

In 1947, the show moved to ABC (the former NBC Blue Network). During their time on ABC the duo also hosted a 30-minute children&#x27;s radio program (&quot;The Abbott and Costello Children&#x27;s Show&quot;) on Saturday mornings. The program featured child vocalist Anna Mae Slaughter and child announcer Johnny McGovern. It finished its run in 1949.
==Film==
In 1940, Universal Studios signed them for a musical, &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot; starring Allan Jones and Nancy Kelly. Cast in supporting roles, Abbott and Costello stole the picture with several classic routines, including &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;. Signed to a two-picture contract, their second film, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; (1941), directed by Arthur Lubin and co-starring The Andrews Sisters, was a massive hit, earning $4 million at the box office and launching Abbott and Costello as stars.

Their next film was a haunted house comedy, &quot;Oh, Charlie!&quot;; however, &quot;Buck Privates&quot; was so successful that the studio decided to delay the release so the team could hastily film and release a second service comedy. &quot;In the Navy&quot; (1941), co-starred crooner Dick Powell and the Andrews Sisters, and initially out-grossed &quot;Buck Privates&quot;. Loew&#x27;s Criterion in Manhattan was open until 5 a.m. to oblige over 49,000 customers during the film&#x27;s first week.

&quot;Oh, Charlie&quot; went back into production to add music featuring the Andrews Sisters and Ted Lewis. The film was eventually retitled &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot; (1941). The duo next appeared in &quot;Ride &#x27;Em Cowboy&quot; (1941), with Dick Foran, but its release was delayed so they could appear in a third service comedy, &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Flying&quot; (1941). This was their last film directed by Arthur Lubin. All of their 1941 films were big hits, and Abbott and Costello were voted the third biggest box office attraction in the country in 1941.

Universal loaned the team to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a musical comedy, &quot;Rio Rita&quot; (1942). During filming Abbott and Costello had their hand and foot prints set in concrete at what was then &quot;Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&quot;. Back at Universal they made &quot;Pardon My Sarong&quot; (1942), a spoof of South Sea Island movies; and &quot;Who Done It?&quot; (1942), a comedy-mystery.

In 1942, exhibitors voted them the top box office stars in the country, and their earnings for the fiscal year were $789,026. The team did a 35-day tour during the summer of 1942 to promote and sell War Bonds. The Treasury Department credited them with $85 million in sales.

After the tour the team starred in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Hay&quot; (1943), from a story by Damon Runyon; and &quot;Hit the Ice&quot; (1943).

Costello was stricken with rheumatic fever upon his return from a winter tour of army bases in March 1943 and was bedridden for approximately six months. On November 4, 1943, the same day that Costello returned to radio after a one-year hiatus due to his illness, his infant son Lou Jr. (nicknamed &quot;Butch&quot; and born November 6, 1942) died in an accidental drowning in the family&#x27;s swimming pool. Maxene Andrews remembers visiting Costello with sisters Patty and LaVerne during his illness, and remembered how Costello&#x27;s demeanor changed after the tragic loss of his son, recalling, &quot;He didn&#x27;t seem as fun-loving and as warm...He seemed to anger easily...there was a difference in his attitude&quot;.

After Costello recovered, the duo returned to MGM for &quot;Lost in a Harem&quot; (1944) then were back at Universal for &quot;In Society&quot; (1944), &quot;Here Come the Co-Eds&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot; (1945). Their third and final film for MGM was &quot;Abbott and Costello in Hollywood&quot; (1945).

In 1945, a rift developed when Abbott hired a domestic servant who had been fired by Costello. Costello refused to speak to his partner except when performing. The following year they made two films, (&quot;Little Giant&quot; and &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;), in which they appeared as separate characters rather than as a team. This was likely the result of the tensions between them, plus the fact that their most recent films had not performed as well at the box office. Abbott resolved the rift when he suggested naming Costello&#x27;s pet charity, a foundation for underprivileged children, the &quot;Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation.&quot; The facility opened in 1947 and still serves the Boyle Heights district of Los Angeles.

Abbott and Costello reunited as a team in &quot;Buck Privates Come Home&quot; (1947), a sequel to their 1941 hit. In &quot;The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap&quot; (1947) they were supported by Marjorie Main. They signed a new contract with Universal which allowed them to appear in films outside of their studio contract. The first of these, &quot;The Noose Hangs High&quot; (1948), was distributed by Eagle-Lion.

The team&#x27;s next film, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948), co-starring Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr, was a massive hit and revitalized the duo&#x27;s careers. It was followed by &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot; (1948), an adaptation of a Cole Porter musical without the songs. They followed with &quot;Africa Screams&quot; (1949) for Nassour Studios, an independent company which was released through United Artists. Back at Universal, they returned to horror comedy with &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff&quot; (1949).

The pair was sidelined again for several months when Costello suffered a relapse of rheumatic fever. They returned to the screen in &quot;Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion&quot; (1950). They returned the following year in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man&quot; (1951); then &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; (1952), a hillbilly comedy.

Their first color film, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1952), was an independent production distributed by Warner Bros. After filming &quot;Lost in Alaska&quot; (1952) back at Universal, they made a second independent color movie, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd&quot; (1952) co-starring Charles Laughton, which was also distributed by Warner Bros.

At Universal, they starred in &quot;Abbott and Costello Go to Mars&quot; (1953) and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1953). They were forced to withdraw from &quot;Fireman Save My Child&quot; in 1954 due to Costello&#x27;s ill health, and were replaced by lookalikes Hugh O&#x27;Brian and Buddy Hackett along with Spike Jones and his City Slickers. Their last two films for Universal were &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops&quot; (1955) and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; (1955). In 1956, they appeared in their final film together, &quot;Dance With Me, Henry&quot;, an independent production released through United Artists.

==Television==
In January 1951, Abbott and Costello joined the roster of rotating hosts of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; on NBC. (Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were among the others.) Each show was a live hour of vaudeville in front of an audience, revitalizing the comedians&#x27; performances and giving their old routines a new sparkle.

From the fall of 1952 to the spring of 1954, a filmed half-hour series, &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;, appeared in syndication on over 40 local stations across the United States. Loosely based on their radio series, the show cast the duo as unemployed wastrels. One of the show&#x27;s running gags involved Abbott perpetually hounding Costello to get a job, while Abbott was happily unemployed. The show featured Sidney Fields as their landlord and Hillary Brooke as a neighbor and sometime love interest for Costello. Other regulars were future Stooge Joe Besser as Stinky, a whiny child in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit; Gordon Jones as Mike the cop, who always lost patience with Costello; Joe Kirk, an Italian immigrant caricature whose role varied with the requirements of the script; and Bobby Barber, who played many &quot;extra&quot; parts.

The simple plot lines were often an excuse to recreate comedy routines from their films and burlesque days, including &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; Since Costello owned the series (with Abbott working on salary), this allowed them to own these versions of the classic routines as well. The 2nd season was more story-driven. There was no continuity. Although &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; originally ran for only two seasons, it found a larger viewership in reruns from the 1960s to the 1990s. The shows have also been released in three different DVD sets over the years.

==&quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;==

&quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; is Abbott and Costello&#x27;s signature routine. &quot;Time&quot; magazine (December 26, 1999) named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century. The sketch was based on other earlier burlesque wordplay routines. They began honing the routine shortly after teaming up in 1936, and performed it in vaudeville in 1937 and 1938. It was first heard by a national radio audience on March 24, 1938, when the team were regulars on the Kate Smith radio show. By then, John Grant had been writing or adapting other sketches for the team and may have helped expand &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; prior to its radio debut. He stayed on as their head writer into the 1950s.

Depending upon the version, Abbott has either organized a new baseball team and the players have nicknames, or he points out the proliferation of nicknames in baseball (citing St. Louis Cardinals sibling pitchers Dizzy and Daffy Dean) before launching into the routine. The infielders&#x27; nicknames are Who (first base), What (second base) and I Don&#x27;t Know (third base). The key to the routine is Costello&#x27;s mounting frustration set against Abbott&#x27;s unyielding formality. Audio recordings are readily available on the Internet.

A notable version is the first television performance on the 1951 &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;.
&quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; is believed to be available in as many as twenty versions, ranging from one minute to up to ten minutes. The team could time the routine at will, adding or deleting portions as needed for films, radio or television. The longest version is seen in &quot;The Actors&#x27; Home&quot; episode of their filmed TV series, running approximately eight minutes. A live performance commemorating the opening day of the Lou Costello Jr Youth Foundation in 1947 was recorded, and has been included in numerous comedy albums. The team&#x27;s final performance of &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; on TV was on Steve Allen&#x27;s variety show in 1957.

==Personal lives==
Abbott and Costello both married performers they met in burlesque. Abbott wed Betty Smith, a dancer and comedienne, in 1918, and Costello married a chorus girl, Anne Battler, in 1934. The Costellos had four children; the Abbotts adopted two. Abbott and Costello faced personal demons at times. Both were inveterate gamblers and had serious health problems. Abbott suffered from epilepsy and turned to alcohol for seizure management. Costello had occasional, near-fatal bouts with rheumatic fever.

==Later years==
In the 1950s, Abbott and Costello&#x27;s popularity waned with the emergence of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Another reason for their decline was overexposure. Each year they made two new films, while Realart Pictures re-issued their older hits; their filmed television series was widely syndicated, and the same routines appeared frequently on the Colgate program. (Writer Parke Levy told Jordan R. Young, in &quot;The Laugh Crafters: Comedy Writing in Radio and TV&#x27;s Golden Age&quot;, that he was stunned to learn that the pair were afraid to perform new material.)

Universal dropped the comedy team in 1955 after they could not agree on contract terms. In the early 1950s, the Internal Revenue Service charged them for back taxes, forcing them to sell their homes and most of their assets, including the rights to most of their films.

In 1956, they made one independent film, &quot;Dance with Me, Henry&quot;, and Costello was the subject of the television program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, then formally dissolved their partnership in 1957. In his posthumously published 1959 autobiography, &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;, Errol Flynn claims that he triggered the breakup. Flynn, a chronic practical joker, invited them, along with their wives and children, to his house for dinner, and afterwards, he commenced to show a home movie that &quot;accidentally&quot; turned out to be hard-core pornography. While Flynn pretended to be baffled, Costello and Abbott each blamed the other for the film&#x27;s substitution.

In his last years, Costello made about ten solo appearances on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; doing many of the old routines without Abbott. Costello performed stand-up in Las Vegas, and appeared in episodes of &quot;GE Theater&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. On March 3, 1959, not long after completing his lone solo film, &quot;The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock&quot;, he died of a heart attack three days short of his 53rd birthday.

Abbott attempted a comeback in 1960 with Candy Candido. Although the new act received good reviews, Abbott quit, saying, &quot;No one could ever live up to Lou.&quot; Abbott made a solo, dramatic appearance on an episode of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; in 1961. In 1966, Abbott voiced his character in a series of 156 five-minute &quot;Abbott and Costello&quot; cartoons made by Hanna-Barbera. Costello&#x27;s character was voiced by Stan Irwin. Bud Abbott died of cancer on April 24, 1974.

==Spin-offs==
The 1960s cartoon series was not the first time Abbott and Costello were animated. During the height of their popularity in the 1940s, Warner Bros.&#x27;s Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies animation unit produced 3 cartoons featuring the pair as cats or mice named &quot;Babbit and Catstello&quot;. One of the cartoons, Bob Clampett&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot; (1942), introduced Tweety. The other cartoons are &quot;A Tale of Two Mice&quot; and &quot;Mouse-Merized Cat&quot;. In all three cartoons, Tedd Pierce (normally a storyman/writer for the cartoons) and Mel Blanc, respectively, provide voice impressions of the comedy duo.

The revival of their former television series in syndicated reruns in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped spark renewed interest in the duo, as did the televising of many of their old film hits. In 1994, comedian Jerry Seinfeld—who says Abbott and Costello were strong influences on his work—hosted a television special &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld&quot; (the title refers to the duo&#x27;s popular film series in which they met some of Universal&#x27;s famed horror picture characters), on NBC; the special was said to have been seen in 20 million homes.

==In popular culture==

Abbott and Costello were frequently referred to in 1940s Looney Tunes cartoons, such as &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot; (1942), &quot;A Tale of Two Mice&quot; (1945), &quot;Hollywood Canine Canteen&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Daffy&quot; and &quot;The Mouse-Merized Cat&quot; (all three from 1946). A catchphrase from Abbott and Costello&#x27;s radios show, &quot;I&#x27;m only three and a half years old&quot; was often quoted in these cartoons too. Even Bugs Bunny&#x27;s famous catchphrase, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a stinker?&quot; was borrowed from Lou Costello.

Although they are not inductees of the Hall itself, Abbott and Costello are among the few non-baseball personnel to be memorialized in the Baseball Hall of Fame. A plaque and a gold record of the &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; sketch have been on permanent display there since 1956, and the routine runs on an endless video loop in the exhibit area.

Their &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; routine has been referred to numerous times. In the 1988 movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s autistic character Raymond Babbitt recites an affectless &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; as a defence mechanism. In 1982, &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson performed a topical sketch as then-President Ronald Reagan in which &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot;-style confusion arose from the names of Interior Secretary James Watt, Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and Chinese leader Hu Yaobang.

The comedy group &quot;The Credibility Gap&quot; performed a rock and roll update of &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; using the names of rock groups The Who, The Guess Who, and Yes, recorded and released on their first album, &quot;The Bronze Age of Radio&quot;. On the January 13, 2001, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; host Charlie Sheen and &quot;SNL&quot; cast-member Rachel Dratch performed a modified version of &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; in a sketch. NBC&#x27;s &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; (2006), a drama about life backstage at a television comedy series, used &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; as a plot device.

A TV movie called &quot;Bud and Lou&quot;, based on a book by Hollywood correspondent Bob Thomas, was broadcast in 1978. Starring Harvey Korman as Bud Abbott and Buddy Hackett as Lou Costello, the film told the duo&#x27;s life story, focusing on Costello and portraying him as volatile and petty.

Jerry Seinfeld is an avid Abbott and Costello fan and their influence on him was celebrated in a 1994 NBC special, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld&quot;. Seinfeld&#x27;s TV series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza&#x27;s middle name is &quot;Louis&quot;, after Costello. &quot;The Old Man&quot; (Season 4, Episode 18, aired February 18, 1993) featured a cantankerous old man named &quot;Sid Fields&quot; (played by veteran actor Bill Erwin) as a tribute to the landlord on the Abbott and Costello TV show. A friend of Kramer&#x27;s is named Mickey Abbott. A copywriter for the J. Peterman catalog is named Eddie Sherman, after the team&#x27;s longtime agent. In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, &quot;His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder.&quot;

In 1991, the US Postal Service featured Abbott and Costello on a first-class stamp, part of a &quot;Comedian Commemorative Issue&quot;, illustrated by Al Hirschfeld.

In 2003, Montclair State University dedicated a student residential complex named The Abbott and Costello Center on Clove Road in the Little Falls portion of the university&#x27;s campus.

In &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, a 1993 spoof comedy directed by Mel Brooks, Dick Van Patten played the part of the Abbot. At one point, a man who looked and sounded like Lou Costello (played by Chuck McCann) yelled &quot;Hey, Abbott!&quot;, in exactly the same way Lou did in the Abbott and Costello movies, repeating a joke from Brooks&#x27; Robin Hood sitcom &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot; in which Van Patten shouted the line. Van Patten responds, &quot;I hate that guy!&quot;

Abbott and Costello were inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009.

In 2015, a non-profit fan film was produced titled &quot;Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Superman.&quot; The film was screened at the Superman Celebration Film Festival in Metropolis Illinois and is currently streaming on YouTube. Abbott and Costello are played by two actors from New York, Aaron M. Lambert and Jake Navatka.

In the 2016 sci-fi movie &quot;Arrival&quot;, the two Heptapods (alien beings) are named Abbott and Costello by the scientists, because the one named Abbott is taller and quieter while the one named Costello is shorter and chattier. The names also have extra-diegetic significance as two of the main themes in the movie are linguistics and (mis)communication, which mirrors themes of the &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; routine.

<text>In cryptography, an initialization vector (IV) or starting variable is an input to a cryptographic primitive being used to provide the initial state. The IV is typically required to be random or pseudorandom, but sometimes an IV only needs to be unpredictable or unique. Randomization is crucial for some encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme under the same key does not allow an attacker to infer relationships between (potentially similar) segments of the encrypted message. For block ciphers, the use of an IV is described by the modes of operation.

Some cryptographic primitives require the IV only to be non-repeating, and the required randomness is derived internally. In this case, the IV is commonly called a nonce (a number used only once), and the primitives (e.g. CBC) are considered &quot;stateful&quot; rather than &quot;randomized&quot;. This is because an IV need not be explicitly forwarded to a recipient but may be derived from a common state updated at both sender and receiver side. (In practice, a short nonce is still transmitted along with the message to consider message loss.) An example of stateful encryption schemes is the counter mode of operation, which has a sequence number for a nonce.

The IV size depends on the cryptographic primitive used; for block ciphers it is generally the cipher&#x27;s block-size. In encryption schemes, the unpredictable part of the IV has at best the same size as the key to compensate for time/memory/data tradeoff attacks. When the IV is chosen at random, the probability of collisions due to the birthday problem must be taken into account. Traditional stream ciphers such as RC4 do not support an explicit IV as input, and a custom solution for incorporating an IV into the cipher&#x27;s key or internal state is needed. Some designs realized in practice are known to be insecure; the WEP protocol is a notable example, and is prone to related-IV attacks.

==Motivation==
A block cipher is one of the most basic primitives in cryptography, and frequently used for data encryption. However, by itself, it can only be used to encode a data block of a predefined size, called the block size. For example, a single invocation of the AES algorithm transforms a 128-bit plaintext block into a ciphertext block of 128 bits in size. The key, which is given as one input to the cipher, defines the mapping between plaintext and ciphertext. If data of arbitrary length is to be encrypted, a simple strategy is to split the data into blocks each matching the cipher&#x27;s block size, and encrypt each block separately using the same key. This method is not secure as equal plaintext blocks get transformed into equal ciphertexts, and a third party observing the encrypted data may easily determine its content even when not knowing the encryption key.

To hide patterns in encrypted data while avoiding the re-issuing of a new key after each block cipher invocation, a method is needed to randomize the input data. In 1980, the NIST published a national standard document designated Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 81, which specified four so-called block cipher modes of operation, each describing a different solution for encrypting a set of input blocks. The first mode implements the simple strategy described above, and was specified as the electronic codebook (ECB) mode. In contrast, each of the other modes describe a process where ciphertext from one block encryption step gets intermixed with the data from the next encryption step. To initiate this process, an additional input value is required to be mixed with the first block, and which is referred to as an &quot;initialization vector&quot;. For example, the cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode requires an unpredictable value, of size equal to the cipher&#x27;s block size, as additional input. This unpredictable value is added to the first plaintext block before subsequent encryption. In turn, the ciphertext produced in the first encryption step is added to the second plaintext block, and so on. The ultimate goal for encryption schemes is to provide semantic security: by this property, it is practically impossible for an attacker to draw any knowledge from observed ciphertext. It can be shown that each of the three additional modes specified by the NIST are semantically secure under so-called chosen-plaintext attacks.

==Properties==
Properties of an IV depend on the cryptographic scheme used. A basic requirement is &quot;uniqueness&quot;, which means that no IV may be reused under the same key. For block ciphers, repeated IV values devolve the encryption scheme into electronic codebook mode: equal IV and equal plaintext result in equal ciphertext. In stream cipher encryption uniqueness is crucially important as plaintext may be trivially recovered otherwise.

:Example: Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext &quot;P&quot; to ciphertext &quot;C&quot; by deriving a key stream &quot;K&quot; from a given key and IV and computing &quot;C&quot; as &quot;C&quot; = &quot;P&quot; xor &quot;K&quot;. Assume that an attacker has observed two messages &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;2 both encrypted with the same key and IV. Then knowledge of either &quot;P&quot;1 or &quot;P&quot;2 reveals the other plaintext since
::&quot;C&quot;1 xor &quot;C&quot;2 = (&quot;P&quot;1 xor K) xor (&quot;P&quot;2 xor K) = &quot;P&quot;1 xor &quot;P&quot;2.

Many schemes require the IV to be &quot;unpredictable&quot; by an adversary. This is effected by selecting the IV at random or pseudo-randomly. In such schemes, the chance of a duplicate IV is negligible, but the effect of the birthday problem must be considered. As for the uniqueness requirement, a predictable IV may allow recovery of (partial) plaintext.

:Example: Consider a scenario where a legitimate party called Alice encrypts messages using the cipher-block chaining mode. Consider further that there is an adversary called Eve that can observe these encryptions and is able to forward plaintext messages to Alice for encryption (in other words, Eve is capable of a chosen-plaintext attack). Now assume that Alice has sent a message consisting of an initialization vector &quot;IV&quot;1 and starting with a ciphertext block &quot;CAlice&quot;. Let further &quot;PAlice&quot; denote the first plaintext block of Alice&#x27;s message, let &quot;E&quot; denote encryption, and let &quot;PEve&quot; be Eve&#x27;s guess for the first plaintext block. Now, if Eve can determine the initialization vector &quot;IV&quot;2 of the next message she will be able to test her guess by forwarding a plaintext message to Alice starting with (&quot;IV&quot;2 xor &quot;IV&quot;1 xor &quot;PEve&quot;); if her guess was correct this plaintext block will get encrypted to &quot;CAlice&quot; by Alice. This is because of the following simple observation:
::&quot;CAlice&quot; = &quot;E&quot;(&quot;IV&quot;1 xor &quot;PAlice&quot;) = &quot;E&quot;(&quot;IV&quot;2 xor (&quot;IV&quot;2 xor &quot;IV&quot;1 xor &quot;PAlice&quot;)).

Depending on whether the IV for a cryptographic scheme must be random or only unique the scheme is either called &quot;randomized&quot; or &quot;stateful&quot;. While randomized schemes always require the IV chosen by a sender to be forwarded to receivers, stateful schemes allow sender and receiver to share a common IV state, which is updated in a predefined way at both sides.

==Block ciphers==
Block cipher processing of data is usually described as a mode of operation. Modes are primarily defined for encryption as well as authentication, though newer designs exist that combine both security solutions in so-called authenticated encryption modes. While encryption and authenticated encryption modes usually take an IV matching the cipher&#x27;s block size, authentication modes are commonly realized as deterministic algorithms, and the IV is set to zero or some other fixed value.

==Stream ciphers==
In stream ciphers, IVs are loaded into the keyed internal secret state of the cipher, after which a number of cipher rounds are executed prior to releasing the first bit of output. For performance reasons, designers of stream ciphers try to keep that number of rounds as small as possible, but because determining the minimal secure number of rounds for stream ciphers is not a trivial task, and considering other issues such as entropy loss, unique to each cipher construction, related-IVs and other IV-related attacks are a known security issue for stream ciphers, which makes IV loading in stream ciphers a serious concern and a subject of ongoing research.

== WEP IV ==
The 802.11 encryption algorithm called WEP (short for Wired Equivalent Privacy) used a short, 24-bit IV, leading to reused IVs with the same key, which led to it being easily cracked. Packet injection allowed for WEP to be cracked in times as short as several seconds. This ultimately led to the deprecation of WEP.

== SSL 2.0 IV ==

In cipher-block chaining mode (CBC mode), the IV need not be secret, but must be unpredictable (In particular, for any given plaintext, it must not be possible to predict the IV that will be associated to the plaintext in advance of the generation of the IV.) at encryption time. Additionally for the output feedback mode (OFB mode), the IV must be unique. In particular, the (previously) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext block of a message as the IV for the next message is insecure (for example, this method was used by SSL 2.0). If an attacker knows the IV (or the previous block of ciphertext) before he specifies the next plaintext, he can check his guess about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key before. This is known as the TLS CBC IV attack, also called the BEAST attack.

<text>Death Becomes Her is a 1992 American satirical surrealistic black comedy fantasy film directed and produced by Robert Zemeckis and written by David Koepp and Martin Donovan. The film stars Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini. Its plot follows two women who drink a magic potion that promises eternal youth, with surprising consequences. Filming began in December 1991 and concluded in April 1992; it was shot entirely in Los Angeles.

&quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on July 31, 1992. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was also a pioneer in the use of computer-generated effects and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The film is regarded as a cult classic and a highly treasured film within the queer community.

==Plot==

In 1978, a narcissistic fading actress Madeline Ashton performs in a Broadway musical. She invites long-time friend and rival, the meek aspiring writer Helen Sharp, backstage along with Helen&#x27;s fiancé, famed plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Smitten with Madeline, Ernest breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry Madeline. Seven years later, a lonely, obese, depressed, and destitute Helen is committed to a psychiatric hospital where she obsesses over taking revenge against Madeline.

Another seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live an opulent but miserable life in Beverly Hills: Madeline is depressed about her age and withering beauty and Ernest, now an alcoholic, has been reduced to working as a reconstructive mortician. After receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen&#x27;s new book, Madeline rushes for beauty treatments. Desperate to look younger, Madeline is given the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, wealthy socialite who specializes in rejuvenation.

Madeline and Ernest attend Helen&#x27;s party and discover that Helen is now slim, glamorous and youthful despite being fifty years old. Jealous of Helen&#x27;s appearance, Madeline observes as Helen tells Ernest that she blames Madeline for his career decline. Madeline later visits her young lover but discovers he is with a woman of his own age. Despondent, Madeline drives to Lisle&#x27;s mansion. The youthful Lisle claims to be seventy-one years old and offers Madeline a potion that promises eternal life and youth. Madeline drinks the potion, which reverses her age, restoring her beauty, but Lisle warns her that she must disappear from the public eye after ten years, to avoid suspicion of her immortality, and treat her body well.

Meanwhile, Helen seduces Ernest and persuades him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she belittles Ernest, who snaps and pushes her down the stairs, breaking her neck. However, she inexplicably survives and Ernest takes Madeline to the hospital where the doctor&#x27;s analysis shows she is clinically dead. Ernest considers her reanimation to be a miracle and uses his skills to repair her body at home. Helen arrives and, after overhearing her and Ernest discussing their murder plot, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. The blast leaves a large hole in Helen&#x27;s torso but she remains alive, revealing that she also has taken Lisle&#x27;s potion. Helen and Madeline fight before apologizing and reconciling. Depressed at the situation, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline persuade him to repair their bodies first. Realizing they will need regular maintenance, they scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure his permanent availability.

The pair knock out Ernest and bring him to Lisle, who offers him the potion in exchange for his surgical skills. Although tempted, Ernest rejects immortality, concerned about outliving anyone he cares about—forcing him to spend eternity with Madeline and Helen—and the physical consequences Madeline and Helen have already suffered. He flees with the potion but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall but, realizing they only want him for selfish reasons, he throws the potion away. Ernest survives the fall after landing in Lisle&#x27;s pool and escapes, leaving the pair in despair at the realization that they will have to depend on each other for companionship and maintenance, forever.

Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest&#x27;s funeral, where he is eulogized as having achieved true immortality by living an adventurous and fulfilling life and having many children and grandchildren. Now grotesque parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and decrepit flesh, Helen and Madeline mock the eulogy and leave. Outside, Helen trips and falls down a flight of steps, dragging Madeline with her. Their bodies break apart, and Helen sardonically asks Madeline if she remembers where they parked their car.
==Cast==
==Production==
===Casting ===
Before Bruce Willis was cast, Kevin Kline was the first choice to play Dr. Ernest Menville; however, he fell out of the project due to a pay dispute with the studio. Jeff Bridges and Nick Nolte were both considered before Willis was eventually cast.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; began on December 9, 1991, and wrapped up on April 7, 1992. The film was shot entirely in Los Angeles and featured several locations frequently used in film and television, including the Greystone Mansion (Ernest&#x27;s funeral home) and the Ebell of Los Angeles (Helen&#x27;s book party). The exterior of Madeline and Ernest&#x27;s mansion is located at 1125 Oak Grove Avenue in San Marino, but the interior was a set built on a soundstage. The ending scene where Helen and Madeline tumble down a set of stairs outside a chapel was filmed at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University in Brentwood.

===Visual effects===
&quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was a technologically complex film to make, and represented a major advancement in the use of CGI effects, under the direction of Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It was the first film where computer-generated skin texture was used, in the shot where Madeline resets her neck after her head is smashed with a shovel by Helen. Creating the sequences where Madeline&#x27;s head is dislocated and facing the wrong way around involved a combination of chroma key, an animatronic model created by Amalgamated Dynamics, and prosthetic make-up effects on Meryl Streep to create the look of a twisted neck.

The digital advancements pioneered on &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; would be incorporated into Industrial Light and Magic&#x27;s next project, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, released by Universal only a year later. The two films also shared cinematographer Dean Cundey and production designer Rick Carter.

The production had a fair number of mishaps. In the scene where Helen and Madeline are battling with shovels, Streep accidentally cut Goldie Hawn&#x27;s face, leaving a faint scar. Streep admitted that she disliked working on a project that focused so heavily on special effects and vowed never to work on another film with heavy special effects again, saying:

===Post-production===
Multiple scenes that were filmed were omitted from the film&#x27;s final cut. Director Robert Zemeckis decided on cutting the scenes to accelerate the film&#x27;s pacing and to eliminate extraneous jokes. Most dramatically, the original ending was entirely redone after test audiences reacted unfavourably to it. That ending featured Ernest, after he has fled Lisle&#x27;s party, meeting a bartender named Toni (Tracey Ullman) who helps him fake his death to evade Madeline and Helen. The two women encounter Ernest and the bartender 27 years later, living happily as a retired couple while Madeline and Helen give no sign that they are enjoying their eternal existence. Zemeckis thought the ending was too happy and opted for the darker ending featured in the final cut. Ullman was one of five actors with speaking roles in the film to be eliminated. Other scenes that were eliminated included one in which Madeline talks to her agent (Jonathan Silverman) and one in which Ernest removes a frozen Madeline from the kitchen freezer he has stored her in. Some of the scenes can be viewed in the original theatrical trailer.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was a box office success and opened at number one at the box office with $12,110,355, the same weekend as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Bebe&#x27;s Kids&quot;. It went on to earn over $58.4 million domestically and $90.6 million internationally. In Taipei, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; set a box-office record by earning $269,310 in two days, marking it the &quot;biggest opening ever&quot; for overseas distributor United International Pictures.

===Home media===
The film&#x27;s release on DVD was called &quot;appallingly bad&quot; due to the quality of its transfer, which has been said to suffer from excessive grain, blur, and muted colors. A BBC review described it as &quot;horrible&quot; and &quot;sloppy&quot;. Many online DVD forum users speculated that the DVD transfer was taken from the Laserdisc edition of the film and called for a restorative release. &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was initially distributed in an open matte fullscreen (1.33:1) edition in the U.S. while a Widescreen version with its theatrical aspect ratio (1.85:1) was released worldwide. The latter version has also been mistakenly labelled anamorphic. It was later released in North America on Blu-ray from Shout! Factory in 2016.

==Reception==

&quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its special effects and lead performances, but found it lacking depth and substance. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 58% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Hawn and Streep are as fabulous as &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;″s innovative special effects; Zemeckis&#x27; satire, on the other hand, is as hollow as the world it mocks.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Dave Kehr wrote, &quot;Instantly grotesque, relentless misanthropic and spectacularly tasteless, &#x27;Death Becomes Her&#x27; isn&#x27;t a film designed to win the hearts of the mass moviegoing public. But it is diabolically inventive and very, very funny.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;While the fountain of youth theme has often come up in films, it has never been given anything like this treatment before.&quot; &quot;People&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;flashes of originality, brilliant special effects and terrific performances—Willis as a curdled Milquetoast and Hawn as a woman who is finally feeling her own power. Streep makes a fine untamed shrew, by turns shrill, whiny and cooing&quot;. Willis was also singled out for his against type comedic performance.

Negative reviews criticized the script and pacing, noting that its satire feels scattershot and that the plot is pushed aside for the special effects. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; a &#x27;thumbs down&#x27;, commenting that while the film has great special effects, it lacks any real substance or character depth. &quot;People&quot; said &quot;screenwriters David Koepp and Martin Donovan would have done well to keep their skewed, scabrous vision in sharper focus and to display satire that rises to the level of a scene in which Rossellini is throwing a party for her myriad clients&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;The trouble with &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; isn&#x27;t that its comic vision is too dark but that it has no shadings, no acerbic glee. Zemeckis gives nastiness such a hard sell he forgets to take any delight in it.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave an overall positive review in which she praised the script&#x27;s &quot;offbeat lines and unexpected laughs&quot;, but noted there is still an &quot;underlying high-and-mighty moral tone, which might have come straight from the pen of Hawthorne -- a puritannical posture wholly deserving of Madeline&#x27;s retort: &#x27;Blah, blah, blah, blah.&#x27; Really, fellas, what&#x27;s a little cucumber mask going to hurt?&quot;

In &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;Oddly, the more fantastical and grotesque this comedy becomes, the more conventional it seems-and the less it has to say. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, the characters take a back seat to the pyrotechnics, reality is replaced by cliffhangers and Gothic claptrap, and the laughs start to dry up. Satire needs a social context, but the filmmakers have little to say about the culture that created these age-obsessed women. Still, even when &#x27;Death Becomes Her&#x27; wanders off course, it remains worth rooting for.&quot;

===Accolades===

===Legacy===
&quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; has acquired a significant cult following, especially in the LGBT community. In RogerEbert.com, Jessica Ritchey wrote, &quot;Time has been kind to &#x27;Death Becomes Her&#x27;, and the mordantly funny eye it turns to Hollywood pretense and our cultural inability to forgive women for aging. With the virtual extinction of Hollywood&#x27;s interest in women over thirty, it&#x27;s a real pleasure to see a film centered on and held down by two actresses as strong as Streep and Hawn.&quot; An article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; titled &quot;The Gloriously Queer Afterlife of &#x27;Death Becomes Her&#x27;&quot; called the film a &quot;gay cult classic&quot; and &quot;a touchstone of the queer community&quot;. The movie is screened in bars during Pride Month, while the characters of Madeline and Helen are favorites of drag performers. In this vein, the movie inspired a &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;-themed runway show on season 7 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. The winner of season 5, Jinkx Monsoon, has cited the movie as an inspiration to become a drag queen. Jinkx has participated in &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot;-themed photoshoots, and in 2018 they played Madeline in a drag stage show parody called &quot;Drag Becomes Her&quot; alongside season 6 contestant BenDeLaCreme. Tom Campbell, an executive producer of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, reflected on the appeal of the movie to gay audiences:In May 2024, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&#x27;s&quot; Trinity the Tuck and Jujubee released their single &quot;&#x27;Til Death Becomes Us&quot; alongside a music video, serving as an homage to the original film.

==Musical==
A musical adaptation of &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was produced by Broadway In Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre in Chicago from April 30 to June 2, 2024. It was directed and choreographed by Christopher Gattelli with a book by Marco Pennette and music and lyrics by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey. The cast featured Megan Hilty as Madeline, Jennifer Simard as Helen, Christopher Sieber as Ernest and Michelle Williams as Viola Van Horn, the character originally named Lisle von Rhuman. In May 2024, the producers announced their plans to have the musical begin performances at Broadway&#x27;s Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on October 23 of that year. Its official opening took place there on November 21.

<text>John Ericsson (born Johan Ericsson; July 31, 1803 – March 8, 1889) was a Swedish-American engineer and inventor. He was active in England and the United States.

Ericsson collaborated on the design of the railroad steam locomotive &quot;Novelty&quot;, which competed in the Rainhill Trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which were won by inventor George Stephenson&#x27;s (1781–1848), &quot;Rocket&quot;. Later in North America, he designed the United States Navy&#x27;s first screw-propelled steam-frigate , in partnership with Captain (later Commodore) Robert F. Stockton (1795–1866) of the U.S. Navy, who unjustly blamed him for the fatal accident of that new vessel. A new partnership with Cornelius H. DeLamater (1821–1889), of the DeLamater Iron Works in New York City resulted in the first armoured ironclad warship equipped with a rotating gun turret, , which dramatically saved the U.S. (Union Navy) naval blockading squadron from destruction by an ironclad Confederate States naval vessel, , at the famous Battle of Hampton Roads harbor at the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay (at the confluence of the James and Elizabeth Rivers) in March 1862, during the American Civil War (1861-1865).

==Early career==

Johan Ericsson was born at Långban in Filipstad Municipality, Värmland, in the Kingdom of Sweden in Northern Europe / Scandinavia. He was the younger brother of Nils Ericson (1802–1870), a distinguished canal and railway builder in Sweden. Their father Olaf Ericsson (1778–1818) had worked as the supervisor for a mine in Värmland. He had lost money in speculation and had to move his family to Forsvik in 1810. There he worked as a director of blastings during the excavation of the Swedish Göta Canal.

The extraordinary skills of the two Ericsson brothers were discovered by Baltzar von Platen (1766–1829), the architect of Göta Canal. They were dubbed &#x27;cadets of mechanics&#x27; of the Swedish Royal Navy, and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. At the age of fourteen, John was already working independently as a surveyor. His assistant had to carry a footstool for him to reach the instruments during surveying work.
At the age of seventeen he joined the Swedish army in Jämtland, serving in the Jämtland Ranger Regiment, as a Second Lieutenant, but was soon promoted to Lieutenant. He was sent to northern Sweden to do surveying, and in his spare time he constructed a heat engine which used the fumes from the fire instead of steam as a propellant. His skill and interest in mechanics made him resign from the army and move to England in 1826. However, his heat engine was not a success, as his prototype was designed to burn birchwood and would not work well with coal (the main fuel used in England).


Notwithstanding the disappointment, he invented several other mechanisms instead based on steam, improving the heating process by incorporating bellows to increase oxygen supply to the fire bed. In 1829 he and English engineer John Braithwaite (1797–1870) built &quot;Novelty&quot; for the Rainhill Trials arranged by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was widely praised but suffered recurring boiler problems, and the competition was won by English engineers George and Robert Stephenson with &quot;Rocket&quot;.

Two further engines were built by Braithwaite and Ericsson, named &quot;William IV&quot; and &quot;Queen Adelaide&quot; after the new king and queen. These were generally larger and more robust than &quot;Novelty&quot; and differed in several details (for example it is thought that a different design of blower was used which was an &#x27;Induced Draught&#x27; type, sucking the gases from the fire). The pair ran trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but the railway declined to purchase the new designs.

Their innovative steam fire engine proved an outstanding technical success by helping to quell the memorable Argyll Rooms fire on February 5, 1830 (where it worked for five hours when the other engines were frozen up), 
but was met with resistance from London&#x27;s established &#x27;Fire Laddies&#x27; and municipal authorities. An engine Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for Sir John Ross&#x27;s 1829 Arctic expedition failed and was dumped on the shores of Prince Regent Inlet. At this stage of Ericsson&#x27;s career the most successful and enduring of his inventions was the surface condenser, which allowed a steamer to recover fresh water for its boilers while at sea. His &#x27;deep sea lead,&#x27; a pressure-activated fathometer was another minor, but enduring success. 

The commercial failure and development costs of some of the machines devised and built by Ericsson during this period put him into debtors&#x27; prison for an interval. At this time he also married 19-year-old Amelia Byam, a disastrous match that ended in the couple&#x27;s separation until Amelia&#x27;s death.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1877.

==Education==
His only formal education was a basic officer&#x27;s education and training during his time in the Swedish Army, achieving the military rank of captain. On March 27, 1822, John passed a surveyor&#x27;s examination in the Royal capital city of Stockholm. As a child he was taught to be a miner and surveyor by his father.

==Propeller design==
He then improved ship design with two screw-propellers rotating in opposite directions (as opposed to earlier tests with this technology, which used a single screw). However, the British Admiralty of the Royal Navy disapproved of the invention in the late 1830s, which led to the fortunate contact with the prominent American naval captain (and later commodore) Robert Stockton (1795-1866), who had Ericsson design a propeller-driven steamer for him and invited him to bring his invention across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States of America, as it would supposedly be more welcomed in that more free-thinking place. As a result, Ericsson moved to New York City in 1839. Captain Stockton&#x27;s plan was for Ericsson to oversee the development of a new class of naval warship of a larger heavier frigate with Stockton using his considerable political connections to grease the funding authorizations wheels. Finally, after the death of 9th President William Henry Harrison (1773-1841, served March-April 1841), and succession to the Presidency by his former Vice President John Tyler in the spring of 1841, funds were then allocated to the Navy under the new administration for a new design. However, they only received funding enough for a 700-ton Sloop-of-war design instead of a larger frigate. The sloop eventually became the , named after Stockton&#x27;s hometown in New Jersey and the famous university located there. 

The ship took about three years to complete and was perhaps the most advanced warship of its time. In addition to steam-powered twin screw propellers, it was originally designed to mount a 12-inch muzzle-loading gun on a revolving pedestal. The gun had also been designed by Ericsson and used hoop construction to pre-tension the breech, adding to its strength and allowing safe use of a larger charge. Other innovations on the warship design included a collapsible smoke funnel and an improved recoil system for the artillery.

The relations between Ericsson and Stockton had grown tense over time and, approaching the completion of the ship, Stockton began working to force Ericsson out of the shipbuilding project. Stockton carefully avoided letting outsiders know that Ericsson was the primary inventor. Stockton attempted to claim as much credit for himself as possible, even designing a second gun to be also mounted on the &quot;Princeton&quot;. Unfortunately, because Stockton did not totally understand the design of the first gun (originally named &quot;The Orator&quot;, renamed &quot;The Oregon&quot; by Stockton), the second gun was fatally flawed.

When launched, the &quot;U.S.S. Princeton&quot; was an enormous success. On October 20, 1843, she won a speed trial against the huge passenger liner, paddle steamer , until then considered the fastest steamer afloat. Unfortunately, during a firing demonstration of Capt. Stockton&#x27;s gun, the breech ruptured and exploded, killing visiting onboard observers of U.S. Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur and the Secretary of the Navy, Thomas Walker Gilmer (of the Presidential Cabinet of 10th President John Tyler, 1790-1862, served 1841-1845), as well as six others accompanying them. Stockton attempted to deflect the blame onto Ericsson, with moderate success, despite the fact Ericsson&#x27;s gun was sound and it was instead Stockton&#x27;s second gun that had failed. Stockton also refused to pay Ericsson, and by using his political connections, Stockton blocked the U.S. Navy bureaucracy from paying him.

==Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater==
When Ericsson arrived from England and settled in New York City, he was persuaded by Samuel Risley of Greenwich Village to give his work to the Phoenix Foundry. There he met industrialist and iron / steel foundry owner Cornelius H. DeLamater (1821–1889), and soon a mutual attachment developed between the two. Rarely thereafter did Ericsson or DeLamater enter upon a business venture without first consulting the other.&quot; Personally, their friendship never faltered, though strained by the pressures of business and Ericsson&#x27;s quick temper, DeLamater called Ericsson &quot;John&quot; and Ericsson called DeLamater by his middle nickname &quot;Harry&quot;, intimacies almost unknown in Ericsson&#x27;s other relationships. In time, the DeLamater Iron Works, situated facing the Hudson River on the waterfront / west end of West 13th Street in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s westside, became known as the Asylum where Capt Ericsson had free rein to experiment and attempt new feats. 

The &quot;Iron Witch&quot; was next constructed, the first iron steamboat. The first hot-air invention of Capt Ericsson was first introduced in the ship &quot;Ericsson&quot;, built entirely by DeLamater. The DeLamater Iron Works also launched the first submarine boat, first self-propelled torpedo, and first torpedo boat. When DeLamater died on February 2, 1889, Ericsson could not be consoled. Ericsson&#x27;s own death only one month later in March 1889, was not surprising to his close friends and acquaintances.&quot;

==Hot air engine==
Ericsson then proceeded to invent independently the caloric, or hot air, engine in the 1820s which used hot air, caloric in the scientific parlance of the day, instead of steam as a working fluid. A similar device had been patented earlier in 1816 by the Reverend Robert Stirling (1790-1878), whose technical priority of invention provides the usual term &#x27;Stirling Engine&#x27; for the device. Ericsson&#x27;s engine was not initially successful due to the differences in combustion temperatures between burning Swedish wood and firing of British coal. In spite of his setbacks, Ericsson was later awarded the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1862 for his invention.

In 1830, Ericsson patented his second engine, that can work either with steam, air or water. This rotative engine objective is to reduce the engine within more convenient limits without any corresponding loss of power.

By 1833, Capt. Ericsson built his third engine, a hot air engine (or caloric engine) that is exhibited in London: &quot;the engine will prove the most important mechanical invention ever conceived by the human mind, and one that will confer greater benefits on civilized life than any that has ever preceded it&quot; (John O. Sargent). This engine included a regenerator that would inspire many other hot air engine inventors.
The caloric ship, powered by the fourth Ericsson engine was built in 1852.

A group of New York merchants and financiers headed by John B Kitching, Edward Dunham, President of the Corn Exchange Bank, and G.B. Lamar, president of the Bank of the Republic, backed the project and in April, 1852, the keel of the ship was laid at the yard of Perine, Patterson, and Stack in Williamsburgh. At about the same time the construction of the engine was commenced by Messrs Hogg and Delamater.
Hull and machinery were built in the greatest possible secrecy, both Ericsson and his financial backers being convinced that their ship would revolutionize ocean transport by its economy and safety, and that competitors would if possible copy the design of at least the engine.
On September 15, 1852, the ship was launched and in November the engine was turned over at the dock under its own power. It will be a failure.
Smaller experimental engines based on the same patent design and built before the caloric ship will prove to be working efficiently.

In his later years, the caloric engine would render Ericsson comfortably wealthy, as its boilerless design made it a much safer and more practical means of power for small industry than steam engines. Ericsson&#x27;s incorporation of a &#x27;regenerator&#x27; heat sink for his engine made it tremendously fuel-efficient. Apparently in the post Civil War era some time before or around 1882, from the publishing date, a ship was purchased by a Captain Charles L. Dingley called the &quot;Ericsson&quot; with a weight of 1,645 tons that was built by John Ericsson (Although the above section on John Ericsson&#x27;s Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater says that the ship known as the &quot;Ericsson&quot; was built by the DeLamater Iron Works) to try out the hot air engine as a motive power in open ocean navigation.

Decades later, in 1883 John Ericsson built a solar air engine of 1 HP. The leading feature of the sun motor is that of concentrating the radiant heat by means of a rectangular trough having a curved bottom lined on the inside with polished plates, so arranged that they reflect the sun&#x27;s rays toward a cylindrical heater placed longitudinally above the trough.
This heater, it is scarcely necessary to state, contains the acting medium, steam or air, employed to transfer the solar energy to the motor; the transfer being effected by means of cylinders provided&#x27; with pistons and valves resembling those of motive engines of the ordinary type. Practical engineers, as well as scientists, have demonstrated that solar energy cannot be rendered available for producing motive power, in consequence of the feebleness of solar radiation.

==Ship design==
On September 26, 1854, Ericsson presented Emperor Napoleon III of France with drawings of iron-clad armored battleships with a dome-shaped gun tower, and even though the French emperor praised this particular plan of an invention, he did nothing to bring it to practical application or to obtain and build such a revolutionary vessel for the French Navy. In 1851 he designed the Caloric ship Ericsson.

==USS &quot;Monitor&quot;==
Shortly after the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the Confederacy began constructing an ironclad ram upon the burnt hull hulk of the which had been partially burned and then scuttled / sunk by evacuating Federal troops before it was captured by militia forces loyal to the local Commonwealth of Virginia. Nearly concurrently, the United States Congress had recommended to the U.S. Navy Department in August 1861 that armored ships be built for the American Navy. Ericsson still had a dislike for the U.S. Navy because of his personal experience with now Commodore Stockton, but he was nevertheless convinced by 16th President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s hard-working new Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles (1802-1878, served 1861-1869), and railroad executive / shipbuilder Cornelius Scranton Bushnell (1829-1896), to submit an ironclad ship design to them. Ericsson later presented drawings of , a novel design of armored ship which included a rotating turret housing a pair of large cannons. Despite controversy over the unique design, based on Swedish lumber rafts, the keel was eventually laid down in a New York shipyard and the experimental ironclad was launched on March 6, 1862. The ship went from plans to launch in approximately 100 days, an amazing achievement.

On March 8, the former heavy steam frigate USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;, rechristened as the , for the new Confederate States Navy, was wreaking havoc on the wooden Union Navy Blockading Squadron in the lower / southern Chesapeake Bay of Virginia, sinking and and damaging / running aground the USS Minnesota off-shore of the northside peninsula from Newport News. The new &quot;Monitor&quot; appeared the next day, initiating the first battle between ironclad warships on March 9, 1862, at the Hampton Roads harbor of southeastern Virginia. The battle ended in a tactical stalemate between the two ironclad warships, neither of which appeared capable of sinking the other, only causing minor damage on its opponent, but strategically saved the remaining Federal fleet from losing any more now obsolete wooden warships and defeat. After this, numerous monitors were built for the Union&#x27;s United States Navy, including additional twin turret versions, and contributed greatly to the further continued success of the blockade of Southern coasts and port cities with naval victory of the Union over the rebellious states. Despite their low draft and subsequent problems in navigating in high seas, plus frequent engine break-downs, many basic design elements of the &quot;Monitor&quot; class were copied in future warships by other designers and navies around the world. The rotating gun turret in particular is considered one of the greatest technological advances in naval history, still found on modern warships today.

==Later designs==
Later Ericsson designed other naval vessels and weapons, including a type of torpedo and a destroyer, a torpedo boat that could fire a cannon from an underwater port. He also provided some technical support for John Philip Holland in his early submarine experiments. In the book &quot;Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition&quot; (1877, reprinted 1976) he presented his &quot;sun engines&quot;, which collected solar heat for a hot air engine. One of these designs earned Ericsson additional income after being converted to work as a methane gas engine.

==Death and ensuing controversy==
Ericsson died on March 8, 1889, the anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, in which his &quot;Monitor&quot; famously played a central role. His wish to be buried in his native land sparked a series of articles in the &quot;New York Times&quot; alleging that, by selecting the third-rate to transport his remains, the US Navy was not paying proper respect to Ericsson. The Navy responded and sent the remains on the , escorted by other ships such as . On August 23, 1890, the fleet departed with a twenty-one gun salute and the Swedish flag hoisted on every ship of the squadron. Around 100,000 people turned out for the funeral procession and departure ceremonies, including several veterans of the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;.

His final resting place is at Filipstad in Värmland, Sweden.

<text>Exclusive or, exclusive disjunction, exclusive alternation, logical non-equivalence, or logical inequality is a logical operator whose negation is the logical biconditional. With two inputs, XOR is true if and only if the inputs differ (one is true, one is false). With multiple inputs, XOR is true if and only if the number of true inputs is odd.

It gains the name &quot;exclusive or&quot; because the meaning of &quot;or&quot; is ambiguous when both operands are true. XOR &quot;excludes&quot; that case. Some informal ways of describing XOR are &quot;one or the other but not both&quot;, &quot;either one or the other&quot;, and &quot;A or B, but not A and B&quot;.

It is symbolized by the prefix operator formula_1 and by the infix operators XOR (, , or ), EOR, EXOR, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, ⩛, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7.

==Definition==

The truth table of formula_8 shows that it outputs true whenever the inputs differ:

==Equivalences, elimination, and introduction==
Exclusive disjunction essentially means &#x27;either one, but not both nor none&#x27;. In other words, the statement is true if and only if one is true and the other is false. For example, if two horses are racing, then one of the two will win the race, but not both of them. The exclusive disjunction formula_9, also denoted by formula_10 or formula_11, can be expressed in terms of the logical conjunction (&quot;logical and&quot;, formula_12), the disjunction (&quot;logical or&quot;, formula_13), and the negation (formula_14) as follows:
: formula_15

The exclusive disjunction formula_9 can also be expressed in the following way:
: formula_17

This representation of XOR may be found useful when constructing a circuit or network, because it has only one formula_14 operation and small number of formula_19 and formula_13 operations. A proof of this identity is given below:
: formula_21

It is sometimes useful to write formula_9 in the following way:
: formula_23
or:
: formula_24

This equivalence can be established by applying De Morgan&#x27;s laws twice to the fourth line of the above proof.

The exclusive or is also equivalent to the negation of a logical biconditional, by the rules of material implication (a material conditional is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of its antecedent and its consequence) and material equivalence.

In summary, we have, in mathematical and in engineering notation:
: formula_25

==Negation of the operator==
By applying the spirit of De Morgan&#x27;s laws, we get:
formula_26

==Relation to modern algebra==

Although the operators formula_12 (conjunction) and formula_13 (disjunction) are very useful in logic systems, they fail a more generalizable structure in the following way:

The systems formula_29 and formula_30 are monoids, but neither is a group. This unfortunately prevents the combination of these two systems into larger structures, such as a mathematical ring.

However, the system using exclusive or formula_31 &quot;is&quot; an abelian group. The combination of operators formula_12 and formula_5 over elements formula_34 produce the well-known two-element field formula_35. This field can represent any logic obtainable with the system formula_36 and has the added benefit of the arsenal of algebraic analysis tools for fields.

More specifically, if one associates formula_37 with 0 and formula_38 with 1, one can interpret the logical &quot;AND&quot; operation as multiplication on formula_35 and the &quot;XOR&quot; operation as addition on formula_35:
: formula_41

The description of a Boolean function as a polynomial in formula_35, using this basis, is called the function&#x27;s algebraic normal form.

==Exclusive or in natural language==

Disjunction is often understood exclusively in natural languages. In English, the disjunctive word &quot;or&quot; is often understood exclusively, particularly when used with the particle &quot;either&quot;. The English example below would normally be understood in conversation as implying that Mary is not both a singer and a poet.

:1. Mary is a singer or a poet.

However, disjunction can also be understood inclusively, even in combination with &quot;either&quot;. For instance, the first example below shows that &quot;either&quot; can be felicitously used in combination with an outright statement that both disjuncts are true. The second example shows that the exclusive inference vanishes away under downward entailing contexts. If disjunction were understood as exclusive in this example, it would leave open the possibility that some people ate both rice and beans.

:2. Mary is either a singer or a poet or both.
:3. Nobody ate either rice or beans.

Examples such as the above have motivated analyses of the exclusivity inference as pragmatic conversational implicatures calculated on the basis of an inclusive semantics. Implicatures are typically cancellable and do not arise in downward entailing contexts if their calculation depends on the Maxim of Quantity. However, some researchers have treated exclusivity as a bona fide semantic entailment and proposed nonclassical logics which would validate it.

This behavior of English &quot;or&quot; is also found in other languages. However, many languages have disjunctive constructions which are robustly exclusive such as French &quot;soit... soit&quot;.

==Alternative symbols==
The symbol used for exclusive disjunction varies from one field of application to the next, and even depends on the properties being emphasized in a given context of discussion. In addition to the abbreviation &quot;XOR&quot;, any of the following symbols may also be seen:
* formula_43 was used by George Boole in 1847. Although Boole used formula_43 mainly on classes, he also considered the case that formula_45 are propositions in formula_46, and at the time formula_43 is a connective. Furthermore, Boole used it exclusively. Although such use does not show the relationship between inclusive disjunction (for which formula_48 is almost fixedly used nowadays) and exclusive disjunction, and may also bring about confusions with its other uses, some classical and modern textbooks still keep such use.
* formula_3 was used by Christine Ladd-Franklin in 1883. Strictly speaking, Ladd used formula_50 to express &quot;formula_51 is-not formula_52&quot; or &quot;No formula_51 is formula_52&quot;, i.e., used formula_3 as exclusions, while implicitly formula_3 has the meaning of exclusive disjunction since the article is titled as &quot;On the Algebra of Logic&quot;.
* formula_57, denoting the negation of equivalence, was used by Ernst Schröder in 1890, Although the usage of formula_58 as equivalence could be dated back to George Boole in 1847, during the 40 years after Boole, his followers, such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Hugh MacColl, Giuseppe Peano and so on, did not use formula_57 as non-equivalence literally which is possibly because it could be defined from negation and equivalence easily.
* formula_60 was used by Giuseppe Peano in 1894: &quot;formula_61. The sign formula_60 corresponds to Latin &quot;aut&quot;; the sign formula_63 to &quot;vel&quot;.&quot; Note that the Latin word &quot;aut&quot; means &quot;exclusive or&quot; and &quot;vel&quot; means &quot;inclusive or&quot;, and that Peano use formula_63 as inclusive disjunction.
* formula_65 was used by Izrail Solomonovich Gradshtein (Израиль Соломонович Градштейн) in 1936.
* formula_5 was used by Claude Shannon in 1938. Shannon borrowed the symbol as exclusive disjunction from Edward Vermilye Huntington in 1904. Huntington borrowed the symbol from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1890 (the original date is not definitely known, but almost certainly it is written after 1685; and 1890 is the publishing time). While both Huntington in 1904 and Leibniz in 1890 used the symbol as an algebraic operation. Furthermore, Huntington in 1904 used the symbol as inclusive disjunction (logical sum) too, and in 1933 used formula_43 as inclusive disjunction.
* formula_7, also denoting the negation of equivalence, was used by Alonzo Church in 1944.
* formula_1 (as a prefix operator, formula_70) was used by Józef Maria Bocheński in 1949. Somebody may mistake that it is Jan Łukasiewicz who is the first to use formula_1 for exclusive disjunction (it seems that the mistake spreads widely), while neither in 1929 nor in other works did Łukasiewicz make such use. In fact, in 1949 Bocheński introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary connectives of classical logic which is a compatible extension of the notation of Łukasiewicz in 1929, and in which formula_1 for exclusive disjunction appeared at the first time. Bocheński&#x27;s usage of formula_1 as exclusive disjunction has no relationship with the Polish &quot;alternatywa rozłączna&quot; of &quot;exclusive or&quot; and is an accident for which see the table on page 16 of the book in 1949.
* &lt;samp&gt;^&lt;/samp&gt;, the caret, has been used in several programming languages to denote the bitwise exclusive or operator, beginning with C and also including C++, C#, D, Java, Perl, Ruby, PHP and Python.
* The symmetric difference of two sets formula_74 and formula_38, which may be interpreted as their elementwise exclusive or, has variously been denoted as formula_76, formula_77, or formula_78.

==Properties==





If using binary values for true (1) and false (0), then &quot;exclusive or&quot; works exactly like addition modulo 2.

==Computer science==
===Bitwise operation===
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 1 XOR 1 = 0
* 1 XOR 0 = 1
* 0 XOR 1 = 1
* 0 XOR 0 = 0
* XOR = (this is equivalent to addition without carry)

As noted above, since exclusive disjunction is identical to addition modulo 2, the bitwise exclusive disjunction of two &quot;n&quot;-bit strings is identical to the standard vector of addition in the vector space formula_79.

In computer science, exclusive disjunction has several uses:
* It tells whether two bits are unequal.
* It is a controllable bit-flipper (the control input chooses whether or not to invert the data input).
* It tells whether there is an odd number of 1 bits (formula_80 is true if and only if an odd number of the variables are true), which is equal to the parity bit returned by a parity function.

In logical circuits, a simple adder can be made with an XOR gate to add the numbers, and a series of AND, OR and NOT gates to create the carry output.

On some computer architectures, it is more efficient to store a zero in a register by XOR-ing the register with itself (bits XOR-ed with themselves are always zero) than to load and store the value zero.

In cryptography, XOR is sometimes used as a simple, self-inverse mixing function, such as in one-time pad or Feistel network systems. XOR is also heavily used in block ciphers such as AES (Rijndael) or Serpent and in block cipher implementation (CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR).

In simple threshold-activated artificial neural networks, modeling the XOR function requires a second layer because XOR is not a linearly separable function.

Similarly, XOR can be used in generating entropy pools for hardware random number generators. The XOR operation preserves randomness, meaning that a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will result in a random bit. Multiple sources of potentially random data can be combined using XOR, and the unpredictability of the output is guaranteed to be at least as good as the best individual source.

XOR is used in RAID 3–6 for creating parity information. For example, RAID can &quot;back up&quot; bytes and from two (or more) hard drives by XORing the just mentioned bytes, resulting in () and writing it to another drive. Under this method, if any one of the three hard drives are lost, the lost byte can be re-created by XORing bytes from the remaining drives. For instance, if the drive containing is lost, and can be XORed to recover the lost byte.

XOR is also used to detect an overflow in the result of a signed binary arithmetic operation. If the leftmost retained bit of the result is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left, then that means overflow occurred. XORing those two bits will give a &quot;1&quot; if there is an overflow.

XOR can be used to swap two numeric variables in computers, using the XOR swap algorithm; however this is regarded as more of a curiosity and not encouraged in practice.

XOR linked lists leverage XOR properties in order to save space to represent doubly linked list data structures.

In computer graphics, XOR-based drawing methods are often used to manage such items as bounding boxes and cursors on systems without alpha channels or overlay planes.

==Encodings==
It is also called &quot;not left-right arrow&quot; (codice_1) in LaTeX-based markdown (formula_6). Apart from the ASCII codes, the operator is encoded at and , both in block mathematical operators.

<doc id="105980" wikidata="Q367447" url="?curid=105980" title="Louis Prima">
<text>Louis Leo Prima (; December 7, 1910 – August 24, 1978) was an American trumpeter, singer, entertainer, and bandleader. While rooted in New Orleans jazz, swing music, and jump blues, Prima touched on various genres throughout his career: he formed a seven-piece New Orleans–style jazz band in the late 1920s, fronted a swing combo in the 1930s and a big band group in the 1940s, helped to popularize jump blues in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s, and performed frequently as a Vegas lounge act beginning in the 1950s.

From the 1940s through the 1960s, his music further encompassed early R&amp;B and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, boogie-woogie, and Italian folk music, such as the tarantella. Prima made prominent use of Italian music and language in his songs, blending elements of his Italian and Sicilian identity with jazz and swing music. At a time when ethnic musicians were discouraged from openly stressing their ethnicity, Prima&#x27;s conspicuous embrace of his Sicilian ethnicity opened the doors for other Italian-American and ethnic American musicians to display their ethnic roots.

Prima is also known for providing the voice for the orangutan King Louie in the 1967 Disney film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

==Early life==
Louis Leo Prima was from a musical Italian American family in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father, Anthony Prima, was the son of Leonardo Di Prima, a Sicilian immigrant from Salaparuta, while his mother, Angelina Caravella, had emigrated from the island of Ustica north of Sicily as a baby. Prima was the second child of four; his older brother, Leon, was born in 1907, while his sisters Elizabeth and Marguerite were younger. Marguerite died when she was three years old. Leon, Louis, and Elizabeth were all baptized at St. Ann&#x27;s Parish. They lived in a house at 1812 St. Peter Street in New Orleans.

Prima&#x27;s mother was a music lover, and she made sure that each child played an instrument. Louis was assigned the violin and started out playing at St. Ann&#x27;s Parish. He became interested in jazz when he heard black musicians, including Louis Armstrong. Italian immigrants, Italian-Americans, and African-Americans in New Orleans at the time frequently socialized together in the same clubs and bars. Local clubs tailored to the ostracized Italian community, such as Matranga&#x27;s, Joe Segrettas, Tonti&#x27;s Social Club, and Lala&#x27;s Big 25, were all Italian-American clubs owned and operated by Italians; African Americans were always welcomed in these clubs and often played music and fraternized with Italians and Italian-Americans. Prima&#x27;s interest in jazz was sparked while frequenting these clubs and observing black and Italian jazz artists playing together.

According to author Garry Boulard in his book &quot;Louis Prima&quot;, Prima paid attention to the music coming from clubs and watched his older brother Leon play the cornet. When Leon left the house to spend one summer in Texas, Prima practiced continuously on his worn-down cornet. He formed a band in 1924 with his childhood friends &quot;Candy&quot; Candido (bass), Irving Fazola (clarinet) and Johnny Viviano (drums).

Prima attended Jesuit High School but transferred to Warren Easton High, then a boys&#x27; school, in the fall of 1926. At Warren Easton, he played with the &quot;Eastonites&quot;, the school band. In 1927, he partnered with fellow musician Frank Federico and the pair played at &quot;The Whip&quot;, a run-down French Quarter nightclub. By the spring of 1928, Prima decided he would become a professional musician.

==Career==
After finishing high school in New Orleans, Prima had a few unsuccessful gigs, including when he joined the Ellis Stratako Orchestra in 1929. Prima, Federico and saxophonist Dave Winstein drove to Florida for a gig but no one showed up. They made it to a relative&#x27;s house, where they were given money for gas and a meal. Prima did not give up. He joined Joseph Cherniavsky&#x27;s Orchestra in 1929 at Jefferson Parish. He got a temporary job playing on the steamship &quot;Capital&quot; that docked on Canal Street.

Although the &quot;Capital&quot; did not provide him with a big break for his career, he did meet his first wife Louise Polizzi there. They married on June 25, 1929. From 1931 to 1932, Prima occupied his time by performing in the Avalon Club owned by his brother Leon. His first break was when Lou Forbes hired him for daily afternoon and early evening shows at The Saenger.

===New York City===
New York was an attraction for hungry musicians during the Great Depression. Guy Lombardo met Prima while he was performing at club Shim Sham during the Mardi Gras season of 1934.

===Prima and his New Orleans Gang===
In September 1934, Prima began recording for the Brunswick label. He recorded &quot;That&#x27;s Where the South Begins&quot;, &quot;Long About Midnight&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Shout&quot;, and &quot;Star Dust&quot;.

Prima and his New Orleans Gang featured Frank Pinero playing piano, Jack Ryan on bass, Garrett McAdams on guitar, and Pee Wee Russell on clarinet. The band had their first performance at a club called the Famous Door, owned and operated by Jack Colt. Prima&#x27;s recordings from 1935 were a combination of Dixieland and swing. In May 1935, Prima and Russell recorded &quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, a national jukebox hit. They also recorded &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;Chasing Shadows&quot; and &quot;Gypsy Tea Room&quot;.

Martha Raye played a role in Prima&#x27;s professional and personal life. She was a comedian with potential to become a singer. The two featured a show at the club that granted Prima his first national debut on &quot;The Fleischman Hour&quot;. In March 1936, Prima recorded &quot;Sing Sing Sing&quot;, which subsequently became a hit for Benny Goodman.

===California===
Prima moved to California to expand his music. During this time there was a movement for big bands and orchestras. Prima hired Louis Masinter on the string bass, a New Orleans native. He fired McAdams so that he could have Frank Federico, his childhood friend, play the guitar. With all of his success, his marriage back in New Orleans had already failed. He and Louise were divorced in 1936, following infidelities going back at least to the French Quarter in 1933. A few months later, he was involved in a new fling with Alma Ross, an actress.

Prima and Ross were quite serious and after only a few months together he asked her to marry him while he started his tour out in the Midwest. The couple faced problems in Wisconsin and Chicago because they did not meet the marital requirements. Guy Lombardo helped them out by arranging a place in South Bend, Indiana. They wed on July 25, 1936. The couple had a few problems; one of the worst was that Louis denied much about his past. He never confessed to Alma that he had a daughter until she found out from a tax return. Prima also pushed Ross into signing with Paramount in 1937.

He continued to travel along the East Coast with his band. Prima struggled to upgrade to big band style. It was not supported by his mentors in New York or Los Angeles. With the help of Guy Lombardo he traveled to Chicago to promote his new format at the Blackhawk in October 1936. The new format was unsuccessful.

===Reinvented in New York===
In 1937, Prima and his smaller gang (Federico, Masinter, Pinero, and Meyer Weinberg on clarinet) returned to the Famous Door in New York to perform. He also appeared at Billy Rose&#x27;s Casa Mañana club in May 1938. He earned nearly a quarter million dollars throughout seven weeks at Casa Mañana.

He was booked by William Morris Agency in late 1938, which sent him to Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Miami Beach, New Orleans, and St. Louis. The band traveled by car, since it was the cheapest option.

===World War II===
In 1939, Prima was under contract to appear in Black theatres in New York, Baltimore, Boston and Washington D.C. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt attended his performance in Washington D.C., and formally invited him to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s birthday celebration. He appeared in photographs with the President, which ultimately boosted his publicity. Deemed unfit for military service in World War II because of a knee injury, Prima continued performing.

By the mid-1940s, Prima was experiencing great success. People were purchasing tickets early in the morning for shows later on that evening. Despite the anti-Italian sentiment during the war, Prima continued to record Italian songs, the most famous being &quot;Angelina&quot;, named after his mother. Others included &quot;Please No Squeeza Da Banana&quot;, &quot;Baciagaloop (Makes Love on the Stoop)&quot;, and &quot;Felicia No Capicia.&quot;

He performed the Italian songs at the Strand Theatre in New York. He brought in $440,000 in six weeks. In Detroit he could bring in about $38,000 for an afternoon performance. With all of this success, he decided to go back to Chicago to prove himself; he sold out the &quot;Panther Room&quot; in that city.

Prima had several big hits in the summer of 1945, including &quot;My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time&quot; and &quot;Bell-Bottom Trousers&quot;. As his career grew, however, his marriage with Alma simultaneously failed. They got a divorce when she discovered he had been cheating on her with another actress. Alma was supposed to receive $15,000 a year or 7.5% of his earnings. Prima ignored the payments until they piled up to about $60,000, which forced him to write a settlement check of $45,000 plus $250 per week. Later he married his secretary, Tracelene Barrett.

By the end of the war years, the popularity of big band music was diminishing, and by 1947 Prima was playing more jazzy versions of his music. Under a new contract with RCA Victor, he recorded &quot;Civilization&quot;; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Tell the Depth of the Well&quot;; &quot;Say it with a Slap&quot;; &quot;Valencia&quot;; &quot;My Flame Went Out Last Night&quot;; &quot;Thousand Islands&quot;; &quot;Mean To Me&quot;; and &quot;Tutti Tutti Pizzicato&quot;.

In 1948, Prima and Barrett had a baby girl.

===Personality===
Fans knew Prima as a genial and patient celebrity: he always signed autographs or posed for pictures with a smile. To the record companies and big corporations, however, Prima showed little deference, and he was uncompromising in seeking maximum compensation for his work.

Warner Brothers offered him $60,000 to be in a movie based on the life of Helen Morgan, but he rejected it; when the studio increased the offer to $75,000, it was still not enough. Prima wanted $100,000 and creative control of his role, which was rejected by Warner Brothers. He had protracted disputes with the Strand Theatre in New York City and Majestic Records, and he flatly refused to allow a former songwriter to advertise herself as &quot;formerly featured with Louis Prima&#x27;s orchestra&quot;.

Prima had expensive tastes: he shopped at luxury clothing stores and always wore top-brand suits. He spent great sums on horse racing and his own private stable of horses. He said he enjoyed gambling because it relaxed him; riding was another one of the things that relaxed him the most outside of his busy performing life. He knew each of his horses well and read about training. Another hobby was boating. He purchased a boat for his third wife Tracelene Barrett for their honeymoon on the Hudson River.

===Keely Smith===
Keely Smith was twenty when she met Prima in August 1948. Born in Norfolk, Virginia, she made a point to stop by the Surf Club in Virginia Beach to visit him. To her surprise, Prima was looking for a new female vocalist to replace Lily Ann Carol. Smith was wearing a bathing suit and was not allowed into the club until she put on proper attire. Luckily, someone was able to lend her some acceptable clothing and she auditioned. She landed the part and was soon traveling with his band.

Prima signed with Columbia Records in the fall of 1951 to keep up with the rapid changes in the marketing industry. Throughout his sixteen-month contract, his top hits consisted of &quot;Chop Suey, Chow Mein&quot;, &quot;Ooh-Dahdily-Dah&quot;, and &quot;Chili Sauce&quot;. To support his horses and manage his expenses, he chose to drop his big band and play in lesser clubs. On top of it all, he divorced his third wife Tracelene on June 18, 1953. Less than a month later he married Keely. She was open to criticism, and he wanted to make her a star. He tried to find the style that fit her correctly, especially since rock and roll was emerging. Prima was not against rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll like some other artists, such as Frank Sinatra and Jackie Gleason. He accepted that &quot;the kids had an instinct for the kind of music that&#x27;s fun to listen to and dance to.&quot;

===A new act===
In 1954, Prima was offered a stay at The Sahara in Las Vegas to open his new act with Keely Smith. He enlisted New Orleans saxophonist Sam Butera and his backing musicians, The Witnesses. The act was a hit, and ultimately led Prima to sign with Capitol Records in 1955. The act performed regularly in Las Vegas for the rest of the decade.

He released his first album with Capitol Records, &quot;The Wildest!&quot;, in September 1956. Some of the popular songs include his medley of &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;. In 1957, the couple released &quot;The Call of the Wildest&quot;. Keely worked with other artists to release the album &quot;I Wish You Love&quot;, and received a Grammy for it in 1958.

She earned &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Variety&#x27;s&quot; number one female vocalist award in 1958–59, and the Playboy Jazz Award in 1959. The duo also redid &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, which was a Top 40 hit for two months. It earned the duo a Grammy. The couple also had two daughters together, one of whom, Toni, became an actress and singer in her own right. Prima decided to relocate his acts to the Desert Inn because he would take in $3 million for producing twelve weeks&#x27; worth of acts a year for five years.

Prima signed with Dot Records in 1959 and produced eight albums, headlined by &quot;Wonderland By Night&quot; and &quot;On Stage&quot; in 1961. The couple was constantly performing and it affected their marriage. An attempted vacation boating down the Atlantic coast ended up grounded in the Intracoastal Waterway until rescued by the Coast Guard.

In January 1961, Prima was invited by Frank Sinatra to perform at the inaugural gala for President John F. Kennedy; the two played &quot;Old Black Magic&quot; together. The constant performances and Prima&#x27;s infidelities were too much for Smith. That noted, Smith also had an affair with Frank Sinatra, prior to her divorce from Prima in 1961. After finishing up their contract at the Desert Inn, she filed for divorce at the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court of Nevada in Las Vegas.

After Smith was out of his life and his performances, Prima tried to prove that he did not need her. In the &quot;New York Post&quot;, there was a suggestion that Smith should rejoin for an act in New York&#x27;s Basin Street East nightclub. Prima said, &quot;I have no desire whatsoever to have any dealings with Keely Smith under any conditions…There is nothing in the world or no one that could ever make me accept this woman in our act.&quot;

Prima&#x27;s father died in 1961, the same year as the divorce from Smith. His mother died in the winter of 1965.

In 1962, he tried to form his own recording company called Prima One Records. He filled Smith&#x27;s spot with Gia Maione, a waitress who was 21 years old. He did his best to make her famous by producing her first album &quot;This Is … Gia.&quot; It was funded entirely by him, and it was unsuccessful. They married and had a daughter, Lena, later a New Orleans–based singer and recording artist with Basin Street Records, and his only son, Louis Prima Jr., the last of his six children. He was also in the middle of making appearances in Las Vegas and promoting the film &quot;Twist All Night&quot;.

In 1967, Prima landed a role in Walt Disney&#x27;s animated feature &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, as the raucous orangutan King Louie. He performed the hit song &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be like You&quot; on the soundtrack, leading to the recording of two albums with Phil Harris: &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and &quot;More Jungle Book&quot;, and covering MC duties and singing the theme song &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, for the 1967 album entitled &quot;Happy Birthday Winnie the Pooh&quot;, all of these on Disneyland Records. He can be heard on the soundtrack of another cartoon feature, &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Prima was married five times and had six children. Prima was married to Louise Polizzi from 1929 to 1936; Alma Ross from 1936 to 1945; Tracelene Barrett from 1945 to 1952; Keely Smith from 1953 to 1961; and Gia Maione in 1963. All but his marriage to Maione ended in divorce.

Among his children are musical performers Lena Prima and Louis Prima Jr., both born to Maione.

In 1973, Prima suffered a heart attack. Two years later, following headaches and episodes of memory loss, he sought medical attention, and was diagnosed with a brain stem tumor. Following a surgery, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and went into a coma. He never recovered and he died in 1978, having been moved back to New Orleans. He was buried in Metairie Cemetery in a gray marble crypt topped by a figure of Gabriel, the trumpeter-angel, sculpted by Russian-born sculptor Alexei Kazantsev.

==Legacy==
At a time when ethnic musicians were discouraged from openly stressing their ethnicity, Prima&#x27;s conspicuous embrace of his Sicilian ethnicity opened the doors for other Italian-American and ethnic American musicians to display their ethnic roots.

Prima&#x27;s expected visit to a small Italian restaurant drives the plot of the critically acclaimed 1996 film &quot;Big Night.&quot;

His rendition of &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; was featured in the 2003 Christmas blockbuster &quot;Elf.&quot;

On July 25, 2010, the centenary year of his birth, Prima received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2018, Prima&#x27;s 1936 single &quot;What Will Santa Claus Say (When He Finds Everybody Swingin&#x27;)&quot; was sampled by Kids See Ghosts on the song &quot;4th Dimension&quot;, which appeared on their album &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot;.

Prima&#x27;s New Orleans–based daughter, Lena Prima, performs throughout the nation. His son, Louis Prima Jr. leads his own band.

<doc id="105984" wikidata="Q7130766" url="?curid=105984" title="Pandulf Verraccio">
<text>Pandulf Verraccio (died 16 September 1226), whose first name may also be spelled Pandolph or Pandulph (&quot;Pandolfo&quot; in Italian), was a Roman ecclesiastical politician, papal legate to England and bishop of Norwich.

== Early life ==
Pandulf was born in the Papal States, and first came to England in 1211, when he was commissioned by Pope Innocent III to negotiate with King John during the Investiture Controversy. He is often erroneously called &quot;Cardinal Pandulph&quot; or &quot;Pandulph Masca&quot; due to being confused with Cardinal Pandolfo da Lucca, who himself was confused with Cardinal Pandulf of Pisa and erroneously given the Pisan family name Masca. His authentic surname may be rendered Verraccio, Verracchio or Verracclo.

== Role in the Investiture Controversy ==

Obtaining no satisfactory concessions in John&#x27;s efforts to impose Caesaropapism upon the Catholic Church in England, Pandulf is alleged to have produced the papal sentence of excommunication in the very presence of the king. In May 1213 Pandulf again visited England to receive the king&#x27;s submission. The ceremony took place at the Templar church at Dover, and on the following day John, of his own motion, formally surrendered England to the Holy See and received it back as a papal fief.

== Loyalty to King John ==
Pandulf repaid this act of humility by using every means to avert the threatened French invasion of England. For nearly a year he was superseded by the cardinal-legate Nicholas of Tusculum; but returning in 1215 was present at the conference of Runnymede, when the Magna Carta was sealed. He rendered valuable aid to John who rewarded him with the see of Norwich, England in 1215, however he was not consecrated for a number of years. The arrival of the cardinal-legate Gualo in 1216 relegated Pandulf to a secondary position; but after Gualo&#x27;s departure in 1218 he came forward once more, after having been appointed papal legate again on 1 September 1218.

== Handling of Brigandage ==

Pandulf is known to have sent a letter to Peter des Roches (who was bishop of Winchester) between 1218 and 1221 urgently requesting action against rampant brigandage on the roads near Winchester (one of the largest cities of England at the time). He wrote:

My lord bishop, the complaints of the poor and of women ought especially to move you, that nobody can travel near Winchester without being held up, robbed, and worst of all—should there not be enough goods on them—people are being killed. Truly, because this sort of thing is a disgrace to the lord king, and to you, and it is going on to the scandal and disorder of the whole kingdom, we ask, advise and firmly instruct your wisdom, as you value the forgiveness of your sins, that you cause this business to be sorted out, so that we hear no further complaints.

== Regency Years 1219-1221 ==
During the years 1219-1221 there are at least 68 letters from or addressed to Pandulf which survive detailing his handling of diplomatic affairs, domestic affairs, national defense, the Exchequer, and his coordination with the Justiciar Hubert de Burgh, the bishop of Winchester (regency member) Peter des Roches, and the vice-chancellor Ralph Neville. In fact, the only two members of Henry III&#x27;s regency government who have more surviving letters are Ralph Neville and Hubert de Burgh. He sent and received several letters regarding diplomacy including the reception of a letter from Llywelyn the Great regarding diplomatic affairs with wales.

== Termination of Legatine and Consecration as Bishop of Norwich ==
As representing the pope Pandulf claimed a control over Hubert de Burgh and the other ministers of the young Henry III; and his correspondence shows that he interfered in every department of the administration. His arrogance was tolerated while the regency was still in need of papal assistance; but in 1221 Hubert de Burgh and the primate Stephen Langton successfully moved the pope to recall Pandulf and to send no other legate &quot;a latere&quot; (of the highest rank) in his place. His legatine commission was terminated by the summer of 1221. He was finally consecrated bishop on 29 May 1222.

Pandulf retained the see of Norwich, but from this time drops out of English politics. He died in Rome on 16 September 1226, but his body was taken to Norwich for burial.

==In popular culture==
* Pandulf Verraccio is one of the main characters in the stage play &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot; by William Shakespeare. Pandulf Verraccio&#x27;s role centers first upon the Investiture Controversy between King John and Pope Innocent III and Verraccio&#x27;s subsequent role in blocking the French invasion.

<doc id="105985" wikidata="Q306650" url="?curid=105985" title="Lex (software)">
<text>Lex is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers (&quot;scanners&quot; or &quot;lexers&quot;). It is commonly used with the yacc parser generator and is the standard lexical analyzer generator on many Unix and Unix-like systems. An equivalent tool is specified as part of the POSIX standard.

Lex reads an input stream specifying the lexical analyzer and writes source code which implements the lexical analyzer in the C programming language.

In addition to C, some old versions of Lex could generate a lexer in Ratfor.

==History==
Lex was originally written by Mike Lesk and Eric Schmidt and described in 1975.
In the following years, Lex became standard lexical analyzer generator on many Unix and Unix-like systems. In 1983, Lex was one of several UNIX tools available for Charles River Data Systems&#x27; UNOS operating system under Bell Laboratories license.
Although originally distributed as proprietary software, some versions of Lex are now open-source. Open-source versions of Lex, based on the original proprietary code, are now distributed with open-source operating systems such as OpenSolaris and Plan 9 from Bell Labs. One popular open-source version of Lex, called flex, or the &quot;fast lexical analyzer&quot;, is not derived from proprietary coding.

==Structure of a Lex file==
The structure of a Lex file is intentionally similar to that of a yacc file: files are divided into three sections, separated by lines that contain only two percent signs, as follows:
*The definitions section defines macros and imports header files written in C. It is also possible to write any C code here, which will be copied verbatim into the generated source file.
*The rules section associates regular expression patterns with C statements. When the lexer sees text in the input matching a given pattern, it will execute the associated C code.
*The C code section contains C statements and functions that are copied verbatim to the generated source file. These statements presumably contain code called by the rules in the rules section. In large programs it is more convenient to place this code in a separate file linked in at compile time.

==Example of a Lex file==
The following is an example Lex file for the flex version of Lex. It recognizes strings of numbers (positive integers) in the input, and simply prints them out.

/*** Definition section ***/
/* C code to be copied verbatim */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 /*** Rules section ***/

 /* [0-9]+ matches a string of one or more digits */
[0-9]+ {
 /* yytext is a string containing the matched text. */
 printf(&quot;Saw an integer: %s\n&quot;, yytext);

.|\n { /* Ignore all other characters. */ }
/*** C Code section ***/

int main(void)
 /* Call the lexer, then quit. */
 yylex();
 return 0;

If this input is given to codice_1, it will be converted into a C file, . This can be compiled into an executable which matches and outputs strings of integers. For example, given the input:
 abc123z.!&amp;*2gj6
the program will print:
 Saw an integer: 123
 Saw an integer: 2
 Saw an integer: 6

==Using Lex with other programming tools==

===Using Lex with parser generators===

Lex, as with other lexical analyzers, limits rules to those which can be described by regular expressions. Due to this, Lex can be implemented by a finite-state automata as shown by the Chomsky hierarchy of languages. To recognize more complex languages, Lex is often used with parser generators such as Yacc or Bison. Parser generators use a formal grammar to parse an input stream.

It is typically preferable to have a parser, one generated by Yacc for instance, accept a stream of tokens (a &quot;token-stream&quot;) as input, rather than having to process a stream of characters (a &quot;character-stream&quot;) directly. Lex is often used to produce such a token-stream.

Scannerless parsing refers to parsing the input character-stream directly, without a distinct lexer.

===Lex and make===
make is a utility that can be used to maintain programs involving Lex. Make assumes that a file that has an extension of codice_2 is a Lex source file. The make internal macro codice_3 can be used to specify Lex options to be invoked automatically by make.

<doc id="105986" wikidata="Q9324032" url="?curid=105986" title="Borough of Runnymede">
<text>The Borough of Runnymede is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. Its council is based in Addlestone and the borough also includes the towns of Chertsey and Egham. The borough is named after Runnymede, a water meadow on the banks of the River Thames near Egham, which is connected with the sealing of Magna Carta by King John in 1215.

It is a prosperous part of the London commuter belt, having some of the most expensive housing in the United Kingdom outside central London, such as the Wentworth Estate at Virginia Water. The M25 motorway which encircles London runs through the borough, with Addlestone, Chertsey and Egham Hythe being inside the M25. At the 2021 Census, the population of the borough was 87,739. With a GDP per capita of £87,277 it is the sixth wealthiest borough in the UK, being the wealthiest outside of London. The UK Competitiveness Index ranks it as the 8th most economically competitive area in the UK, with only London boroughs ahead.

The neighbouring districts are Spelthorne, Elmbridge, Woking, Surrey Heath and Windsor and Maidenhead.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering two former districts which were both abolished at the same time:
*Chertsey Urban District (which included Addlestone)
*Egham Urban District (which included Thorpe and Virginia Water)
The new district was named after the water meadow of Runnymede on the banks of the Thames at Egham on the northern edge of the borough, which is connected with the sealing of Magna Carta by King John in 1215 and is the site of several significant monuments.

The district was awarded borough status in 1978, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Runnymede Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2023. Following the 2024 election a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and independent councillors formed to run the council.

The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Runnymede. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader or co-leaders of the council. The leaders (or co-leaders) since 1984 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council has been:
Of the independent councillors, three (all representing Ottershaw ward) form the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, which informally supported the Conservative minority administration between 2023 and 2024. Two (both representing Englefield Green East) form part of the majority administration group. The next election is due in 2026.

=== Elections ===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 41 councillors representing 14 wards with each ward electing three councillors except Englefield Green East which elects two. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council elected each time for a four-year term of office. Surrey County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at Runnymede Civic Centre on Station Road in Addlestone. The new building cost a reported £12.6m and opened in May 2008. The council&#x27;s former offices were on the adjoining site and were subsequently demolished to make way for a retail development.

==Transport==

The M25 motorway runs through Runnymede from south to north, with junctions at Chertsey and Egham, while train services in the borough are provided by South Western Railway on the Waterloo–Reading line and the Chertsey branch line.

==Twinning==
Runnymede is twinned with:
*Bergisch Gladbach, situated 10 miles east of Cologne
*Herndon, Virginia, about 20 miles west of Washington, D.C.
*Joinville-le-Pont, located to the east of Paris.
