<text>Countryside was a half-mile-wide residential area in Johnson County, Kansas, USA, which was incorporated by its residents as a city on July 2, 1951, under Kansas Law. In a special election on December 3, 2002, residents voted to consolidate with the surrounding city of Mission, Kansas, in which the houses and streets had originally been built in the unincorporated Mission Township of Johnson County beginning in 1937. Countryside, as a city governmental entity, ceased to exist on January 15, 2003, however, the originally founded Countryside Homes Association, Inc. neighborhood remains active.

As a city, Countryside consisted of 133 houses of middle to upper-class value situated with Lamar Avenue on the west, West 61st Street on the north, Nall Avenue on the east and Shawnee Mission Parkway on the south. The south side of West 62nd Terrace is a parkway strip of well-kept grass and trees opening, on its far side, onto a view of West 63rd Street, which had become a divided four-lane major artery, also running in an east–west direction, through Johnson County in 1960. In 1983, the W 63rd Street, Rock Creek Pkwy, Johnson Drive (US 56 &amp; 169) corridor was renamed Shawnee Mission Parkway to reduce confusion about the three names and multiple numbers the road carried.

Countryside was dependent on Mission, Kansas for police services, Consolidated Fire District 2 provided fire protection and it had no commercial, governmental or other non-residential buildings, except Trinity Lutheran Church, within its boundaries. Its property regulations were established by the City of Countryside ordinances and its 1937 Countryside Homes Association declarations, which were revised in 2016.

<doc id="114644" wikidata="Q2232393" url="?curid=114644" title="De Soto, Kansas">
<text>De Soto is a city along the Kansas River, in Johnson and Leavenworth counties in the U.S. state of Kansas, and part of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,118, and the 2021 estimate is 6,380.

==History==

The land that would become De Soto was part of a large territory extending to present-day St. Louis that was occupied by the Osage people, who were relocated from east of the Mississippi River in the upper Midwest. After the Treaty of St Louis in 1825, the Shawnee were forcibly relocated from Cape Girardeau to southeastern Kansas near the Neosho River. Only the Black Bob band of Shawnee resisted removal, however by 1828 they too migrated west and settled in northeastern Kansas in and around De Soto along the Kansas River. Later in the 19th century, many cultures of Native Americans arrived in the area after being pushed west by European-American pressure following colonial expansion and later the discovery of Gold in 1849. Between 1829 and 1854 almost thirty tribes were assigned reservations in what would become Kansas Territory. The Shawnee Methodist Mission was built in the De Soto area to minister to the tribe. A reserve was established in Kansas and soon other Shawnee from as far east as Ohio would join the reservation. The Agency of the Shawnee Indians, also known as Lexington, was located on the southern edge of the city.

The city of De Soto was platted in the spring of 1857, named for sixteenth-century Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. In 1858, John Possum, a Shawnee man, and Hattie Possum sold to John F. Legate, S. Todd and Stratton and Williams for $1,200. The next sale was 80 acres to the De Soto Town Company in July 1861 for $1,176. Major James B. Abbot is remembered as one of the town&#x27;s pioneer landowners and the builder of Abbot Hall. Today, Abbot Hall is one of two town museums. De Soto was incorporated as a city on October 1, 1897.

With the construction of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant south of De Soto, the city&#x27;s population boomed in the early 1940s during World War II. In May 1943, a &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; article reported &quot;a town rapidly growing, with a population increase from 400 to 1,000 persons in under a year.&quot; This sudden overflow in population put a great strain on housing and other resources in the city; however, many original residents prospered during this time, buying property and starting new businesses. Production flowed steadily at the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant until the plant went on standby in March 1948, with small-scale production following shortly after until its closure in 1993.

===Clearview===
In 1943, nearby &quot;Sunflower Village&quot; was built to house workers for nearby Sunflower Ordnance Works. The west side &quot;Old Village&quot; had 853 dwellings in 1943, and the east side &quot;New Village&quot; had 580 pre-fab units that was completed by 1945. Housing, a school and traffic were filled and overflowing. Highway 10, the main street, is now 83rd Street. As people came in, it was getting harder to find room and places to room, board, and to dwell in, to a point that people were living in the chicken house and sleeping under quilts on the ground where the current Scout House is sitting on Wea Street. It was so unbearable that rooms that were rented out &quot;by the shift&quot; that other people would bring in trailers and tents. In 1955, the housing units transferred to Sunflower Ordnance Worker (SOW), then sold to private buyers. In 1961, Sunflower was sold to Quick Way Homes and renamed as &quot;Clearview City&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Clearview City&quot; was annexed by the city of De Soto, boosting the city&#x27;s population by 339 people.

===1951 flood===

In mid-July 1951, heavy rains led to a great rise of water in the Kansas River and other surrounding areas of the central United States, known as the Great Flood of 1951. De Soto, along the south side of the river, was severely damaged. The river crest at De Soto was , the highest recorded on the Kansas River during the flood. Most of the downtown area was completely flooded, with over of standing water in some places.

===Recent growth===

Since the 2008 recession came to an end, growth in De Soto has steadily picked up, with substantial commercial development in the K-10 Business District.

In 2019, the Kansas City Star reported that De Soto was, and is expected to remain the second fastest-growing city in the Kansas City metro area, trailing only Spring Hill.

After the closure of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant in 1993, plans for potential development of the 15.5 square-mile lot south of De Soto began to receive attention. After several abandoned proposals for large-scale developments and attractions, a master use plan was adopted by the authorities of Olathe, De Soto, Johnson County, and Sunflower Redevelopment Group. The master plan called for high density housing, major commercial zoning, a &quot;downtown&quot; area for offices, high density commercial and civic uses, and land promised to The University of Kansas, Kansas State University and the City of De Soto, as well as land being reserved for the army reserves, parks and other public spaces. However, slow cleanup and exhausted funding delayed the completion to 2038. In 2019, congressional lawmakers representing Kansas urged the Army to accelerate cleanup efforts of the land. Additional funding allocation and priority from the Army led to the announcement that the portions of the lot closest to De Soto would be ready for development by 2020.

In April 2021, unrelated to the development at the former ammunition plant site, Flint Logistics announced a proposal to construct a $500 million logistics center and high-density residential complex three miles west of De Soto, petitioning annexation of the property adjacent to the Johnson-Douglas County line.

In 2021, following extensive cleanup and decontamination of site, clearance for development was granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the northernmost portion of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant. De Soto initiated annexation of 10 square miles, doubling the city&#x27;s footprint. Shortly thereafter, De Soto established a short-term plan to improve roadway and utility access to the area, as well as establishing a TIF (tax increment financing) district, in an effort to encourage development of the largest remaining undeveloped plot of land in the region. Amidst wide speculation of a large-scale development potential on the site, in July 2022, Panasonic North America announced its intent to construct the company&#x27;s first United States-based, and world&#x27;s largest electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility. Panasonic&#x27;s investment of over $4 billion into the site makes it the largest single private investment in Kansas&#x27; and Kansas City&#x27;s history.

In October 2022, Sunflower Redevelopment Group initiated an agreement with De Soto, which included 

voluntary annexation of an additional 2,800 acres of the former ammunition plant, completing annexation of the entire 17 square mile property. The agreement was an amendment to the original from 2021, extending the existing TIF district into the most recently annexed portion, excluding a small portion outside of the De Soto USD 232, with most of the original stipulations left intact. The city avoided extending the TIF district into the portion of recently annexed land that lie within Gardner-Edgerton USD 231, fearing that school board would consider veto of the TIF agreement in its entirety, requiring the city to restart the agreement approval process. A part of the amended agreement is that should development not occur within the time frame, the city is not obligated to de-annex the property, as was the contingency with the original agreement. The annexation conflicted with a 1989 boundary agreement with Gardner, however a 2022 ruling by the Kansas Supreme Court on a case between Olathe and Spring Hill set a precedent, rendering the original annexation agreement unenforceable by Gardner.

In November 2022, Sunflower Redevelopment Group renamed the site of the former ammunition plant to Astra Enterprise Park.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.15%, are water. While the majority of De Soto is located in northwestern Johnson County at (38.9791709, -94.9685783), the golf course north of the Kansas River is located in southern Leavenworth County. De Soto mainly lies south of the Kansas River, the only city in Johnson County originally platted around the river. Four of the river&#x27;s tributaries, Captain Creek, Kill Creek, Cedar Creek, Camp Creek end within the city limits.

Considered by many locals to be an exurb, rather than a suburb, De Soto is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area, and it borders other communities on the eastern edges. These include Shawnee to the northeast, Lenexa to the east, and Olathe to the southeast.

De Soto currently has annexation agreements with Olathe and Gardner, guaranteeing De Soto will be able to annex as far south as 127th Street and as far east as meeting Olathe at its western boundary. However, a 2022 Kansas Supreme Court ruling on a disagreement between Spring Hill and Olathe nullified most boundary agreements between Johnson County cities. Subsequently, in October 2022, De Soto initiated annexation of 2,800 acres south of the formerly agreed southernmost boundary with Gardner, at the behest of Sunflower Redevelopment Group, which the city argued took precedence since it was a voluntary annexation request.

=== Panasonic ===
In 2021, following extensive cleanup and decontamination of site, clearance for development was granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the northernmost portion of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant. De Soto initiated annexation of 6,376 acres, increasing the city&#x27;s footprint from 7,400 acres to 13,776 acres, nearly doubling in size. Shortly thereafter, De Soto established a short-term plan to improve roadway and utility access to the area, as well as establishing a TIF (tax increment financing) district, in an effort to encourage development of the largest remaining undeveloped plot of land in the region.

In early 2022, the Kansas legislature passed a bill, referred to as APEX, signed by Governor Laura Kelly, providing $800 million in tax breaks and incentives on a proposed $4 billion project by a company whose identity was concealed by a non-disclosure agreement between the two parties. It was believed that this project was to either be developed in De Soto, or Pryor Creek, Oklahoma, due to the extensive amount of land that was expected to be required.

On July 13, 2022, state officials announced during a press conference that Panasonic was the company in question, and had selected De Soto for its planned $4 billion electric-vehicle battery manufacturing facility, to be constructed on the northernmost portion of the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant. The facility is expected to provide 4,000 direct jobs, with an estimated 4,000 additional jobs by non-direct development related to the facility, and 16,000 construction jobs. It is the largest, costliest single development in Kansas&#x27; history, and will be one of the largest private employers in the state once operational, which is expected to be in July, 2024.

==Arts and culture==
Between 1999 and 2000, a barn that had originally been built in the 1880s was moved piece by piece from a farmstead and placed on the Zimmerman farm at the northwest corner of the Kill Creek Road and K-10 interchange. The barn was historically called the White-Waitmann barn but after its erection in 2000, by contractors and community volunteers, it also became known as the Zimmerman barn. The barn was not only a piece of American history, but it became well known throughout the community because the owner, Darrel Zimmerman, allows the public to pay a fee and use the barn for events such as weddings, graduations, and other meetings. However, a fierce storm demolished the barn in May 2010. The barn was rebuilt in 2013, after it was determined that Zimmerman could not locate another historic-looking barn to move on the location.

De Soto was settled in 1828 as a city along the Kansas River. Several years later, in 1857, the Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe Railway constructed track through northern portions of town, parallel to the river. De Soto&#x27;s train depot was constructed along a siding around 1860. In 1900, a railyard was constructed east of town to allow the switching of freight cars from Topeka to Kansas City. The yard consisted of seven rails along the main line and siding. Portions of the yard are still in use today to store unused freight cars. However, only three lines remain, as the others were removed to save on maintenance.

In 1942, during the construction of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, the U.S. army constructed a spur through De Soto to connect the plant to a main rail line. To this day the spur is used for the industrial district shipments.

==History==

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. In the 1820s, the federal government reserved this area for use by the Shawnee people, who had ceded their lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States. In 1839, Methodists established the Shawnee Methodist Mission here to operate a school for the Shawnee and try to convert them to Christianity. Later it was named the Shawnee Indian Manual Labor School and also accepted Native American boarding students, then closed in 1862. The site is now owned by the Kansas Historical Society, designated as a National Historic Landmark, and is operated by the city of Fairway as a museum.

In the 1930s, as Kansas City suburbs were developing, a developer named J.C. Nichols. laid out a subdivision near a golf course. It was named Fairway from its proximity to several driving ranges. Fairway was incorporated in 1949 and is known as &quot;The City of Trees&quot;.

Fairway formed its own police force in 1949 with the appointment of a town marshal. This position was succeeded by police chiefs.

<text>Leawood () is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States, and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 33,902.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the area east of present-day Leawood opened for settlement. The Santa Fe Trail which ran through the area also contributed to the development of the area. The Border Ruffian War (1855-1857), part of a larger conflict known as Bleeding Kansas, damaged the local economy as pro-slavery activists from the slave state of Missouri attacked settlers, traders, and those traveling along the Santa Fe Trail. Conditions improved with the founding of Oxford, Kansas, the predecessor of Leawood. The township was destroyed by the American Civil War, and there was little left by 1865.

Leawood was named for Oscar G. Lee, the original land owner of the town site.

=== 20th century ===
Modern Leawood was established in the 1920s, after Oscar G. Lee, a retired police chief from Oklahoma, moved to Johnson County. He supervised the construction of Lee Boulevard for public use.

In 1948, a housing development by the Kroh Brothers led to the incorporation as a city. On November 30, 1948, Leawood became a city of the third class with a population of less than 2,000. By 1959, it had become a city of the second class. , it is a city of the first class with approximately 32,800 residents.

, it was one of the Kansas City metropolitan area&#x27;s wealthiest suburbs, alongside Mission Hills, Kansas, the Country Club Plaza neighborhood, and Olathe, Kansas. Particularly the neighborhoods of Hallbrook, Mission Hill Estates, and Tuscany Reserve were all rated in the top 1%, according to a widely cited research professor.

==Covenants==
The developers of Leawood, the Kroh Brothers (Clifford E. Kroh, Jr., and brother John A. Kroh, Sr.) and their father Clifford E. Kroh, Sr., emulated Kansas City urban planner and real estate developer J. C. Nichols, if not competed and attempted to eclipse him. Nichols developed neighborhoods defined by “large lots, curvilinear streets, uniform architecture, extensive deed restrictions, and homes associations,” according to “Race, Real Estate, And Uneven Development; The Kansas City Experience, 1900-2000” by Kevin Fox Gotham.

The Kroh Brothers for years used restrictive covenants for homeowners similar to those developed by J. C. Nichols, which have come under increasing scrutiny since the George Floyd Protests of 2020.

For example, on April 4, 1945, John A. Kroh Sr., filed the following language for a subdivision called Leawood Estates: &quot;“None of said lots or portions of lots shall ever be sold, conveyed, transferred, devised, leased or rented to or used, owned or occupied by any person of Negro blood or by any person who is more than one-fourth of the Semitic race, blood, origin, or extraction, including without limitation in said designation, Armenians, Jews, Hebrews, Turks, Persians, Syrians, and Arabians, excluding, however, from the application of this paragraph partial occupancy by bona fide domestic servants employed thereon.”&quot;

The Kroh Brothers diversified into shopping malls and office buildings, and developed the original Ward Parkway Shopping Center. Their properties stretched across the country, with more than 100 developments in 13 states. The firm failed in a high-profile bankruptcy in 1987. Clifford Kroh’s grandsons, John A. Kroh Jr. and George P. Kroh, both served time in prison for bank fraud and conspiracy.

==Geography==

The city is bordered on three sides by the cities of Overland Park and Prairie Village and on the fourth by Kansas City, Missouri. The city&#x27;s land area is approximately 75% developed and growth is expected to continue in the future.

<text>Lenexa is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States, and part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 57,434. making it the ninth most populated city in Kansas. It is bordered by the cities of Shawnee to the north, Overland Park to the east, De Soto to the west and Olathe to the south.

==History==
Twelve years before the town of Lenexa was platted, James Butler Hickok staked a claim on at what is now the corner of 83rd and Clare Road. Filed in 1857, the claim was not far from the Kansas River, and was southwest of Westport, Missouri, and the start of the Santa Fe Trail. The trail meandered through this area on its way to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

On March 22, 1858, Hickok was elected one of the first four constables of nearby Monticello Township. Later, Hickok became a scout for the Free-State Army, a sharpshooter and eventually, one of the most famous folk heroes of the American West, Wild Bill Hickok.

At about the same time as Hickok filed his claim, a census of the Shawnee Indians living in the area was being taken, and one of the residents listed was Na-Nex-Se Blackhoof. She was the widow of Chief Blackhoof, the second signer of the 1854 treaty that ceded of the Kansas Shawnee Indian reservation to the United States government.

In 1865, the Kansas and Neosho Valley Railroad was organized to take advantage of favorable new land laws. It later changed its name to Missouri River, Ft. Scott and Gulf Railroad, and in 1869 purchased a right-of-way from C.A. Bradshaw in the area that is now Lenexa, with the stipulation that a depot be built on the property.

Bradshaw also sold to Octave Chanute, a railroad civil engineer, who platted the town in 1869. Legend states that the first town name proposed was &quot;Bradshaw&quot;, but Bradshaw modestly refused and the name &quot;Lenexa&quot;, a derivation of the name Na-Nex-Se, the name of Shawnee Chief Thomas Blackhoof&#x27;s wife, was adopted.

<text>Mission Hills is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States, and part of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,594. The east city limits is the Kansas-Missouri state line at State Line Road. Mission Hills was originally developed by noted Kansas City developer J. C. Nichols beginning in the 1920s as part of his Country Club District plan.

==History==

An Indian mission was established at the town&#x27;s site in the 1830s, hence the name of the later settlement.

The city started as a planned upscale community for the elite by J.C. Nichols to be built around the Mission Hills Country Club (Kansas) on the hills above Brush Creek just south of the Shawnee Methodist Mission. Most of the country club&#x27;s property is in Kansas but its original clubhouse was in Kansas City, Missouri, allowing it to serve liquor, which was prohibited on the Kansas side. Nichols laid out plans in 1914. He had developed the country club to enhance the value of his Kansas properties after discovering that upscale buyers were reluctant to live on the Kansas side of the state line.

Adjoining the club Nichols established the Community Golf Club. After it dramatically grew, it moved to what today is the Kansas City Country Club. Nichols lured the Kansas City Country Club to take over the land, and the Community Golf Club went on to establish the Indian Hills Country Club. Together, the three clubs became the most prestigious in the Kansas City metropolitan area; many rank them in order of prestige: Indian Hills first, Kansas City second, and Mission Hills third.

Nichols opposed incorporation of the community fearing that a city would not adequately meet the needs of its residents or properly enforce housing covenants. Consequently, the Mission Hills Home Company was founded on August 18, 1914. One of the most publicized early enforcements involved forbidding the family of a sick woman to enclose her porch with glass.

Faced with prospects of annexation by neighboring relatively lower income communities seeking its wealthy tax base, Mission Hills incorporated as a city in 1949.

Many of the early houses were designed by Clarence E. Shepherd, Edward Tanner, and Edward Buehler Delk.

The city&#x27;s most distinctive landmark, which is used on the official city seal, is the Verona columns and reflecting pool at the intersection of Ensley Lane, Mission Drive and Overhill Road. They were conceived by landscape architect S. Herbert Hare in 1924.

In 1928 Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Pauline, stayed at the house of W. Malcolm and Ruth Lowry at 6435 Indian Lane. During this time, Hemingway was working on &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. He later gave an autographed copy of the book to Don Carlos Guffey, the Kansas City doctor who delivered his son Patrick. The inscription, which is now in the University of Missouri-Kansas City library, said &quot;...with much admiration and grateful remembrance of a Caesarean that was beautifully done and turned out splendidly.&quot; 

They returned for a time in 1931 while Hemingway was working on &quot;Death in the Afternoon.&quot;

<text>Olathe ( ) is the county seat of Johnson County, Kansas, United States. It is the fourth-most populous city in both the Kansas City metropolitan area and the state of Kansas, with a 2020 population of 141,290.

==History==
===19th century===
Olathe was founded by John T. Barton in the spring of 1857. He rode to the center of Johnson County, and staked two quarter sections of land as the town site. He later described his ride to friends: &quot;...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful.&quot; Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say &quot;Beautiful&quot; in his native language. The interpreter responded, &quot;Olathe.&quot;

Olathe was incorporated in 1857, and while not the first city in Johnson County, its rapid growth led to it being named the county seat in October 1859. Rising tensions across the nation over the issue of slavery led to numerous clashes between abolitionist settlers and neighboring slave state Missouri. These clashes further escalated and become a part of the greater conflict known as Bleeding Kansas. With the admission of Kansas into the Union as a free state in 1861, violence began to dissipate. Peace continued to elude Olathe for many years to come, however. In 1861, Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It housed one company of troops along with the local militia.

On September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led a surprise raid of guerrilla Confederates against the city, which resulted in a half dozen deaths and the destruction of most of the city. Quantrill captured the outpost and tried forcing the men to swear an oath to the Confederacy. The oath was deemed invalid in November 1862, since the guerrillas were not considered legitimate enemy military units. Kansas militia continued to occupy the Olathe military post through the rest of the Civil War.

Confederate forces attempted two further raids against the city. The first happened on August 20–21, 1863, as Quantrill was passing through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid occurred October 24–5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price, with a force of 10,000 men, passed through on their retreat south (see Price&#x27;s Raid). With the Confederate surrender, the military post was decommissioned in August 1865.

Olathe served as a stop on the Oregon Trail, the California Trail, and the Santa Fe Trail. Catering to travelers was the main source of income for local stores and businesses. The Mahaffie House, a popular resupply point for wagons headed westward, is today a registered historical site maintained by the City of Olathe. The staff wears period costumes, and stagecoach rides and farm animals make the site a favorite among children. Visitors can participate in Civil War re-enactments, Wild West Days, and other activities.

After the construction of the transcontinental railroad, the trails to the west lost importance, and Olathe faded into obscurity and remained a small, sleepy prairie town.

===20th century===
In the 1950s, the construction of the interstate highway system and, more directly, Interstate 35, linked Olathe to nearby Kansas City, Missouri. The result was tremendous residential growth as Olathe became a part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. In the 1980s, Olathe experienced tremendous commercial growth, which also drew more residents. Olathe&#x27;s population is estimated to have surpassed 100,000 in 2001, and later projections showed Olathe&#x27;s growth continuing as the city expanded into the farm fields south, west, and north of town.

Less than thirty years later, the population had nearly quadrupled to 111,790 in 1990, increasing to 173,250 as of the 2010 census. Overland Park officially became the second largest city in the state, following Wichita, Kansas, after passing Kansas City, Kansas in the early 2000s.

Population growth in the city can mainly be attributed to the traditional greenfield suburban development, appreciated on the city&#x27;s annexation map.

<text>Prairie Village is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States, and located within the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 22,957.

== History ==
After the successful development of the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri, real estate magnate J. C. Nichols turned toward development of his native Johnson County, just a few miles from the Plaza. Prairie Village was platted in 1941 and was named after Prairie School, which was established almost a century before. In 1949, Prairie Village was named the best planned community in America by the National Association of Home Builders. It incorporated in 1951.

Remnants of the Santa Fe Trail are found in the city.

Shawnee, Osage, and Kansa Indians formerly inhabited the land now developed into the City of Prairie Village. In 1858, Thomas Porter bought 160 acres of farmland in what is now Prairie Village; he raised all his children on that farmland and was involved in agricultural development and civic affairs.

Porter&#x27;s sister, Betty Porter, married Thompson A. Lewis, who owned 80 acres between Mission Road and Roe Avenue.

Henry Coppock arrived in Johnson County in 1857, before heading farther west to work in freighting and farming. He came back in the mid-1860s and bought land in 1865. Coppock built his family home on 900 acres in Prairie Village. Coppock&#x27;s house stood for 30 years. Now on his land is Homestead County Club.

The original Prairie School was built in 1882, and a new building was constructed in 1912. This landmark was a community treasure until 1990 when it was struck by a bolt of lightning during a storm. The east entrance of the 1912 building still stands at the remodeled school.

In the 1940s, J.C. Nichols, an experienced developer, wanted to turn the farmland into suburban housing for white soldiers returning home from the war. Nichols bought farmland from the Porters, Coppocks, and Lewises. There were hurdles along the way including a lack of experienced builders after World War II, but this didn&#x27;t stop Nichols from pursuing his goal.

Prairie Village continued to expand as the Prairie Village Shopping Center opened in 1947 and the Corinth Square Shopping Center opened in 1955, with subdivisions including Corinth Hills, Corinth Meadows, Corinth Estates, Somerset Hills, Ridgeview Heights, Town &amp; Country Estates, Calvin Crest, Prairie Hills, Prairie Fields and Prairie Ridge, to name a few.

<text>Roeland Park is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States, and located within the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,871.

==History==
The community was named after John Roe, an immigrant from Ireland who settled on in 1883, on part of which Roeland Park now stands. The Roe Home was built in 1891 and razed in 1958 to make room for the interchange at Roe Boulevard and Shawnee Mission Parkway.

The area that would become Roeland Park was first developed in 1905 as a streetcar suburb, known as Southridge, by William Strang. Strang&#x27;s Missouri and Kansas Interurban Railway went through Roeland Park on its way from Rosedale to downtown Overland Park. Single-family home construction in this area accelerated during the late 1930s and 1940s as more developers subdivided land purchased from farmers.

Incorporation of the city of Roeland Park occurred on July 2, 1951, led by developer Charles Vawter and his Roeland Park Homes Association. A series of annexations occurred between 1951 and 1959 leading to the present-day city boundaries.

Roeland Park&#x27;s original pool was built in 1958 on land donated by the Roe Estate. The new pool facility is located on the east side of the Community Center at 4843 Rosewood Drive. The Community Center address is 4850 Rosewood Drive and offers many different programs throughout the year. A fabric dome which covers the main pool is in place from September to May, allowing residents to use the main pool throughout the year.

In 2023, Michael Poppa was appointed mayor, becoming the first openly gay mayor of any large city in Johnson County. Poppa succeeded previous mayor, Mike Kelly, who was elected chairman of the Johnson County board of commissioners.

==Geography==

<text>Shawnee is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States. It is the seventh-most populous municipality in the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 67,311.

==History==
===Territory of Kansas===
Before and after the Civil War, Shawnee served as a government road that connected Fort Leavenworth to Fort Riley. During the mid 19th century, branches of the Oregon Trail and nearby Santa Fe Trail that passed through Olathe, Overland Park and Kansas City, Missouri saw settlers travel through the area. A Shawnee Indian mission had been established at the present site of Shawnee in 1831. Shawnee was laid out as a town in 1857. Kansas entered the union as a free state on January 29, 1861, to become the 34th state. The declaration of a free state added to the tension between the anti-slave abolitionists and pro-slave Confederate guerrillas.

===American Civil War===
In October 1862, Willam Quantrill ordered an attack on Shawnee, which saw the town pillaged and burned to the ground. Quantrill and his army of bushwhackers return in the summer of 1863, to raid and look for an escape route from Lawrence, which he was intending to sack. The raids on Shawnee served as a training exercise before attempting the full scale siege on Lawrence.

Shawnee was selected by Quantrill for its proximity to Lawrence, being 35 miles away (56 km). Lawrence was established for the political reason of being an anti-slave town and had many clashes with the confederate army started before the American Civil War. The first documented event of Bleeding Kansas was the Wakarusa War that saw both sides clash and come to a temporary truce. This allowed Lawrence to add to its defenses before the Sacking of Lawrence. In August 1863, the Lawrence Massacre took place at the hands of William Quantrill. This resulted in 250 men corralled and murdered and $2.2 million in damages.

<doc id="114659" wikidata="Q2619785" url="?curid=114659" title="Westwood, Kansas">
<text>Westwood is a city in northeastern Johnson County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,750. It is the second most densely populated city in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area.

==History==
The land where Westwood is located was originally occupied by the Kansa and Pawnee Indians. However, beginning in the 1830s, Captain Joseph Parks, then Head Chief of the Shawnee, worked with the U.S. Government to remove the Shawnee tribes from Ohio to the newly opened reservations in northeastern Kansas. In exchange for his services, the government awarded Parks 1,290 acres of land straddling what is now Johnson and Wyandotte counties as part of an 1854 treaty with the Shawnee. In 1859, Parks died without leaving a will stating what should happen to the land. His heirs spent the next 60 years disputing how the land should be divided. The land that would eventually become Westwood was ultimately awarded to Parks&#x27; granddaughter and her husband, Catherine and John Swatzell. In 1898, the Swatzells built a stone home. That home is still located at 4958 Rainbow and is considered the beginnings of the community that would eventually become Westwood. 

Following World War II, the land around the Swatzells&#x27; residence began to be seriously developed as a suburb of Kansas City. Residents originally formed the Hudson Mission Homes Association as a loose group who worked to bring streets and utilities to the area. Westwood was formally incorporated as a city in 1949. The name &quot;Westwood&quot; was chosen for the city because immediately to the East of Westwood there was Westwood, Missouri, which was already a thriving neighborhood. The name Westwood, moreover, already appeared in several area subdivisions and the elementary school which was already in existence was called Westwood View.

The Westwood Neighborhood Association was formed in 1987 for the purpose of hosting community events. Its first president was Tom Shanks, a sixteen-year-old resident. The association&#x27;s first event was Oktoberfest, held in the park located at 50th and Rainbow. It is an event that still takes place in the community annually.

Westwood maintains its own police department, which serves the public.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The original boundaries of the city were 47th Street to the north, Rainbow Boulevard to the east, Shawnee Mission Parkway and the rear property line of the homes on 51st Terrace to the south, and Mission Road to the west. In 1960, the city also annexed Westport Annex and Westport View, extending the boundaries of the city to include 47th Place, 47th Terrace, and 48th Street from Rainbow Boulevard to State Line Road. In a 1973 vote, the city declined to consolidate with the neighboring city of Westwood Hills.

<text>Greensburg is a city in and the county seat of Kiowa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the population of the city was 740. It is home to the world&#x27;s largest hand-dug well.

On the evening of May 4, 2007, Greensburg was devastated by an EF5 tornado that leveled at least 95 percent of the city, killing eleven people between the ages of 46 and 84. The community had a population of 2,000 people in the late 1990s, and 1,400 people before the tornado leveled the city. Some people did not want to come back, or rebuild the community, or build green. By 2010, over half of Greensburg&#x27;s population before the tornado had moved away from the city. Today, Greensburg stands as a model &quot;green town&quot;, often described as the greenest in America. The hospital, city hall, and school have all been built to the highest certification level issued by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).

==History==
===Early history and development===

For millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.

The first settlement was established at Greensburg in 1885. Greensburg was named after D.R. &quot;Cannonball&quot; Green, who owned a stagecoach company and played a part in the establishment of the city. In 1887, construction began on the Big Well, the largest hand-dug well in the world. By 1888, Greensburg was proclaimed the &quot;liveliest town in the state&quot;, the same year the construction of the Big Well was completed.

The city ceased using the Big Well as a water source in 1932, and converted it into a tourist attraction in 1937. In 1972, the Big Well was declared a national museum.

One of the largest pallasite meteorites ever discovered was found near Greensburg in 1949, weighing over 1,000 pounds.

===2007 tornado===
At 9:45 p.m. CDT on May 4, 2007, during a deadly tornado outbreak, Greensburg took a direct hit from a rain-wrapped EF5 tornado. The tornado was estimated to be in width — wider than the city itself — and traveled for nearly . 

The tornado killed 10 people in Greensburg and two more in neighboring communities. Tornado sirens sounded in the city twenty minutes before the tornado struck, and a tornado emergency was issued, is believed by experts to have saved hundreds of lives. The tornado lasted for a total of one hour and five minutes and caused $250 million in damages.

Ninety-five percent of the city was confirmed to be destroyed, with the other five percent being severely damaged. The National Weather Service estimated winds of the tornado to reach . It was the first tornado in history to be rated EF5 since the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita scale earlier that year. It was also the first F5 or EF5 classification since May 3, 1999, when an F5 tornado devastated Moore, Oklahoma during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak.

Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius and President George W. Bush both declared Kiowa County a disaster area, which opened up the affected areas for national and international aid.

===Rebuilding (2007-present)===
After the tornado, Greensburg rebuilt itself as a &quot;green&quot; city. A non-profit organization called Greensburg GreenTown was founded to help inform the residents about the green living initiative. 

In response to the disaster, the city council passed a resolution requiring all city buildings be built to LEED — platinum standards, becoming the first city in the nation to do so. With extra help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Greensburg residents developed a long-term plan for Greensburg. The city&#x27;s power is supplied by ten 1.25 MW wind-turbines. Carbon offsets generated from the turbines are being managed by NativeEnergy, and have been purchased by charter supporters including Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Clif Bar, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, and Stonyfield Farm.

Despite the efforts to rebuild the town, the population by 2010 was about 50% of what it was in 2000. The 2000 census found 1,574 residents, while 777 residents were recorded in the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===

Greensburg is home to the world&#x27;s largest hand dug well. Work had begun on the well in 1887 to provide water for the steam engines of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. When the well was completed in 1888 it was deep and in diameter. The well was used as the city&#x27;s water supply until 1932. In 1939 it was opened as a tourist attraction allowing visitors to descend to the bottom of the well.

The adjacent museum displayed a 1000-pound pallasite meteorite until the museum fell down around the meteorite during the 2007 tornado that destroyed the city. The meteorite was found in the rubble of the museum and moved to a temporary home in Hays, Kansas while Greensburg was rebuilding. In May 2012, the new Big Well Museum and Visitor Information Center opened featuring exhibits about the history of Greensburg, The Big Well, the 2007 tornado, the rebuilding process, and the meteorite.

On October 16, 2006, a related smaller meteorite measuring 154 pounds (70 kilograms) was dug up near Greensburg () and Haviland (). The only scientific publication discussing time of impact suggests a terrestrial age of 20,000 years. It was once thought that its age was around 10,000 years.

==Media==

Several television networks have drawn an interest in Greensburg as a subject for reality shows as a result of the Greensburg City Council&#x27;s decision to make the city a &quot;green&quot; town. A documentary on its reconstruction, called &quot;Greensburg&quot;, aired on Planet Green, a sister network of Discovery Channel.

Another documentary, &quot;Earth 2100&quot;, drew attention to Greensburg as &quot;the green town&quot; that was built after the devastating 2007 tornado. The ABC film suggested a fictionalized, future Greensburg as a model showing how American towns can successfully implement green technology, and become a beacon for hope on a planet doomed to destruction from climate change and overpopulation.

Multiple books have been written about Greensburg and the 2007 tornado. &quot;Greensburg: The Twisted Tales&quot; (Janice Haney) recounts several residents&#x27; experiences with the tornado. &quot;Aftermath: Scenes from the Sudden Destruction of an American Hometown&quot; (Merlin Peck) showcases images of destruction and debris from the event.

<text>Chetopa is a city in Labette County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 929. Chetopa was named for Chief Chetopah, an Osage Indian chief. Later, the community name was shortened.

==History==
The community began as an Osage village, named after its Chief Chetopah, whose name in the Osage language signifies &quot;four lodges,&quot; was an advocate of peace, the leading chief of the Little Osage tribe, and one of the chief counselors of the Osage Nation.

In 1847 a trading post to exchange goods with the Osage Nation was established here by Larkin McGhee. By the time of McGhee&#x27;s arrival there were three other Euro-American families plus two families with a Euro-American husband and a Cherokee wife at Chetopa. There were also many Osage there.

Chetopa was the site of a September 18, 1861 battle between the 6th Kansas Cavalry under the direction of James G. Blunt and pro-slavery raiders led by John Allen Mathews, whose wife was an Osage and was culturally identified with the Osages.

The first post office in Chetopa was established in April 1867. In 1880, Postmaster J.M. Cavaness petitioned the removal of the ending “h” in the original spelling to become Chetopa.

Chetopa was the destination of the Nevada and Minden Railway, completed in 1886. The town attracted that line, which ran southwest from Nevada, Missouri through Pittsburg, Kansas, when it donated land for right-of-way and year/depot purposes. Much of the trackage has since been abandoned.

<text>Oswego is a city in and the county seat of Labette County, Kansas, United States, and situated along the Neosho River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,668.

==History==
Oswego is located on the site of an Osage village called No tse Wa spe, which means &quot;Heart Stays&quot; or more loosely translated, &quot;Quiet Heart.&quot; Jesuit Missionaries from Osage Mission (now St. Paul, Kansas) who worked among the Osages called the village &quot;Little Town,&quot; probably because the band of Osages who lived in the village were of the &quot;Little Osage&quot; division of the Osage People. More specifically, the Osage Village of Little Town was described as &quot;Little Town Above&quot; by the Jesuits, to distinguish it from another village, which was sometimes located just to the east of Little Town, called &quot;Little Town Below.&quot; While Osage villages were moved quite often (according to weather, hunting conditions, and sanitary conditions) Little Town Above was generally located on the bluff overlooking the Neosho River, where Oswego sits today. Little Town Below often sat near Horseshoe Lake, in the Neosho River Valley about a mile due east of Oswego. During the 1850s, Little Town was often referred to as &quot;White Hair&#x27;s Town,&quot; in honor of a resident of the village named Iron Hawk. Iron Hawk was named Grand Tsi Shu Chief (or Peace Chief) of the Osage Nation (through the 19th Century, it was traditional for the Osage Chief to take the name &quot;White Hair&quot;.)
A study of the baptismal records of the Jesuits at Osage Mission reveals that several white or mixed white and Osage families lived in or near Little Town before the Civil War. Several mixed white and Cherokee families also lived in or near the present site of Little Town, likely just east of the village in the Cherokee Neutral Lands or to the south, near Chetopa.

One family of mixed Osage blood that lived at Little Town before the Civil War was the John Allen Mathews family, who operated a blacksmith/gunsmith shop on the site and ran a trading post here, as well as one at Osage Mission and one at Fort Gibson. Mathews first purchased the trading post at Little Town from Augustus Chouteau in either 1838 or 1843, depending upon the source. Mathews was married to Mary Ann Williams until her death and then to her sister Sarah Jane Williams, daughters of William Sherley Williams, better known as &quot;Old Bill Williams&quot; and his Osage wife, A-Ci&#x27;n-Ga or Wind Blossom.

Mathews was a slaveholder from Kentucky, as evidenced by the baptismal records of the Osage Mission. Before the Civil War, Mathews was involved in driving off settlers from the adjacent Cherokee Neutral Lands and in stirring Southern sympathies among Native Americans living on the frontier. Early in the spring of 1861, Mathews was commissioned a captain in the Confederate Army and given orders to organize a company of soldiers from among sympathetic Native Americans, specifically, the Quapaw. In June 1861, he held a meeting at the house of Larkin McGhee in the nearby Osage village of Chetopa and organized a company of Osages and mixed-blood Cherokees for the Confederate Army. One of his sons, John Mathews, Jr. joined this company. September 8, 1861, Mathews led another company, this one made up of Osages, mixed-blooded Osages and Cherokees, and border ruffians. This second company raided and looted Humboldt, Kansas, capturing no less than a dozen freed slaves. James Lane put a $1000.00 bounty on the head of Mathews, who was soon betrayed by a man who worked at his ranch. The man helped James G. Blunt and the Kansas 6th Volunteer Cavalry (and the Humboldt Home Guard) track down Mathews. He was killed at the house of William Blythe, rented by Lewis Rogers, just southeast of Chetopa on the Cherokee Neutral Lands.
The next day, local residents were tried by James G. Blunt in an impromptu court martial. Mathews&#x27; ranch and trading post at Little Town were subsequently burned. The ranch had consisted of a two story double log cabin (covered with burr siding and sporting plastered walls), a blacksmith shop, a stable, slaves quarters, a well house, a smoke house, a woodshed, and other outbuildings, as well as two race tracks. He had title to on the bluff and below. He had no less than 100 head of cattle and 50 horses. His possessions and the stock of the trading post (including 50 buffalo robes and six bear skins) were distributed among the volunteers who had tracked him down. Little Town and many houses at Chetopa were also burned. The site of Little Town remained unoccupied by whites during the war. Most, but not all, of the Osages fled Kansas during the Civil War. Mathews&#x27;s own children fled to Texas and Kentucky.

In 1865, a number of settlers located at this point and called the town &quot;Little Town.&quot; Two years later, the Oswego town company was organized and so named for Oswego, New York, whence many of the settlers had come. Lots were given away to every person who would erect a building, with the result that the town grew very rapidly. The organization of Oswego as a city of the third class took place in February 1870. The town was made a city of the second class by proclamation of the governor in 1880.

The first frame house was put up by Dr. William S. Newlon in September 1865. The first frame store building was erected by Thomas J. Buntain, though the first store was opened in a log building in 1865 by Rexford &amp; Elsbee. The post office was established in 1867 with Nelson Carr as postmaster. At that time, there were two provision stores, since Oswego was on the military road. M. George had opened a blacksmith shop and D.W. Clover a hotel, which was not only an inn for the public, but the county headquarters, a political rendezvous and a news center. This was the second hotel, the first having been built in 1866 by William A. Hogaboom. In 1868, Mr. Shanks operated the first pottery and made several kilns of stoneware; a cotton gin was set up the same year. The first bank was opened in 1868 by W. M. Johnson, who was forced two years later to make an assignment of all that he had to satisfy his creditors. The second bank was started in July 1870 by B. F. Hibart and H. L. Taylor, which was a success. The State Bank of Oswego started business a few weeks later, but discontinued after a short time, as there was not business enough for two banks. In September 1870, a steam sawmill was erected by Macon, Krell &amp; Cowell.

The first newspaper was the &quot;Oswego Register&quot;, established in 1868 by E.R. Trask. The first church was the Congregational, organized in May 1868; the Presbyterian church was founded in July of the same year. The first school was opened in 1867. The public library association was organized in 1877 and continues in the form of Oswego Public Library, a Carnegie Library, today. The telephone system was put into operation in 1882, the waterworks in 1887, and the first electric lights were turned on July 12, 1888 (but were turned off a few months later).

In 2011, the City Council voted to annex city-owned Oswego Municipal Airport into the city limits, expanding Oswego into neighboring Cherokee County.

==Medical==

Until 2019, Oswego was served by Oswego Community Hospital (OCH), a twelve-bed Critical Access hospital administered by HMC/CAH, Inc. and supported by Via Christi Hospital (Pittsburg) of Pittsburg, Kansas and Labette Health of Parsons. OCH had a contractual agreement with Eagle-Med to provide Air Ambulance services to any local or regional hospital. 

On February 13, 2019, Oswego Community Hospital abruptly closed its doors, &quot;citing [a] failure to expand Medicaid&quot; and &quot;low patient volumes.&quot; However, later in 2019, then-Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt announced his office had executed a search warrant as part of a broader investigation of the hospital&#x27;s operator, EmpowerHMS. In June 2020, federal indictments were unsealed, revealing that several persons associated with EmpowerHMS were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for their alleged role in a $1.4 billion fraudulent billing scheme. In April 2020, the hospital&#x27;s assets, including the former hospital site, a former clinic location, and other real estate, were purchased out of bankruptcy by Oswego NeuroPsych Hospital, Inc.

<text>Parsons is a city in Labette County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 9,600. It is the most populous city of Labette County, and the second-most populous city in the southeastern region of Kansas. It is home to Labette Community College and the Parsons State Hospital &amp; Training Center.

==History==

Parsons was named after Levi Parsons, president of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (Katy) Railroad. The town was founded in 1870 and incorporated the following year by the railroad. The location for the town was chosen because it was on a flat ridge between the Labette Creek and Little Labette Creek and provided an ideal site for where the two branches of the railroad being built from Junction City, Kansas and Sedalia, Missouri would meet. The creeks were soon dammed to provide a water source. The railroad commenced building a massive rail yard, foundry, and locomotive shop at Parsons; for many years this was the third largest railroad facility west of the Mississippi River, with only Kansas City and Los Angeles being larger. Settlers from nearby towns uprooted and moved to Parsons, and new settlers arrived on every incoming train. Parsons soon became a major hub for several railroads, including the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, the Parsons and Pacific Railroad, the Kansas City and Pacific Railroad, and the Memphis, Kansas &amp; Colorado Railroad. In the early part of the twentieth century, Parsons operated its own street car system, and also had an interurban electric railroad connecting it to the nearby cities of Cherryvale, Independence, Coffeyville, and Nowata. During World War II it was home to the Kansas Ordnance Plant, which later operated for some years as the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant. In Spring of 2005, the munitions plant was placed on the BRAC list for closure. The community has rallied behind the current plant operator, Day &amp; Zimmerman, to keep the company on the grounds after closure and to keep those jobs and more in the Parsons area. (See link to &quot;Great Plains Industrial Park&quot; in &quot;External Links&quot;, below)

===Hospitals===
Parsons is also home to the Parsons State Hospital &amp; Training Center, which has been in operation since 1903 when it was opened as the Kansas State Hospital for Epileptics.

In 1957 the hospital was renamed Parsons State Hospital and Training Center. At that time it began providing programs for individuals with developmental disabilities. The Hospital occupies 43 buildings on . The hospital also includes residential services, the University Center on Developmental Disabilities and the Parsons Research Center for the University of Kansas, the Special Purpose School of the Southeast Regional Education Service Center. The Southeast Kansas Agricultural Research Center of Kansas State University is also located on the grounds, as is the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, Heart of America Chapter, Southeast Kansas Regional Office.

Parsons is also home to Labette County Medical Center.

===Library===
The first library began as a subscription library in 1904 and was located in city hall. Parsons Public Library, a Carnegie library, opened on May 18, 1909. A new library opened on April 18, 1977, and the former library has since been renovated to become a visual and performing arts center.

===Industry===
The sale of Katy Industries to Union Pacific, in 1988, eventually saw the loss of scores of railroad jobs and, in effect, severed a major part of Parsons&#x27; city history which stretched back to its 1871 incorporation. While, in return, the city received a million dollars to help it recover (and so that it would not file lengthy paperwork opposing the sale and thus delaying it), that money is kept in a fund by the city government, which uses the accrued interest on economic development projects. The only reminder of the Katy Railroad is now found in the local historical society&#x27;s museum, the annual Katy Days Festival and of course the tracks, over which trains now speed through Parsons. The Kansas Army Ammunition Plant also was down scaled in the 1980s.

===2000-2020===
On April 19, 2000, an F3 tornado cut a devastating path of destruction through the center of Parsons. About 700 homes were damaged and about 100 destroyed, about 60 businesses were damaged and 11 destroyed.

On June 5, 2006 the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Parsons a 2006 Great American Main Street Award winner for its successful efforts in revitalizing its downtown area through historic preservation. The award was presented during the 2006 National Main Streets Conference in New Orleans. Parsons was one of only five cities receiving the 2006 award.
Parsons is the home of Dwayne&#x27;s Photo, which became the last processor of K-14 Kodachrome film in the world and was the location of the final frame taken on the final roll of Kodachrome film produced. Parsons is featured prominently in the plot of the 2017 Netflix movie &quot;Kodachrome&quot; about a man who takes a road trip to develop a roll of Kodachrome film.

===Film===
The motion picture &quot;ZombieGeddon&quot; (2003) was filmed in Parsons in July 2002.

=== Newspaper ===
The &quot;Parsons Sun&quot; is a twice-weekly newspaper published in Parsons since 1871. At different times it was owned by Henry J. Allen and Clyde M. Reed, who would both go on to serve as governor of Kansas.

<text>Dighton is a city in and the county seat of Lane County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 960. Dighton is named for Dick Dighton, a surveyor.

==History==

===19th century===
The Homestead Act of 1862 offered of land in the American West, previously owned by railroads, to homesteaders who could live on the land for five years. Drawn west by the promise of free, fertile land, pioneer settlers arrived in Kansas starting in 1869. In 1879, W.A. Watson arrived at the town site, and a post office was established. In 1885, there were three houses and seven voters in town. Lane County became a county in 1886, with Dighton as its county seat. By 1900, the population was 194, and by 1910 it had grown to 370, and the town had banks; a flour mill; a grain elevator; two newspapers; public schools; a hotel; merchants; Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist churches; telegraph service; a band and telephones.

Life was difficult for the early pioneers, who built houses made of sod and found that the land was quite dry, and not as fertile as they had been led to believe. A song written by Frank Baker, the &quot;Lane County Bachelor&quot;, became a popular folk song throughout the western United States.

===20th century===
On May 23, 1928, the Fleagle Gang arrived in Dighton after robbing the First National Bank of Lamar, Colorado. Needing medical attention, they kidnapped local doctor W.W. Wineinger, and later shot him and dumped his body into a ravine.

The courtroom mural, &quot;The First House of Lane County,&quot; by Mary Alice Bosley, was featured in &quot;Kansas Murals: A Traveler&#x27;s Guide&quot;, by Jost and Loewenstein.

<text>Basehor is a city in Leavenworth County, Kansas, United States which is included statistically in the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,896. 

==History==
In exchange for extensive Delaware holdings in the state of Indiana, on September 24, 1829, the United States government ceded a large tract of land to the Delaware Indians. Basehor is built on a small part of this tract. The Delawares held this land, or at least parts of it, until the 1860s. On July 4, 1866, the Secretary of the Interior of the United States was offered for sale what was left of the Delaware lands, then referred to as the Delaware Diminished Reserve, for not less than $2.50 per acre. The Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company subsequently bought all of the remaining land on January 7, 1886.

The first individuals to own the land upon which Basehor now stands were Thomas Salem and Mary Z. Towne (though William Henery Lewis, who surveyed for the railroad, bought an extensive plot of land to the northeast of Basehor around 1861 and homesteaded it right after the Civil War). The couple bought it from the railroad in 1873 and mortgaged it to Ephraim Basehor the same year. On January 9, 1874, the Townes sold the to Basehor. Ephriam and Reuben&#x27;s nephew William Mast later moved to Basehor and in 1896 married Margaret Towne, the daughter of the couple from whom they had purchased the land.

Basehor was founded in 1889 by Reuben Basehor and his brother Ephraim. They both were of Pennsylvania Dutch descent and came to Kansas in 1854. After living in Lawrence for a time, Ephraim began working as a hired hand for an area farmer. He eventually bought the farm and other land holdings in the area.

In 1889, the railroad was completed, and Ephraim plotted his land and began building the town site. It was dedicated on November 30, 1889, and was named after Basehor.

Ephraim Basehor donated the land for the schoolhouse around 1900. The old grade school was located north of town and was originally called the Prairie Garden District #32. The first high school classes in the community met in 1905 above the Kemler-Hammond General Store. In 1906, a building was erected to house the high school and grade school. It was built for K–12 on the southeast corner of 155th Street and Leavenworth Road. The high school was upstairs, and K–8 was located in the three classrooms downstairs. In 1929, five students graduated.

Reuben Basehor donated $1,000 to the school to build a library. With this donation, a concrete structure was built east of the old school. After many years of disuse, the library building was moved to the city park in June, 2016. A new two-story brick high school was built as a WPA project in 1938. The grade-school classes continued to be held in the old building until a new grade school was built in 1955. By 1963, a new high school was built, and the older building was taken over by the top two grades of the grade school. In 2008, the community built a new library on 158th St.

<text>Linwood is a city in Leavenworth County, Kansas, United States, and part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 415. It is located along K-32 highway between Lawrence and Bonner Springs.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Linwood was founded as Journeycake, named after Charles Journeycake, the last Delaware chief. People occasionally made fun of the name Journeycake by calling it &quot;Johnny Cake.&quot; The community was platted on both sides of Stranger Creek, near the creek&#x27;s mouth at the Kansas River.

In May 1860, a treaty was signed at Sarcoxieville, northeast of Linwood, by Chief Sarcoxie of the Delaware and by the United States. After the treaty&#x27;s signature, each member of the tribe was assigned a parcel of land, and the balance of the tribe&#x27;s territories were sold to the predecessor of the Union Pacific Railroad. Meanwhile, the U.S. government established a trading post near Stranger Creek until the tribe was moved to the Indian Territory in 1867. Located beside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, the trading post became the first school in the community.

===Union Pacific Railroad===
In September 1863, the Union Pacific Railroad began building the main line westward across the Great Plains from Kansas City, Kansas, to Denver, Colorado. This was the long-line railroad in Kansas for 2–3 years. The first were opened in 1864 from Wyandotte (now a suburb of Kansas City) to Lawrence. William A. Harris moved to Kansas in 1865 employed as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1868 it became the Kansas Pacific Railroad.

===Name change===
The original community of Journeycake was officially platted as Stranger on July 11, 1867, and recorded at the Leavenworth County Courthouse. When the name Stranger became a problem for the Postal Service. who confused Stranger with a nearby community also named Stranger (referred to as &quot;Big&quot; Stranger), it was renamed Linwood on December 20, 1877. Legend has it that one day when the citizens were cutting wood for the church, Colonel Loring suggested they change the name to Linwood, because of the many linden trees that grew in the area. But, according to the Kansas Historical Collections, the community of Stranger had its name changed to Linwood by Senator William A. Harris because of his great appreciation for the Linden trees that were abundant in the vicinity of Stranger Creek.

===Senator Harris===
William A. Harris moved to Kansas in 1865 and worked as a civil engineer for the Union Pacific Railroad until 1868, when he moved to Lawrence, Kansas. He was appointed agent for the railroad companies in the sale of the Delaware Reservation and other lands. In 1884, Harris became a prominent citizen of Linwood, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits and stock raising. He bought about of land just west of Linwood. On a high hill within sight of the city he built a modest two-story mansion with fifteen rooms, the Harris House. Harris was elected as a Democratic Congressman to the Fifty-third Congress (1893–1895) and as a Populist to the U.S. Senate (1897–1903). He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Kansas in 1906. Harris died in 1909, and is buried in Lawrence, Kansas.

===Relocation===
Much of Linwood&#x27;s commerce came from the sawmills on the river, as the city had grown very near the banks of the Kansas River (known as the “Kaw” River) that flows eastward to the Missouri. After the 1903 flood damaged and endangered much of Linwood, the city was relocated about one mile (1.6 km) north to its present location out of “the bottoms” (as they are still known today) near the river.

===21st century===

Present-day Linwood is a small city that is accessed mainly from , as the Golden Road bridge over Stranger Creek collapsed in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt. Currently, the city has less than 400 people. Since 2019, numerous new homes have been built drawing new families. Linwood has several businesses including a gas station, tavern, landscaping company, salsa plant and a Dollar General retail store. Linwood is home to one of the Basehor-Linwood Elementary Schools, while the Basehor-Linwood Middle and High Schools are located in Basehor.

===2019 tornado===

On May 28, 2019, an EF4 tornado with Doppler windspeed measurements of over 187 mph struck the outlying areas of the city and severely damaged homes. At least 13 injuries were reported due to the storm. The city itself was spared any major damage, with just the occasional roof damage and loss of trees and fencing.

<text>Lincoln Center, more commonly known as Lincoln, is a city in and the county seat of Lincoln County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,171.

==History==

Settler George Green founded the town of Lincoln in 1870, naming it after the county. &quot;Center&quot; was added to its name to indicate its location in the central part of the county. County residents initially voted to place the county seat in Lincoln Center. Elections in November 1870 resulted in the seat relocating to nearby Abram, sparking a county seat war. Another vote in February 1872 reversed the switch, and Lincoln Center again became the county seat. Residents relocated all the buildings in Abram to Lincoln, merging the two communities. The town was incorporated as the city of Lincoln Center in 1879, and is officially referred to as such in the United States Census. Both the city government and local chamber of commerce refer to the city as Lincoln, and it appears as such on state maps and signs.

Lincoln grew rapidly over the following decade, more than doubling in size, and the city gradually modernized. Kansas Christian College opened in Lincoln in 1885. The Union Pacific Railroad opened a branch line through the city in 1886, bringing mail service. In 1900, after the previous courthouse burned down, a new one was built out of native limestone known locally as post rock. Rural mail delivery began in 1904, and telephony service began in 1905. In 1906, the city&#x27;s first power plant opened, providing electric power. Beginning in the 1920s, the mechanization of agriculture reduced the need for farm work and commercial farming operations gradually consolidated family farms, resulting in a reduction in the population. By 1950, the state highway commission had completed K-14 and K-18 through Lincoln.

In 1989, given the widespread, long-standing use of post rock limestone in local building construction, the Kansas Legislature named Lincoln County as &quot;The Post Rock Capital of Kansas&quot;.

In the past, Lincoln has offered free residential lots to entice people to move to Lincoln. This program was suspended in 2024.

==Geography==

<text>La Cygne (pronounced ) is a city in Linn County, Kansas, United States, and situated along the Marais des Cygnes River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,050. The city is named after the Marais des Cygnes River which is a French translation of an Osage appellation meaning &quot;marsh of the swans&quot;.

==History==
La Cygne was founded in 1869 as soon as the people were assured of the building of a track for the Missouri River, Ft. Scott &amp; Gulf Railroad. A town company was organized and purchased of land, but had only laid out as a town site. La Cygne was incorporated on January 14, 1870, and a board of trustees was appointed. In the fall of that year the town had grown so that it had inhabitants enough to organize as a city of the third class, and F. A. Foote was elected the first mayor. The first school was taught in 1869 in Cady&#x27;s hall. It was a private subscription school and was kept open until 1870, when the public school house was built. It was a commodious two-story brick building containing the graded and high schools. The Methodist church organized in 1870 and soon after built a house of worship. The Presbyterian church was organized the same year but had no building for a year afterward.

At an early date La Cygne became a manufacturing point. A flour mill was built in 1870; a bank was started in 1871; the La Cygne organ factory was another early commercial enterprise, but it did not flourish. In 1881 a coal mine was opened, after which it became an important point for the industry. The first newspaper in the town was the &quot;Weekly Journal&quot;, which first appeared in June 1870.

The suspicious death of Alonzo Brooks in 2004 was featured in the fourth episode &quot;No Ride Home&quot; of the fifteenth season of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; TV series in 2020.

==History==


Located on upland prairie, Emporia was founded in 1857, drawing its name from ancient Carthage, a place known in history as a prosperous center of commerce.

In 1864 the Union Pacific Railway, Southern Branch (later incorporated into the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad) received land grants to build from Fort Riley to Emporia. The road eventually reached Emporia in 1869, becoming the first railroad to serve the burgeoning town. In July 1870, a second railroad, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached Emporia, and in the years following the American Civil War the city became a booming railroad hub. In 1888, railroad executive and educator John Byers Anderson donated his personal library to the College of Emporia to commemorate his 50th wedding anniversary, and his former mentee Andrew Carnegie donated additional funds to build a library in Anderson&#x27;s honor (conditioned upon the new college paying off its mortgage).

In 1953, Emporia was the site of the first Veterans Day observance in the United States. At the urging of local shoe cobbler Alvin J. King, U.S. Representative Edward Rees introduced legislation in The United States Congress to rename Armistice Day as Veterans Day. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on October 8, 1954.

For millennia, the land that is currently Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, the United States secured most of modern Kansas as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, Congress organized the Kansas Territory and in 1861, Kansas became the 34th state.

In 1863, by Act of Congress and similarly by an act of the State of Kansas, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was granted 3,000,000 acres of Kansas land on the condition that it would build a continuous line to the western border of Kansas by March 1, 1873. On Oct. 30, 1868, construction began at Topeka. By Sept. 14, 1870, the first Santa Fe train reached Emporia, fifteen miles past the present site of Reading. James Fagan, agent for the railroad lands, and T. J. Peter and M. S. Sargent, who represented the railroad interest, organized a town company, with James Fagan as president. The land was owned by McMann &amp; Co., of Reading, Pennsylvania. The town was platted on sixty acres of Section 3, Township 18, Range 13, and called it Reading, after Reading, Pennsylvania. In summer 1870, the town site was surveyed.

<text>Burns is a city in Marion County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 234. The city name came from a nearby train station, which was named prior to the city being incorporated. It is located between El Dorado and Florence along the west side of U.S. Route 77 highway. The southern edge of the city is the border between Marion and Butler counties.
==History==
===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Burns.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado, and a station called Burns was built north of the present city location. In 1881, the rail line was extended to Douglass, then later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence through Burns to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence through El Dorado to Arkansas City.

At the present location, a city named St. Francis was platted in August 1880. When the town incorporated, they discovered the official city name of St. Francis was already taken, so they changed the name to be the same as the nearby Burns train station, then soon afterward the station was moved into the new city. The original station was named after a railroad company official.

A post office was established in Burns on November 30, 1880.

===20th century===
Burns High School was closed in 1965 as a result of statewide school district consolidation. Burns Elementary &amp; Junior High School closed in 1997 due to the lack of funds. Education is currently provided by Peabody–Burns USD 398 public school district in Peabody.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed 6.5 miles west of Burns, north to south through Marion County, with much controversy over road damage, tax exemption, and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs). A pumping station named &quot;Burns&quot; was built two miles north of Potwin.

On August 15. 2023 police chief Joel Justice Womochil was arrested for possessing child pornography. He had been chief since February 8, 2022 but resigned on August 8.

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase for .

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Marion County near the current cities of Florence, Marion, Durham.

Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

A post office was established in Durham Park on June 22, 1874 (near current Cottonwood Grove Christian School northwest of Durham), then it was moved to the community of Durham on September 19, 1887 around the time the new railroad was built through the area.
