<text>Bishop (formerly Bishop Creek) is the most populous and only incorporated city in Inyo County, California, United States. It is located near the northern end of the Owens Valley within the Mojave Desert, at an elevation of . The city was named after Bishop Creek, flowing out of the Sierra Nevada range; the creek was named after Samuel Addison Bishop, a settler in the Owens Valley. Bishop is a commercial and residential center, while many vacation destinations and tourist attractions in the Sierra Nevada are located nearby. The city covers approximately , making it the county&#x27;s largest community by population and land area.

The population of the city was 3,879 at the 2010 census, up from 3,575 at the 2000 census. The population of the built-up zone containing Bishop is much larger; more than 14,500 people live in a compact area which includes Bishop, West Bishop, Dixon Lane-Meadow Creek, and the Bishop Paiute Reservation. It is by far the largest settlement in Inyo County.

A number of western films were shot in Bishop, including movies starring John Wayne, Charlton Heston, and Joel McCrea.

==History==
The Bishop Creek post office operated from 1870 to 1889 and from 1935 to 1938. The first Bishop post office opened in 1889.

In order to support the growth aspirations of Los Angeles, water was diverted from the Owens River into the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. From the 1910s to 1930s, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased much of the valley for water rights and control. The result was a substantial change to the Owens Valley culture and environment. The economy of Bishop suffered when farmers, ranchers and land owners sold much of their property. Jack Foley, a Bishop resident and sound effects specialist, mitigated the economic loss by persuading several Los Angeles studio bosses that the town of Bishop would be ideal as a location to shoot westerns.

===History and heritage===

The city of Bishop was named for one of the first European settlers in the area, Samuel A. Bishop. Owens Lake was named for Richard Owens, a member of John C. Fremont&#x27;s 1845 exploration party which included Kit Carson and Ed Kern. Later the entire valley became known as The Owens Valley (see First Settlers below). The Paiute Indians called Owens Lake by the name of &quot;Pacheta&quot; and the Owens River &quot;Wakopee.&quot; Geographically, Inyo County is today the second largest county in California with a population of slightly over 18,000 residents. The county is so large that several eastern states put together would fit neatly within its boundaries. Inyo County contains both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States; Mt. Whitney, above sea level, and Badwater in Death Valley, below sea level. The &quot;Inyo&quot; in Inyo County is commonly believed to be a Paiute word meaning &quot;dwelling place of the great spirit,&quot; although some scholars are now convinced that it is a mistranslation of the word &quot;Indio&quot;, which is Spanish for Indian. It is possible that the Paiute were trying to explain to the earliest English speaking settlers in the Owens Valley that this was their land by using a form of &quot;Indio&quot; they had learned from other Indian tribes, who in turn, had learned it from the Spanish or Mexicans, not realizing that not all Europeans spoke the same language. Thus Inyo may actually mean &quot;Indian Land.&quot;

===First American settlers===
The first American explorers in the Owens Valley of Eastern California included the famous mountain men Jedediah Smith in 1833 and Joseph Walker in 1834. This remote area of California had never been explored by the Spanish and even though it was shown as Mexican territory on early maps, the Eastern Sierra region remained unvisited by them. 

The most renowned early explorer to visit the area was John C. Fremont. He was the first Republican candidate to run for President of the United States in 1856 and later a famous Union Civil War general. Officially sanctioned by the federal government, his 1845 mapping party to the Eastern Sierra included the celebrated Indian scout Kit Carson, for whom the capital of Nevada, Carson City, was named. Also in the party were Ed Kern for whom Kern County, California was named, and Richard Owens, who gave his name to Owens Lake near Lone Pine, California and later Owens Valley itself. Fremont lost a cannon which he had brought along in case of Indian attacks near present-day Bridgeport, California (about north of Bishop).

The city of Bishop came into being due to the need for beef in a booming mining camp some eighty miles to the north, Aurora, Nevada, (Aurora was believed to be on the California side of the border at that time and was the county seat of Mono County, California). In 1861 cattlemen drove herds of cattle some three hundred miles from the great San Joaquin Valley of California, through the southern Sierra at Walker Pass, up the Owens Valley, and then through Adobe Meadows to Aurora. Along the way, some cattlemen noticed that the unsettled northern Owens Valley was perfect for raising livestock.

To avoid the long journey from the other side of the mountains, a few of them decided to settle in the valley. Driving about 600 head of cattle and 50 horses, Samuel Addison Bishop, his wife, and several hired hands arrived in the Owens Valley on August 22, 1861 from Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains. Along with Henry Vansickle, Charles Putnam, Allen Van Fleet, and the McGee brothers, Bishop was one of the first white settlers in the valley.

Sheepmen soon followed the cattlement and they initially struggled due to a lack of forage for their stock in the area. Remnants of the early settlers&#x27; stone corrals and fences can still be seen north of Bishop along Highway 395 in Round Valley, California (barb wire fencing was not invented until 1873). Establishing a homestead, the San Francis Ranch, along the creek which still bears his name, Samuel Bishop set up a market to sell beef to the miners and business owners in Aurora. One of the residents of Aurora at that time was a young Samuel Clemens who later gained fame as author Mark Twain (see Twain&#x27;s book Roughing It for his comments on the area). By 1862, a frontier settlement (and later town), known as Bishop Creek, was established a couple of miles east of the San Francis Ranch. Though the town continues to prosper, the only reminder of Samuel Bishop&#x27;s ranch today is a monument placed near the original site at the corner of Highway 168 West and Red Hill Road, two miles west of downtown Bishop.
In 1866, the County of Inyo was established from part of Tulare County. The Eastern High Sierra and the Owens Valley was the westernmost frontier in America at that time. In 1871, Daniel Bruhn was one of 41 wranglers herding nearly 3,000 wild Spanish mustangs from Stockton, California to Texas. Their travels brought them over the High Sierra and into the remote Owens Valley, where they lost over 500 head of horses. The descendants of those mustangs still roam wild on the California/Nevada border just north of Bishop.

===Water conflicts of the Owens Valley===

As Los Angeles expanded during the late 19th century, it began outgrowing its water supply. Fred Eaton, mayor of Los Angeles, promoted a plan to take water from Owens Valley, where Bishop lies, to Los Angeles via an aqueduct. Between 1905 and 1907, most of the land in the Owens Valley was purchased from farmers and ranchers at bargain prices by Eaton, ostensibly for a his own use. The real goal was to send Owens Valley water south to Los Angeles. In 1907, Eaton traveled to Washington to meet with advisers of Theodore Roosevelt to convince them that the water of the Owens River would do more good flowing through faucets in Los Angeles than it would if used on Owens Valley fields and orchards. Despite a political fight with Congressman Sylvester Smith, who represented the area around Bishop, Roosevelt decided in favor of the aqueduct.

The aqueduct was built from 1907 to 1913 under the supervision of William Mullholland. The aqueduct is long, used no pumping stations; only gravity siphons. By 1928, Los Angeles owned 90 percent of the water in Owens Valley and agriculture interests in the region were effectively dead. With the diversion of water to Los Angeles, the Owens Lake and lower Owens River dried up, forcing many valley residents to leave the area. For a number of years, Owens Valley residents expressed much animosity toward the city of Los Angeles; for example, in Dry Ditches, a book of poems published in 1934 by the Parcher family of Bishop. The Owens Valley–city of Los Angeles conflict was the inspiration of the 1974 film Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson.

===Native American cultural heritage===

Indigenous peoples live in and near Bishop on four reservations. The southernmost is the Lone Pine Indian Reservation; northward is Fort Independence Reservation and Big Pine Indian Reservation. The largest and northernmost is the Bishop Indian Reservation.

==Geography==
Bishop lies west of the Owens River at the northern end of the Owens Valley. The city is located on U.S. Route 395, the main north–south artery through the Owens Valley, connecting the Inland Empire to Reno, Nevada. US 395 also connects Bishop to Los Angeles via State Route 14 through Palmdale. Bishop is the western terminus of U.S. Route 6. The Paiute-Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community of the Bishop Colony control land just west of the town. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) controls much of the upstream and surrounding area.

Bishop is immediately to the east of the Sierra Nevada, and west of the White Mountains. Numerous peaks are within a short distance of Bishop, including Mount Humphreys () to the west, White Mountain Peak () to the northeast, and pyramidal Mount Tom () northwest of town. Basin Mountain () is viewed to the west from Bishop as it rises above the Buttermilks. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 97% of it land. Bishop is known as the &quot;Mule Capital of the World&quot; and a week-long festival called Bishop Mule Days has been held since 1969 during the week of Memorial Day, celebrating the contributions of pack mules to the area. The festival attracts many tourists, primarily from the Southern California area.

Bishop is well known in the rock climbing community. Near the city are numerous climbing spots that attract visitors from around the world. There are over 2,000 bouldering locations in Bishop. The two main types of rock are volcanic tuff (at the Happy and Sad boulders) and granite (at the Buttermilks).

<text>Darwin is an unincorporated mining community and Census-designated place in Inyo County, California, United States. It is located southeast of Keeler. The population was 43 at the 2010 census, down from 54 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The town is named after Darwin French (1822–1902), a local rancher, miner, and explorer. 

According to Erwin Gudde, French of Fort Tejon was with a party of prospectors in the area during the fall of 1850. French also led a party into Death Valley in 1860 to search for the mythical Gunsight Lode via the local wash, lending his first name to the wash, canyon, and future town.

Silver and lead discovery at the place led to the founding of a settlement in 1874. A post office opened in 1875, closed for a time in 1902, and remains open. The town prospered when Eichbaum Toll Road opened in 1926, opening Death Valley from the west. When Death Valley became a National Monument in 1933, it was decided to buy the toll road to allow free access to the new park. In 1937, a new cutoff bypassed Darwin, isolating the town.

The town was the subject of a 2011 documentary film &quot;Darwin&quot;. In April 2012, BBC News featured a video of local residents describing their wishes to replace dial-up Internet access with broadband.

<text>Keeler, formerly known as Hawley, is an unincorporated community in Inyo County, California, United States. Keeler is located on the east shore of Owens Lake south-southeast of New York Butte. The population was 71 people at the 2020 census, up from 66 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Keeler as a census-designated place (CDP).

==History==
When the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake rendered the pier in nearby Swansea inaccessible by uplifting the shoreline, a new pier was constructed to the south at a community named Hawley. In 1880 a new mill was constructed at Hawley by the Owens Lake Mining and Milling Company for processing silver ore from the Cerro Gordo Mines in the mountains to the east. A town was laid out by the company agent Julius M. Keeler, for whom the town of Hawley was later renamed.

The steamship &quot;Bessie Brady&quot; brought ore from Keeler across the lake to the town of Cartago. There was a at Keeler, and the steamship route cut days off the time a freight wagon would have taken to circle the lake. She carried 700 ingots at a time in a three-hour crossing, but in 1882 the &quot;Bessie Brady&quot; was destroyed by fire. The Carson and Colorado Railroad constructed a narrow-gauge railway to Keeler in 1883. The success of the Cerro Gordo mines caused Keeler to boom until silver prices plummeted in the late 19th century.

A second boom of zinc mining in the early 20th century brought new life to the town and an aerial cable tramway was built to bring the ore from Cerro Gordo to Keeler. There were small surges in the mining of silver, lead, zinc and limestone, but by the 1950s all mining had ceased. Train service was stopped in 1960 and the tracks were removed in 1961. Water exports from the Owens Valley to the City of Los Angeles in the 1920s led the Owens Lake to eventually dry up, causing alkali dust storms to blow through Keeler, driving many residents away. Dust remediation efforts in the early 21st century reduced this problem, but few residents remain.

A post office operated at Keeler from 1883 to 1898 and is still operating today.

There is a California Historical Landmark in Keeler for the furnace of the Owens Lake Silver Company.

<text>Lone Pine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Inyo County, California, United States, located south-southeast of Independence. The population was 2,035 at the 2010 census, up from 1,655 at the 2000 census. The town is located in the Owens Valley, near the Alabama Hills and Mount Whitney, between the eastern peaks of the Sierra Nevada to the west and the Inyo Mountains to the east. The local hospital, Southern Inyo Hospital, offers standby emergency services. The town is named after a solitary pine tree that once existed at the mouth of Lone Pine Canyon. On March 26, 1872, the very large Lone Pine earthquake destroyed most of the town and killed 27 of its 250 to 300 residents.

==History==
The Paiute Indians inhabited the Owens Valley area from prehistoric times. These early inhabitants are known to have established trading routes which extended to the Pacific Central Coast, delivering materials originating in the Owens Valley to such tribes as the Chumash.

A cabin was built here during the winter of 1861–62. A settlement developed over the following two years. The Lone Pine post office opened in 1870.

On March 26, 1872, at 2:30 am, Lone Pine experienced a violent earthquake that destroyed most of the town. At the time, the town consisted of 80 buildings made of mud and adobe; only 20 structures were left standing. As a result of the quake, which formed Diaz Lake, a total of 26 people lost their lives. A mass grave located just north of town commemorates the site of the main fault. One of the few remaining structures pre-dating the earthquake is the -thick &quot;Old Adobe Wall&quot; located in the alley behind the Lone Star Bistro, a coffee house.

During the 1870s, Lone Pine was an important supply town for several nearby mining communities, including Kearsarge, Cerro Gordo, Keeler, Swansea, and Darwin. The Cerro Gordo mine high in the Inyo Mountains was one of the most productive silver mines in California. The silver was carried in ore buckets on a strong cable to Keeler, and then transported northwest to smelter ovens at Swansea. To supply the necessary building materials and fuel for these operations, a sawmill was constructed near Horseshoe Meadows by Colonel Sherman Stevens that produced wood for the smelters and the mines. The wood was moved by flume to the valley, where it was burned in adobe kilns to make charcoal, which was then transported by steamships across Owens Lake to the smelters at Swansea, about south of Lone Pine.

Railroads played a major role in the development of Lone Pine and the Owens Valley. In 1883, the Carson and Colorado Railway line was constructed from Belleville, Nevada, across the White Mountains to Benton, and then down into the Owens Valley where it ended in Keeler. The arrival of the C&amp;C rail line, with its engine &quot;The Slim Princess&quot;, and the stagecoach in Keeler were a major economic boost for the area. Twice a week, passengers arrived on the evening train, spent the night at the Lake View Hotel (later renamed the Hotel Keeler), and then took the stage the following morning to Mojave. A short line to the north connected with the Virginia and Truckee Railroad line at Mound House, Nevada.

In 1920, the history of Lone Pine was dramatically altered when a movie production company came to the Alabama Hills to make the silent film &quot; The Round-Up&quot;. Other companies soon discovered the scenic location, and in the coming decades, over 400 films, 100 television episodes, and countless commercials have used Lone Pine and the Alabama Hills as a film location. Notable films shot here in the 1920s and 1930s include &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1925) with Tom Mix, &quot;The Enchanted Hill&quot; (1926) with Jack Holt, &quot;Somewhere in Sonora&quot; (1927) with Ken Maynard, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; (1934) with John Wayne, &quot;Hop-Along Cassidy&quot; (1935) with William Boyd, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936) with Errol Flynn, &quot;Oh, Susanna!&quot; (1936) with Gene Autry, &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; (1936) with Bing Crosby, &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; (1938) with Gary Cooper, &quot;Under Western Stars&quot; (1938) with Roy Rogers, and &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939) with Cary Grant.

In the coming decades, Lone Pine and the Alabama Hills continued to be used as the setting for Western films, including &quot;West of the Pecos&quot; (1945) with Robert Mitchum, &quot;Thunder Mountain&quot; (1947) with Tim Holt, &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; (1950) with Gregory Peck, &quot;The Nevadan&quot; (1950) with Randolph Scott, &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955) with Spencer Tracy, &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; (1960) with Audie Murphy, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) with James Stewart, &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966) with Steve McQueen, &quot;Joe Kidd&quot; (1972) with Clint Eastwood, &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994) with Mel Gibson, and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013) with Johnny Depp. Through the years, non-Western films also used the unique landscape of the area, including Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) with Robert Cummings, &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949) with Hedy Lamarr, &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989) with William Shatner, &quot;Tremors&quot; (1990) with Kevin Bacon, &quot;The Postman&quot; (1997) with Kevin Costner, and &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000) with Russell Crowe.

The most important movie filmed in and around Lone Pine is director Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), starring Humphrey Bogart as Roy Earle in the role that moved Bogart from respected supporting player to leading man. Cast and crew lodged in Lone Pine, and Walsh shot various scenes in and around Lone Pine. For the film&#x27;s mountain chase scenes, Walsh took everyone to nearby Mt. Whitney, where pack mules lugged camera equipment up the mountainside: &quot;filming began just outside Lone Pine ... on August 5, 1940. ... On a slope at the side of Mt. Whitney, ... a group of twenty men from the studio worked for four days to clear a path so that mountain-trained mules, packing cameras and other equipment, could get up to the shooting area. ... Bogart had to run three miles up a mountainside for two days ... Walsh ordered all the big boulders removed from the path of [Bogart&#x27;s] final fall, but the little ones remained, and Bogart complained about that plenty ... Bogie especially did not want to trek up that mountain. This was the shoot on which Walsh gave him the nickname &#x27;Bogey the Beefer&#x27;&quot;. John Huston wrote the screenplay, and Ida Lupino co-starred.
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, President Roosevelt signed an executive order that required people of Japanese ancestry living along the Pacific coast to be placed into relocation camps. One of these camps, Manzanar, was built north of Lone Pine.

==Geography==

Lone Pine is situated in the Owens Valley with the picturesque Alabama Hills lying to the west. Their unique appearance has attracted many film companies over the years. The hills were named in 1862 by Southern sympathisers, commemorating the victories of the Confederate ship CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;.

As the crow flies, Lone Pine is due east of Fresno. However, there is no road crossing the Sierra Nevada to provide access from Lone Pine to Fresno. As a result, the closest accessible large city is Bakersfield, nearly away.

===Film history at Lone Pine===

The Lone Pine Film History Museum, supported by Beverly and Jim Rogers, highlights the area&#x27;s frequent appearances in Hollywood feature films. The Alabama Hills west of town are frequently used as a filming location for Western movies. Since the early years of filmmaking, directors and their production units have used the Lone Pine area to represent the iconic American West. Approaching the 100th anniversary of &quot;The Roundup&quot; (1920), the first documented film produced in the area, Lone Pine has played host to hundreds of the industry&#x27;s best-known directors and actors, among them directors William Wyler, John Ford, George Stevens, and William Wellman, and actors John Wayne, Bing Crosby, Gene Autry, Clint Eastwood, Barbara Stanwyck, and Jeff Bridges. The Whitney Portal road was used in the film &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941) with Humphrey Bogart, which culminated with a shoot-out between Bogart&#x27;s character and the police, at the foot of Mount Whitney. The classic &quot;Bad Day at Black Rock&quot; (1955), starring Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan and Anne Francis, was also filmed in and around the Lone Pine area. Lone Pine is also the location of several scenes in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (2008), depicting Afghanistan, and in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; (2014) remake, as a temporary military forward operating base (&quot;FOB&quot;).

Barbara Stanwyck in accordance with her wishes had her cremated remains and ashes scattered from a helicopter over Lone Pine, California, where she had made some of her western films.

The Forum Theater is a theater-cafe that hosts live music, theater, and films at weekends. The Lone Pine Film Festival has been held every year since 1989 to celebrate the rich heritage that filmmakers have brought to the area over the years.

<text>Olancha (Timbisha: &quot;Pakwa&#x27; si&quot;) is a census designated place in Inyo County of the U.S. state of California. Olancha is located on U.S. Route 395 in California, south-southeast of Independence. As of the 2010 census, the population was 192, up from 134 at the 2000 census.

Located in the Owens Valley next to the now mostly dry Owens Lake, the arid settlement is home to a major bottled water plant for Crystal Geyser Natural Alpine Spring Water.

==Geography==

Olancha is an unincorporated community located in the Owens Valley on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range at the elevation of , in Inyo County, California. It is on US Highway 395 near the junction of State Route 190, approximately due north of Los Angeles. Owens Lake - a dry saline lakebed - lies to the northeast of Olancha. Olancha Creek flows from the slopes of nearby Olancha Peak (12,123 ft), passing near the town of Olancha, and finally towards Owens Lake. To the east of town lie some sand dunes, as well as a hot spring known as &quot;Dirty Socks&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , over 99% of it land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Olancha has a cold semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps due to it being in the rainshadow of the Sierra Nevada.

==History==
Olancha was established by Minnard Farley, who came to the area in 1860 and discovered silver ore in the nearby Coso Range. The name &quot;Olancha&quot; is believed to be derived from the nearby Yaudanche tribe. For processing the ore, he built a stamp mill just south of Olancha Creek. The remains of a stone wall from this mill still exists and has been designated as a California Historical Site (marker #796).

The first post office at Olancha opened in 1870.

On August 11, 1969, Manson Family members Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson and Dianne &quot;Snake&quot; Lake settled down in Olancha two days after Watson had stabbed Sharon Tate to death. Here, Watson bought a newspaper revealing that it still was a mystery who committed the Manson murders and confessed to Lake: &quot;I killed her, Charlie (Manson) ordered me to do so, it was fun&quot;. This fact was witnessed by Lake during the Watson trial in 1971. Lake was shortly put into custody in Independence after complaints from Olancha inhabitants for swimming nude. After a few weeks the two of them left Olancha for the final Manson hideout in Death Valley.

==California Historical Landmark==
Farley&#x27;s Olancha Mill Site is a California Historical Landmark number 796, assigned on September 16, 1964, on U.S. Route 395 in California in Olancha, California.

The California Historical Landmark reads:
:&quot;NO. 796 FARLEY&#x27;S OLANCHA MILL SITE - In 1860, while working for the Silver Mountain Mining Company in the Coso Mountains, M. H. Farley conceived the idea of building a processing mill on a creek that flowed into Owens Lake. He explored and named Olancha Pass that year, and by December 1862 had completed the first mill and furnace in the Owens River Valley, on Olancha Creek about one mile west of this marker.&quot;

<doc id="107517" wikidata="Q2090811" url="?curid=107517" title="Tecopa, California">
<text>Tecopa is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Mojave Desert in southeast Inyo County, California, United States. Originally occupied by the Koso and Chemehuevi Indians, Pioneers began populating what would become the CDP in the late 19th century to support nearby mines. It is now better known for the natural hot springs in the northern part of the CDP.

==Regional History==

The Old Spanish Trail and the later wagon road called the Old Mormon Road or Salt Lake Road, passed from Resting Springs, east of the modern site of Tecopa, 7 miles to Willow Creek (fed by Willow Spring within China Ranch Wash on the east bank of the canyon of the Amargosa River (then called Saleratus Creek)), south of Tecopa. In 1859, &quot;The Prairie Traveler&quot;, a popular handbook for overland travelers at that time described it: 
The spring is on the left of the road, and flows into Saleratus Creek. Animals must not be allowed to drink the Saleratus water.&quot; 

There the trail turned to follow the river south to Salt Springs.

China Ranch Wash is named for the Chinese man known as either Quon Sing or Ah Foo, who developed Willow Creek around 1900 and raised meat and vegetables to sell to the miners.

==History of the Community==

===Original Town===

In 1875 two brothers William D. and Robert D. Brown, had discovered lead and silver ore at what would become the Resting Springs Mining District and began promoting it. They established a townsite, calling it Brownsville, southeast of Resting Springs near the head of Willow Creek. Kasson, California was nearby. A camp was established at the site as mines were developed at Noonday Mine in the late 1870s. Jonas Osborne bought out the Browns, and renamed the townsite after Paiute leader Chief Tecopa. The camp grew into a town; in 1877 a post office began operating at there.

In 1878, it was determined that the townsite was 300 yards within Inyo county. Settling a dispute with San Bernardino County of who controlled the township. Soon thereafter, the town went into decline, with most of the miners moving to Resting Springs in July 1879. Inyo County Sheriff William Welch considered Tecopa a costly mistake because, &quot;it costs five cents a pound freight from San Bernardino here.&quot; The original townsite was occasionally occupied but never really revived and in 2006 the Amargosa Conservancy acquired it for preservation purposes 

The townsite is currently located in the vicinity of &quot;The Triangle&quot;, a small piece of land surrounded by the arms of three &quot;Y&#x27;s&quot; at the intersection of two roads. It was reestablished in 1907 when the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad reached the site, which was the closest point from the railroad to the mines. A post office opened at the new site in 1907, was closed in 1931, and reopened in 1932. A church, some homes and seasonal eating establishments are also located by the Triangle.

===Hot Springs===

The road heading north of the Triangle leads to the Hot Springs zone of the community where the State of California made indemnity selections in 1927. The State subsequently sold parcels to private citizens. In the early 1960s John Gregory Dunne documented that several low-income retirees were squatting in trailers within the zone.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) granted a 40 acre &quot;Recreational and Public Purposes&quot; (R&amp;PP) lease to Inyo County for County run facilities. The Hot Springs area is currently where the Community Center, Fire Station, Library, several tourist facilities and some homes are located.

===Tecopa Heights===

The Triangle is the west endpoint of the Old Spanish Trail (OST) Heading east, the OST Road passes Tecopa-Francis Elementary School (now closed) to the intersection with the Furnace Creek Road. Southwest of the intersection is most populous part of the community, originally known as &quot;Jackrabbit Flat.&quot; In the 1950&#x27;, the General Land Office, then the BLM began offering parcels under the authority of the &quot;Small Tract Act of 1938&quot; as recreational properties to become known as &quot;Jackrabbit Homesteads. The first round of five acre parcels were proofed and patented prior to 1959. After a change in policy second round of a few more parcels were offered at fair market value by BLM. The lands offered under the first two rounds remain largely undeveloped. The third round of 2.5 acre parcels were offered in 1964 to provide inexpensive land for housing retirees that were squatting at the Hot Springs. Seven parcels were sold, six of which were purchased by the Thilenius and Parrish families who subdivided them and developed water systems. Those parcels now constitute the densist population of what is now known as &quot;Tecopa Heights,&quot; the area offered under the Small Tracts Act. The cemetery is on the west side of Tecopa Heights.

Since Tecopa lacks proper water infrastructure that is capable of properly filtering ground water to state standards, the Southern Inyo County Fire Protection District in 2014 received a grant in order to install a water kiosk for the community, The community water kiosk was opened in 2017 east of Tecopa Heights on an R&amp;PP lease granted by the BLM.

==Geography==
In 1976, Congress designated the federal lands within the CDP part of the &quot;California Desert Conservation Area&quot; in Title VI, Section 601 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Tecopa is on the east side of the Amargosa Range which lies between the CDP and Death Valley, which was designated a National Park in the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 CDPA. The Nopah Range, designated Wilderness in the CDPA is to the east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.37%) is water.

==Economy==
Historically, Tecopa&#x27;s economy was based on silver and lead mining.

===In popular culture===
Tecopa was the subject of an article by John Gregory Dunne published in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and reprinted in Dunne&#x27;s book, &quot;Quintana &amp; Friends&quot;, published by Dutton in 1978.

<text>Arvin is a city in Kern County, California, United States. Arvin is located southeast of Bakersfield, at an elevation of . As of the 2010 census, the population was 19,304, up from 12,956 at the 2000 census.

In 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed Arvin as having the highest levels of smog of any community in the United States. The city&#x27;s level of ozone, smog&#x27;s primary component, exceeded the EPA&#x27;s acceptable limits on an average of 73 days per year between 2004 and 2006.

Wired telephone numbers in Arvin follow the format (661) 854-xxxx or (661) 855-xxxx and the ZIP Code is 93203.

==History==
Property sales of lots in present-day Arvin began in 1906. The Arvin Post Office was established in 1914 and the community incorporated as a city in 1960. The city was named after Arvin Richardson, who was the son of one of the original settling families from San Bernardino. Birdie Heard petitioned for the addition of the post office in 1914 and submitted proposed names, including Bear Mountain, Walnut, and Arvin. Officials in Washington, D.C., chose Arvin as it was the only proposed name which was not already in use in California. Birdie was the city&#x27;s first postmaster. She initially set up the post office in her living room, but it was later moved to the general store owned by the Staples family. The in-store post office was also the area&#x27;s first informal library until an official branch of the Kern County Library system was established in 1927.

Pedro Subia, a Mexican striker in the California agricultural strikes of 1933, was murdered at a strike in Arvin.

The Mountain View Oil Field, which underlies the town and much of the surrounding area, was discovered in 1933 and developed extensively in the 1930s. Many oil wells still surround the town; some are slant-drilled to reach formations directly underneath inhabited areas.

In the 1930s and 1940s the area east of Arvin became popular for recreational gliding and soaring, and the hillsides of the Tejon Ranch were used annually for a Western Soaring Championship in the spring. These significant events were later memorialized as a National Landmark of Soaring by the National Soaring Museum in 2000.

The &quot;Arvin Tiller&quot; started publication in 1939 and Arvin High School was built in 1949. The city was nearly destroyed on July 21, 1952, during the M7.3 Kern County earthquake (a rupture of the White Wolf Fault). Arvin suffered further damage on December 20, 1977, when a dust storm hit the area.

The Arvin Migratory Labor Camp was the first federally operated farm labor camp opened by the Farm Security Administration in 1937, one of many New Deal programs created during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt to respond to the Great Depression. This agricultural camp was considered a model, and was built by the Resettlement Administration.

==Economy==
The economy of Arvin is primarily based on agriculture, and as such the employment statistics show seasonal variation. In March 2011, 41.9 percent of Arvin&#x27;s residents were out of work, the highest of any city in Kern County.

===Cannabis===

In 2018, voters in Arvin passed a measure to license and tax marijuana after the legalization of the sale and distribution of cannabis in California was legalized. The measure set a 6% tax on cannabis sales and a tax of up to $6 per square foot per year on cultivation. The city issued its first license to a delivery service in June 2020. This was the first legal cannabis business in Kern County as similar measures have failed in other jurisdictions. Companies must be licensed by the local agency and the state to grow, test, or sell cannabis and each city or county may authorize none or only some of these activities. Local governments may not prohibit adults who are in compliance with state laws from growing, using, or transporting marijuana for personal use.

==Education==
The city of Arvin is served by the Arvin Union School District and the Kern High School District. Other nearby districts include Di Giorgio School District, Vineland School District, and the Lamont School District.

The Arvin Union School District consists of Sierra Vista Elementary School, Bear Mountain Elementary School, El Camino Real Elementary School, Haven Drive Middle School, and Arvin State Preschool. The land for the Haven Drive campus was acquired in 1943. Sierra Vista and Haven Drive are the two oldest schools in Arvin. The district serves preschool to eighth grade students. The Arvin Union School District also serves the community with the Arvin Family Resource Center.

The Kern High School District serves grades 9–12 in Arvin. It operates Arvin High School, which also services students from the surrounding rural areas and the nearby town of Lamont.

==Public safety==

The city of Arvin has its own police department. In January 2008, the city purchased six hybrid police vehicles with a grant by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. The city also purchased six hybrid SUVs in December 2008 with a grant by the San Joaquin Valley Air Quality District. Station 54 of the Kern County Fire Department is responsible for fire prevention services.

<text>Bakersfield is a city in and the county seat of Kern County, California, United States. The city covers about near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, which is located in the Central Valley region.

Bakersfield&#x27;s population as of the 2020 Census was 403,455, making it the 47th-most populous city in the United States and the 9th-most populous in California. The Bakersfield–Delano Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Kern County, had a 2020 census population of 909,235, making it the 62nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.

Bakersfield is a significant hub for both agriculture and energy production. Kern County is California&#x27;s most productive oil-producing county and the fourth most productive agricultural county (by value) in the United States. Industries in and around Bakersfield include natural gas and other energy extraction, mining, petroleum refining, distribution, food processing, and corporate regional offices. The city is the birthplace of the country music genre known as the Bakersfield sound.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of Native American settlements dating back thousands of years. Upon Spanish arrival, present-day Bakersfield was inhabited by the Yowlumne, a Yokuts people. Yowlumne accounts indicate that the village of Woilu was situated in the bounds of the present city.

The Yokuts of the region lived in lodges along the branches of the Kern River delta and hunted antelope, tule elk, deer, bear, fish, and game birds.

In 1776, Spanish missionary Francisco Garcés became the first European to explore the area. Recording his May 1 arrival to a Yokuts village along the Kern River, immediately northeast of present Bakersfield, Garcés wrote,

Given the remoteness and inaccessibility of the region, the Yokuts remained largely isolated from further contact until after the Mexican War of Independence, when Mexican settlers began to migrate to the area. Following the discovery of gold in California in 1848, settlers flooded into the San Joaquin Valley. In 1851, gold was discovered along the Kern River in the southern Sierra Nevada, and in 1865, oil was discovered in the valley. The Bakersfield area, once a tule reed-covered marshland, was first known as Kern Island to the handful of pioneers, who built log cabins there in 1860. The area was subject to periodic flooding from the Kern River, which occupied what is now the downtown area, and experienced outbreaks of malaria.

Bakersfield is the fifth-largest majority-Hispanic city in the United States, with 53% of its population being Hispanic in 2020.

=== Founding ===

In 1861, disastrous floods swept away the original settlement founded in 1860 by the German-born Christian Bohna. Among those attracted to the area by the California gold rush was Thomas Baker, a lawyer and former colonel in the militia of Ohio, his home state. Baker moved to the banks of the Kern River in 1863, at what became known as Baker&#x27;s Field, which became a stopover for travelers. By 1870, with a population of 600, what is now known as Bakersfield was becoming the principal town in Kern County.

In 1873, Bakersfield was officially incorporated as a city, and by 1874, it officially replaced the town of Havilah as the county seat. Alexander Mills was hired as the city marshal, a man one historian would describe as &quot;... an old man by the time he became Marshal of Bakersfield, and he walked with a cane. But he was a Kentuckian, a handy man with a gun, and not lacking in initiative and resource when the mood moved him.&quot; Businessmen and others began to resent Mills, who was cantankerous and high-handed in his treatment of them. Wanting to fire him but fearing reprisals, they devised a scheme to disincorporate, effectively leaving him without an employer. According to local historian Gilbert Gia the city was also failing to collect the taxes it needed for services. In 1876, The city voted to disincorporate. For the next 22 years, a citizen&#x27;s council managed the community.

By 1880, Bakersfield had a population of 801, with 250 of Chinese descent.

By 1890, it had a population of 2,626. Migration from Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Southern California brought new residents, who were mostly employed by the oil industry.

The city reincorporated on January 11, 1898.

=== Establishment of rail connection ===

In 1874, the Southern Pacific Railroad first arrived in Kern County. However, the train depot was placed nearly three miles east of Bakersfield due to a land dispute between the railroad and the town.

Desperate to get their own station, Bakersfield residents, sugar magnate Clause Spreckels, and small investors from all over the state ended up raising around $3,500,000 by January 17, 1895, to fund a second railroad to Bakersfield. By January 29, 1895, the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad was born. Dubbed the &quot;People&#x27;s Railroad,&quot; the project was completed and warmly welcomed by the town with a parade attended by thousands on May 27, 1898, amidst the Spanish-American War and over 20 years after the completion of Southern Pacific&#x27;s line. Competition from the new railroad caused Southern Pacific to lower its fares from $9.10 ($347.22 in 2023) to $6.90 ($263.27 in 2023) to match the new railroad&#x27;s fare.

Eventually, a streetcar line would connect the Santa Fe station to the Southern Pacific station in Sumner (now East Bakersfield).

However, while the track had reached Bakersfield in 1898, a station would not be constructed until 1899 due to the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad being purchased by Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe. The new station was located at the intersection of 15th Street and F Street and was demolished in 1972. It was replaced with the present day Bakersfield Station built in 2000, near Truxtun Avenue and S Street.

=== 1952 earthquake ===
On July 21, 1952, an earthquake struck at 4:52 am Pacific Daylight Time. The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale and was felt from San Francisco to the Mexican border, destroyed the nearby communities of Tehachapi and Arvin. The earthquake&#x27;s destructive force bent cotton fields into U shapes, slid a shoulder of the Tehachapi Mountains across all four lanes of the Ridge Route, collapsed a water tower, creating a flash flood, and destroyed the railroad tunnels in the mountain chain. Bakersfield was somewhat spared, experiencing minor architectural damage without loss of life.

A large aftershock occurred on July 29, causing minor architectural damage but raising fears that the flow of the Friant-Kern Canal could be dangerously altered, potentially flooding the city and surrounding areas.

Aftershocks continued for the next month, and on August 22 at 3:42 pm, another earthquake, measured at 5.8, struck directly under the city&#x27;s center in the most densely populated area of the southern San Joaquin Valley. Four people died in the aftershock, and many of the town&#x27;s historic structures sustained heavy damage.

=== 1970 to 2010 ===
Between 1970 and 2010, Bakersfield grew 400% (from 70,000 to 347,483), making it one of the fastest-growing cities in California.

Bakersfield&#x27;s close proximity to mountain passes, primarily the Tejon Pass on Interstate 5 between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Joaquin Valley, has made the city a regional transportation hub.

In 1990, Bakersfield was one of 10 U.S. communities to receive the All-America City Award from the National Civic League.

In 2010, the Bakersfield MSA had a gross metropolitan product of $29.466 billion, making it the 73rd-largest metropolitan economy in the United States.

=== Historic architecture and preservation ===

Bakersfield has several buildings and locations designated as historic sites at the national, state, and city levels. Five buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), including the First Baptist Church (NRHP 1/2/79); Baker Street Library (NRHP 4/1/81) and Bakersfield Californian Building (NRHP 3/10/83). Four sites have been designated as California Historical Landmarks, including Garces Memorial Circle (designated in 1937) and the Colonel Thomas Baker Memorial (designated in 1944). In addition, 16 sites have been locally designated on the Bakersfield Register of Historic Places, including the Fox Theater (designated 8/24/94) and Kern County Chamber of Commerce Building (designated 3/12/08). With only 16 sites on its local register (compared to more than 300 sites designated by the City of Fresno), Bakersfield has been criticized for its lack of focus on historic preservation.

== Geography ==

Bakersfield is located near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, with the southern tip of the Sierra Nevada just to the east. The city limits extend to the Sequoia National Forest, at the foot of the Greenhorn Mountain Range and the entrance to the Kern Canyon. To the south, the Tehachapi Mountains, rising more than a vertical mile, feature the historic Tejon Ranch. To the west is the Temblor Range, behind which is the Carrizo Plain National Monument and the San Andreas Fault. The Temblor Range is about from Bakersfield across the valley floor.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land (98.99%) and are covered by water (1.01%).

At the 2000 census, the city had a total area of , of which were land (98.86%) and were water-covered (1.14%).

Bakersfield is located about north of Los Angeles (about a 1-hour, 45-minute drive on I-5 and State Route 99) and about southeast of the state capital, Sacramento (about a 4-hour drive on State Route 99).

Hart Memorial Park is located in northeast Bakersfield along Alfred Harrell Highway.

=== Communities and neighborhoods ===

Bakersfield has historically referred to its regions by directional names. They include North Bakersfield, Northeast, Southeast, South Bakersfield, Southwest, and Northwest. East Bakersfield generally refers to the former town of Sumner (later renamed East Bakersfield). As a result, the Northeast wraps around East Bakersfield.

=== Climate ===
Bakersfield has a hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;), with sweltering, dry summers and winters that consist of mild days with chilly/cold nights. Rainfall is low in the city, averaging only annually, with most of it falling in the winter. Bakersfield averages about 191 clear days a year. Bakersfield&#x27;s climate makes the region suitable for growing crops ranging from carrots to citrus and almonds.

Bakersfield summers are sweltering with extended stretches of hot weather and 112 days per year with high temperatures of + (on average between April 18 and October 13); in addition, there are 36 days with highs of + (on average between June 2 and September 19), and 0.9 days with highs of +. The frequency of readings can significantly vary each year, with the record being 17 days in 1931. The most recent year to have more than five days of + temperature readings was 2017, with seven days reaching or exceeding . Temperatures can be highly variable throughout the spring, summer and fall months every year, with triple digit temperature readings in May, and on rare occasion April, and October in addition to occasional high temperatures below in June and September not being uncommon. The warmest month on record was July 2024, with an average temperature of . Except for occasional monsoons, which may bring light rain, typically no rain or almost no rain will fall from May to September.

Winters feature mild daytime temperatures and chilly/cold nights. Frost and/or dense fog usually occurs in winter with accompanying low visibility, causing many schools to have fog delays. Winters will usually produce a very dense layer of fog occasionally. Due to years of prolonged drought and the rapid development of many new neighborhoods around Bakersfield, the density of the fog and the number of &quot;fog days&quot; has steadily decreased. At the same time, areas outside the city still experience thick fog. The official time frame for tule fog to form is about five months long – various days from November 1 to March 31. Most noticeable in summer and winter, the urban heat island phenomenon can be observed throughout various neighborhoods in Bakersfield. Areas closer to downtown and along the 99 freeway corridor can experience warmer temperatures at night than neighborhoods on the edge of the city limits and rural Kern County areas, with temperature differences up to between these areas at any given time. On average, ten mornings have freezing lows (on average between December 14 and January 24) annually, and the coldest night of the year typically bottoms out below . On January 2, 2012, Bakersfield reached a record high of for that year&#x27;s winter.

Spring and fall typically feature mild to warm daytime high temperatures with cool nighttime low temperatures, but temperatures and precipitation can vary significantly depending on the year. More than 50 percent of Bakersfield&#x27;s annual precipitation falls between January and March, with the remainder falling during late fall and early winter.

Snow is rare on the valley floor, although frost may occur. The last snow fell on January 25, 1999, when the city received up to , with at the airport. The record maximum temperature was on July 28, 1908, and the record minimum temperature was on January 3, 1908. The most rainfall in one month was in December 2010, and the maximum 24-hour rainfall was on February 9, 1978. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; has been from July 1997 to June 1998 with and the driest from July 1933 to June 1934 with .
=== Air quality ===

Air quality is generally at its worst in fall and winter due to the California wildfire season and colder temperatures forming an inversion layer, respectively. It is common for an inversion layer to form in the valley in the winter, in which temperatures can be warmer in the foothills above the valley with the valley itself being cooler. This can trap air pollution in Bakersfield and the surrounding valley areas for days or even weeks. This can typically be mediated by rain or strong winds. Emissions from agriculture, industry, rail freight and road traffic together create significant concentrations of air pollution. The extraction of oil and gas, a historic industry in the area, contributes to the poor air quality. Returning flowing water to the Kern River and along with trees is promoted as a way to improve air quality and enhance recreation in the city.

=== Housing and development ===
Bakersfield saw its population grow from about 105,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 in 2020. Although the city is still growing, its growth rate has slowed in recent years due to the economic recession and high home foreclosure rates. However, in October 2013, Bakersfield was found to be the number two city in the nation for the rental market. Apartment vacancies have become a large issue, with only one percent of potential apartments being open to new renters as of April 2021. The average cost of rent and housing has dramatically increased in the last few years, with some apartments having their monthly rent nearly double in cost. Most new apartments being built are catering to commuting workers from Southern California and the Bay Area, with local residents being priced out.

The city of Shafter, a small farming town north of Bakersfield, previously filed a suit to attempt to limit the northern expansion of Bakersfield&#x27;s city limits. Shafter has also annexed large pieces of farmland to its east and south to ensure that Bakersfield does not annex this area. Bakersfield, in addition, filed a lawsuit against Shafter in 2007 regarding water rights Shafter planned to use but Bakersfield stated it had purchased in 1976. As a result, the city of Bakersfield threatened to annex the city of Shafter.

The large bluff and plateau east of Bakersfield—toward the Rio Bravo and Kern Canyon area—has been under development for the last 60 years. Because the steep, north-facing edge of the bluff provides a view of the foothills, mountains, oil fields, and Kern River, the city government has attempted to balance development and preservation in this area.

== Economy ==
Bakersfield&#x27;s historic and primary industries are related to Kern County&#x27;s two main industries: oil and agriculture. Kern County in 2013 was the most oil productive county in the US. Kern County is a part of the highly productive San Joaquin Valley and ranks in the top five most productive agricultural counties in the nation. Major crops for Kern County include grapes, citrus, almonds, carrots, alfalfa, cotton, and roses. The city is home to the corporate and regional headquarters of companies engaged in these industries.

Bakersfield has a growing manufacturing and distribution sector. Several companies have moved to Bakersfield because of its inexpensive land, as well as proximity to international ports in both Los Angeles and Oakland. Other companies have opened regional offices and non-oil/agricultural businesses because of Bakersfield&#x27;s and Kern County&#x27;s business-friendly policies, such as having no local utility or inventory taxes. Products manufactured in the city include ice cream (the world&#x27;s largest ice cream plant), central vacuums, highway paint, and stock racing cars.

Sales tax in Bakersfield is 8.25%.

=== Music ===
Due to the Dust Bowl, Buck Owens and his family migrated west where they would travel from Phoenix to the San Joaquin Valley to pick crops, including cotton. At 16, Owens moved to Bakersfield in 1951, where he and other musicians began to create what is now known as the Bakersfield sound. In 1996, Buck Owens opened the Crystal Palace, a music hall, nightclub, bar, restaurant, and museum, in Bakersfield.

Musician Merle Haggard was born and raised in Oildale. In 1962, Haggard completed his first single, &quot;Skid Row,&quot; on Bakersfield&#x27;s Tally label. In 1965, he went on to sign with Capitol Records. Most of Haggard&#x27;s early songs reflect his time spent in prison, farming, and working blue-collar jobs in Southern California, including Bakersfield.

Bakersfield is often considered to be the birthplace of a unique strand of country music that has inspired many country artists, such as Dwight Yoakam and The Strangers. Yoakam, alongside Owens, paid tribute to Owens by covering his 1973 recording of &quot;Streets of Bakersfield.&quot; The cover reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1988.

Sacred music composer, pianist and singer Gloria Roe was born in Bakersfield in 1935.

== Government and politics ==

=== Local government ===
Bakersfield uses the Council-Manager form of government, in which the City Council is the primary governing authority. The City Council consists of seven members elected from seven wards (or districts). The Mayor is elected at large and is the presiding member of the City Council, although she does not cast a vote except in a few instances. The City Council appoints and confirms (which the mayor does cast a vote) both the City Attorney and the City Manager. The City Manager, in turn, appoints (does not require confirmation from the City Council) the Finance Director, City Clerk, and Deputy City Clerk. In addition to these positions, Bakersfield has several departments that provide the services necessary to the city. They are: Department of Development Services, Department of Economic and Community Development, Fire Department, Police Department, Department of Public Works, Department of Recreation and Parks, and Department of Water Resources.

The framework for the city government is defined in the City Charter. As of 2011, it contained 11 articles and four addendums. The current version was adopted on January 23, 1915. Little information is known about the City Charter adopted in 1873 or 1898, when the city was incorporated. The City Charter has been amended several times since it was adopted. One of the more definitive amendments was to change the Mayor from an appointed position (by the City Council) to an elected position in 1956, which was done as a result of the 1952 Kern County earthquake.

The City Manager of Bakersfield is the appointed head of the executive branch. The position was created after 1957 when the role of mayor (which was the previous head) was split into two new positions. Under the council-manager form of government, the City Manager is responsible for executing ordinances passed by the city council and running the departments that make up the city. His office is currently located in City Hall North.

The city council appoints the city manager. His service can end in one of two ways. Either he resigns or by a vote of removal by the city council. The vote to appoint and remove is one of the few votes the mayor can cast.

This agency is contracted to provide dispatch services for the California City Fire Department, Kern Ambulance based in Wasco, and Care Ambulance based in Lake Isabella. Over 546 uniformed firefighters are stationed in 46 fire stations throughout the county.

Due to the vast number of county islands and jagged city limit lines in the south part of Bakersfield, the closest fire station is dispatched to incidents. This often results in city resources being dispatched to county locations and vice versa.

=== Crime ===

The number of violent crimes recorded by the Bakersfield Police Department in its 2008 Crime Reports was 5,961. 27 of those were murders and homicides. Data collected by Bakersfield Police Department, an anti-gang program under the city of Bakersfield, shows that the city of Bakersfield has experienced an increase in gang membership and gang activity since the early 2000s.

== Education ==
Two of the earliest schools founded in Kern County were Mrs. Thomas Baker&#x27;s school, opened in 1863 at the Baker home (near present-day 19th and N streets), and a Catholic parochial school opened by Reverend Father Daniel Dade in 1865 in Havilah (then the county seat). In 1880, Norris School was established. The land for this school was donated by William Norris, a local farmer. Thirteen to twenty students were taught in its one classroom during the 1880s. Bakersfield City School District (BCSD) is the state&#x27;s largest elementary school district. The first high school in Bakersfield, Kern County Union High School, opened in 1893. It was renamed Bakersfield High School after World War II.
The site at California Avenue and F Street is the location of the first campus of Bakersfield College, which was established in 1913 and relocated in 1956 to its current location overlooking the Panorama Bluffs in northeast Bakersfield. Bakersfield College has an enrollment of 16,000 students.

== Transportation ==
=== Highways ===

Bakersfield is serviced by an extensive highway network which includes three freeways. State Route 99 bisects Bakersfield from north to south. At the same time, State Route 58 exists as a freeway east of SR 99, serving the southeast part of the city and extending over the Tehachapi mountains to Tehachapi, Mojave, and Barstow. State Route 178 consists of a short segment of freeway that runs from a point near downtown to the northeastern part of the city, although there is currently no direct freeway connection between SR 99 and SR 178. Interstate 5 bypasses the city several miles to the west.

Bakersfield is also served by a short, unsigned, four-lane freeway called Alfred Harrell Highway. It was constructed between 1956 and 1958 and extends from China Grade Loop to Hart Park (a large recreation park in northeast Bakersfield). There is also a two-lane expressway to the east of the park. This section was initially reserved to be converted to a four-lane freeway similar to the constructed western portion. If it were ever constructed, it would have two interchanges (at Morning Drive and Lake Ming Road) and would terminate at the SR 178 adopted alignment (not built).

Both SR 58 and SR 178 have planned extensions. The western extension of SR 58 is known as the Centennial Corridor, which will extend the freeway west to I-5. Included in the Centennial Corridor is the Westside Parkway (sometimes referred to by its formal name, the Kern River Freeway). This is a newer freeway which runs through western Bakersfield, on a route parallel to the Kern River and Stockdale Highway. The western extension of SR 178 is known as the Crosstown Freeway/SR 178 Connection, although it was formerly known as the Centennial Corridor before that name was moved to SR 58. It is planned to connect SR 178 to the Westside Parkway.

In addition to these freeway extensions, there is also a proposed network of beltways. Currently, two beltways are being considered in Bakersfield. The West Beltway would run north–south from Seventh Standard Road to Taft Highway. It will run parallel to Heath Road to the north and parallel to South Allen Road to the south. A future extension would connect the West Beltway to SR 99 and I-5, providing a bypass to Bakersfield. The South Beltway would run east–west from SR 58 to I-5. From SR 58, it would run south, parallel to Comanche Drive until Taft Highway. From there, the freeway would turn west and run parallel to Taft Highway until terminating at I-5.

A future extension would extend the freeway north to SR 178 and terminate at Alfred Harrell Highway. Bakersfield also envisioned Caltrans building a North Beltway as the western extension of SR 58, but this has been withdrawn in favor of the Centennial Corridor.

Most of Bakersfield&#x27;s major streets are six-lane divided roads with bike lanes, with most streets in the city having proper lane signage for bicycle traffic but little to no protection from vehicle traffic. Despite the city&#x27;s relatively flat topography and grid-like street system, only around 2,782 bike commuters exist, as estimated in 2013, around 0.7% of its total population then.

Newer neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city, previously surrounded by two-lane farm roads, are prompting more large, divided roads to be built to help ease the increase in traffic that has resulted from the rise in population. Many developers choose to widen the roads that connect these neighborhoods at their own discretion, which can cause a major road to widen and narrow repeatedly over a short distance (Allen Road and Panama Lane are prime examples). Since the Bakersfield city limit boundaries are not uniform, this can cause Kern County &quot;islands&quot; to exist within Bakersfield. The county of Kern may choose not to upgrade a road while the city of Bakersfield does improve a road, which can cause traffic congestion to increase (Calloway Drive from the Westside Parkway north to Rosedale Highway best exemplifies this disparity).

Bakersfield is currently one of the largest cities in the U.S. that is not directly linked to an Interstate highway. However, SR 99 and SR 58 have been considered for conversion to Interstates. SR 99 would be a new Interstate signed either as Interstate 7 or Interstate 9, while SR 58 would be an extension of I-40, which currently terminates in Barstow. In 2005, SR 99 was added to the FHWA list of high-priority corridors as &quot;California farm to market route&quot; and designated a Future Interstate.

Garces Memorial Traffic Circle, informally known as Garces Circle or just &quot;the Circle,&quot; is a traffic circle in Bakersfield. The traffic circle is located at the intersection of Chester Avenue, Golden State Avenue (State Route 204), and 30th Street. The Circle was built circa 1932 as a part of US 99. A large sculpture of Francisco Garces was erected inside the circle in 1939.

=== Bus ===

Bakersfield is served by Golden Empire Transit. Eighteen routes are operated, the majority of which serve the urbanized portion of the county which includes the city of Bakersfield. Bakersfield is also served by Kern Transit, which connects Bakersfield with other communities in Kern County. Intercity bus providers in Bakersfield include Amtrak Thruway, Greyhound, Flixbus, Orange Belt Stages, National Charter Bus, Intercalifornias, TUFESA, and Fronteras del Norte.

The privately owned Airport Valet Express used to offer daily service between Bakersfield and LAX via a connection at the Van Nuys FlyAway bus station. However, they suspended service during the 2020 pandemic and have not yet announced a reopening date.

=== Rail ===

For freight, Bakersfield is served directly by two class-1 railroads, Union Pacific, and BNSF. North of the city, each railroad uses its own rail lines; south of the city, they share a line owned by Union Pacific. The route travels over Tehachapi Pass (and through the Tehachapi Loop). There are several spur lines in and around Bakersfield. The majority are operated by the San Joaquin Valley Railroad, owned by Genesee &amp; Wyoming.

Passenger service is provided by the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service, operated by Amtrak California. The Bakersfield Amtrak station is located downtown, at the intersection of S Street and Truxtun Avenue. The city is the route&#x27;s southern terminus; passenger trains are normally prohibited from traveling through the Tehachapi Loop to Los Angeles. There are five Amtrak Thruway routes, which connect passengers to destinations west, south, and east. Kern Transit also uses the station as one of its hubs, connecting passengers to regions throughout Kern County. A station for Bakersfield is planned as part of the California High-Speed Rail system.

=== Airport ===
Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield was rebuilt and dedicated as the William M. Thomas Terminal in 2012.

Also located at the Airport are the Hall Medivac Helicopter, International Flight Training Academy (a subsidiary of Japan&#x27;s ANA Airlines), SRT Helicopter Flight School, and numerous other aviation mechanics and technicians. However, IFTA has suspended operations in March 2014.

== Notable people ==
== In popular culture ==
Bakersfield appears in the 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Fallout&quot; under the name of &quot;Necropolis&quot;. The city was destroyed and abandoned after being hit by nuclear bombs. Later, ghouls, humans whose flesh had been destroyed and ravaged by radiation, moved into the city and resided there in isolation for several decades before it was invaded by the Unity.

In their song &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot; (off the 1978 &quot;Some Girls&quot; album), the Rolling Stones briefly reference Bakersfield. Lead singer Mick Jagger, emulating a quasi-spoken Southern drawl, narrates:

I was driving home, early Sunday morning, through Bakersfield&lt;br&gt;
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station&lt;br&gt;
And the preacher said, &quot;You know, you always have the Lord by your side&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Well, I was so pleased to be informed of this&lt;br&gt;
That I ran twenty red lights, in his honor&lt;br&gt;
Thank you Jesus . . . Thank you, Lord
It was the setting for the short-lived, early 1990s sitcom Bakersfield P.D.

<text>Bear Valley Springs is a guarded-gate community in Kern County, California, United States. The unincorporated community is in the Tehachapi Mountains and is part of the greater Tehachapi area. The elevation ranges from to (Bear Mountain). The population fluctuates between a low during the winter months when snow is common, to a high in the summer months when its elevation keeps it much cooler than surrounding areas and major cities. The population was 5,172 at the 2010 census, up from 4,232 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Bear Valley Springs as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name.

A &quot;Semi-Public&quot; Community. Unlike private communities entirely owned by residents and a private homeowner association (HOA) or other private entity, Bear Valley Springs is &quot;semi-public&quot;. Roads and infrastructure are owned by a public governmental agency—Bear Valley Community Services District (BVCSD). A homeowner association, Bear Valley Springs Association, exists and has authority over residential lots, but not the streets and public areas owned by BVCSD. BVCSD is one of only seven Community Services Districts authorized by California law to limit access to landowners and residents of the district. Due to this unique arrangement preventing general public access, BVCSD cannot receive outside public funds (i.e., county, state) for road maintenance. Instead, maintenance is entirely funded by local property taxes.

==History==
While the nation had pushed to the western coast, the land the Fickert family settled in 1869 was still isolated and remote. For centuries, it had been the realm of Native Americans. Over the years, after purchasing squatter&#x27;s rights to , the Fickerts expanded their holdings until, by the 1900s their ranch encompassed a vast region of .

By 1959, the last of the immediate Fickert family were gone, joining their kin who had gone before in the tiny family cemetery just up the hill from the main house.

Dart Resorts purchased the ranch from the Fickert heirs. Resource Ecology Associates was employed by Dart to plan and maintain the original natural value of the property, including wildlife. Bear Valley Springs was born.

The first sales of property were in late 1970 with a full sales team starting January 1971. The project was sold out in November 1977. The Bear Valley Springs Community Services District was formed to act as a nonprofit organization for management and maintenance of the water, roads, and police protection. The Bear Valley Springs Property Owners Association was formed to administer the amenity package. Together they insure the upkeep of the facilities of Bear Valley Springs.

The original concept was a second home destination resort where families could come to spend a weekend or longer and have a complete amenities package. The concept changed from second homes to full-time residents, approximately 3,700 homes. Former President Ronald Reagan bought a ranch in BVS . A number of athletes and TV/movie stars have made BVS their home.

== History ==
Borate evaporites in the form of colemanite was first reported in 1913 during drilling of a water well. Claims were acquired by the Pacific Coast Borax Company and exploration continued. In 1925 commercial colemanite production began. In the 1920s and 30s borates were produced from the Baker and West Baker mines.

The first post office at Boron opened in 1938.

== Industry ==

A large borax deposit was discovered in 1925, and the mining town of Boron was established soon thereafter. This borax deposit is the world&#x27;s largest borax mine. It is owned by Rio Tinto Minerals (formerly U.S. Borax). It is operated as an open-pit mine, the largest open-pit mine in California. This mine supplies nearly half of the world&#x27;s supply of refined borates. Rio Tinto Minerals is Boron&#x27;s primary employer, employing over 800 people.

Workers at Rio Tinto are represented by Local 30 Mine, Mineral and Processing Workers of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Originally represented by Local 85 of the International Chemical Workers&#x27; Union, workers voted to affiliate with the ILWU in 1966. During a 2010 labor dispute, workers were locked out by Rio Tinto for 107 days until support from the community and organized labor across California and elsewhere allowed both parties to successfully negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The dispute was covered in a 2010 documentary entitled Locked Out.

 east of Boron, across the county line in San Bernardino County, is what was, until 2014, the world&#x27;s largest solar power production facility. The Kramer Junction Company (KJC) is the managing general partner of the five 30 megawatt Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) facilities in the Mojave Desert at Kramer Junction, California. Together with its wholly owned subsidiary, KJC Operating Company, KJC operates and manages these facilities (SEGS III-VII).

== Public services ==

=== Law enforcement ===
Law enforcement services are provided by the Kern County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. From 1933 to 1954, personnel from the Mojave substation met the law enforcement need of the Boron area. The first actual office space occupied by the sheriff&#x27;s office in Boron was a quonset hut shared with the fire department in the 12200 block of Boron Avenue. This continued until 1963 when the sheriff&#x27;s office established the substation building at 26949 Cote Street. This building housed a small jail and the court in Boron, which operated one day a week.

A federal prison was closed in 2000. 

=== Fire services ===
In 1969 the new Boron station 17 opened at 26965 Cote Street. This fire station is operated by the Kern County Fire Department.

=== Schools ===
Boron schools are part of the Muroc Joint Unified School District. The local Boron schools include the K – 6 grade West Boron Elementary School, and the 7 – 12th grade Boron High School. Boron High School&#x27;s mascot is the Bobcat. Boron&#x27;s first school, Gephart School was built in 1929. It burned to the ground in 1994.

== Churches ==

== Notable residents ==
*Boron was the home of &quot;Walking George&quot; Swain, whose penchant for walking made him a legend. George earned his name as &quot;Walking George&quot; because he never owned a car, or house, and walked to and from work—from his home, which was always rumored to be just a hole in the desert. He supposedly kept himself warm at night with a covering of newspapers. His wardrobe was always the same: wrinkled shirt and pants with well-worn boots. Swain was a chemist at the borax plant in Boron. He attended local events and often played the piano for entertainment. He taught piano to children in Boron and played at the Baptist Church. On his 59th birthday in 1978 an article about George appeared in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. By May 1979 he was featured on the TV show &quot;Real People&quot;. He died on April 25, 2000.
* Boron was home to Pancho Barnes from 1966 to 1975. Barnes was a world-renowned air race and stunt pilot during the 1920s and 1930s. She is better known, however, for being the matron of the Happy Bottom Riding Club. She was forced to move when, during a heated dispute with Edwards Air Force Base over the expansion of one of the nearby base&#x27;s runways, the club mysteriously burned down. Years later Barnes moved to Boron from Gypsy Springs when her age no longer allowed her to properly tend to her ranch. She died in Boron during the spring of 1975.

== Media ==
The movie &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), starring Julia Roberts, and various other movies have been filmed in the town, often using local residents as extras.

==History==

The town was originally called Buena Vista when it was founded in 1895, but the name quickly became Buttonwillow.

Buttonwillow was named for the &quot;buttonbush&quot; &quot;(Cephalanthus occidentalis)&quot;. A lone buttonbush served as a landmark on an old trans-valley trail and was used by ancient Yokuts Indian as a meeting place, later becoming the site of settlers&#x27; stock rodeos. The Miller &amp; Lux holdings company eventually established a headquarters and store near the tree. This tree is listed as California Historical Landmark No. 492. This landmark is now known as the Buttonwillow Tree.
California Historical Landmark reads:
:.NO. 492 BUTTONWILLOW TREE - This lone tree, which gave the town of Buttonwillow its name, served as a landmark on an old trans-valley trail. An ancient Yokuts Indian meeting place, it later became the site of settlers&#x27; stock rodeos. Miller and Lux established their headquarters and store here about 1885.&quot;

The first United States Post Office at Buttonwillow was established in 1895.

==Environment==


Buttonwillow, California, is the host to one of California&#x27;s two active hazardous waste landfills: the Lokern Facility. The facility, owned and operated by a company then known as Laidlaw Environmental, which subsequently became Safety-Kleen and was later purchased in 2012 by Clean Harbors, lies west of the community. It was created in the 1970s, without the notification of any of the county&#x27;s residents. Furthermore, Highway 58, a busy road through the community, was used as the main route for trucks from the facility to transport toxic loads. At times, as many as 200 trucks per day could travel around the community in a defined traffic route that does not permit trucks through the town.

HISTORICAL BUT NOT CONFIRMED NOR VERIFIED: According to a study performed by Lisa Schweitzer, “transport spills [from toxic waste transporters, such as trucks] generally cluster near origins more than destinations.&quot; In the study, Schweitzer observed the amount of toxic waste that is spilled during transportation and the area where spills are generally located. If intermodal facilities and transfer points are considered origins, Laidlaw Environmental would qualify. Furthermore, the hundreds of trucks that transport toxic loads travel in and out of the community every day. Given the results of Schweitzer&#x27;s study, the residents of nearby communities (Buttonwillow, especially) are at the highest risk of experiencing side effects from the spills. Generally, spills occur as a result of human error, in which the load was packaged incorrectly or the driver experienced a vehicle accident or some other force which allowed for the leaking of toxins.

It was nearly ten years before the residents of Buttonwillow became aware of the facility. Even then, residents felt as if they could do nothing to stop it. In 1988, Laidlaw Environmental proposed to build a toxic waste incinerator, which would burn up to of toxic waste each year. The development and construction of the incinerator was never &quot;green-lit&quot; as a project for the facility. Then in 1992, the birth and death of a child with a physical defect—anencephaly—stirred suspicion from several residents. The tragedy created a bond between these residents, and they began to look to Laidlaw Environmental and the toxins that it released as the root of the issue. No health study or data collection has ever been performed and/or produced to confirm a direct correlation between the activities taking place at the facility and the health of any residents in Buttonwillow or the surrounding areas.

Also in 1992, Laidlaw Environmental proposed an expansion of its facility in Kern County. It wanted to double the dump&#x27;s capacity, making it one of the largest in the United States. Furthermore, it wanted to change the types of chemicals it took from strictly petroleum waste to more than 450 different types of substances, many of which were highly hazardous. According to Juanita Fernandez, a resident of Buttonwillow, those in attendance at the community meeting which discussed the proposed acts appeared to be businessmen and women who were mostly of a Caucasian background. The name of the committee in charge of the meeting was the Local Assessment Committee (LAC), which was formed in accordance with a law passed by California in the 1980s known as the Tanner Act. The law attempted to give county residents a say in the environmental occurrences and developments in their area. The LAC consisted of seven members, all of which met to discuss events and proposals such as those of Laidlaw Environmental.
Despite the apparent effort, the rules and regulations of the LAC were not fairly implemented. Even though LAC meetings were held in Buttonwillow, there were no residents from Buttonwillow on the committee. Furthermore, no members were of a Latino descent, although nearly all of Buttonwillow&#x27;s residents belonged to this demographic group. While many Buttonwillow residents attempted to participate in meetings, there was no one in attendance who was willing to translate for Spanish speakers. Because the majority of Buttonwillow residents predominantly spoke Spanish, their presence at the meetings had little influence. Finally, in June 1992, a Spanish translator was provided at the meetings. One month later, the Local Assessment Committee was suspended indefinitely.

In September 1994, the committee was reinstated. During the two-year span, a draft and final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was designed for Laidlaw Environmental. The EIR, required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), “examines the potential environmental impacts of many projects such as toxic waste dumps”. In addition, speculation surrounded the decisions that were made in appointing new committee members. Many people believed the decisions were made based upon race rather than qualification. In fact, a white applicant was chosen over a Latino, even though this applicant had failed to submit their application. Because of the tension, the LAC decided to appoint a Latino member, Eduardo Montoya.

After the application process, the LAC was told that it had ten weeks to convene and discuss the upcoming December hearing about the proposed expansion of Laidlaw Environmental. In this short amount of time, the LAC battled not with Laidlaw Environmental, but rather with the county. It appeared to many as if the county would not let the committee run their own meetings. The committee wanted control—the ability to set their own agenda and hire outside consultants. However, the county did not want to grant this authority to the LAC. Ten weeks later, in December, Laidlaw Environmental proceeded with the hearing and the Board of Supervisors disbanded the LAC. Montoya said that “the Board knew beforehand they would approve the dump” and that “they were just going through the motions”.

A major divider in the struggle of Buttonwillow against Laidlaw Environmental was the issue of race. While the LAC could have spent time gathering community support and increasing awareness about the toxins, the committee members were instead battling racial discrimination and a debate with the county about Spanish translation. A local community group, known as Padres Hacia una Vida Mejor, worked for these particular rights. Furthermore, the translation issue seemed to create a division among the county&#x27;s residents. For example, in their efforts to institute Spanish translation of the EIR and public hearings, the Latino residents isolated themselves from the black and white people in the community. Many English-speaking residents did not support the translation and felt that speaking English was key if Latinos “wanted to live in [their] country”. Because of these divisions, a racial streak emerged in the community, further dividing the community and decreasing the strength of their resistance.

The struggles of the Buttonwillow community still persist, and even as the residents make progress, they also face additional setbacks. Many of the myths that are often disproved by similar environmental justice cases apply to Buttonwillow. One of the primary myths initially believed by communities facing environmental injustice is that the government is “on our side.” According to Luke W. Cole, this myth is shared more widely among white Americans than among minorities, probably because minorities have historically faced several levels of governmental injustice.

<text>California City is a city located in northern Antelope Valley in Kern County, California, United States. It is north of the city of Los Angeles, and the population was 14,973 at the 2020 census. Covering , California City has the third-largest land area of any city in the state of California (behind San Diego and Los Angeles), and is the largest city in California, by land area, that is not a county seat. It is the 43rd-largest city in the United States by land area.

Much of the city&#x27;s residents are employed at Edwards Air Force Base, which is located southeast of the city. Other major employers are the California City Correctional Center (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation), Mojave Air and Space Port (and its flight test facility) and the Hyundai/Kia Proving Grounds, located in the rural southwestern part of the city. California City also has a park, a PGA golf course, and a municipal airport.

==History==

=== Early ===
Padre Francisco Garcés, a Franciscan missionary, camped at Castle Butte (what is now California City) during the Juan Bautista de Anza expedition of Alta California (1776).

In the late 19th century, the Twenty-Mule Team Trail, which carried loads of borax to the railhead in Mojave from Harmony Borax Works&#x27; mines to the east, ran through the California City area.

===Military===
The Mojave Gunnery Range &quot;C&quot; was used from August 1944 until January 1959, when it became California City land; this had included bombing ranges and strafing targets, such as a vehicle convoy. It was also used for pilotless aircraft just after World War II. Unexploded ordnance and toxic waste is associated with the site; the Army Corps of Engineers began surveying the site in 1999 and, by 2001, the range was described as encompassing southwest of the California City center. Site surveys in 1999 found MK 23 3-pound practice bombs with unfired signal cartridges and 20 mm target practice projectiles, along with 2.25&quot;, 2.75&quot; and 5&quot; practice rockets, undetonated bombs and small arms ammunition (from .22 to .50 caliber). The largest fuzed and most dangerous bombs discovered were a pair of 100-pound general purpose bombs.

=== Town ===

The city was formed in 1958, when developers purchased , 128 square miles or 332 square km of western Mojave Desert. The new city was aggressively marketed. Developers pitched the city as a northern alternative to Los Angeles, which the developers argued could not handle the post-war population-boom, and the region needed other communities to share the increase. Instead of being built piecemeal, the whole city would be developed simultaneously. The city was designed to be a planned community. The masterplan was prepared by Smith and Williams and architect Garrett Eckbo at the behest of real estate developer and sociology professor Nat Mendelsohn. The city included a central park with a manmade lake, two golf courses, and a new Holiday Inn. Mendelsohn was then president of a corporation called the California City Development Company. There were conflicting reports that the city was built over a large aquifer. The city was originally designed to accommodate 400,000 people, with a downtown center capable of holding 80,000–100,000, and satellite suburbs housing the rest.

A post office opened in 1960, and the city incorporated in 1965, when it had of land, 5,900 landowners, 817 residents, and 232 homes.
By 1965, population growth was less than the developer&#x27;s projection, and by 1969 only about 1,300 people lived in the city. The Federal Trade Commission began inspecting the development company in 1969, and Ralph Nader&#x27;s 25-person California task force (part of &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot;) published &quot;Power and Land in California&quot; in 1971. Part of the book focused on California City, calling it a fraud and &quot;a particularly stark study of government failure.&quot; By the 1970s, over 50,000 lots had been sold and the market declined. The Federal Trade Commission filed a cease and desist against the home seller for misleading advertising about the city, and in 1977, over 14,000 landowners receiving partial refunds from a $4 million pool, the largest FTC settlement to date. The sales company was also required to invest $16 million in long-promised infrastructure in various cities.

California City had a population of 3,200 in 1985 and over 14,000 in 2018, clustered around the west end.

In 2015, it was reported that California City&#x27;s water usage had exceeded expectations, increasing by 28% in May of that year. The rapidly increasing water usage was blamed on aging pipes beneath undeveloped portions of the city, faulty pumps reporting exaggerated figures, and the large number of inmates and workers at California City Correctional Facility.

In June 2016, California City became the first city of Kern County, California, to allow commercial cannabis cultivation. The city anticipated an eventual profit of $10 million+ a year in tax revenue from the new policy; by the first quarter of 2023, the city had made around $98,000 in cannabis-related revenues.

==Geography==
Although one of California&#x27;s smaller cities in terms of population, California City is the third largest city in California by land area. Satellite photos underscore its claim to being California&#x27;s third-largest city by land area (40th largest in the United States). Located in the northern Antelope Valley in Kern County, California, the city is northwest of Edwards Air Force Base, east of Tehachapi, north of Lancaster, southwest of Ridgecrest, east of the city of Bakersfield, and north of the city of Los Angeles.

<text>Delano ( ) is a city in Kern County, California, United States. Delano is located about north-northwest of Bakersfield at an elevation of . The population was 51,428 in 2020, down from 53,041 in 2010. It is Kern County&#x27;s second-largest city after Bakersfield.

Agriculture is Delano&#x27;s major industry. The area is particularly well known as a center for the growing of table grapes. Delano is also home to two California state prisons, North Kern State Prison and Kern Valley State Prison. The Voice of America once operated one of its largest, most powerful shortwave broadcast facilities at a station outside Delano at . The Voice of America ceased broadcasts in October 2007, citing a changing political mission, reduced budgets, and changes in technology.

Delano&#x27;s two school districts currently operate eight elementary schools, three middle schools, three comprehensive high schools and two alternative high schools. The city has its own police department and contracts with the Kern County Fire Department for fire services, EMS services are privately provided by local company, Delano Ambulance Service.

==History==
Delano was founded on July 14, 1869, as a railroad town, not because the railroad passed through the town but because the railroad coming south from San Francisco terminated at Delano. The name was officially given by the Southern Pacific Railroad in honor of Columbus Delano, at the time the Secretary of the Interior (1870–1875) for the United States. The first post office opened in 1874. Delano incorporated in 1913.

The town started with a boom. With Delano as the southern terminus of the railroad, it became the headquarters for hundreds of workmen who were building the railroad into town, and who eventually built the railroad into Bakersfield the following year. Meanwhile, the merchandise that formerly was trucked south from Visalia to Bakersfield and then to Walker Pass, or perhaps Tejon Pass, en route to Los Angeles, now coming via freight from the south, east and west, was likewise trucked in by ox or mule team. Great loads of bullion were delivered here from the mines in the mountains. Delano became the northern terminus for the passenger stages that ran south to Bakersfield and Los Angeles. The fare from Bakersfield to Delano was $7.00.

Delano was a major hub of farm worker organization efforts and Chicano political movements. Filipino immigrants Philip Vera Cruz and Larry Dulay Itliong were instrumental in shaping the direction of farm worker movement in the 1950s.

 On September 8, 1965, Larry Itliong and other Filipino leaders led the predominantly Filipino Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in a &quot;walk off&quot; from table grape farms, now known as the Delano grape strike. The strikers&#x27; goal was to improve farm workers&#x27; wages and working conditions. The National Farm Workers&#x27; Association (NFWA), a largely Hispanic union led by Cesar Chavez, joined the strike within a week. During the strike, the two groups joined forces and formed the United Farm Workers of America (UFW). By 1970, the UFW won a contract with major grape growers across California.

<doc id="107530" wikidata="Q217563" url="?curid=107530" title="Edwards Air Force Base">
<text>Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) is a United States Air Force installation in California. Most of the base sits in Kern County, but its eastern end is in San Bernardino County and a southern arm is in Los Angeles County. The hub of the base is Edwards, California. Established in the 1930s as Muroc Field, the facility was renamed Muroc Army Airfield and then Muroc Air Force Base before its final renaming in 1950 for World War II USAAF veteran and test pilot Capt. Glen Edwards.

Edwards is the home of the Air Force Test Center, Air Force Test Pilot School, and NASA&#x27;s Armstrong Flight Research Center. It is the Air Force Materiel Command center for conducting and supporting research and development of flight, as well as testing and evaluating aerospace systems from concept to combat. It also hosts many test activities conducted by America&#x27;s commercial aerospace industry.

Notable occurrences at Edwards include Chuck Yeager&#x27;s flight that broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1, test flights of the North American X-15, the first landings of the Space Shuttle, and the 1986 around-the-world flight of the Rutan Voyager.

==History==
=== Origins ===
A water stop on the Santa Fe Railroad since 1882, the site was largely unsettled until the early 20th century. In 1910, Ralph, Clifford and Effie Corum built a homestead on the edge of Rogers Dry Lake. The Corums proved instrumental in attracting other settlers and building infrastructure in the area, and when a post office was commissioned for the area, they named it Muroc, a reversal of the Corum name, due to the presence of a town named Coram.

Conscious that March Field was located in an area of increasing growth in Riverside County, and with the need for bombing and gunnery ranges for his units, base and 1st Wing commander Lieutenant Colonel Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold began the process of acquiring land next to Muroc Dry Lake for a new bombing range away from populated areas in August 1932; the last tract was not acquired until 1939. The facility established to support the range, initially called &quot;Mohave Field&quot; for the nearby community of Mohave, was Muroc Field. In October 1935, five men under a Sergeant Folgleman were sent to the area from March Field. They put out circular bombing targets in the desert. For the next two years aircraft shuttled back and forth between Muroc Dry Lake and March Field for Crew Bombing Practice.

At this time, another colorful character in Edwards&#x27; history, Pancho Barnes, built her renowned Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch that would be the scene of many parties and celebrations to come. The dry lake was a hive of hot rodding, with racing on the playa. The runway on which the Space Shuttle landed follows the route that hosted racing in the 1930s.

The first major aerial activity occurred at Muroc in 1937 when the entire Army Air Corps participated in a large-scale maneuver. From then on, the bombing range grew in size. When Arnold became Chief of the Air Corps in 1938, the service was given a renewed focus on research and development. Muroc Field drew attention because the nearby dry lake was so flat (Arnold described it as &quot;level as a billiard table&quot;) that it could serve as a giant runway, ideal for flight testing. Over US$120 million was spent to develop the base in the 1940s and expand it to . The base&#x27;s main runway was completed in a single pour of concrete.

===World War II===

On the afternoon of 7 December 1941, the 41st Bombardment Group and the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron moved to Muroc from Davis-Monthan Army Airfield, Arizona, with a collection of B-18 Bolos, B-25 Mitchells, and an A-29 Hudson. On Christmas Eve, the 30th Bombardment Group and the 2d Reconnaissance Squadron arrived from New Orleans Army Airbase, Louisiana, for crew training. On 23 July 1942, the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range, Muroc Lake, California, was designated as a separate post (Exempted Status). The name of the facility at the time was &quot;Army Air Base, Muroc Lake.&quot;

In July 1942, Muroc Army Airfield became a separate airfield from March Field and was placed under the jurisdiction of Fourth Air Force. Throughout the war years, the primary mission at Muroc was providing final combat training for bomber and fighter aircrews just before overseas deployment. Among its sub-bases and auxiliaries were:
* Bishop Army Airfield 
* Blythe Army Airfield 
* Palmdale Army Airfield 
* Desert Center Army Airfield 
* Gary Army Airfield 

Muroc was initially used for IV Bomber Command Operational Unit training. The B-25 Mitchell 41st and 30th Bombardment Groups and the A-20 Havoc 47th Bombardment Groups trained at the station in early 1942. The training provided newly graduated pilots eight to 12 weeks of training as a team using the same aircraft they would use in combat. In 1942, the training mission was transferred to IV Fighter Command, with P-38 Lightning OTU training for the 78th and 81st Fighter Groups. In 1943, the 360th Fighter Group and 382d Bombardment Groups were assigned permanently to Muroc for P-38 Lightning and B-24 Liberator Replacement Training (RTU) of personnel.

In the spring of 1942, the Mojave Desert station was chosen as a secluded site for testing America&#x27;s first jet, the super-secret Bell Aircraft P-59 Airacomet jet fighter. The immense volume of flight tests being conducted at Wright Field, in Ohio, helped drive a search for a new, isolated site where a &quot;Top Secret&quot; airplane could undergo tests &quot;away from prying eyes.&quot; The urgent need to complete the P-59 program without delay dictated a location with good, year-round flying weather, and the risks inherent in the radical new technology to be demonstrated on the aircraft dictated a spacious landing field. After examining a number of locations around the country, they selected a site along the north shore of the enormous, flat surface of Rogers Dry Lake about six miles away from the training base at Muroc.

Ground tests began five days after the first XP-59 arrived on 21 September 1942. First flight took place on 30 September when the XP-59 rose to altitude for during taxi testing. However, the first official flight was 1 October 1942 with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Royal Air Force, Army, Bell and General Electric personnel on hand.

As with virtually all of the test programs conducted during the war years, most of the actual flight test work on the P-59 was conducted by the contractor. Although Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots flew the aircraft from time to time, and flight test engineers from Wright Field reviewed the data, the formal preliminary military test and evaluation program did not commence until the Fall of 1943, a year after the first flight. Designed to validate the contractor&#x27;s reports, this preliminary evaluation consisted of a very limited number of flights and was essentially completed within a month. Formal operational suitability and accelerated service tests did not get underway until 1944, well after the AAF had decided that the airplane would not be suitable for combat operations and would, instead, be relegated to a training role.

The P-59s were tested at Muroc from October 1942 through February 1944 without a single accident and, though the aircraft did not prove to be combat worthy, the successful conduct of its test program, combined with the success of the Lockheed XP-80 program which followed it in early 1944, sealed the future destiny of the remote high desert installation. Muroc would thenceforth become synonymous with the cutting edge of the turbojet revolution in America.

Aircraft testing continued at this desert &quot;Army Air Base&quot;, then on 8 November 1943, the base title was changed to &quot;Muroc Army Air Field, Muroc&quot;. In the fall of 1944, Eighth Air Force ran tests to determine how well conventional fighters stood up against jets. Also, in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at the base for experimental work in rocket firing and achieved such success that they remained through most of 1945.

Other World War II test flights included the Northrop JB-1 Bat.

In 1943, a replica of a Japanese cruiser, nicknamed &quot;Muroc Maru&quot;, was constructed in Rogers Dry Lake where it was used for bombing training until 1950.

===Postwar era===
With the end of the war, Fourth Air Force relinquished command of Muroc Army Airfield on 16 October 1945 and jurisdiction was transferred to Air Technical Service Command, becoming Air Materiel Command in 1946. Test work on the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star was the primary mission of the base for the greater part of the fall of 1945. The Consolidated Vultee XP-81 single-seat, long-range escort fighter and Republic XP-84 Thunderjet fighter arrived at the base in early 1946 for flight testing. It was obvious even at this embryonic stage of base development that the Army Air Force desert station was destined to become a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental airplanes.

The success of these programs attracted a new type of research activity to the base in late 1946. The rocket-powered Bell X-1 was the first in a long series of experimental airplanes designed to prove or disprove aeronautical concepts—to probe the most challenging unknowns of flight and solve its mysteries. Further evidence of things to come was experienced on 14 October 1947 when Captain Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager flew the small bullet-shaped airplane to become the first human to exceed the speed of sound.

Four months later, on 10 February 1948, Muroc AAF was re-designated Muroc Air Force Base with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate military service. Units attached or assigned to the base at the time were the 4144th Army Air Force Base Unit, the 3208th Strategic Bomb Test Squadron along with communications and weather detachments. On 20 August 1948, the 4144th Air Force Base Unit was re-designated as the 2759th AF Base Unit and with the adoption of the Hobson Plan, as the 2759th Experimental Wing.

With the X-1, flight testing at Muroc began to assume two distinct identities. Highly experimental research programs—such as the X-3, X-4, X-5 and XF-92A—were typically flown in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, and were conducted in a methodical fashion to answer largely theoretical questions. Then, as now, the great bulk of flight testing at Muroc focused on evaluations of the capabilities of aircraft and systems proposed for the operational inventory.

In December 1949, Muroc was renamed Edwards Air Force Base in honor of Captain Glen Edwards (1918–1948), who was killed a year earlier in the crash of the Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing. During World War II, he flew A-20 Havoc light attack bombers in the North African campaign on 50 hazardous, low-level missions against German tanks, convoys, troops, bridges, airfields, and other tactical targets. Edwards, from Alberta, Canada, became a test pilot in 1943 and spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, on California&#x27;s high desert, testing wide varieties of experimental prototype aircraft. He died in the crash of a Northrop YB-49 flying wing near Muroc AFB on 5 June 1948. From the time Edwards Air Force Base was named, speed and altitude records began to pile up as new aircraft were developed and the base started to build and branch out significantly.

A major reason for the growth of Edwards AFB was the nearness of West Coast aircraft manufacturers. However, another major reason was the decision in 1947 to build a missile test facility on the base. The need for a static missile faculty to test high-thrust missile rocket engines was first envisioned in 1946 by the Power Plant Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It was that decision that such a facility should be government-owned to prevent a single contractor exclusive advantages on Air Force contracts for high-thrust missile rocket power plants, and it would eliminate duplication of like facilities by different manufacturers. The choice of location in 1947 was the Leuhman Ridge east of Rogers Dry Lake on Edwards AFB. Construction began in November 1949 on what was to become the Experimental Rocket Engine Test Station.

===Cold War===
====Flight testing====
Jurisdiction of Edwards AFB was transferred from Air Materiel Command on 2 April 1951 to the newly created Air Research and Development Command. Activation of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) followed on 25 June 1951. Units designated and assigned to the Center at the time of activation were the 6510th Air Base Wing for station support units. The test flying units at Edwards were assigned directly to the AFFTC .

That same year, the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School moved to Edwards from Wright Field, Ohio.

Its curriculum focused on the traditional field of performance testing and the relatively new field of stability and control, which had suddenly assumed critical importance with the dramatic increases in speed offered by the new turbojets. As the decade opened, the first-generation X-1 reached and a altitude, representing the edge of the envelope. The D-558-II Douglas Skyrocket soon surpassed these marks. In 1951, Douglas test pilot Bill Bridgeman flew the Skyrocket to a top speed of and a peak altitude of . Then, in 1953, Marine Corps test pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Marion Carl, flew the same plane to an altitude of .

On 20 November 1951, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics&#x27; Scott Crossfield became the first man to reach Mach 2 as he piloted the Skyrocket to a speed of . Less than a month later, Major Chuck Yeager topped this record as he piloted the second-generation Bell X-1A to a top speed of and, just nine months later, Major Arthur &quot;Kit&quot; Murray flew the same airplane to a new altitude record of .

These records stood for less than three years. In September 1956, Captain Iven Kincheloe became the first man to soar above , as he piloted the Bell X-2 to a then-remarkable altitude of . Flying the same airplane just weeks later on 27 September, Captain Mel Apt became the first to exceed , accelerating to a speed of . His moment of glory was tragically brief, however. Just seconds after attaining top speed, the X-2 tumbled violently out of control and Apt was never able to recover.

With the loss of the X-2, the search for many of the answers to the riddles of high-Mach flight had to be postponed until the arrival of the most ambitious of the rocket planes—the North American X-15.

Meanwhile, the turbojet revolution had reached a high plateau at Edwards. By the time the base was officially designated the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center in June 1951, more than 40 different types of aircraft had first taken flight at the base and the nation&#x27;s first generation of jet-powered combat airplanes had already completed development. One of them, the North American F-86 Sabre, was dominating the skies over Korea.

The promise of the turbojet revolution and the supersonic breakthrough were realized in the 1950s, as the Center tested and developed the first generation of true supersonic fighters—the famed &quot;Century Series&quot; F-100 Super Sabre, F-101 Voodoo, F-102 Delta Dagger, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief and F-106 Delta Dart, and, in the process, defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighter aircraft that still prevail to this day. The Center also played a pivotal role in the development of systems that would provide the United States with true intercontinental power projection capabilities as it tested aircraft such as the B-52 Stratofortress, C-133 Cargomaster and KC-135 Stratotanker, as well as the YC-130 Hercules which served as the basis for a classic series of tactical transports that would continue in frontline service until well into the 21st century. It also supported the development of the extremely high-altitude and long-range Lockheed U-2 and the dazzling ultra-performance capabilities of the B-58 Hustler, the world&#x27;s first Mach 2 bomber.

Throughout the 1950s, American airplanes regularly broke absolute speed and altitude records at Edwards, but nothing compared to the arrival of the North American X-15 in 1961. The program got under way in earnest in 1961 when Maj. Robert M. &quot;Bob&quot; White became the first man to exceed Mach 4, as he accelerated to on 7 March. He claimed Mach 5 just three months later when he pegged a speed of on 23 June and then, during the X-15&#x27;s first full-powered flight on 9 November, he exceeded Mach 6, as he flew to a speed of . Major White also became the first man to fly an airplane in space when he climbed to on 17 July 1962. NASA&#x27;s Joe Walker flew the airplane to its peak altitude of on 22 August 1963 and Maj William J. &quot;Pete&quot; Knight reached in the modified X-15A-2 on 3 October 1967, a speed that remains the highest ever attained in an airplane.

In addition to the X-15 Program, AFFTC and NASA also teamed up to explore a new concept called &quot;lifting reentry&quot; with a series of wingless lifting body aircraft. These rocket powered-vehicles – the M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A and X-24B – paved the way for the Space Shuttle and future spaceplane designs when they demonstrated that they could make precision landings after high-speed gliding descents from high altitude.

The major aircraft systems that were tested and developed during the 1960s, the T-38 Talon, B-52H Stratofortress, F-4 and RF-4 Phantom II, the F-111 and FB-111, C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy, all became mainstays in the USAF operational inventory. Another aircraft gained world fame in the late 1960s at Edwards: the Lockheed YF-12A, a precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird, shattered nine records in one day of testing at Edwards. The SR-71&#x27;s full capabilities remain classified, but the records set on 1 May 1965 included a sustained speed of and an altitude of .

New aircraft types arrived in the 1970s: the F-15 Eagle with its advanced engine and fire-control system; the single-engine F-16 Fighting Falcon with its revolutionary &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; flight control system; and the B-1 Lancer with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems. These planes more than bore out the prophecy concerning the ever-increasing importance of systems testing and integration. Moreover, another major new element of complexity was soon introduced into the flight test process.

At a remote location in 1978 and 1979, an AFFTC test pilot and a pair of flight test engineers were engaged in proof-of-concept testing with Lockheed&#x27;s &quot;low-observable&quot; technology demonstrator, dubbed &quot;Have Blue.&quot; The successful completion of those tests led immediately to the development of a new subsonic attack aircraft that was designated the F-117A Nighthawk.

The capabilities of existing aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16 have been continually refined and expanded, even as totally new aircraft and systems incorporating radical new technologies are developed for future operational use. The dual-role F-15E, for example, was developed in the 1980s and went on to demonstrate truly remarkable combat effectiveness in the Persian Gulf conflict of the early 90s. The Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night, or LANTIRN, system revolutionized air-to-ground combat operations during the same conflict by denying opposing forces the once comforting sanctuary of night.

The late 1980s also witnessed the arrival of the first giant flying wing to soar over the base in nearly 40 years. The thin silhouette, compound curves and other low-observable characteristics of the B-2 Spirit bomber represented third-generation stealth technology, following the SR-71 and F-117.

The 1980s also saw Edwards host a demonstration of America&#x27;s space warfare capabilities when a highly modified F-15 Eagle launched an ASM-135 anti-satellite missile at the dead P78-1 (or Solwind) satellite and destroyed it. In 1986, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager launched from Edwards to set a new aviation record by piloting the first non-stop, around-the-world flight on a single tank of fuel in the Rutan Voyager.

====Ground research====
Extensive aviation research was also conducted on the ground at Edwards. Two rocket sled tracks pioneered important developments and research for the Air Force. The first track was built by Northrop in 1944 near what is currently the North Base. Originally intended to help develop a V-1 flying-bomb-style weapon that never left the drawing board, the track found use after the war as a test area for V-2 rockets captured from Nazi Germany in Operation Paperclip. Later, Lt. Col. John Stapp appropriated the track for his MX981 project and installed what was believed to be one of the most powerful mechanical braking systems ever constructed. His deceleration tests led the press to nickname him the &quot;fastest man on earth&quot; and the &quot;bravest man in the Air Force&quot;.

The results from the first track prompted the Air Force to build a second in 1948. Located just south of Rogers Lake, the track was capable of supersonic speeds. Its first project was the development of the SM-62 Snark cruise missile. This track was so successful that an extension was constructed, and on 13 May 1959, the full track was opened. After the Navy had conducted research on the UGM-27 Polaris ballistic missile, the track was used to develop ejection seats that could be used at supersonic speeds. Though this program was a success, a budgetary review concluded that the track was too expensive to maintain, and the track was decommissioned on 24 May 1963. Before it was closed, a trial run set a world speed record of before the test car broke up. After it closed, the rails were pulled up to help straighten Lancaster Boulevard.

====Space Shuttle support====

After President Richard M. Nixon announced the Space Shuttle program on 5 January 1972, Edwards was chosen for Space Shuttle orbiter testing. The prototype was carried to altitude by the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) and released. In all, 13 test flights were conducted with the Enterprise and the SCA to determine their flight characteristics and handling.

After Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; became the first shuttle launched into orbit on 12 April 1981, it returned to Edwards for landing. The airbase&#x27;s immense lakebeds and its proximity to Plant 42, where the shuttle was serviced before relaunch, were important factors in its selection and it continued to serve as the primary landing area for the space shuttle until 1991. After that time, Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida was favored. This saved the considerable cost of transporting the shuttle from California back to Florida, but Edwards AFB and White Sands Space Harbor continued to serve as backups for the duration of the shuttle program. Shuttles landed at Edwards as recently as 9 August 2005 (STS-114), 22 June 2007 (STS-117), 30 November 2008 (STS-126), 24 May 2009 (STS-125), and 11 September 2009 (STS-128) due to rain and ceiling events at the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility. STS-126 was the only mission to land on temporary runway 04 at Edwards, as the refurbished main runway was operational from STS-119 through to the retirement of the shuttles.

===Into the 1990s===
The end of the Cold War was marked by the arrival of the YF-22A and the YF-23A. The two prototype fighters were the first airplanes to blend stealth with agility and high-speed, supersonic cruise capability. The YF-22A was selected to become the Air Force&#x27;s new advanced tactical fighter after a brief demonstration and validation risk reduction flight test program. Now named the Raptor, the F-22A continues to undergo test and evaluation at Edwards.

A new group of research projects came to Edwards in the 1990s. Global Hawk, an unmanned aerial vehicle that has been used extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq, made its first flight at Edwards in February 1998. The X-24, X-33, X-34, X-36 and X-38, a series of new lifting bodies, technology demonstrators and half-scale models were tested here by NASA during the decade.

The new millennium brought new projects with worldwide impact. The X-35A and X-32A, competing models for the Joint Strike Fighter program, made their first flights in September and October 2000. The X-35A won the competition in 2001 and will eventually be built in various versions for America&#x27;s flying armed services and for foreign air forces as well. Also new are the RQ-4 Global Hawk, YAL-1 Airborne Laser, the B-52 synthetic fuel program, the C-17 Globemaster III, and many prototype unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Edwards is among the few U.S. military bases to have gained jobs since the Cold War. Under the DoD&#x27;s Base Realignment and Closure process, several smaller bases have been decommissioned, and their facilities and responsibilities have been sent to Edwards, China Lake, and other large bases.

During 2012, the 95th Air Base Wing, the former base support unit at Edwards was inactivated and consolidated into the 412th Test Wing as part of the Air Force Flight Test Center transitioning into the Air Force Test Center. The five-Center consolidation not only better integrates the workforce but saves taxpayers approximately $109 million annually.

==Role and operations==
The base has helped develop virtually every aircraft purchased by the Air Force since World War II. Almost every United States military aircraft since the 1950s has been at least partially tested at Edwards, and it has been the site of many aviation breakthroughs.

===Air Force Test Center===

====412th Test Wing====
The 412th Test Wing plans, conducts, analyzes, and reports on all flight and ground testing of aircraft, weapons, software and components as well as modeling and simulation for the U.S. Air Force. The Wing also oversees the base&#x27;s day-to-day operations and provides support for the military, federal civilian, and contract personnel assigned to Edwards AFB. Planes assigned to the 412th carry the tail code ED.

*U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School: Part of the 412th Test Wing, USAF TPS is where the Air Force&#x27;s top pilots, navigators and engineers learn how to conduct flight tests and generate the data needed to carry out test missions. The comprehensive curriculum of Test Pilot School is fundamental to the success of flight tests and evaluations.
*412th Operations Group: The 412th OG flies an average of 90 aircraft with upwards of 30 aircraft designs. It performs an annual average of more than 7,400 missions, including more than 1,900 test missions. Its squadrons include: 
**411th Flight Test Squadron: (F-22)
**416th Flight Test Squadron: (F-16)
**419th Flight Test Squadron: (B-52H, B-1, B-2)

*412th Civil Engineer Division
*412th Maintenance Group
*412th Medical Group
*412th Mission Support Group
*412th Electronic Warfare Group
*412th Test Engineering Group
The Test Engineering and Electronic Warfare groups provide the central components in conducting the Test and Evaluation mission of the 412 TW. They provide the tools, talent and equipment for the core disciplines of aircraft structures, propulsion, avionics and electronic warfare evaluation of the latest weapon system technologies. They also host the core facilities that enable flight test and ground test—the Range Division, Benefield Anechoic Facility, Integrated Flight Avionics Systems Test Facility and the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator. The Project and Resource Management Divisions provide the foundation for the successful program management of test missions.

===Associate units===
There are a vast array of organizations at Edwards that do not fall under the 412th Test Wing. They are known as Associate Units. These units do everything from providing an on-base grocery store to testing state-of-the-art rockets.

==== 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron (Tail Code: OT) ====
: The 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron provides Air Combat Command personnel to support combined test and evaluation on Air Force weapons systems. Established in 1917, it is one of the oldest units of the United States Air Force. The &quot;Desert Pirates&quot; are part of the 753d Test and Evaluation Group, Nellis AFB, Nevada and the 53d Wing, Eglin AFB, Florida. It also provides the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, and Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with test team members who have an operational perspective to perform test and evaluation on Combat Air Force systems.

: The 31st is staffed with a mixture of operations, maintenance and engineering experts who plan and conduct tests, evaluate effectiveness and suitability, and influence system design. The squadron&#x27;s personnel are integrated into the B-1, B-2, B-52, Global Hawk, MQ-9 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programs. Their results and conclusions support Department of Defense acquisition, deployment and employment decisions.

==== Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 1 ====
: An Air Force Materiel Command named unit assigned to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, AFOTEC Detachment 1 is responsible for accomplishing Block 2 and 3 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation of the F-35 Lightning II for the US Air Force, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, and the Royal Netherlands Air Force.

==== Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 5 ====
: AFOTEC Detachment 5** is responsible for conducting the operational test and evaluation of USAF aircraft and avionics systems. Certification by Detachment 5 is required for new aircraft prior to AFMC full-rate production and combat fielding decisions. Detachment 5 personnel are integrated into the Flight Test Center&#x27;s combined test squadrons and provide a critical operating perspective during developmental flight testing to help prepare systems for their final operational test and evaluation.

==== Air Force Plant 42 production flight test installation ====
: A remote facility of Edwards AFB, located at Palmdale, California, Plant 42 is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility with proximity to both the concentration of aerospace industry in Los Angeles, and the high-speed corridors and resources of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards. Plant 42 is one of four Air Force plants located throughout the United States and is uniquely situated to fully support the Air Force&#x27;s newest and most advanced aerospace systems. It provides industrial facilities for production, modification, depot maintenance and flight testing of aerospace systems. It is staffed by a mixture of civilian defense contractors, as well as USAF personnel.

==== NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center ====

: Contained inside Edwards Air Force Base is NASA&#x27;s Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) where modern aircraft research is still active (e.g. the Boeing X-45). The AFRC is home to many of the world&#x27;s most advanced aircraft. Notable recent research projects include the Controlled Impact Demonstration and the Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment. It is chartered to research and test advanced aeronautics, space and related technologies for atmospheric flight operations, and to transfer those technologies to industry and other government agencies. Armstrong supports NASA&#x27;s Earth science research with a fleet of specialized manned and unmanned environmental science aircraft. Armstrong is also involved in NASA&#x27;s space science mission by managing and flying the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. The center is named for Neil A. Armstrong, an American astronaut and the first person to walk on the Moon. Armstrong&#x27;s history dates back to late 1946, when 13 engineers arrived at what is now Edwards from the NACA Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in Virginia to support the last supersonic research flights by the X-1 rocket plane in a joint NACA, Army Air Forces and Bell Aircraft program.

==== Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory ====
: The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Propulsion Directorate maintains a rocket engine test facility on and around Leuhman Ridge, just east of Rogers Dry Lake. This facility traces its roots to early Army Air Corps activities. The Edwards Research Site is part of the AFRL Propulsion Directorate, which is headquartered at the Wright Research Site, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

==== Other units and further details ====
Edwards is also home to several other units from DOD, Air Force, Army, Navy, FAA, USPS and many companies that support the primary mission or the personnel stationed there.

The Main Base is also the home of the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF), an electromagnetic and radio frequency testing building. It is also home to the Air Force Flight Test Museum, which has over 15 aircraft on display.

The site has one paved runway, 06/24, and is accessed from the lakebed or via a single controlled road.

The base is next to Rogers Dry Lake, an endorheic desert salt pan which has a hard dry lake surface that provides a natural extension to Edwards&#x27; runways. This large landing area, combined with excellent year-round weather, makes the base good for flight testing. The lake is a National Historic Landmark. The base hosts half of the Edwards &amp; Sanborn Solar and Energy Storage Project, with 875 megawatts of solar power and 3,287 megawatt-hours of battery storage. The base receives $75m during 35 years from the plant.

As a military airbase, civilian access is severely restricted. There are three lighted, paved runways:

* 05R/23L is , and an extra of lakebed runway is available at its northerly end. It is equipped with arresting systems approximately from each end.
* 05L/23R is and was constructed to temporarily replace 04R/22L while it was being renovated in 2008.
* 07/25 is (this runway is technically part of the South Base) and an extra of lakebed runway is available at its easterly end.

There are 13 other official runways on the Rogers lakebed:
* 17/35 is . Imagery from the 1990s show an extension another to the north, including a visual cue and centerline markings that extend about down the currently declared portion of the runway. In 2022 Google Maps imagery, the southern Runway 35 indicator is still outlined and clearly visible. The only other remains are a faint outline along the length, and the very eroded northern Runway 17 indicator.
* 05L/23R is 
* 05R/23L is and is next to 05L/23R at the 23L (easterly) end.
* 06/24 is . Not to be confused with the south base 06/24 paved runway (which also extends onto the lakebed), or the north base 06/24 paved runway.
* 07/25 is 
* 09/27 is 
* 12/30 is . It is actually marked as two adjacent -wide runways (L and R). Runway 30 rolls out onto the compass rose, so its corresponding, unmarked, runway 12 is never used.

==Geography==

The largest features of the that make up Edwards AFB are the Rogers Lake and Rosamond Lake dry lakes. These have served as emergency and scheduled landing sites for many aerospace projects including the Bell X-1, Lockheed U-2, Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, and the Space Shuttle. The lakebeds have black lines painted on them to mark seven official &quot;runways&quot;. Also painted on the dry lake beds near Dryden is the world&#x27;s largest compass rose: radius, in diameter. The Edwards AFB compass rose&#x27;s magnetic declination to true north is measured by Google Earth&#x27;s distance/direction measurement tool as inclined to magnetic north with a 15.3 degrees east variance of true north, as opposed to the current variance of 11.5 degrees east (2025). This is consistent with a calculated magnetic variance of 15.5 degrees east at this location at the time of the compass rose&#x27;s construction in 1956. The larger lake bed, Rogers, encompasses of desert. Because of Rogers&#x27; history in the space program, it was declared a National Historic Landmark.

The Rosamond dry lake bed encompasses and is also used for emergency landings and other flight research roles. By August, the lake bed is dry and rough from the weather and from high-performance aircraft performing landings. Both lake beds are some of the lowest points in the Antelope Valley and they can collect large amounts of precipitation. Desert winds whip this seasonal water around on the lake beds and the process polishes them, yielding a new, extremely flat surface; the Rosamond lake bed was measured to have an altitude deviation of over a length; that&#x27;s about altitude deviation over every of length.

The census-designated place encompasses an area of of which is water.

===Environmental concerns===
There are several protected and threatened species living in Edwards, the most notable being the desert tortoise (&quot;Gopherus agassizii&quot;). It is illegal to touch, harass or otherwise harm a desert tortoise. Another notable species is &quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot;: the taller members of this species are called Joshua trees.

<text>Frazier Park is a village and unincorporated community in Kern County, California. It is west of Lebec, at an elevation of . It is one of the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass. The population was 2,592 in the 2020 census, down from 2,691 in 2010.

==History==

The earliest record relating to Frazier Park was a report in 1854 that lumber was being produced there from Frazier Mountain trees for use at the new Army post at nearby Fort Tejon. Local historian Bonnie Ketterl Kane wrote that the mill was &quot;supposedly&quot; at the southeast end of the present community. She cited another report that a Kitanemuk Indian referred to the site as Campo del Soldado (Soldier&#x27;s Camp), &quot;which was where the soldiers stayed when they cut timber from a mountain they called Pinery Mountain, today&#x27;s Frazier Mountain.&quot;

The community was established in 1925 by Harry McBain, who named it in 1926 for Frazier Mountain, on its southern flank. Its post office was established on September 14, 1927, with Charles B. Fife as the first postmaster.

Frazier Park was used in filming for &quot;The Waltons&quot; television show.

Frazier Park is the setting of the 2011 film &quot;The FP&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Black Six&quot;.

On October 11, 2023, a winning Powerball lottery ticket worth $1.75 billion was sold in Frazier Park. The owners of the Midway Market &amp; Liquor store where the ticket was purchased receive a $1 million bonus for selling the billion-dollar ticket.

==History==

Inyokern was founded in the mid-19th century as an agrarian community located in the northernmost corner of the Mojave Desert. It expanded during construction of the Owens Valley aqueduct. The first post office opened in 1910.

The Inyokern Elementary School was founded in 1913. The original building was replaced in the mid-1930s by a larger building with a stage and indoor restrooms. This building was demolished in the early 1970s. In the 1930s, half a dozen irrigated farms were scattered around Indian Wells Valley, growing mostly alfalfa and livestock. Community events were held in Inyokern Hall, which still stands.

With the onset of World War II, the US Navy located its new Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in Inyokern. This accounts for the length of the runways and the size of the county airport. The military base was subsequently moved to the east and the city of Ridgecrest was established as a commercial support center for that base.

==Present time==

Today Inyokern serves as a sparsely-populated bedroom community for workers on the base desiring a more rural lifestyle.

The town infrastructure consists of two churches, a post office, market and gas station, convenience store and gas station, a variety store, hardware store, welding and blacksmith shop, a county park, two restaurants, a motel, an autobody shop and several antique shops. In the 1990s the building which formerly housed the library was demolished and replaced by a Senior Citizen&#x27;s Center. Inyokern also had a now-closed Kern County Sheriff&#x27;s Office substation and a Caltrans road maintenance center and a motorcycle shop and blanket store. The town water and sewer system is managed by the Community Services Center. The population of the town peaked circa 1988 following a period of expansion on the naval base, but has dwindled since then, and many properties were abandoned during the military downsizing of the 1990s. Until the 1990s, the main commercial block of the town along highway 178 was a somewhat picturesque street of older buildings constructed of local rock and bricks, including a vintage post office, cafe, three bars, and a small Chinese restaurant. This street is sometimes used in filming Hollywood westerns. The Inyokern airport is used to film commercials.

==Environment==

Characterized by extreme aridity, Inyokern is situated in a wide valley at the base of the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Rugged mountains more than in elevation west of the area create a pronounced rain-shadow effect, resulting in a shrub-steppe habitat zone with annual rainfall of less than . The flora of the valley floor consists primarily of Creosote Bush (&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot;), Burrobush (&quot;Ambrosia dumosa&quot;), and several varieties of native bunch grasses. The transition zone of the nearby foothills also contain mixtures of pinyon pine, Joshua tree forests, and concentrated riparian habitat surrounding the small streams descending from the mountain peaks.

Wildlife ranges from black bear, mountain lion, and whitetail deer in the mountain and transition zones to the kangaroo rat and the endangered desert tortoise on the valley floor. A special note on the local wildlife is the local subspecies of rattlesnake, the Mojave rattlesnake (also called the Mojave green rattlesnake). This snake, which is common in the area, produces pit viper venom common to the general species but also produces a neuro-toxin that paralyzes the victim within 15 minutes. The subspecies is docile, and fatal bites are rare.
Indigenous animals that found in the valley floor are kit foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and roadrunners. Bears and mountain lions occasionally descend from the Sierra Nevada Mountains seeking food.

==Attractions==

As of 2008, Inyokern had the highest insolation of any locale on the North American continent, having over 355 days of sunshine each year.

As of 2018, the town was home to the past and current world champion musical saw players.

<text>Kernville is a census-designated place (CDP) in the southern Sierra Nevada, in Kern County, California, United States. Kernville is located northeast of Bakersfield, at an elevation of . The population was 1,549 at the 2020 United States census, up from 1,395 at the 2010 census, but below the 2000 census total of 1,736.

==History==
The Kern River was named after artist and topographer Edward Kern, who accompanied John C. Fremont on his 1845 expedition. They camped at what was a fork of two rivers, now the middle of Lake Isabella. An 1858 gold rush led to the formation of a town briefly called Rogersville, then Williamsburg, which was in 1863 renamed Whiskey Flat after a bar opened. In 1864, the town was renamed Kernville.

After decades of planning, the Isabella Dam project began in 1948. As a result, Kernville was relocated upstream to its present location at the tip of the northeast fork of the man-made lake, along with certain historic buildings. Downtown visibly retains Kernville&#x27;s gold rush and Old West roots, attracting tourists along with the area&#x27;s natural scenery and outdoor activities. The town&#x27;s original location is slightly east of Wofford Heights. Foundations and other remnants can still be seen when the lake is low. The famous Mountain Inn, built mainly to house movie stars and crew before the 1948 move, is now (partially) at the new Kernville, renamed the River View Lodge.

Whiskey Flat Days is the annual celebration of the area&#x27;s Wild West roots. A parade, historical re-enactments, pioneer-style camps, a carnival, street vendors and rodeo are just part of the festivities put on every President&#x27;s Day weekend and attended by thousands of visitors.

Even with its annual summer influx of tourists, Kernville remains one of the most quaint, conservative relics of early California. Many local families trace their lineage to original 19th century homesteaders. The post office, established at the original site in 1868, was moved to the new site in 1951.

The original townsite is now registered as California Historical Landmark #132.

<text>Lake Isabella (formerly, Isabella) is a census-designated place (CDP) in the southern Sierra Nevada, in Kern County, California, United States. It is named after the Lake Isabella reservoir and located at its southwestern edge, south of Wofford Heights in the Kern River Valley.

The town of Lake Isabella is located east-northeast of Bakersfield, at an elevation of . The population was 3,466 at the 2010 census, up from 3,315 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Lake Isabella is located in Hot Springs Valley, part of the Kern River Valley, at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , over 98% of it land.

Lake Isabella is at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Kern River. These rivers are &#x27;wild&#x27;, in that they are not controlled by any dam upstream. Upstream on the North Fork white water enthusiasts play in the spring and early summer. The famous Golden Trout originate in these rivers in the high country to the north.

==History==
The area was inhabited for millennia by the indigenous Tübatulabal and Owens Valley Paiute. Gold was discovered nearby in 1853, leading to a gold rush and the founding of Keyesville. The 1863 Keyesville massacre occurred a few miles north.

The town of Isabella was founded by Steven Barton in 1893 and named in honor of Queen Isabella of Spain while her name was popular during the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Lake Isabella was created in 1953 by a dam on the Kern River, forcing the town to move about south of the original site. The Isabella post office, which had opened in 1896, operated at the new site; the name was changed to Lake Isabella in 1957.

The dam&#x27;s reservoir also inundated the original site of Kernville. Like Isabella, it was relocated, along with several of its historic buildings, to higher ground.

The area is a joy for hikers, boaters, water skiers, fishermen, birders, hunters, wind surfers, kayakers, and other outdoor recreationists. Tourist trade is a major part of the area&#x27;s economy.

The first public library in Lamont was opened in June 1912. It was located in the Weedpatch home of Phoebe Wells. Growth was rapid in the Lamont region, with the influx of workers in the oil industry, and in 1935, the library was moved to a new building. In 1952, the Kern County Board of Supervisors purchased a lot to construct a building that would house the library and a public health center. The facility was opened in January 1953. The branch remained in that building until January 1974, when it was relocated to a newer and larger location. Five years later, the branch was moved yet again to the former Lamont Community Building. To meet the ever-growing needs projected for the population in 1990, construction for a new building was made possible through funds provided by the California State Library under the Library Services and Construction Act, Title II, Community Development Block Grant funds from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The old building was demolished, the new building was built, and opened to the public in early spring of 1998.

<text>Lebec is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in southwestern Kern County, California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,239.

==Geography==
Lebec is located in Castac Valley between the San Emigdio and Tehachapi Mountains. The community is one of the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass.

Lebec is south of Bakersfield.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Lebec has an area of . The community, which is near Tejon Pass, lies at an elevation of .

==History==
Lebec is named in honor of Peter Lebeck or Lebecque, a French trapper killed by a grizzly bear in 1837 in the area that later became Fort Tejon. He was memorialized in an epitaph at the site, found carved in a bare spot on an old oak tree. The epitaph read &quot;PETER LEBECK / KILLED BY A X BEAR / OCTR 17 / 1837.&quot; The bark of the oak tree eventually grew over the carving. A group from Bakersfield, called the Foxtail Rangers, removed the bark in the late 19th century and found the inscription in reverse on its underside. The piece is now displayed in the museum at Fort Tejon State Historic Park. 
Lieutenant R.S. Williamson camped at the same oak grove in 1853 while on a mid-1850s mapping mission for a practicable railway route from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. Geologist William P. Blake accompanied Williamson&#x27;s party. The area was garrisoned by the United States Army a year later, on August 10, 1854, as Fort Tejon, the first military fort in the California interior. The fort suffered extensive damage during the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake.

The first post office opened in 1895, having been transferred there from Tejon.

The Lebec Hotel was a large Spanish Colonial Revival-style hotel located on the Ridge Route in the community. It was built in 1921, and was popular with Hollywood executives and movie stars before World War II. It closed in 1968, and was demolished in 1971.

==Water district==
Lebec is served by the Lebec County Water District which was established in 1967 and began operation on April 21, 1969. In October 2011 the district approved a five-year contract with Applied Process Technology to manage the district.

The district serves 836 people, and in May 2012 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that individual sampling of the district&#x27;s water showed two contaminants above legal limits — alpha particle activity and Combined Uranium (picoCuries per liter). Two contaminants — lead (total) and uranium-228 — were below legal limits but above &quot;health guidelines&quot;.

In 2011–2012 a committee of the Kern County grand jury investigated complaints about the installation and connection of a private 12-inch line to the district&#x27;s water supply, by which a developer hoped to bring water to a hotel then planned for construction. The committee&#x27;s report claimed that the water line was laid without proper approval and that the &quot;subsequent opening of the hotel created a water shortage that lasted for at least five days.&quot; It was later determined that two men affiliated with the district&#x27;s governance, along with the hotel developers, constructed the water line across Cuddy Creek without a permit from California Department of Fish and Game which was obtained after the fact.

The Grand Jury committee also investigated &quot;a number of complaints&quot; alleging that the board violated the California Open Meetings Law, a.k.a. Brown Act, that it exceeded its authority and that it engaged in &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot;. The committee submitted its report in April 2012, finding, among other things, &quot;frequent bickering&quot; among governing board members and the public, &quot;highly irregular&quot; actions at a board meeting in December 2011, including the approval of a &quot;seemingly pre-designated slate&quot; of officers. The committee report stated that the water district &quot;is not operating in a manner that serves the best interests of the public&quot; and recommended &quot;formal training ... and conduct themselves accordingly or resign from the board.&quot;

The water district board replied that &quot;the Grand Jury&#x27;s findings are substantially incorrect&quot; and that the report was &quot;filled with opinion, unsubstantiated with actual facts&quot;.

The board voted on January 14, 2014, to open each meeting with a prayer &quot;prior to the Pledge of Allegiance at all future meetings&quot;, and president Michael Hightower opened the subsequent meeting, on February 11, &quot;with a call to stand for a minute of silence. He asked that all—including &#x27;atheists or agnostics, with their powers of positive thinking&#x27; and those that are faith-based, &#x27;with their prayers,&#x27;—to focus on the much-needed resource of rain.&quot;

==Businesses==
Lebec is the home of the Tejon Ranch Company. This ranch has been seen in movies such as &quot;The Kid Ranger&quot; (1936), &quot;Pals of Silver Sage&quot; (1940) and &quot;Wild Bill&quot; (1995).

The Kern County Sheriff&#x27;s Department provided police services to the citizens of Maricopa from 1998 until 2006 when the city reopened its police department in the old building.

As reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on July 4, 2011, the Maricopa Police Department has become embroiled in a local controversy playing out through large signs posted on the city&#x27;s main thoroughfare. The police have been accused of racial profiling and &quot;over-enforcement&quot; regarding traffic violations and frequent towing of vehicles driven by drivers without proof of insurance or with license or license plate infractions. In mid-2011, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jennie Pasquarella is quoted as saying, &quot;Maricopa has been a shining example of impoundments gone wrong,&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re essentially creating a racket to steal people&#x27;s cars.&quot;

The damage done during this era to the city of Maricopa&#x27;s reputation persists, as recently as May 2022, Reason magazine reported that, &quot;...the town of Maricopa gained a reputation for targeting drivers, especially farm workers, in the hopes that they&#x27;d be undocumented immigrants, thus allowing the small police department to impound their cars without much fuss.&quot;

==Transportation==
Maricopa lies at the junction of Route 166 and Route 33.

The City of Taft operates Taft-Maricopa Area Transit, with buses serving Taft and Maricopa.

<text>McFarland (formerly, Hunt and Lone Pine) is a city in the San Joaquin Valley, in Kern County, California, United States. McFarland is located north-northwest of Bakersfield and south of Delano, at an elevation of . The population of McFarland was 12,707 at the 2010 census and an estimated 15,506 as of 2019.
==History==

In the early 1900s, an educator named James Boyd McFarland moved to the Anaheim area from Zanesville, Ohio, to try his hand at real estate and walnut farming.

McFarland visited Kern County in 1907 and was impressed with the land&#x27;s crop-growing potential near a community called Hunt&#x27;s Siding, which was a small agriculture and livestock-based community that served about 50 families. With help from Bakersfield real estate businessman William Laird, McFarland bought 50 acres at the location of what is now McFarland.

The first post office opened in 1908. The town was founded in 1909 (and later became incorporated in 1957). McFarland grew tremendously during the Great Depression of the 1930s, then the population tapered off during World War II.

In 1950, the Highway 99 expressway and later freeway (then U.S. Route 99), the major corridor of the Central Valley, was constructed, which ended up dividing the town into an east side and west side. McFarland incorporated as a city in the summer of 1957. The name honors J.B. McFarland, the city&#x27;s founder.

In 2009 the city re-established its police force after decades of relying on the Kern County Sheriff.

In 2015, the movie &quot;McFarland USA&quot; was released, based on a true story that occurred at McFarland High School. &quot;McFarland USA&quot; follows the McFarland Cross Country team and their coach James White (portrayed by Kevin Costner).

<text>Mojave (formerly Mohave) is an unincorporated community in Kern County, California, United States. Mojave is located east of Bakersfield, and north of Los Angeles, at an elevation of . The town is located in the western region of the Mojave Desert, below and east of Oak Creek Pass and the Tehachapi Mountains. Mojave is on the Pacific Crest Trail.

The population was 4,238 at the 2010 census, up from 3,836 at the 2000 census. Telephone numbers in Mojave follow the format (661) 824-xxxx and the area includes three postal ZIP Codes.

==History==
The town of Mojave began in 1876 as a construction camp on the Southern Pacific Railroad. From 1884 to 1889, the town was the western terminus of the , twenty-mule team at Harmony Borax Works in Death Valley. It later served as headquarters for construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct.
===Mojave Airport: aviation and military use===
Located near Edwards Air Force Base, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, and Palmdale Regional Airport, Mojave has a rich aerospace history. Besides being a general-use public airport, Mojave has three main areas of activity: flight testing, space industry development, and aircraft heavy maintenance and storage. The closest airfield to the city, formerly known as the Mojave Airport, is now part of the Mojave Air and Space Port.

In 1935, Kern County established the Mojave Airport east of town to serve the gold and silver mining industry in the area. The airport consisted of two dirt runways, one of which was oiled, but it lacked any fueling or servicing facilities. In 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Board began improvements to the airport for national defense purposes that included two asphalt runways and an adjacent taxiway. Kern County agreed the airport could be taken over by the military in the event of war.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. Marine Corps took over the airport and expanded it into Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station (MCAAS) Mojave. The two existing runways were extended and a third one added. Barracks were constructed to house 2,734 male and 376 female military personnel. Civilian employment at the base would peak at 176. The Marines would eventually spend more than $7 million on the base, which totaled .

Many of the Corps&#x27; World War II aces received their gunnery training at Mojave. During World War II, Mojave hosted 29 aircraft squadrons, four Carrier Aircraft Service Detachments, and three Air Warning Squadrons. At its peak, the air station had 145 training and other aircraft. Mojave also had a swimming pool that was used to train aviators in emergency water egress and for recreation. The base&#x27;s 900-seat auditorium hosted several USO shows that featured Bob Hope, Frances Langford and Marilyn Maxwell.

With the end of WWII, MCAAS was decommissioned on February 7, 1946; a U.S. Navy Air Station was established the same day. The Navy used the airport for drone operations for less than a year, closing it on January 1, 1947. The base remained closed for four years until the outbreak of the Korean War. Mojave was reactivated as an auxiliary landing field to MCAS El Toro. The airport was recommissioned as a MCAAS on December 31, 1953. Squadrons used Mojave for ordnance training when El Toro had bad weather. Marine Corps reserve units were temporarily deployed to Mojave for two week periods. MCAAS Mojave personnel peaked at 400 military and 200 civilians during this period.

In 1961, after the USMC transferred operations to MCAS El Centro, Kern County obtained title to the airport. In February 1972, the East Kern Airport District (EKAD) was formed to administer the airport; EKAD maintains the airport to this day. To a great extent EKAD was the brainchild of Dan Sabovich who heavily lobbied the state for the airport district&#x27;s creation and ran EKAD until 2002.

During the 1970s, Mojave Airport was served by commuter air carrier Golden West Airlines with scheduled passenger flights operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops direct to Los Angeles (LAX).

===Mojave Air and Space Port===
On November 20, 2012, the EKAD Board of Directors voted to change the name of the district to the Mojave Air and Space Port. Officials said that the spaceport name is well known around the world, but EKAD is not. The change took effect on January 1, 2013.

The airport is now the home of various aerospace companies and institutions such as Scaled Composites and the civilian National Test Pilot School. The town was home to the Rutan Voyager, the first aircraft to fly around the world nonstop and unrefueled. The airport is also the first inland spaceport in the United States, and was the location of the first private spaceflight, the launch of SpaceShipOne on June 21, 2004.

Mojave also has a Mojave Transportation Museum.

<text>North Edwards (formerly, Edgemont Acres and North Muroc) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kern County, California. Situated in the Mojave Desert, North Edwards is located about north-east of Edwards Air Force Base, at an elevation of . As of the 2010 census it had a population of 1,058.

==History==
A developer announced in June 1955 that he was building houses on Clay Mine Road, within of the north gate of the military installation. Soon construction was underway by other builders. In March 1960, the &quot;Boron Enterprise&quot; reported that in the &quot;bustling community&quot; north of the base, more than 1,000 residents were living in a half dozen subdivisions. In the following year, the community was named North Edwards.

A chamber of commerce was organized in October 1958. It aimed to advance the civic, commercial, and industrial interests of the community, as well as foster beneficial social developments. Moreover, the organization hoped to exert &quot;controlled guidance&quot; in the community rather than allow &quot;uncontrolled mushroom growth&quot;. By August 1957, volunteer firemen were constructing a fire station and receiving instruction in fire fighting from Kern County firemen stationed at Boron. The county assigned the volunteers a fire engine. Construction of the first phase of a shopping center began in March 1959 and it was ready for business by October. Thomas Stovall, formerly a Bakersfield retailer, opened a supermarket. Soon other merchants joined him. After the consolidation of several local water companies, two remained to serve the community, the Edgemont Acres Mutual Water Company organized in October 1960 and the North Edwards Water District formed in January 1987.

In May 1967 the Chamber of Commerce sponsored a community event called Western Silver Days. In a parade were a variety of floats, decorated cars, and marching units. Food was available at the firehouse and the local merchants and those of Boron donated goods and services as door prizes. Under the pastorate of the Reverend Thomas Morgan, the First Southern Baptist Church was built in June 1959. Subsequently, several other churches became a part of the community. In November 1964, the Muroc Joint Unified School District authorized a school. Upon its opening in November 1966, it accommodated kindergarten through third grade. Before opening a post office in the area of North Edwards-North Muroc, the postal authorities required the selection of a name that a majority of residents favored. Reaching an agreement proved to be difficult, and the problem was solved by establishing &quot;Contract Branch No. 1 of the Edwards Post Office&quot; in September 1959. In June 1961 the Chamber of Commerce and the Community League sponsored a postcard election with the understanding that all who cast votes would be willing to accept the outcome. The winning name was North Edwards and the post office opened in September 1961 with Nevajoe Roush as the postmaster.

The Kern County Planning Commission recognized North Edwards as a town in January 1963.

North Edwards was also the first town to have a woman as president of the Chamber of Commerce, Ann L. Campen. She served until her death on August 15, 1973. She was responsible for having Clay Mine Road paved, also for having telephone service to Aerial Acres, she was a representative for Barry Goldwater Jr., and she helped organize an annual community parade for North Edwards and Boron Ca. bringing some famous people as Grand Marshall&#x27;s to participate in the parades. Being an American Indian and born on a reservation, there is no real record of her birth, she always told her grandchildren at every birthday, she was 58.

For mostly reasons of economic viability, several prior establishments have been closed over the years, including 20 Mule Team Cafe, a bar &amp; restaurant (The Bubbi North formerly The Red Barn), pizza parlor (Chuck&#x27;s Pizza), hardware store (Hillman&#x27;s True Value), movie rental, bowling alley (due to arson), and the local elementary school (Richard B. Lynch). Today, the town serves mainly as a bedroom community for those wishing to live near either Edwards Air Force Base or the U.S. Borax mine in Boron.

<text>Pine Mountain Club is an unincorporated community in southwestern Kern County, California. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 2,422. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Pine Mountain Club as a census-designated place (CDP). It is one of the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass.

==Geography==
Pine Mountain Club has an area of . It ranges from in elevation. The community sits in a deep valley of the San Emigdio Mountains, on the San Andreas Fault. It is surrounded by Los Padres National Forest. The settlement lies between Apache Saddle and Pinon Pines Estates along Mil Potrero Highway. It is west of Frazier Park, Lebec, and Interstate 5.

==History==

===Founding and development===

Pine Mountain Club was developed in 1971 by Tenneco. The first announcement was made from Houston, Texas, in April of that year when the company said it would develop &quot;more than 1.1 million acres of land in Arizona and Southern California.&quot; Tenneco was the Bakersfield-based western land-development arm of Tenneco, Inc., of Houston.

About half that acreage was to be in Kern County, where the projects would include the residential development of 6,500 acres surrounding the then-new California State College near Bakersfield and 3,200 acres in the Los Padres National Forest, also mostly for residences (Pine Mountain Club).

The forest project was to set aside a thousand acres for vacation home sites and 2,200 acres &quot;for permanent preservation in their natural state.&quot; The program was to be directed by John E. Sommerhalder, president of Tenneco West. The land was part of a 3,200-acre tract of pine forest and meadowland, formerly a private preserve.

Tenneco West was a Bakersfield subsidiary that administered all the western holdings of Tenneco, &quot;the parent, Houston-based, multi-industry company.&quot;

Adjacent to the clubhouse will be a nine-hole executive golf course[,] and other recreational facilities are a heated swimming pool, archery range, volleyball and basketball courts, a lake stocked with fish and a community barbecue area.

Tenneco West President Sommerhalder said the club was believed to be among the largest all-electric family recreational resorts in California. Three kinds of &quot;vacation or weekend homesites&quot; were to be offered: (1) One- to three-bedroom dwellings, (2) modular homes, and (3) space for mobile homes.

Hiking trails, bridle trails (16 miles marked for from one-hour to all-day rides), an equestrian center with 10-stall barn, tack room, riding ring and corrals for boarding horses also will be available. . . . Later this year, a general store and laundromat will be added.

The prices were estimated to begin from about $13,500 for a one-bedroom house and lot.

At the time of the announcement in 1971, &quot;four deep wells&quot; had already been sunk and an &quot;extensive network of reservoirs and pipelines&quot; laid, with a filtration plant near the commercial center.
Sommerhalder said the developer had the &quot;assistance of Simon Eisner, nationally known environmental planner.&quot;

Eight months after the opening, seventy-nine percent of the 1,309 purchasers indicated in a survey that construction of a vacation home was the prime reason for buying a lot and 43% of that group said they intended to start building during 1972.

The development&#x27;s sixth and final section, on a plateau some thousand feet higher than the clubhouse, went on sale in March 1973.

===Mil Potrero Highway===

Tenneco West improved a &quot;winding, steep, one-lane dirt road&quot; called &quot;Mil Potrero&quot; west from Pine Mountain Club to California State Highway 33 into a &quot;comfortable, convenient and safe way . . . to view what is generally regarded as Southern California&#x27;s most strikingly beautiful scene.&quot; The cost for the 6.5-mile segment was estimated at nearly a million dollars. John E. Sommerhalder, the company president, said the road opened up &quot;a large segment of the [Los Padres National] forest that, until now, has been almost inaccessible.&quot;

The job was unusually difficult, partly because of the mountainous terrain and partly because of protective and restorative measures taken to reduce to a minimum the disturbance to the natural surroundings. . . . The project had to conform to the specifications and requirements of both Kern County and the U.S. Forest Service. In effect, it is already a public road, although Tenneco must maintain it for a year before the formal dedication as a public road can take place.

To keep damages to the forest at a minimum, contractors Yeager Construction of Riverside and Desert Construction of Victorville were required to do all the work from the existing right-of-way and forbidden to build a temporary construction road alongside. Fire-protection equipment had to be on hand at all times.

===Fruition===

By 1988, Pine Mountain Club had a small commercial district with about forty businesses, ranging from an Exxon gas station to a place called &quot;Pheasants by Frank.&quot; According to the &quot;Newhall Signal,&quot; the district was &quot;more or less shut down on Mondays and Tuesdays . . . because there are so many people with weekend homes that the stores choose to stay open Saturday and Sunday.&quot;

On July 31, 2021, the community celebrated its fiftieth birthday with a barbecue picnic on blankets spread beneath the trees next to the golf course. Also noted was the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Mil Potrero Mutual Water Company.

==Demographics==

===2010 census===
The 2010 United States Census reported that Pine Mountain Club had a population of 2,315. The population density was . The racial makeup was 2,079 (89.8%) white, 29 (1.3%) African American, 25 (1.1%) Native American, 45 (1.9%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 58 (2.5%) from other races, and 79 (3.4%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 231 persons (10.0%).

There were 1,062 households, of which 226 (21.3%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 585 (55.1%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 62 (5.8%) had a female householder with no husband present, and 36 (3.4%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 49 (4.6%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 13 (1.2%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. Three hundred eighteen households (29.9%) were made up of individuals, and 111 (10.5%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18. There were 683 families (64.3% of all households); the average family size was 2.68 persons.

Four hundred eleven people (17.8%) were under the age of 18, 105 were (4.5%) aged 18 to 24, 355 (15.3%) aged 25 to 44, 929 (40.1%) aged 45 to 64, and 515 (22.2%) 65 years or older. The median age was 51.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.9 males. For every 100 women age 18 and over, there were 103.2 men.

There were 2,181 housing units at an average density of , of which 880 (82.9%) were owner-occupied, and 182 (17.1%) were renter-occupied. The homeowner vacancy rate was 6.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 17.8%. Exactly 1,884 people (81.4% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 431 (18.6%) in rentals.

===2000 census===

The 2000 census found that almost 91 percent of the sixteen hundred residents were white. There were nine blacks. There were 146 Hispanics or Latinos of any race. Other residents included 19 American Indians or Alaska natives and 12 Asians.

It was a relatively aged population, the median age being 45 years compared with 35 years for the nation as a whole. PMC also had more veterans than its share — 263, or 21 percent, compared to 13 percent around the country. In contrast with the country at large, where 64 percent of the people were working, Pine Mountain Club had just 56 percent employed. Those who were working had to travel about an hour to their jobs, compared to 25 minutes for most Americans.

It was a high-income area — $62,750 median family income, compared to $50,046 in the nation at large. In per capita income, it stood at $25,465 — just between Diamond Bar and Mira Monte among other towns in California.

Yet there were still 55 families (or 15 percent) below the poverty level in Pine Mountain Club in 2000. That is greater than the 12 percent for the country as a whole.

Almost two-thirds of its 1,737 housing units (61.5 percent) were vacant when the census was taken in March 2000. Owners lived in about eight of every 10 occupied units (84 percent), renters in the other two (16 percent).

==Community management==

The PMC community is managed by the Pine Mountain Club Property Owners Association, Inc., which is governed by a nine-member volunteer board of directors and a group of documents: the Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;R&#x27;s ), bylaws, the association rules, and an Environmental Control (EC) code . The association maintains several recreational facilities , including a nine-hole golf course, pool, clubhouse, and stables. It manages the Pine Mountain Patrol and publishes a monthly newspaper, the &quot;Condor&quot; .

==Education==
Pine Mountain Club is part of the El Tejon Unified School District, and students are transported by bus to local public schools, including Frazier Mountain High School. The community hosts a charter school, Peak to Peak Mountain Charter, serving grades kindergarten through seventh.

==Transportation==
Kern Regional Transit provides bus service Thursdays and Saturdays during the summer to Frazier Park, Gorman, Lake of the Woods, Lebec, and Pinon Pines. It offers a dial-a-ride service all year. Connections can be made in Frazier Park or Lebec to a scheduled service to Grapevine and Bakersfield and further connection there to Greyhound and Amtrak.

==Economy ==
The area is served by the Mountain Communities Chamber of Commerce.

==Wildlife ==
Black bears began commonly disturbing the community by breaking into homes and vehicles around 2014. Considered a human-black bear conflict zone by wildlife authorities, the issue is a challenge for the community especially when the bears emerge from their winter hibernation to search for food in the spring.

<text>Randsburg (formerly Rand Camp) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kern County, California, United States. Randsburg is located south of Ridgecrest, at an elevation of . The population was 69 in the 2010 census, down from 77 in the 2000 census.

==Geography==

Randsburg is located at . It is on the west side of U.S. Route 395 between Kramer Junction to the south and Ridgecrest to the north. Randsburg is in the Rand Mountains, and is separated by a ridge from the neighboring community of Johannesburg.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , over 99% of it land.

==Climate==
Randsburg has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) found on the western edge of the Mojave Desert with very hot, dry summers and cool winters.

==History==
Gold was discovered by Frederic Mooers, John Singleton and Charles Burcham at Yellow Aster Mine on 25 April 1895 and a mining camp quickly formed named Rand Camp. Both mine and camp were named after the gold mining region in South Africa. 

The Yellow Aster was the first of many gold mines that quickly developed around Rand Camp. The Rand Mining District was created on 20 December 1895. By the end of 1896, the camp was renamed to Randsburg and more than 1500 people lived there. The first post office at Randsburg opened in 1896. By October 1897, the mining district had produced over $600,000 of gold. In 1899, the first stamp mill opened at Yellow Aster.

To expand production at Yellow Aster, a well was dug at Goler and water was pumped up to the mine serving a second mill. This and other district mines were making substantial profits, but pay for the workers was poor and a strike was called in 1903. Yellow Aster&#x27;s production declined during the First World War, and it closed in 1918. It reopened in 1921 and worked intermittently until 1933 when it was taken over by the Anglo-American Mining Corporation, who sold it in 1940 to John Cummings &amp; Co who worked it until 1956.

In 1983, Glamis Gold purchased Yellow Aster. They untopped the mine. By 2006 all remaining gold-bearing rock had been extracted, and operations ceased for the final time.

==Tourism==
The town has an influx of tourists throughout the year. Most visitors arrive between autumn and spring due to the extreme heat in summer. The annual Western Days Celebration starts in the third weekend of September, where the town hosts events such as gun fights, panning for gold, live bands, dances and vendors. During Thanksgiving and New Year&#x27;s Day weekend, off-roading enthusiasts visit via the town&#x27;s legal off-roading trail. Local shops are usually closed on weekdays, and open during weekends.

Rand Mining District California Historical Landmark reads:
:&quot;NO. 938 RAND MINING DISTRICT - The Yellow Aster, or Rand, mine was discovered in April 1895 by Singleton, Burcham, and Mooers. The town of Randsburg quickly developed, followed by the supply town of Johannesburg in 1896. Both names were adopted from the profusion of minerals resembling those of the ranch mining district in South Africa. In 1907, Churchill discovered tungsten in Atolia. In June 1919, Williams and Nosser discovered the California Rand Silver Mine at Red Mountain.&quot;

<text>Ridgecrest is a city in Kern County, California, United States, along U.S. Route 395 in the Indian Wells Valley in northeastern Kern County, adjacent to the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake (NAWS, or China Lake). It was incorporated as a city in 1963. The population was 27,959 at the 2020 census, up slightly from 27,616 at the 2010 census, making it the third-largest city in Kern County.

Ridgecrest is surrounded by four mountain ranges; the Sierra Nevada on the west, the Coso Range on the north, the Argus Range on the east, and the El Paso Mountains on the south. The most isolated community in Kern county, it is approximately from the Lancaster/Palmdale area, from Bakersfield, and from San Bernardino, the three nearest major urban centers. Private air travel in and out of the city is provided through the Inyokern Airport. There are currently no scheduled commercial flights.

The city has been near the epicenter of major earthquakes, including one in 1995 and a series of quakes in July 2019.

==History==
Native American tribes of the Paiute, Shoshone, and Kawaiisu thrived in the Indian Wells Valley. The Shoshone tribe left behind petroglyphs in the Coso Range that can be found in Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons. Their petroglyphs and artwork are displayed in the Maturango Museum and Petroglyph Park.

During the mid-1800s, travelers began crossing through the Indian Wells Valley. In 1826, Jedediah Smith&#x27;s beaver trappers arrived, followed in 1834 by Joseph Walker when he crossed Walker Pass into the Indian Wells Valley. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, mining booms brought more settlers to the valley. In the 1880s, Chinese railroad workers briefly settled in the area, giving local China Lake its name. 

Until the 20th century, non-permanent settlers had arrived and traveled throughout the Indian Wells Valley. This changed, however, when the Los Angeles Aqueduct was built and finished from 1908-1913. This, plus the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad brought lasting settlers to the Indian Wells Valley.

The settlement that would eventually become Ridgecrest began as a farming community called Crumville in 1912, honoring James and Robert Crum, local dairymen. The first post office opened in 1941. By 1943, Ridgecrest had grown to 115 homes and 196 residents. Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS) was established in November 1943, providing a strong job base for the years to come.

Ridgecrest incorporated in 1963. During this era the growth of Ridgecrest was governed by the continuing needs of the high tech industries coupled to the Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) programs for testing arms and guidance systems. Today, the city serves as an essential housing and business community for NAWS China Lake.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and of it (3.04%) is water. Ridgecrest is located in Indian Wells Valley, which is a southern extension of Owens Valley, broken up by the volcanic Coso Range.

===1995 earthquake===
The area, associated with the Eastern California Shear Zone, has in the past experienced numerous earthquake swarms, groups of several thousand quakes under magnitude 6.0 or so, often with no obvious mainshock. The 1995 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence started on August 17, when a magnitude 5.4 quake, centered north of the town of Ridgecrest, shook the area and spawned over 2,500 aftershocks over the course of the following five weeks. Then, on September 20, 1995, the second large quake struck the area: it measured magnitude 5.8, and was at that time the largest earthquake to hit southern California since the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

=== 2019 earthquakes ===
Between July 4 and 5, 2019, the city of Ridgecrest and surrounding communities experienced a series of significant earthquakes, including the strongest to impact the area in decades—a magnitude 7.1 mainshock. The epicenter of the main earthquake was located approximately 10 miles northeast of Ridgecrest.

The sequence began on July 4 with a 4.0-magnitude quake approximately southwest of Searles Valley. Later that morning, at 10:33 A.M., a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck around southwest of Searles Valley. This initial sequence triggered over 1,400 aftershocks in the Ridgecrest and Searles Valley regions.

On July 5, 2019, at 8:19 P.M., the magnitude 7.1 mainshock, known as the Ridgecrest mainshock occurred, significantly impacting the Ridgecrest area. 

=== Climate ===

<text>Rosamond is an unincorporated community in Kern County, California, US, near the Los Angeles county line. Rosamond is part of Greater Los Angeles and is located in the Mojave Desert just north of Lancaster and Palmdale, the two largest cities in the Antelope Valley. As of the 2020 Census, Rosamond&#x27;s population was 21,071. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Rosamond as a census-designated place (CDP).

Rosamond is a suburban bedroom community with many residents employed by nearby Edwards Air Force Base or commuting to Los Angeles, Lancaster, and Palmdale for work. The town is about 15 minutes north of the Lancaster Metrolink station providing direct access to Los Angeles Union Station in just two hours. It has few grocery stores such as Grocery Outlet, Albertsons and Dollar General. 

==History==
Rosamond was established in 1877 as a townsite owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad; it was named for the daughter of one of the railroad&#x27;s officials. The first local industries were mining and cattle. During the 1890s, gold was discovered in the area, quickly drawing miners and prospectors. After the initial boom, gold mining gradually declined, though it had a second, smaller boom during the 1930s. In 1933, Muroc Army Air Field was established some miles away; it was later renamed Edwards Air Force Base in honor of fallen test pilot Glenn Edwards.

The Rosamond post office opened in 1885, closed in 1887, and re-opened in 1888.

===1932 Ford V-8 endurance test===
In July 1932, racing driver Eddie Pullen and his team demonstrated the endurance of the newly developed Ford V-8 engine, by driving a Ford V-8, model 18, in 33 days, in the Mojave desert near Rosamond. The average speed was over course of of difficult desert terrain, where temperatures were as high as . Fuel consumption averaged .

==Geography==
Rosamond sits in the northern end of the Antelope Valley, the westernmost valley of the Mojave Desert. Because the elevation is above sea level, the area, like the other parts of the Mojave Desert region, is referred to as &quot;the High Desert&quot;. Some cities and communities within the trading area of Rosamond include Lancaster, Palmdale, Hi Vista, Roosevelt, Redman, Lake Los Angeles, Quartz Hill, and Mojave. Residents of these desert cities and unincorporated communities share Sierra Highway, Angeles Forest Highway, Angeles Crest Highway (State Route 2), and the Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14) for commutes to the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles Basin in order to get to work.

Willow Springs lies west of Rosamond and was a watering hole for stagecoach travelers for generations, though its springs have since dried up. Willow Springs Raceway is nearby, which hosts a variety of motor racing events, attracting people from all over Southern California and beyond.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.41%) is water. The Census Bureau definition of the area may not precisely correspond to the local understanding of the historical area of the community.

<text>Shafter is a city in Kern County, California, United States. It is located west-northwest of Bakersfield. The population was 16,988 at the 2010 census, up from 12,736 at the 2000 census. The city is located along State Route 43. Suburbs of Shafter include Myricks Corner, North Shafter, Smith Corner, and Thomas Lane.

==History==

The city of Shafter began as a loading dock along the Santa Fe Railroad (former San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad) right-of-way. The community was named for General William Rufus Shafter who commanded US Forces in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Property was sold beginning in 1914 and the city incorporated on January 11, 1938.

The first post office opened in 1898, moved in 1902, closed in 1905. A new postal service started in 1914.

Shafter is home to Minter Field, which began operations in June 1941 and saw heavy use during World War II. Approximately 7,000 troops were stationed at the airstrip which hosted up to 600 prisoners of war as well. It is publicly owned and administered by the Minter Field Airport District and serves as an industrial center and airport for crop dusters and private aircraft. The Minter Field Museum is maintained on location as well.

The first truly successful human powered airplane, the Gossamer Condor, piloted by Bryan Allen won the Kremer prize on August 23, 1977, at Shafter&#x27;s Minter Field. Allen piloted, and powered, the Paul MacCready designed airplane along the one mile long figure &#x27;8&#x27; course with two 10 foot high obstacles as specified by the Royal Aeronautical Society to claim the £50,000 prize. A California State Monument is located at the field for this event.

The Shafter Historical Society maintains two other museums. The Green Hotel and the Shafter Depot Museum emphasize various aspects of the daily lives of Shafter residents in years past; both structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2009, a Shafter High School senior, Anna Jelmini, received the key to the city for placing in the Junior Olympics. She also fell just short of meeting the standards for the 2008 Olympics.

In 2013 Shafter celebrated the 100 year anniversary of its founding. The Centennial Celebration included several events highlighting the history of the town, including a flyover of a PT-13 Training Plane that was stationed at Minter Field during World War II.

<text>Taft (formerly Moron, Moro, and Siding Number Two) is a city in the foothills at the extreme southwestern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, in Kern County, California. Taft is located west-southwest of Bakersfield, at an elevation of . The population was 9,327 at the 2010 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .

It was named for President William Howard Taft in 1909.

==History==
The town began as Siding Number Two on the Sunset Railroad. According to a display at the West Kern Oil Museum, local residents asked the Southern Pacific Railroad if the station could be named &quot;Moro&quot; when the rails arrived in about 1900, but a railroad official declined because the name would be too easily confused with the coastal town of Morro Bay. Instead, the railroad directed the station be called Moron, a word which as yet had no association with lack of intelligence (cf. Spanish word for hillock, ). Pictures of local businesses, including the Moron Pharmacy, hang in the museum.

After a fire burned much of the town, the name was changed to Taft in honor of William Howard Taft.

Taft was once a sundown town that posted &quot;No Colored Allowed&quot; signs.

===Oil industry===

Taft is situated in a major petroleum and natural gas production region in California and is one of the few remaining towns in the United States which exist exclusively because of nearby oil reserves. The discovery of oil in the region occurred in the late 19th century near Maricopa, south of Taft. Many other oil and gas accumulations were discovered around Taft during the early-to-mid-20th century, notably the Midway field (near Fellows, California), the Sunset field (later found to be part of the same trend, accounting for the modern combined name of Midway-Sunset), and the Buena Vista. The town is built directly between these two huge fields. The operational activities within these fields, as well as the Elk Hills Oil Field, South Belridge Oil Field, North Belridge Oil Field, Cymric Oil Field, and McKittrick Oil Field north of Taft, have been the economic lifeblood of the town for over 100 years.

The super-giant Midway-Sunset field has produced nearly of crude oil, most of it heavy gravity (13-14 degrees API). Enhanced oil recovery operations in the form of steam production and injection have been used on the thick viscous crude oil of the Midway-Sunset field since the mid-to-late-1960s. The reservoirs of the Midway-Sunset field are composited layers of mostly unconsolidated sandstones of late Miocene age, shallowly buried. The shallow burial depth and ideal nature of the sandstones make them almost perfectly suited for steam injection. As a result, the amount of oil that can be recovered has greatly increased.

Standard Oil, later the Standard Oil Company of California (modern Chevron), made Taft its corporate operational headquarters. At one time, it is reported that as many as 6,000 inhabitants of Taft were employed by Standard Oil. The hub of this activity was &quot;11-C Camp&quot;, so named due to its survey township location in section 11 and designated &quot;township C&quot; by Standard&#x27;s mapping department. The infrastructure to run a large oil and gas company included: a rail spur from the line running through Taft, steel and timber for derrick construction and maintenance, pipe, valves, numerous offices, an expansive and highly specialized machine shop, supply shops, the car and truck fleet on one side of the Main Street; bunkhouses for workers, and fourteen blocks on four streets of company homes for employees on the other side. 11-C Camp also included a playground, baseball field, tennis courts, a swimming pool, a cook-house open to the public, landscaped grounds, a clubhouse with a television, pool and card tables, and an ice-cream stand. The huge complex gradually closed down over a period of many years. In 1968, Standard Oil of California moved its accounting and finance offices to Concord, California. In the late 1980s, the machine shop was closed and auctioned, signaling the end of the 11-C Camp era. The houses were moved outside the camp into a new neighborhood.

Many other oil companies had operations in the area, including larger companies such as Shell, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil, Gulf, and ARCO, as well as smaller operations (but with a large local presence), such as Santa Fe Energy, Berry Petroleum, Tannehill, M.H. Whittier, and lately Plains Exploration &amp; Production. In the mid-1990s, according to California&#x27;s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), there were 68 operating companies working the Midway-Sunset field alone. While the names of most of these companies have changed, due to mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations, the production activities have been continuous.

In the early days of oil exploration and production, long before the advent of modern blowout preventions, gushers were the norm. Although there were many, the Lakeview Gusher gushed more than any, producing of oil per day at its peak. In all, the Lakeview No.1 produced about of oil (a very respectable cumulative production for a single well in this area). The well and its State historical marker can be found along the Petroleum Club road, just off SR 33 south of town.

===Recent history===
Taft was also the site of a military airfield, Gardner Army Airfield, which was used to train pilots during World War II. After the base was closed, its abandoned airstrip served as a clandestine dragstrip for many years.

The railroad—originally built to export crude oil and import drinking water—is gone, but the area still has a significant oil industry presence.

A private prison, Taft Correctional Institution, operated by Management &amp; Training Corporation under contract to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, is located on Cadet Road south of town. There is a large, modern high school serving area students. The West Kern Oil Museum, at 1168 Wood Street, has vast holdings, including pumps, fire apparatus, trucks, a historic wooden derrick, photos, models, and extensive displays of local history back to Indian times. The town&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Midway Driller&quot;, was reputed to be the oldest daily newspaper in California. About 2005, the &quot;Daily Midway Driller&quot; became the &quot;Midway Driller&quot; and is now published on Tuesdays and Fridays. The town&#x27;s second weekly newspaper, the &quot;Taft Independent&quot;, began publication on July 4, 2006.

The city owns a in the center of town which features the West Kern Oilworker&#x27;s Monument, a tall bronze sculpture that features several human figures displayed on an oil derrick by artist Benjamin Victor that was paid for with donations from local residents, visitors and several oil companies. The railroad property is part of a redevelopment project that the city is using to attract new businesses, housing and commercial office space.

==Arts and culture==
In October 2010 Taft had its 100-year birthday.

Every five years during October, Taft holds a birthday celebration. This event began as a parade and civic luncheon, commemorating Taft&#x27;s 20th birthday in November 1930. These celebrations were held every five years until World War II, during which time none were held.

After the war, in 1946, the celebrations began again and the Taft District Chamber of Commerce made them permanent. A contest was held to choose a name for the event, and &quot;Oildorado&quot; was chosen, having been submitted by W.A. Poff.

Oildorado is a week long celebration honoring the history of Taft as a place of oil production and exploration. There are several oilfield-type skill contests, including: welding, pipe threading and fitting, rod wrenching, various skill tests with a backhoe, and at least as late as 1965 a regular well-pulling contest with local well-servicing rigs and crews. Owing to safety and probably liability issues, the well-pulling contests ceased.

Additionally, there is a beauty pageant where an Oildorado Queen is selected, a facial hair growing contest, talent shows, barbecues, street fairs, parades, and in 2005, motocross races. People usually dress in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat throughout the week.

It is also customary for all men to grow facial hair during this time. If a man does not grow facial hair, he must pay for a permit and wear a bolo tie or lapel pin called a Smooth Puss Badge. If he is caught clean-shaven without his badge, he may be arrested by the Posse, a group of men dressed in western garb, sporting pistols and rifles filled with blanks and, of course, facial hair. The man will be placed in a jail truck called &quot;The Hoosegow&quot; and driven around town for an hour for all to see. Warrants may also be purchased to have somebody else arrested and placed in The Hoosegow.

The Posse is overseen by the Grand Marshal. The group patrols the streets, schools, and businesses and engages in make-believe shootouts with the Bandits (the Wooden Nickel Gang), who customarily wear bandanna masks on their faces.

Other staples of this week-long celebration include wooden nickels, dinner theatres, classic car shows, and rodeos.

==Attractions==

<text>Tehachapi (; Kawaiisu: &quot;Tihachipia&quot;, meaning &quot;hard climb&quot;) is a city in Kern County, California, United States, in the Tehachapi Mountains, at an elevation of , between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert. Tehachapi is east-southeast of Bakersfield, and west of Mojave. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of and a population of 14,414. The Tehachapi area is known for the nearby Tehachapi Loop (a popular railfan site), the Pacific Crest Trail and for the excellent conditions for the aerial sport of gliding.

==History==

The Kawaiisu people (also Nuwu (&quot;people&quot; in Kawaiisu), or Nuooah) are the Native American tribe whose homeland was the Tehachapi Valley, and seasonally the southern Sierra Nevada and Mojave Desert, for thousands of years.

One possibility for the origin of the name Tehachapi comes from the Kawaiisu language. It may be derived from the word for &quot;hard climb&quot; or &quot;tihachipia&quot;, according to the Tomi-Kahni Resource Center. The settlement has been formerly known and spelled as: Tehachapai; Tehachapa; Tehachepi; Tehachipi; and Summit Station. According to Yokuts informant Wahumchah, recorded by anthropologist Frank Forrest Latta, &quot;Tehachapi&quot; derives from a Yokuts-Ute amalgam, from Yokuts &quot;taheech[e]&quot; &quot;oak-covered flat&quot; + Ute &quot;pah&quot;&#x27; &quot;water&quot; (cl. Pah-ute, lit. &#x27;Water Ute&#x27;). On an 1864 map of California, the name appears as &quot;Taheechepah.&quot;

The original settlement in the Tehachapi Valley, once called Williamsburg or &#x27;Tehichipa&#x27;, was founded in the 1860s. Now known as ‘Old Town’, it was located four miles west of present-day downtown Tehachapi and was an important station on the road linking the San Joaquin Valley with Southern California. It is now registered as California Historical Landmark #643 for being the oldest settlement in the Tehachapi Valley.

In 1869, Peter D. Greene, a gold prospector and rancher who originally arrived in 1856, was appointed postmaster of a new post office near the Tomlinson Stage Company station at Oak Creek to be called ‘Tehichipa’, which was the only post office in the area. In 1875, Greene founded the community of Greenwich three miles east of Williamsburg and was appointed postmaster there.

Under the leadership of civil engineer J.B. Harris, the Southern Pacific Railroad line through the Tehachapi Pass was completed in July 1876 and became the final link connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles. A telegraph office near the railroad tracks located one mile east of Greenwich was the first structure on the empty plain and would become the site of the Tehachapi Railroad Depot and the beginning of the downtown core. The depot is now on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)—and was the oldest building in downtown Tehachapi until it burned in June 2008. The building had been in the final stages of becoming a museum. It has since been rebuilt using the original plans with only minor modifications to meet modern building codes. The new depot was dedicated on June 5, 2010.

The new railroad town was given the name of Tehachapi Summit, and Williamsburg and Greenwich, having been bypassed by the railroad, saw their population decline as many of the area&#x27;s residents moved to the new town. In 1885, Greene moved the post office to Tehachapi Summit, the postal name was later changed to ‘Tehachapi’ in 1893. The town was incorporated on August 13, 1909.

===1952 Kern County earthquake===

Tehachapi experienced the 7.3 magnitude 1952 Kern County earthquake on the White Wolf Fault. At the time, the earthquake was the largest in Southern California in the twentieth century and the largest since the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake. It was felt as far away as Reno, Nevada. Twelve people died in the quake and severe damage was done to buildings and rail lines in the area.

==Geography==
===Faults===
Downtown Tehachapi is approximately from the White Wolf Fault, from the Garlock Fault and from the San Andreas Fault. The 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake on the San Andreas Fault had an estimated magnitude of 7.9 but there is no record of the local effects of this quake. The Garlock Fault last ruptured approximately 500 years ago.

=== Climate ===

Tehachapi has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;).

Tehachapi is known for its four-season climate. The wet season is generally November through May, although thunderstorms are common during the summer, especially over the nearby mountain peaks. Average temperatures range from in July to in January. The area typically collects of snow each winter. There are an average of 31.1 days with highs of or higher and an average of 94.8 days with lows of or lower annually.

Due to Tehachapi’s close proximity to the Tehachapi Pass, which forces air up from the San Joaquin Valley through a narrow canyon into the mountains, the region is notably windy throughout the year.

Perhaps the first movie to be filmed in Tehachapi was &quot;The Lady of the Dugout&quot; (1918), which starred former outlaws Al and Frank Jennings playing themselves. The brother outlaws were well known to Americans of the time.

Referencing the local women&#x27;s prison was a common manner in which Tehachapi received mention in noir film, including James M. Cain adaptations &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, in which Fred MacMurray&#x27;s character tells of one woman who killed her husband: &quot;All she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi (neither of Cain&#x27;s novels mention Tehachapi).&quot;

In &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, Sam Spade (played by Humphrey Bogart) tells a female criminal and love interest, &quot;Well, if you get a good break, you&#x27;ll be out of Tehachapi in twenty years and you can come back to me then.&quot; In the book, the reference was not to Tehachapi but to San Quentin.

&quot;Nocturne&quot; (1946) featured a housemaid mysteriously referred to as the &quot;Tehachapi Debutante,&quot; and 1948&#x27;s &quot;The Hunted&quot; has a heroine fresh out of Tehachapi after four years for jewelry theft.

In &quot;The Story of Molly X&quot; (1949), Molly X is the leader of a San Francisco gang sent to Tehachapi for her role in a burglary attempt instead of San Quentin for execution. Most of the film then takes place at the prison, as Molly goes from being trouble to a model prisoner.

In &quot;1001 Rabbit Tales&quot;, Bugs Bunny tells the sultan&#x27;s son that Hansel and Gretel&#x27;s witch was sent to Tehachapi.

In &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), actors Patrick Stewart and William Shatner appear in a scene filmed in the Tehachapi mountains.

The Christina Applegate vehicle originally titled &quot;Tehachapi&quot; sends her character to Tehachapi because her lover is in prison here. The movie was eventually released under the title &quot;Across the Moon&quot; (1995).

The fourth season of the teen-geared television series, &quot;Endurance&quot; produced by the Discovery Kids Network was filmed in Tehachapi and aired from 2005 to 2006.

In &quot;Mac and Me&quot; (1988), after the characters state they have to &quot;drive to Woolworth&#x27;s in Palmdale&quot; the next shot shows them driving up a dirt road through a Tehachapi wind farm. Similarly, &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot; (1994) has a fight sequence filmed on top of a hill in one of the farms.

&quot;&quot; (2005) shot a sequence at a wind farm and on Oak Creek Road, which winds through several farms.

Tehachapi was featured in several episodes of the Animal Planet reality show &quot;Pit Bulls and Parolees&quot;. The show focuses on the Villalobos Rescue Center and the pit bulls cared for by the center; in 2011, the rescue&#x27;s application to use property owned in Tehachapi to expand rescue operations was denied by the Kern County Planning Department.

Other movies filmed in Tehachapi include &quot;Face to Face&quot; (2001), &quot;Fault&quot; (2002), &quot;Batman: Revenge&quot; (2003), &quot;The Gentleman Don La Mancha&quot; (2004), &quot;I.F.O. (Identified Flying Object)&quot; (1985), &quot;Motor Mansions&quot; (2005), &quot;The Legend of Bloody Mary&quot; (2008), &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940, featuring the scene at Keene Ranch), and &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot; (2013).

===Music===
The American Country Rock band Little Feat references Tehachapi in its song, Willin&#x27;, written by its multi-instrumentalist band member Lowell George.

The American singer Margo Cilker included a song called &quot;Tehachapi&quot; on her 2021 album Pohorylle.

===Video game references===
In the 1999 PlayStation video game Parasite Eve II, it&#x27;s main protagonist, Aya Brea, receives a map of Mojave region and is tasked to go to a fictional town of &quot;Dryfield&quot;. The said map can be examined more thoroughly as an item of interest, and upon closer inspection it is revealed that the picture for the aforementioned map was actually based on real life satellite photo of the region, which shows real roads and infrastructure as they were existing in late 1990&#x27;s, including portion of the real town of Bakersfield, with the fictional town of &quot;Dryfield&quot; being encircled in it, and it&#x27;s physical position on the picture shown in-game directly matching where Tehachapi is positioned in real life. The fictional location of &quot;Dryfield&quot; looks nothing like the real Tehachapi does in reality, but on the map picture that&#x27;s being shown in the Parasite Eve II game it is directly placed where real Tehachapi is.

===Condor mass perching===
In May 2021, a resident came home after a holiday to find that about 15 to 20 condors had descended on her home. She said, &quot;To have that many condors on my house was surreal; they can be destructive and messy. Nature is amazing!&quot; The birds had ripped up decking, taken to a bath spa and knocked over several plants.

The Fish and Wildlife Service responded to tweets about the incident that the house is in a condor habitat where there are food sources and that sometimes condors use houses and decks as perch locations. Spokeswoman Pam Bierce said that as condors re-colonized historical ranges &quot;people could increasingly find themselves interacting with the curious, intelligent and social birds&quot;.

Mickols&#x27; daughter Seana Quintero stated that all-in-all her mother was in &quot;good stride and appreciating this once-in-a-lifetime annoyance but hoping they decide to leave her house alone soon&quot;.

==Economy==

One of Wasco&#x27;s major economic activities is agriculture, specifically the growing of rose bushes. In 2007 fifty-five percent of all roses grown in the United States were grown in or around Wasco. Two of Wasco&#x27;s major nurseries closed in 2010, and by 2011 Wasco was producing only approximately forty percent of US-grown roses.

Oil and gas extraction is a significant part of the local economy. The Wasco Oil Field was discovered in April 1938, by Continental Oil Company. The large Semitropic Oil Field is along State Route 46 about west of town. Formerly a gas field, the region now mainly produces oil. Vintage Production, an arm of Occidental Petroleum, is the primary operator as of 2010.

==Sports==
The Wasco Reserve (called the Reserves in their 2019 debut season) were a professional baseball team competing in the independent Pecos League which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. Their home games through the 2021 season were played at Wasco Athletic Park, sharing Bakersfield&#x27;s Sam Lynn Ballpark for their 2022 final season.

==Transportation==
The Amtrak service, the &quot;San Joaquins&quot;, stops at the Wasco station, which has one platform next to the single track; the station building was demolished in 2021. Being on the route of the high speed rail project without a stop, Wasco city officials have expressed concerns that the Amtrak service might be discontinued. , no decision has been announced. The construction has impacted the city and the costs for asbestos removal are in dispute in a labor housing complex that had to be abandoned and demolished. While paid relocation costs, the city can’t afford to demolish the camp and wants the rail authority to pay. Chief Executive Brian Kelly came to the city to discuss the issue in 2021.

<text>Avenal (Spanish for &quot;Oat field&quot;) is a city in Kings County, California, United States. Avenal is located southwest of Hanford, at an elevation of . It is part of the Hanford–Corcoran Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA Code 25260), which encompasses all of Kings County. In area, it is the fourth-largest city in Kings County. The population was 15,505 in the 2010 census, which includes inmates at the Avenal State Prison, the first prison actively solicited by a community in the state of California. Many of the remaining residents largely either work at the prison or in the agriculture industry. The prison provides approximately 1,000 jobs to residents. The California Department of Finance estimated that Avenal&#x27;s population was 13,496 on July 1, 2019. As of that date, Avenal State Prison held 4,165 inmates, which was about 32% of the total population of Avenal. Inmates are counted as city residents by both the United States census and the California Department of Finance.

==Early history==
The City of Avenal was named by Spanish soldiers and explorers. In Spanish, means , and means . This area was covered with wild oats, &quot;waist high,&quot; that looked like golden silk and covered the Kettleman Plains.

Early American settlers arrived in the Kettleman Hills during the 1850s with dreams of raising cattle and farming. Oil, however, would bring fame, fortune and people to the area. Native Americans had always known oil was in the hills, with natural seepage around Coalinga and Tar Canyon. The first Kettleman Hills well was drilled in 1900, followed by countless unproductive efforts.

On March 27, 1927, the Milham Exploration Company began work on Elliot No. 1. The crew toiled for 19 months, drilling past the mark. On October 5, 1928, the well blew out with a roar which was heard away, spewing forth an oil so fine that its color was white, and reportedly could be used unrefined as gasoline in automobiles.

The discovery of oil transformed Avenal into a boomtown. In 1929, Standard Oil surveyed the current site of Avenal to build a town. Makeshift houses were hauled in from Taft to take the place of the tents. A water line was laid and later a sewer plant was installed, a post office replaced a cigar box in the general store, a fire department was organized and a community grew. Standard Oil Company built the residents a 600-seat theater and a hospital.

Also in the first year (1929), nearly 20 businesses occupied Kings Street and Skyline Boulevard. By 1936, Avenal boasted a population of 3,000—mostly oil workers—with 100 businesses and 69 private telephones and numerous community organizations. In 1940, Avenal was the second-largest town in Kings County with a population of over 4,000 and was known to have some of the best services and schools in the state.

Although today Avenal and its economy are largely reliant on the Avenal State Prison and agriculture, Avenal was once a booming oil town known as the &quot;Oil Fields Capital.&quot;

The teeming life of the oil fields, the forward thrust of civilization into the sun-baked hills so recently in their pristine state meant the early development of nearby towns where adequate living facilities could be provided to care for the fast-growing population.

Milham City was projected by a group of Kings County citizens who owned lands on the slope of the hills east of the oil field. It scarcely had emerged from the dream stage when the Standard Oil Company announced in 1929 that a townsite had been set aside on the northwestern slope of the hills and that it would be called Avenal.

Thus the present thriving, interesting little town of Avenal came into being as the &quot;oil capital&quot; of the great field. Roads and streets were surveyed and laid out, water mains were laid, the town was launched on its purposeful career almost overnight.

An emergency hospital was built. Small and large homes were purposefully constructed to enjoy a fuller life in the erstwhile barren plains and trees were planted to provide much needed shade.

On December 5, 1929, the first mail arrived at the new Avenal post office located at Moore&#x27;s Soda Fountain.

During World War II was the site of a training landing strip called Murray Field, part of Lemoore Army Air Field.

==Growth and development==
Among the first business establishments at Avenal were Koepp&#x27;s Welding Works, The Republic Supply Company, Mac&#x27;s Coffee Shop, Moore&#x27;s Soda Fountain and the Cross Lumber Company. Presently, the town included 26 oil field supply houses, 12 oil field service company branches, 9 grocery stores, 9 service stations, 8 restaurants, 5 welding establishments, 4 builders&#x27; supply houses and numerous other enterprises.

While the oil fields and their urban center were populated with industrious, law-abiding people the problem of keeping the peace and maintaining the dignity of the law existed there just as it does in all other communities where there is life, action and big payrolls. To meet this commonplace problem a township was established and on April 1, 1937, E.W. Oliver was appointed as justice of the peace and William &quot;Bill&quot; Brendal was named constable. Aiding and cooperating with them in the enforcement of the law was Deputy Sheriff Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Doty, who was appointed by Sheriff L.P. Loftis in 1935.

Two other county offices maintained deputies at Avenal for service in the oil fields. They were Orville Robbins, deputy county assessor; and R. W. Zivnuska, deputy county treasurer.

By election in February 1934, the Avenal Township formed a fire district, which served efficiently both in the town and country districts. The three fire district commissioners originally elected were Ray Mohler, Floyd Rice and Jess Hamilton.

The Avenal district owned one well-equipped White fire truck and a half interest with the West Side Fire Protection District, of a two-ton Reo fire truck. Two full-time drivers were regularly employed and 20 firemen worked call. The firehouse provided living quarters for the employees. Fire Chief L. H. Dell was assisted by M. L. Sperling.

By April 1930, Dr. S. V. Dragoo was the head of the emergency hospital. Dr. Dragoo was assisted by one office worker and two nurses, having two special nurses on call. Between five and six hundred calls per month with about thirty accident cases were handled by this organization, not to mention the ambulance service extended.

Appointed postmistress in November 1931, Mrs. Marie Eads served in that office until July 1933, when she resigned and Charles E. Day was appointed. The post office later occupied a two-story building leased by the Standard Oil Company in 1935. Later in Avenal&#x27;s history, the Post Office leased a space adjacent to Finster&#x27;s Market (later T&amp;T Market). In the late 1990s, the post office was relocated to its current location near the intersection of Skyline Blvd and San Joaquin Street.

The collapse of oil and gas production came with the intrusion of salt water into the oil reservoir, leaving 65 to 70 percent of the North Dome of the Kettleman Hills still undisturbed.

In 1953, oil companies with holdings in the area fields named the Standard Oil Company of California to operate the fields. Avenal&#x27;s economy dwindled and with it, many stores, buildings and houses were vacated until the 1960s when an influx of agricultural workers made a major impact on Avenal and surrounding area.

The early 1970s saw two substantial projects that had significant impacts on the city: the completion of the California Aqueduct which brought in needed water to the westside of the San Jaoquin valley, and the opening of Interstate 5.

The citizens of Avenal voted for incorporation in September 1979, and while going through the early stages of being a new city, the citizens pursued and were successful in bringing a state prison to Avenal. Avenal State Prison opened in 1987. By 2009, it housed 6,577 inmates and employed 1,517 people, making it a vital part of the community. The building of the facility dramatically increased the city&#x27;s total valuation with construction, improvements and activity that could be seen in every area of the city.

Avenal is also home to the Central California Soaring Club headquartered at the Avenal Gliderport. This year-round operation is one of the few glider-only airports in the western United States, and one of only a few in the entire US that owns/operates its own airport. A soaring contest is held there every spring.

Construction has been completed on the renovation of Skyline Boulevard (California State Route 269) in the city&#x27;s joint effort with Caltrans. Avenal has also completed a massive public improvement project with the development of of new curbs, gutters and sidewalks throughout the city.

In November 2010, the Avenal Police Department was initiated with 14 sworn officers. Jack Amoroso was the first police chief.

Although Avenal&#x27;s future is no longer closely tied to oil, it will always mark its beginnings from &quot;the day Milham came in,&quot; and the cigar box on the counter of the general store which was its first post office.

In 2019, &quot;USA Today&quot; named Avenal the 10th-worst city in America due to high unemployment and violent crime.

==Geography==
Avenal is located at , north of Los Angeles and south of both San Francisco and Sacramento. The city is located on the Kettleman Plain, between the Kettleman Hills and the Chalk Buttes. The city boasts at being located, &quot;Half the way from the Bay to L.A.&quot; According to the United States Census Bureau, Avenal has a total area of , all of it land. Most of the population resides in the southwestern portion of the city. The northeastern areas, separated by the Kettleman Hills, and where Interstate 5 passes through, remain mostly rural. 

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Avenal has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
Avenal is a small city of approximately 13,696 people, including prison inmates. Avenal owes its origin to the discovery of oil on October 4, 1928, in the adjacent Kettleman Hills. Avenal was the site of a &quot;tent city&quot; as the boom started, but foresight made the boom orderly, so that by 1940 Avenal was the second largest town in Kings County with a population of 4,600.

Growth continues today to include a more diversified economy based on oil, agriculture, and the service industry. In 1978, Avenal citizens voted to incorporate. The presence of the Avenal State Prison helps this rural community maintain economic stability, especially as the once-productive Kettleman North Dome Oil Field reaches exhaustion (less than one-half of one percent of its original oil remains).

The city has been actively pursuing industrial development and is looking at future development of the Interstate 5 interchange area for both commercial and industrial uses.

In 2008, a 600-megawatt electric power generating plant was proposed to be built and operated in Avenal by Macquarie Cook Power, a subsidiary of the Macquarie Group, doing business as Avenal Power Center, LLC. The project application indicated that the power plant would be fueled with natural gas and that it would be air-cooled. The capital cost of the project would be $530 million. According to the project&#x27;s proponents, the plant would have generated enough electricity to supply 450,000 homes and businesses annually. The California Energy Commission gave its final approval to the project on December 16, 2009. However, opponents of the power plant vowed to continue to fight. Bradley Angel, executive director of Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice, threatened to file a lawsuit if the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved the project. Federal approval was delayed, causing the company to sue the USEPA. In February 2011, an EPA official told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the agency would allow the project to proceed. According to a newspaper story, Bradley Angel commented that Greenaction would continue to fight the project. On May 26, 2011, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon ordered the USEPA to make a final permit decision, which the agency did the following day. Construction of the power plant could begin after a 60-day administrative appeal period. Paul Cort of Earthjustice was quoted in a news story as saying that an administrative appeal would be filed, and if that is unsuccessful, the organization would appeal to the Federal court. In June 2011, both People for Clean Air and Water and the Sierra Club filed petitions for review with the USEPA&#x27;s environmental appeals board. The Center for Biological Diversity joined the Sierra Club&#x27;s petition. Their petition alleged that the proposed plant would emit excessive nitrogen oxides and is being wrongfully grandfathered in under old clean air rules. On August 18, 2011, the USEPA&#x27;s environmental appeals board denied the petition. Bradley Angel renewed his vow to continue the fight in court. A news story quoted him as saying: &quot;Basically the fix was in when EPA boss Lisa Jackson broke her commitment to environmental justice and illegally approved the permit. We&#x27;re going to continue to challenge it. It&#x27;s going to court.&quot; On November 3, 2011, The Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and Greenaction filed suit with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the EPA permit. On August 12, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that appeal and rejected the permit, finding that the USEPA had improperly grandfathered the project under the old emissions standards. In June 2015, an attorney representing Avenal Power Center LLC sent a letter to the California Energy Commission stating the company &quot;will let the license expire on Sept. 16, 2015&quot; ending the 7-year long effort to build the power plant.

Many local residents are employed in agriculture, which experienced significant growth on the westside of the San Joaquin Valley after the completion of the California Aqueduct in the early 1970s. However, the community was impacted by the 2008-2012 global recession as well as the California drought and restrictions on pumping from the Sacramento River delta to protect endangered species. In November 2016, the unemployment rate was 12.7%.

In 2013, the City Council self-proclaimed Avenal to be the &#x27;Pistachio Capital of the World&#x27;, reflecting the importance of the pistachio industry to the city&#x27;s economy.

<text>Corcoran is a city in Kings County, California, United States. The population was 24,813 (2010 census), up from 14,458 (2000 census). Corcoran is located south-southeast of Hanford, at an elevation of . 

Corcoran is most notable as the site of the California State Prison, Corcoran. The California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Corcoran is a separate facility that is also located in the city. As of January 1, 2015, the two prisons held a combined total of 9,592 inmates. Inmates are counted as city residents by both the United States Census and the California Department of Finance. Thus, the incarcerated people in the two prisons comprise just over 43% of the total population of Corcoran.

==History==
Corcoran was founded by Hobart Johnstone Whitley, a prominent land developer from southern California, who took the lead in building Corcoran (the main street of the community is named in his honor). Liking what he saw during a visit to the area in 1905 (a blacksmith shop, small store, scattered homes and a lush, untapped vista with herds of grazing wild hogs, horses and steers) Whitley purchased to start development. Much like in the San Fernando Valley (Van Nuys and Canoga Park his &quot;creations&quot;), Whitley &quot;leveraged&quot; his holdings with the support of important Los Angeles businessmen. Whitley first intended the town be named &quot;Otis&quot;, after Harrison Gray Otis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and streets as Otis, Sherman, Letts (the Broadway store) and Ross (after his son, Ross Whitley) show the connections. Whitley, it is claimed, purchased and platted some 150 towns over the American West—and Corcoran is one of his last.

Whitley moved a member of his real estate firm, J. W. Guiberson, to the area. Guiberson became one of the many pioneers of the community, building the first home and business structure in Corcoran. His family also helped establish the first church in the community, an event which helped lead to the town&#x27;s incorporation on August 14, 1914.

The basis of Corcoran&#x27;s economy then and now is agriculture. Initially, the most successful crops were grains, alfalfa and sugar beets.

In 1933, more than 12,000 workers went on strike against cotton farmers, one of the largest California agricultural strikes of 1933. Strikers in Corcoran created a tent city that eventually held more than 3,000 people, more than double the town&#x27;s population. Its lack of water or sewage systems created waves of illness. Streets were staked out in the tent city, and committees of workers governed the camp.

The J. G. Boswell Company was established in Corcoran in 1921 and remains a major employer in the city.

The first post office opened in 1901.
