==History==

===19th century===
The particular medicine lodge, mystery house or sacred tabernacle from which the Medicine Lodge River received its name was in reality an arbor-like shelter of tree trunks and leafy branches which was erected by the Kiowa people for the celebration of their annual sun dance in the summer of 1866. It was in the valley of the Medicine Lodge River, several miles below the present town of Medicine Lodge, which is at the mouth of Elm Creek. In their own language, the Kiowa people called this stream A-ya-dalda P’a, meaning &quot;Timber-hill River.&quot; The Kiowa had considered the site sacred due to the high content of Epsom salts in the river.

In October 1867, the Medicine Lodge Treaty was a set of three treaties signed between the United States of America and the Kiowa, Comanche, Plains Apache, Southern Cheyenne, and Southern Arapaho. The site of the Peace Council camp was about three miles above that of the future town and on the same side of the river. A Peace Treaty Pageant, first presented in 1927 in an outdoor amphitheater on a quarter section of Kansas prairie, commemorates this significant event in Western history.

Settlers led by a man named John Hutchinson founded the town of Medicine Lodge north of the confluence of Elm Creek and the Medicine Lodge River in February 1873. The community grew rapidly with a hotel, stores, and a post office established within a year.

In 1874, in response to Native raids in the region, residents and the state militia constructed a stockade. A group of Osage killed three settlers within a few miles of the compound, but no direct attack on the fortifications occurred. Medicine Lodge was incorporated as a city in 1879.

Temperance activist Carrie Nation launched her crusade against the sale of alcohol while living in Medicine Lodge in 1900. Her home and a reproduction of the 1873 stockade are open to the public.

<text>Claflin is a city in Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 562.

==History==
Prior to American expansion and occupation, the region was controlled by Cheyenne, Pawnee, and Kiowa tribes. The Santa Fe Trail contributed to American settlement in Barton County, as it did throughout Kansas and much of the southern Great Plains.

The first settlement claim recorded in the area of Claflin was made by George Platt in 1870. This claim was divided and re-entered, eventually being sold to J. H. Williamson in 1875, and becoming the town of Claflin.

The community was officially organized in response to Missouri Pacific Railroad plans for a branch line to come through the area.
 Tracks were laid by 1887.

The station, on the south side of the tracks, was originally named Giles City after landowner Stelle Giles. Farmer and landowner William Albro Giles, son of Stella Giles, did not sell the 40 acres desired by the town company for building a town on the south side of the tracks. The land for the town was purchased on the north side of the tracks from J. H. Williamson. Judge Oliver Perry Hamilton surveyed the land and named the town Claflin, after his wife, Adelia Maria Claflin. The Claflin Town Company, with Stelle Giles as President, filed the townsite with the Barton County Register of Deeds on March 31, 1887.

The first official resident of Claflin was Robert Leslie Hamilton, who built and operated the S. S. Chatten Lumber Company. Other early residents include: Mel Cummings, railroad agent; George Norris; J. H. Cannon, store owner, banker, undertaker; M. C. Elmore, hardware store owner; Cas Dermitt, cafe owner; A. A. German, elevator operator; Charles Bucker, blacksmith; Charles Vert, publisher of the Claflin Clarion.

The city was incorporated by order of the Barton County Commissioners on July 18, 1901, and the first election was held on August 2, 1901.

<text>Ellinwood is a city in the southeastern corner of Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,011.

==History==

===19th century===

For millennia, the land now known as Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Barton County was founded.

The first claim at Ellinwood was staked in 1871 when it was certain the Santa Fe railroad would be completed nearby. The railroad was finished in 1872 and the city was named after Colonel John R. Ellinwood, a civil engineer working for the Santa Fe railroad. Although neither the founder nor the original settlers were German, many of the main streets were given German names, in order to appeal to German immigrant buyers.

In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

===20th century===
In 1973, the rock band Kansas rented the Ellinwood Opera House as a &#x27;tryout show&#x27; for New York record executive Wally Gold, using free beer as a marketing tool, and charged a USD $0.25 entry fee to help cover some of their expenses. The story is told in the 2015 documentary &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot;.

<text>Great Bend is a city in and the county seat of Barton County, Kansas, United States. It is named for its location at the point where the course of the Arkansas River bends east then southeast. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 14,733. It is home to Barton Community College.

==History==
Prior to American settlement of the area, the site of Great Bend was located in the northern reaches of Kiowa territory. Claimed first by France as part of Louisiana and later acquired by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, it lay within the area organized by the U.S. as Kansas Territory in 1854. Kansas became a state in 1861, and the state government delineated the surrounding area as Barton County in 1867.

The first settlers of the area arrived in 1870. Living in sod houses and dugouts, they worked as buffalo hunters since trampling by bison herds precluded crop farming. In 1871, the Great Bend Town Company, anticipating the westward construction of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, founded Great Bend at a site roughly three miles west of Fort Zarah on the Santa Fe Trail. They named the settlement after its location at the &quot;great bend&quot; in the Arkansas River where the river&#x27;s course turns eastward. The town began to grow as more settlers arrived over the following year and opened several businesses.
The railroad reached Great Bend in July 1872, and an election at about the same time declared the town the permanent county seat. Great Bend was incorporated as a city soon thereafter. The county courthouse and the city&#x27;s first public school were built the following year.

In 1873, following the arrival of the railroad, Great Bend became a shipping point for cattle. This stimulated local business but also transformed the city into a rowdy, violent cowtown. In 1876, the Kansas Legislature extended the legal &quot;dead line&quot; restricting the presence of Texas cattle 30 miles west of Barton County. The cattle trade moved westward accordingly, and the city became more peaceful.

Over the following decades, Great Bend continued to grow and modernize, becoming a center of area commerce. This was despite two disasters which struck the city: a downtown fire in 1878 and a smallpox outbreak in 1882 which resulted in a brief quarantine. In 1886, local speculators began to fund exploration for petroleum in the area. By 1930, the oil and gas industry brought more than $20 million annually to the county. More than 3,000 wells produced during the 1930s, and the influx of workers dramatically increased the city&#x27;s population.

The U.S. Army Air Forces opened Great Bend Army Airfield west of the city in 1943. The base served as training facility for B-29 bomber aircraft personnel during World War II. After the war, the City of Great Bend acquired the base and repurposed it for civilian use as Great Bend Municipal Airport.

The city continued to grow through the 1950s, its population peaking at almost 17,000 in 1960. In 1973, the Fuller Brush Company relocated its production facilities to Great Bend, becoming one of the city&#x27;s major employers. Despite a modest decline in population in recent decades, Great Bend continues to serve as a commercial center for central Kansas.

<text>Hoisington is a city in Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,699.

==History==
In 1886, a group of Barton County businessmen formed the Central Kansas Town Company and founded the town of Hoisington to attract the Kansas and Colorado Railroad to the area. They named the settlement after Andrew J. Hoisington, one of the company partners and a prominent businessman in nearby Great Bend. The railroad reached Hoisington in the fall of 1886, and the settlement was incorporated as a city in 1887. The post office, relocated from nearby Buena Vista, was renamed Hoisington in April 1887 as was the railroad station, originally named Monon, by 1889.

Hoisington modernized and grew steadily over the following decades. The city&#x27;s first power plant opened in 1903, and a city water system was completed in 1904. The railroad, known by that point as the Missouri Pacific, continued to play a central role in the city&#x27;s development, employing 1,600 local men by 1911. Hoisington became a major freight and passenger operating division, complete with a roundhouse and shops. Electric street lights were installed in 1915, and the first streets were paved in 1917. The discovery of natural gas in the area in 1929, followed by the discovery of oil in the area in the 1930s, diversified and further stimulated the local economy.

On April 21, 2001, Hoisington suffered a large scale disaster when an F4 tornado ripped through the city, destroying with a path width of . It came from the southwestern corner and traveled almost directly into the middle of the city. One fatality was reported, as well as 28 injuries (two critical). Two hundred homes and 12 businesses were destroyed and 85 homes were severely damaged; an additional 200 homes received minor to moderate damage. The city&#x27;s population and commerce recovered quickly. Today, the tornado&#x27;s path can still be seen from the air due to the lack of trees, some empty lots, and the newer houses, which are larger and more spaced out than their predecessors.

==Geography==
Hoisington lies on the southern edge of the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. Blood Creek, which flows east into nearby Cheyenne Bottoms, passes immediately south of the city.

The city sits astride the line between North and South Homestead Townships.

The April 2001 storm was featured on an episode of The Weather Channel series &quot;Storm Stories&quot;. The tornado struck during the high school prom, and many of the prom goers were unaware the tornado had even hit—a fact that was the subject of the June 9, 2001, episode of the NPR radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;.

The ABC comedy &quot;Sports Night&quot; referenced Hoisington on October 13, 1998, in the episode &quot;Intellectual Property.&quot; Associate Producer Jeremy Goodwin, challenged to find material to enable sports anchors Dan Rydell and Casey McCall to stretch a segment about a sporting event, notes that the &quot;attendance at tonight&#x27;s game, 11,323, is exactly the same as the population of Hoisington, Kansas.&quot; Producer Dana Whitaker then relays to Dan and Casey that they have two options for stretching the segment: report this odd &quot;fact&quot; about Hoisington, or &quot;talk slower.&quot; Hoisington&#x27;s population in 1998 was probably much closer to 2,975, according to the 2000 census.

<text>Fort Scott is a city in and the county seat of Bourbon County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 7,552. It is named for Gen. Winfield Scott. The city is located south of Kansas City on the Marmaton River. It is the home of the Fort Scott National Historic Site and the Fort Scott National Cemetery.

==History==
Established and garrisoned by the U.S. Army from 1842 to 1853, soldiers at military Fort Scott assisted with the protection of the Permanent Indian Frontier. After the army abandoned the fort in 1853, the buildings were purchased by local settlers at a government auction in 1855. The community of Fort Scott was laid out in 1857, and was chartered as a city in 1860.

Between 1855 and 1861, the citizens of Fort Scott experienced the violent unrest that preceded the American Civil War on the Kansas and Missouri border. Eastern newspapers described this violence as &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, a result of the national controversy concerning the extension of slavery into the new territories. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the union as a free state, but the turmoil of &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; continued throughout the Civil War.

During the Civil War, Fort Scott was a U.S. Army district Headquarters, quartermaster supply depot, training center, and recruitment station. It was strategically vital to the defense of Kansas and the Midwest. A battle over the fort occurred in August 1861 just across the Missouri line in the Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The battle was a pro-South victory for Sterling Price and his Missouri State Guard.

Price did not hold the fort and instead continued a northern push into Missouri in an attempt to recapture the state. Senator James H. Lane was to launch a Jayhawker offensive behind Price from Fort Scott that led to the Sacking of Osceola. The ill will of these actions was to be the basis for the 1976 Clint Eastwood film &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

After the Civil War, Fort Scott was a premier city of the frontier, one of the largest cities in eastern Kansas. On three occasions, between 1870 and 1900, Fort Scott was in competition with Kansas City to become the largest railroad center west of the Mississippi.

During the first half of the 20th century, Fort Scott became an agricultural and small industrial center which it continues to be today.

<text>Andover is a city in Butler County, Kansas, United States, and a suburb of Wichita. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 14,892. Andover is the most populated city in Butler County.

==History==

===19th century===

When the Kansas territory was first mapped, the original Andover area was called Minneha. The Native American name was later changed to Cloud City.

The first Euro-American settlement in Bruno Township was in February 1869, when Vincent Smith arrived on Dry Creek (2 miles east of Andover Road on 21st Street). He filed his claim on May 10, 1869. Other early settlers began to arrive in spring 1870, and soon all the land was claimed. The first Bruno Township election was held April 9, 1872. The first township officers were N.B. Daniels, Trustee; Jacob Brown, Treasurer; J.D. Reber, Clerk; Isaac Newland and Samuel Reed, Justices of the Peace; William Riser and Isaac Stroup, Constables. Bonds totaling $18,000 were issued for the extension of the Frisco Railway through Bruno Township. The railway was completed in 1880.

G. M. Pattison homesteaded the land that became the original plot on which Andover was built. In August 1872, Pattison was given title to this property. In February 1876, the land was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Ephraim Waggoner.

Andover&#x27;s first church was what is known today as the United Methodist Church. The church started as a Sunday school in 1873.

The original post office was established at Minneha (an extinct town) in November 1877. A branch was moved to Cloud City in March 1880. That same year, the Cloud City post office was renamed Andover. Andover was named after Andover, Massachusetts.

In January 1880, Mr. and Mrs. Waggoner deeded to Charles Glancey. Mr. Glancey platted the original townsite in February 1880. The legally established townsite was known as Cloud City, named after Mr. Cloud, a railroad engineer. He helped build the St. Louis–San Francisco Railroad through town. The name of the town was changed from Cloud City to Andover on June 7, 1880, when Mr. Cloud had a &quot;falling out&quot; with residents of the area.

A trading post which sold all types of merchandise was the first known business in Andover. The first hotel was operated in 1881 by J. C. Lines. The front part of the hotel was a general store operated by G. W. Harris.

In 1882, the Richland schoolhouse was moved to the present Meadowlark Elementary School location at a cost of $2,000 and became the city&#x27;s first school. Professor Haskin was the first principal and enrollment was 86 students.

Early businesses during the 1882–83 period were a hotel, a grocery and lumber company, a shoemaker, a business that handled livestock, coal and grain, a general store, a meat market, two other grocery stores, and the railway agent. In 1883, the population of Andover was about 150 people. The first passenger train went through Andover in 1885 and the last passenger train in October 1960.

The best known historical event was a train robbery at 10:00 P.M., on July 17, 1898. After being forced to flag the train, Depot Agent S.B. McClaren escaped and ran to the nearby Methodist Church—where an ice cream social was being held—to spread the alarm. Will Belford, 28 years old, was shot while trying to stop the bandits and died five weeks later. The robbers escaped, but were captured on August 12, 1898, in Maize, Kansas. Both were tried in Butler County Court. Sam Smith was charged with first-degree murder and hanged. Thomas Wind was charged with second-degree murder and sent back to prison.

===20th century===
The class of 1914 was the first class to graduate from Andover High School. The class of four students to receive diplomas were Josie Boyer, Virgil Grier, Ola Peacock, and Perry Hiskin. The school itself started in the fall of 1909 as a consolidated school which had been formed by combining four school districts, and qualified as an accredited high school.

Andover did not incorporate into a third class city until February 4, 1957. The population of the city proper was 166. Up until this time, Andover was a small unincorporated community surrounded by farmland. Homes began to spring up south of the original townsite.

At the first city election on April 2, 1957, Hugo Epp won by one vote over Charles Clay for the position of mayor. The form of government is mayor-council, with the mayor elected every four years, and five council members at large every two years. Robert Dodge was elected Police Judge. Councilmen elected were Roy Allison, Orland Wolf, Ual Baker, Roger Moore and Clair Mohler.

A major annexation in 1968 not only increased the area of the city, but the population grew from 500 to 2,000.

The first Greater Andover Days Celebration was held in 1967.

Andover has two golf courses within a mile of each other and one in the southernmost part of the city that, in 2005–2006, was rated the 43rd best golf course in the country by &quot;Golf Digest&quot;.

====1991 tornado====
On April 26, 1991, an F5 tornado left a trail of destruction through parts of Kansas, including south Wichita and Andover. Widening to nearly one-half mile, with winds over , the deadliest blow was to Andover. The twister ripped through the town, killing 13 people. A third of the 4,300 residents were left homeless. Over 300 homes, 10 businesses and two churches were destroyed. The Golden Spur Mobile Home Park and the St. Vincent De Paul Catholic Church were leveled. It was rated F5; had the tornado hit the heart of Wichita the death toll would likely have been higher.

===21st century===

==History==
===19th century===
The confluence of the Whitewater River and the Walnut River was originally inhabited by Osage people, who found the land ideal for hunting and fishing.

In 1868, C. N. James settled in the area and built a log cabin to serve also as a general store and trading post. Around that same time, a post office was established in the settlement, and as the first postmaster, C. N. James named the post office and the town in honor of his wife, Augusta James.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado. In 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The rail line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Service from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield, Arkansas City. In 2020, the Santa Fe (now BNSF) still maintains tracks through Augusta at the 301 E. Fifth St. headquarters, a brick depot constructed in 1916–1917. The St. Louis &amp; San Francisco (Frisco) Railroad established a depot in Augusta in 1880, serving both passengers and freight. Passenger service ended in 1960.

===20th century===
The discovery of oil near Augusta in 1914, and soon elsewhere in Butler County, led to the doubling of the population of Augusta between 1910 and 1920. Oil drilling and refining became a major source of employment for many years. In 1916, L. L. Marcell founded the White Eagle Oil Company in Augusta. Other early refineries were the Walnut Refining Company and the Lakeside Refinery. In 1930, White Eagle was purchased by the Standard Oil Company of New York and was known as &quot;Socony-Vacuum&quot; for many years, then renamed Mobil in 1966. 

===21st century===

After graduating, the students move onto Circle High School in Towanda.

Circle Middle School used to be a combination of Circle Benton Elementary and Circle Towanda Elementary, which, at the time, were both K-8 schools. Circle Oil Hill Elementary bused their kids over to Circle Towanda Elementary for classes. When the schools became too crowded due to the influx of jobs in nearby Wichita, El Dorado, and Andover, the school board voted to build a middle school in Benton. The project was completed by Summer 2002. Classes began in the fall. The first 8th grade class to go through the middle school graduated in 2007 from Circle High School.

<text>El Dorado ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Butler County, Kansas, United States. It is situated along the Walnut River in the central part of Butler County and located in south-central Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 12,870. It is home to Butler Community College.

==History==
El Dorado was laid out and platted in 1868. The name is of Spanish origin meaning &quot;golden land&quot;. El Dorado was incorporated in 1870.

In 1877, the Florence, El Dorado, and Walnut Valley Railroad Company built a branch line from Florence to El Dorado; in 1881 it was extended to Douglass, and later to Arkansas City. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to El Dorado was abandoned in 1942. The original branch line connected Florence, Burns, De Graff, El Dorado, Augusta, Douglass, Rock, Akron, Winfield, and Arkansas City.

In 1915, the &quot;El Dorado Oil Field&quot; was the first oil field that was found using science/geologic mapping, and part of the Mid-Continent oil province. By 1918, the El Dorado Oil Field was the largest single field producer in the United States, and was responsible for 12.8% of national oil production and 9% of the world production. It was deemed by some as &quot;the oil field that won World War I&quot;.

In 1916, there was an anti-black race riot in El Dorado after an incident between a black shoe shiner and a white oil worker. Large numbers of black families removed their household goods and moved out of El Dorado.

In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were brought to Kansas and other Midwest states as a means of solving the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large internment camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including El Dorado. Prisoners commonly volunteered to help work on local farms; this enabled them to spend time outside the camp, socialize and eat better food than that provided by prison guards. In some cases, smaller structures constructed by the work details still stand.

On June 10, 1958, a tornado hit El Dorado and killed 13 people. In 2008, the city built a memorial at Graham Park in remembrance of the dead.

<text>Elbing is a city in Butler County, Kansas, United States. It is named after the city Elbląg (German: &quot;Elbing&quot;) in northern Poland, formerly Prussia. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 226. It is located about 10.7 miles east of Interstate 135 in Newton, along the Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Butler County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Elbing.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington through Elbing to Caldwell. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

The track passed through the land of Jacob W. Regier in section 17 of the Fairmount Township in Butler county in south central Kansas. The Regiers sold of section 17 to the Elbing Town Company for $5,000. The 1/4 mile by 1/2 mile plot ran along the west side of the CK&amp;NR tracks. The railroad wanted to call the town Regier but Mr. Regier suggested three other possibilities: Elbing, Danzig and Marienburg, all cities in Prussia where he had lived. Elbing was chosen. The town was founded May 18, 1887. Within a few months people began to build houses and businesses in Elbing. By November four passenger trains (two in each direction) served Elbing. The trains also provided mail delivery and pick-up twice daily.

A post office was established in Worth (an extinct town) on March 16, 1886, but it was moved to Elbing on November 2, 1887.

School district 160 for the Elbing community was established in 1887 and provided public education for several local primary school students. The original frame building was replaced by a red brick building in 1919. The brick building stands vacant today and students who attend a public school travel to nearby cities.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, Elbing&#x27;s first church, was built in 1905, but the church disbanded in 1937. The Missionary Church, built in Elbing in 1910, was used until the 1960s when the congregation moved to nearby Newton. The building was razed in 1975. The Zion Mennonite Church, which was built in Elbing in 1924, is the only church which remains in town.

Elbing grew slowly. By 1895 it had a few businesses and 50 residents. By the turn of the century telephone service was available to the residents of Elbing on a party-line basis–four families for each telephone line. By 1910 the population had reached 100 and the town had several businesses: general store (with a post office), hardware store, implement store, bank, blacksmith shop, lumber yard, barber shop, cafe, and hotel. The town also had a doctor. Electricity did not come to Elbing until 1929 and residents had to provide their own water from wells or cisterns until the city installed a citywide water system in 1967. The city sewer system was installed in 1972. Until then each residence had its own septic tank.

In 1919 the first of several oil wells were drilled near Elbing. As a result of the oil boom, Elbing grew dramatically for a brief time. Although the town&#x27;s population increased for a few years, the new residents had little lasting effect upon the town. The oil field rapidly declined and a fire destroyed much of Elbing in 1933. Although new residences were eventually rebuilt, Elbing never regained its businesses. For several decades downtown Elbing included only a grocery/hardware store, a gas station/garage, a post office, and a grain elevator. Elbing&#x27;s grocery/hardware store closed a little over a year ago. Today the garage and grain elevator are the only downtown businesses.

In 1946, Berean Academy was founded at the south end of Elbing. Although it began with fifteen students in grades nine and ten, it quickly expanded to include grades nine through twelve. By the 1970 Berean Academy had an enrollment of 300 students. Today, Berean Academy includes grades K to 12. The academy was established as a Mennonite school, but in 1966 it dropped its Mennonite distinctives to become an interdenominational Christian school. Berean Academy, probably more than any business or group of people, has sustained the life of Elbing. Although the town has several residents who are retired or are employed in nearby towns, a significant number of families reside in Elbing because of their connection to Berean Academy. Some live here because they teach at the school and others make it their home here so that their children can attend Berean Academy.

Today Elbing has about 350 residents. It still has only three north and south streets (Main, Regier, and Johnson); and with the exception of about that was added at the south end by annexing Berean Academy, it is still 1/4 mile wide and 1/2 mile long. The area surrounding Elbing is mostly devoted to grain farming–primarily red winter wheat and sorghum grain. Nearby farms also raise a few cattle and hogs. During the last three decades almost forty houses have been built in Elbing, so only a few of its original lots remain unoccupied. The town still has a small Post Office and is in the process of building its first fire station. Until the fire station is in operation, Elbing continues to depend upon the help of volunteer firemen and the fire protection services of nearby Newton.

In 1961, Frederic Remington High School was built immediately north of Brainerd. Leading up to this new school, Whitewater, Potwin, Brainerd, Elbing, Furley, Countryside, and Golden Gate schools merged to form Remington USD 206 public school district. Heated opposition between Whitewater and Potwin occurred during the discussion for the location of the new high school. Rural voters pushed for a centralized location in neither town. A public vote was passed to build the new school near Brainerd.

<text>Potwin is a city in Butler County, Kansas, United States. It is named after the town site land owner Charles Potwin. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 421.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Butler County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Potwin.

Potwin was incorporated as a town on April 8, 1885. This land, owned by Charles Potwin, whereby the town received its name, became a station for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, instigated by William I. Joseph, known as the Father of Potwin.

Joseph came from West Virginia and, as more settlers arrived, became interested in a railroad to serve the area. After much diligent pursuit, the station was built and Joseph, a land agent for Charles Potwin, began development of a town site around the Potwin station. He opened a land office where the Potwin grocery now stands.

A post office was established in Ayr (an extinct town) on July 12, 1875, but it was moved to Potwin on September 22, 1885.

It quickly grew, including some businesses and houses from nearby community of Plum Grove.

===20th century===

During half of the twentieth century, Potwin enjoyed the prosperity of oil fields in the Mid-Continent oil province. In 1920, John (Jack) Vickers (1891–1940) built the Vickers Oil Refinery in Potwin. He got his start in oil fields in Butler County, commencing with the lease on the Parris Farm 10 miles north of Potwin, production reached 16,000 barrels a day during the 1950s. In 1964, distressed economic conditions shut down the oil processing facilities. The company was sold to Swift &amp; Company and the remaining operations were closed in 1970, and later demolished. In 1934, Vickers built a large mansion (named &quot;Vickridge&quot;) east of Wichita (now in the city limits), which his estate later become the current site of Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School.

In 1961, Frederic Remington High School was built immediately north of Brainerd. Leading up to this new school, Whitewater, Potwin, Brainerd, Elbing, Furley, Countryside, and Golden Gate schools merged to form a joint rural high school. Heated opposition between Whitewater and Potwin occurred during the discussion for the location of the new high school. Rural voters pushed for a centralized location in neither town. A public vote was passed to build the new school near Brainerd.

From 1960s to 1980s, a Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile site was located north of Potwin. The site was one of eighteen overseen by the 381st Strategic Missile Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. The Titan II near Potwin likely contained a 9 megaton W-53 nuclear warhead.

===21st century===
In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was constructed along the east city limits of Potwin, north to south through Butler County, with much controversy over tax exemption and environmental concerns (if a leak ever occurs). A pumping station named &quot;Burns&quot; was built 2 miles north of Potwin, and new power lines were built from a high-voltage line 0.3 mile east of De Graff.

In an unusual technical glitch, a farmstead about 4 miles northeast of Potwin became the default geolocation of 600 million IP addresses when the Massachusetts-based digital mapping company MaxMind changed the putative geographic center of the contiguous United States from 39.8333333,-98.585522 to 38.0000,-97.0000. Later, the default geolocation was changed to the middle of Cheney Reservoir in Kansas.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Potwin has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Whitewater is a city in Butler County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 661.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Butler County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Whitewater.

The city originally formed several miles to the east. A post office was established as White Water (as two words) on August 7, 1871. The post office was renamed to Ovo on July 7, 1882.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a branch line north–south from Herington through Whitewater to Caldwell. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

Between 1885 and 1888, several buildings were moved to the present location on the Whitewater River after the Missouri Pacific railroad came through the area. The city was established where the Missouri Pacific and Rock Island railroads intersected. The post office was renamed to White Water on May 15, 1888.

===20th century===
The historic Oak Lawn Farm Dairy Barn was built near Whitewater in 1926.

On November 1, 1950, the post office name was changed to Whitewater (one word).

In 1961, Frederic Remington High School was built immediately north of Brainerd. Leading up to this new school, Whitewater, Potwin, Brainerd, Elbing, Furley, Countryside, and Golden Gate schools merged to form a joint rural high school. Heated opposition between Whitewater and Potwin occurred during the discussion for the location of the new high school. Rural voters pushed for a centralized location in neither town. A public vote was passed to build the new school near Brainerd.

==Geography==
Whitewater is located along the West Branch of the Whitewater River. 

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Chase County near the current city of Cedar Point.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Cedar Point.

In 1862, Cedar Point was founded. The first post office in Cedar Point was established in 1862.

In 1867, a log dam was built across the Cottonwood River, and a wooden-frame mill was constructed for sawing lumber. The following year (1868) it was converted to grind flour and named Cedar Point Mill. In 1870, the name was changed to Drinkwater &amp; Schriver Mill. In 1871, construction of the current stone structure was started, then completed in 1875. In 1884, the log dam was replaced by a stone dam.

In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a main line east-west and built a nearby station named Cedar Grove in the valley north of Cedar Point. In 1996, it merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;.

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===

In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1859, Chase County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Cottonwood Falls.

The first settlement in the area of Cottonwood Falls was in 1854, when an Indian trader named Seth Hayes founded a cattle ranch on the Cottonwood River close to the mouth of Diamond Spring Creek. The area around the town was organized as Chase County in 1859, and Cottonwood Falls was designated the temporary county seat. Other early settlers arrived in Cottonwood and surrounding lands in 1856 to 1858.

The first post office in Cottonwood Falls was established in 1858. In 1873 the city&#x27;s French Renaissance style Chase County courthouse was built; at roughly the same time, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached Cottonwood Falls area. Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries the area around the city was mainly divided into farms and cattle ranches.

<text>Matfield Green is a city in Chase County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 49. It is located along K-177 highway.

==History==

===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. The historic Native American tribes of Kansas are many, including the Kansa, or &quot;Wind People,&quot; from whom the name of the state is derived. Also included are the related Osage, Pawnee, and Wichita. From the west and north ranged the Comanche and Apache, as well as the Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapaho.

From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1859, Chase County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Matfield Green.

Matfield Green was named after Matfield, in England. The village green at Matfield in Kent is known as Matfield Green.

In 1870, Bazaar Township, Chase County, Kansas which includes Matfield Green had a population of 376, growing to 1,096 by 1880. In its heyday, at the beginning of the 20th century, Matfield Green grew to about 350 residents and possessed a bank, grocery store, livery and blacksmith, hardware, flour mill and lumberyard, and even a hotel for visitors. It also had its own schools. A post office existed in Matfield Green from January 11, 1867 to September 30, 1995.

===Present===

<text>Strong City is a city in Chase County, Kansas, United States. Originally known as Cottonwood Station, in 1881 it was renamed Strong City after William Barstow Strong, then vice-president and general manager, and later president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 386. It is located along U.S. Route 50 highway.

==History==


===Early history===

For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

===19th century===
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.

In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1859, Chase County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Strong City.

In 1871, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway extended a main line from Emporia to Newton. The city originated in March 1871 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was completed to the point then known as Cottonwood Station. Strong City was originally called Cottonwood, and under the latter name laid out in 1872.

In 1881, the name was changed to Strong, in honor of William Barstow Strong, General Superintendent of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and afterward the president of the company.

The original depot was a wooden building, built in 1872, which burned in 1902 and was replaced in 1903 by another wooden building. From 1887 to 1938, a six-stall engine roundhouse employed many workers.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (three miles west of Strong City) to Superior, Nebraska. This branch line connected Strong City, Neva, Rockland, Diamond Springs, Burdick, Lost Springs, Jacobs, Hope, Navarre, Enterprise, Abilene, Talmage, Manchester, Longford, Oak Hill, Miltonvale, Aurora, Huscher, Concordia, Kackley, Courtland, Webber, Superior. At some point, the line from Neva to Lost Springs was pulled but the right of way has not been abandoned. This branch line was originally called &quot;Strong City and Superior line&quot;, but later the name was shortened to the &quot;Strong City line&quot;.

===20th century===

In 1912, construction of a new depot was begun about west of the old one, and was finished in 1913. The new brick depot was trimmed in native cut limestone was built for a cost of $20,000. A brick platform some 800-feet long was built along the front of the building, and a 250-foot freight platform was built along the rear of the building. Passenger service was discontinued in the late 1940s.

In 1945, the name was changed again, this time to Strong City.

In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway.

===21st century===
In 2006 and 2015, the &quot;Symphony in the Flint Hills&quot; concert was held two miles north of Strong City with thousands in attendance.

===Stone industry===
Local stonemasons and builders &quot;Barney Lantry &amp; Son&quot; contracted with railroad companies for projects throughout the United States. In the beginning it built stone-work for certain phases of railroad construction, but later they did build complete railroads, grading, laying the track, building bridges, stations, roundhouses, and other division buildings.

The first stone-crushers Kansas ever saw were brought to the state by the Lantrys and were operated on a very large scale at Strong City. Most of the stone for masonry and road-ballast for their jobs all over the west, was taken from their quarries at Strong City. Big stones for the Kansas State Capitol came from Strong City, each stone weighing 13,000 pounds. Stone was also used for public and private buildings in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado.

When Barney Lantry died in 1895, officials of the Santa Fe Railroad from Los Angeles to Chicago attended his funeral services in Strong City.

<text>Baxter Springs is a city in Cherokee County, Kansas, United States, and located along Spring River. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 3,888. 

==History==

=== Indigenous settlement ===
For thousands of years, indigenous peoples had lived along the waterways throughout the west. The Osage migrated west from the Ohio River area of Kentucky, driven out by the Iroquois. They settled in Kansas by the mid-17th century, adopting Plains Indian traditions. They competed with other tribes and by 1750 they dominated much of what is now the region of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.

One of the largest Osage bands was led by Chief Black Dog (&quot;Manka - Chonka&quot;). His men completed what became known as the Black Dog Trail by 1803. It started from their winter territory east of Baxter Springs and extended southwest to their summer hunting grounds at the Great Salt Plains in present-day Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. The Osage regularly stopped at the springs for healing on their way to summer hunting grounds. They made the trail by clearing it of brush and large rocks, and constructing earthen ramps to the fords. Wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast, the trail was the first improved road in Kansas and Oklahoma.

=== American frontier ===
During the late 1830s and Indian Removal, the Cherokee people were among the Five Civilized Tribes forced out of the Southeast United States to west of the Mississippi River. This area was defined by the United States as part of their Cherokee Neutral Lands. A trading post was established at the springs. Some Native Americans and European-American settlers began to develop a community around the post. The 19th-century settlers eventually named the city and nearby springs after early settler A. Baxter. He had claimed land about 1850 and built a frontier tavern or inn.

=== Civil War era ===
During the American Civil War, the United States government built several rudimentary military posts at present-day Baxter Springs, fortifying what had been a trading post: Fort Baxter, Camp Ben Butler and Camp Hunter. This was to protect settlers against the Confederate regulars and partisan guerrillas operating in the eastern part of state.

On October 4, 1863, some 400 men of the pro-Southern Quantrill&#x27;s raiders were passing on their way to Texas for the winter. They attacked Fort Blair. Part of the garrison was away from the fort on assignment. The remainder, mostly United States Colored Troops, held the fort with few casualties. Quantrill&#x27;s men later encountered an unrelated detachment of 103 Union troops out on the prairie. The Confederates overwhelmed them, killing nearly all the Union men, including many after they were captured.

After temporarily reinforcing the fort, the United States abandoned the Baxter Springs area later that year. It moved its troops to the better fortified Fort Scott, Kansas. Before leaving, US forces tore down and destroyed Fort Baxter to make it unusable for hostiles.

=== Cowtown ===
Most of the town&#x27;s growth took place after the war, when it began to develop at a rapid pace. By 1867, entrepreneurs had constructed a cable ferry across the Spring River, which was operated into the 1880s. At that time, it was replaced by the first bridge built across the river.

Around 1868 there was a great demand for beef in the North. Texas cattlemen and stock raisers drove large herds of cattle from the southern plains, and used Baxter Springs as a way point to the northern markets at Kansas City, which linked to railroads to the East. This led to the dramatic growth of Baxter Springs by the early 1870s as the first &quot;cow town&quot; in Kansas. By 1875, its population was estimated at 5,000.

The town organized the Stockyards and Drovers Association to buy and sell cattle. They constructed corrals for up to 20,000 head of cattle, supplied with ample grazing lands and fresh water. Texas cattle trade stimulated the growth of related businesses, and Baxter Springs grew rapidly. The town was regularly the rowdy gathering place of cowboys, and saloons, livery stables, brothels and hotels were developed to support their seasonal business. At the same time other settlers were building schools and churches, to support family life.

=== Resort town ===
After railroads were constructed from the North into Texas later in the century, cattlemen no longer needed to conduct the cattle drives, or to use Baxter Springs as a way station to markets. The first railroad to enter Texas from the north, completed in 1872, was the As ranchers started shipping their beef directly from Texas, business in Baxter Springs and other cow towns fell off sharply.

However, the Baxter spring developed a medicinal reputation. The town became a destination resort around the springs for travelers brought by the new railroad.

=== Mining center ===

The discovery of lead in large veins in the tri-state area revived the area towns from the economic doldrums in the early twentieth century. In the early days of Baxter Springs, lead had been found in small quantities along Spring Creek, but it was of poor quality. It was suspected that higher grade ore could be found, but only at deeper depths. The Baxter Springs City Council by Ordinance 42 enacted provisions that greatly limited any mining within city limits. Their actions protected the land in the city; nearby towns have suffered from mining-related environmental degradation.

Baxter Springs certainly benefited from the business and revenues generated by regional mining activity. Many of the mine owners and operators built ambitious houses here to reflect their success. In addition, in the early 1900s many mining executives built their business offices in Baxter Springs. By the 1940s, however, much of the high-quality ore had been mined, and the industry declined in the region. Some towns became defunct, and Hockerville, Lincolnville, Douthit, Zincville and others disappeared. The mining practices of the time caused considerable environmental degradation in the region. Federal and state restoration efforts have helped to improve the land since the late twentieth century.

In 1926, the downtown main street was designated as part of the historic Route 66 transcontinental highway connecting Chicago and Los Angeles. The highway became known informally as America&#x27;s &quot;Main Street&quot;, because it used the main arteries of many cities. Designation as Route 66 stimulated related growth along the highway, including of motels and fast food places, and it gained a prominent place in popular culture. Baxter Springs was one of only three towns through which Route 66 passed in Kansas.

Since the late 20th century, the town has reserved the land of Riverside Park along the Spring River. This has renewed the community&#x27;s connection and preserved access to the river and its green banks.

===2014 tornado===

A tornado started near Quapaw, Oklahoma and moved through Baxter Springs on April 27, 2014.

==Geography==
Baxter Springs is sited on the western bank of the Spring River at the edge of the Ozarks, in the Spring River basin. U.S. Route 69 Alternate and U.S. Route 166 have a junction at the city, and U.S. Route 400 bypasses it to the northeast. The center of town is less than two miles (3 km) from the Kansas-Oklahoma state border, though the incorporated area of the city extends to the border. It is also about west-southwest of Joplin, Missouri.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Galena is a city in Cherokee County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,761.

==History==

Although the railroad was built through the territory of Galena in 1871, the community did not start until the discovery of lead there in the spring of 1877. The first post office was established in 1877.

The city was originally platted by the &quot;Galena Mining and Smelting Company&quot; and was to be known as Cornwall. The city was actually known as Short Creek when first established because of a nearby creek and was known as Bonanza briefly before taking the present name of Galena in 1877, which is named after the lead ore galena found in the area. The city was part of the tri state mining area and had over 30,000 inhabitants. The population decreased after the mines closed in the 1970s.

The Jayhawk Ordnance Works northwest of Galena, built during World War II, was a large ordnance plant producing ammonium nitrate. After the war it was privatized by its operator Kenneth Aldred Spencer and at one point was the world&#x27;s largest producer of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in the world. It would form the basis for the Spencer Chemical Company&#x27;s fortune which would eventually be funneled into numerous philanthropies throughout Missouri and Kansas. The Spencer family had been in the area because of their ownership of the Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Company mining operation. The plant is still in operation as the Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation now owned by CABB.

These sites include the most serious abandoned hazardous waste sites in the United States and represent the priority list for remedial action under the Superfund program. The site consists of approximately 115 square miles, divided into seven subsites including Galena. The Cherokee County site encompasses the Kansas portion of the Tri-State district, the latter including Northeastern Oklahoma and Southwestern Missouri.

<doc id="114468" wikidata="Q2384288" url="?curid=114468" title="Treece, Kansas">
<text>Treece is a ghost town in Cherokee County, Kansas, United States, and part of the historic Tri-State Mining District. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 138. As of May 2012 the city was abandoned and most buildings and other facilities demolished due to pervasive problems with lead pollution resulting from past mining. Two people who had refused an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) buyout remained in 2012, one of whom died in 2016.

==History==
Treece and neighboring former cities Picher, Cardin and Douthat were formed as a result of mining operations in the early 20th century. Realtor J. O. Treece lent the town his name. The first post office in Treece was established in 1917. Treece was a major supplier of lead, zinc, and iron ore. During its maximum production, Treece and Picher combined had a population of over 20,000 and produced $20 billion worth of ore mainly during World War I and World War II. After the 1970s, ore production declined rapidly as did the city&#x27;s population. In 1981 the Environmental Protection Agency deemed the Tri-State Mining District as contaminated and promised to take actions to clean up the area.

The cleanup of Tri-State Mining District lands was divided for EPA purposes into a total of four National Priority List (NPL) Superfund Sites: the Cherokee County Site, Cherokee County, Kansas; the Orongo-Duenweg Site, Jasper County, Missouri; the Newton County Mine Tailings Site, Newton County, Missouri; and the Tar Creek Site, Ottawa County, Oklahoma. The Cherokee County Superfund Site was in turn divided into seven subsites that were grouped and divided into nine operable units (OUs). The area around Treece was designated OU4. Thus, while Treece is located less than a mile north of Picher, Oklahoma, a town which was closed due to lead pollution, Treece was located at a different Superfund site. Picher&#x27;s residents&#x27; property was bought out by the Environmental Protection Agency. Residents of Treece also demanded a buy-out, but at first were not certain of receiving one.
As of September 2009, it was reported that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wanted to clean up the soil in Treece, instead of moving its residents away. Congress, however, passed an environmental appropriations bill on October 29, 2009, that authorized the EPA to buy out the town. Residents had until August 31, 2010 to apply for a Federal buyout and offers were to be made to the 80 residents who applied in December. As of May 2, 2012 only one couple had rejected the buyout offer and remained in Treece living in a double-wide trailer. Other than their location all other facilities in the former city have been sold, moved, or demolished.

In 2012, the State of Kansas officially disincorporated the city of Treece.

== Contamination ==
Treece, Kansas was deemed as uninhabitable and contaminated by the Environmental Protection Agency because of the large chat piles and leftover mine tailings that still exist in the abandoned town today. Wes Enzinna, a writer for The New York Times, visited Treece in 2010 and interviewed some of the remaining residents. They claimed that years before Treece was ruled contaminated by the EPA, children who swam in the local Tar Creek Superfund site would end up with chemical burns (superficially resembling sunburn) all over their bodies.

The reason that the chat piles and mine tailings are so dangerous is because of the high amount of lead that is still left in the rock. While short-term exposure to lead will not necessarily harm a person, if one is exposed for long periods of time, which the people living in Treece were, it can result in high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, and reduced fertility. No studies have been done to determine the effects that the toxic environment left on the health of former residents of Treece, Kansas.

Some of the chat piles in Treece are up to tall and the dust that is blown off from these piles “still contains enough metal to make blood-lead levels among young children here three times higher than the national average”. The residents of Treece had been dealing and living with dangerous amounts of toxic waste in their backyards for 50–60 years before anything was done to clean up the area. 

When the mining companies stopped mining, they shut off the water pumps that kept the mines from flooding. When the floodwater traveled through the mining tunnels, it picked up all the leftover traces of minerals that were left behind. The water then found its way into the local Tar Creek and other streams, contaminating the water and ruining the habitat of the local wildlife. 

It is important to add that Tar Creek runs through Treece and many other towns in the area that faced the same issues as Treece.

==Geography==
Treece is located in southeast Kansas adjacent to the Kansas-Oklahoma border just west of U.S. Route 69. Picher, Oklahoma lies one mile to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , all land.

Weir is, in large part undermined at a depth of about 30 feet where coal was mined from a 4 foot thick vein. In 1899, more than 200 African-American miners traveled to Weir from Pana, Illinois, after being attacked by white union members in what was called the Pana riot during a coal mining strike. They were eager for work and unwilling to return to Alabama, from where they had been recruited.

<text>Concordia is a city in and the county seat of Cloud County, Kansas, United States. It is located along the Republican River in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains in North Central Kansas. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 5,111. Concordia is home of the Cloud County Community College and the Nazareth Convent and Academy.

==History==

===19th century===

Concordia holds the distinction of being elected the county seat before the town was created. The founder of the town, James M. Hagaman, had created a complete layout of the town on paper including streets, blocks, courthouse, and parks. The name &quot;Concordia&quot; was chosen because a member of the early group of promoters (&quot;Cap&quot; Snyder) had once lived in Concordia, Missouri, and liked the name because it paid homage to the settlers-to-be&#x27;s German heritage; the name &quot;Concordia&quot; is a German name found in many early Germanic poems.

December 1869 was the first election for the county seat with Concordia, Clyde, and the now defunct town, Sibley. Without a clear majority, a second election was held between Concordia and Sibley on January 4, 1870. Concordia was declared the winner over Sibley, 165 votes to 129.

It was over a year later when Concordia officially became a community when the Republican Land District Office opened on January 16, 1871. The Concordia Land Office continued until February 28, 1889, when it was consolidated with the land office in Topeka, Kansas.

Also in 1871, Concordia elected its first mayor, R. E. Allen. Under his leadership, Concordia was officially incorporated as a third class city under Kansas law in August 1872.

Concordia was visited in its early years by many traveling shows. As early as 1876, various traveling entertainers, including Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody, Ringling Brothers, and others came to Concordia. In 1892, the Ringling train wrecked east of the town killing two men and 20 horses, but the show played the next day to a crowd of 4,000.

The first schoolteacher to teach inside the city limits was Milo Stevens, who was paid a salary of $20 per month. A state normal school was set up in Concordia in 1874 with F. E. Robinson as principal and former state Superintendent H. D. McCarty became president the second year. In 1876, the state ceased to provide funding and the school was closed.

In 1887, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway built a branch line from Neva (three miles west of Strong City) through Concordia to Superior, Nebraska. In 1996, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway merged with Burlington Northern Railroad and renamed to the current BNSF Railway. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Santa Fe.&quot;

In 1897, Pope Leo XIII founded the Roman Catholic Diocese of Concordia, Kansas. The diocese operated until 1947 when it was merged with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina. It was later restored as a titular see in 1995.

===20th century===
Carrie Nation visited Concordia in the early 1900s. Records are mixed, but the date is placed between 1908 and 1910. The &quot;Concordia Blade&quot; newspaper (now the &quot;Concordia Blade-Empire&quot;) reported:

&quot;Carrie Nation is in town. That wonderfully brave little woman who started the crusade against Kansas saloons lectured at the M.E. Church this afternoon, and will talk again tonight at the courthouse. While in this city she is the guest of Mrs. George Mohr.&quot;

A major geographic change in the city and the area occurred on July 9, 1902. The Republican River flooded near town and broke a dam. The flooding resulted in re-routing the river by 1/4 of a mile.

The year of 1912 brought a major blizzard to Concordia with snow so deep that a Union Pacific train became stuck northeast of town and snowbanks on main street piled as high as peoples&#x27; heads. Also in 1912, the first official inspection team for Meridian Highway (now US-81) came through Concordia on their tour from Canada to Mexico. In 1913, the Missouri Pacific Railway depot was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old building.

Another flood took place on June 20, 1915. Damage from the flood was significant but not as wide-sweeping as the flood of 1902.

From May 1, 1943 through November 8, 1945, Camp Concordia was a World War II internment camp for German POWS.

===Points of interest===

In November 1905, Concordia resident Colonel Napoleon Bonaparte Brown announced to the townspeople his plans to build the Brown Grand Theatre, a fully outfitted opera house for Concordia. Renowned Kansas City theater architect Carl Boller was hired to prepare the design drawings and the blueprints. Restored to its original 1907 state, the 650 seat Brown Grand Theatre now serves as a tourist attraction and performing arts/community center for Concordia and North Central Kansas.

Camp Concordia, a prisoner of war camp for captured Germans, was maintained a few miles north of Concordia during World War II. The original guard house remains and has been restored.

The Cloud County Historical Museum preserves and exhibits objects and documents of historical items representing early-day Kansas. It is housed in the former 1908 Andrew Carnegie Library building and a large newer annex. Cloud County, Kansas artifacts exhibited for viewing include items relating to nature, radio, railroads, quilts, photography, toys, vintage clothing and furniture, musical instruments, fossils, tools, and stained glass. The museum is also home of one of the largest hand carved brick murals. Records are on display of the military Prisoner of War Camp, churches, organizations, schools, and businesses. Displays of glass cutting, rare coins and books, rock and gem shop, micro-film of county newspapers and many others too numerous to list. Large displays in the annex include the 1908 Lincoln-Page Airplane, an 1898 Holsman belt driven horseless carriage, and a 1915 Ford Model T.

The Cloud County Veterans Memorial is housed in the courthouse block of Concordia. The memorial includes an &quot;eternal flame&quot; that has been burning since the monument was established on November 11, 1968.

Concordia is the home of the national Orphan Train complex, housed in the restored historic Union Pacific Railroad Depot. The complex currently houses a museum and research center dedicated to the preservation of the stories and artifacts of those who were part of the Orphan Train Movement from 1854 to 1929.

The Nazareth Convent and Academy is the official Motherhouse and Home for the 260 Sisters of St. Joseph of Concordia. It was built in 1903 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The sisters at Nazareth earned a reputation for their education of young women, giving them a sound academic program and instruction in the fine arts, music, French, and the social graces. In 1903, the Sisters of St. Joseph entered the health care field in Concordia with the establishment of the St. Joseph Hospital on the original site after the new Nazareth Motherhouse was built at its present location.

All three bridges are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jamestown is a city in Cloud County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 237.

==History==
Jamestown was founded in 1878, and was incorporated as a city in 1883. It was named for either Senator James Pomeroy, or James P. Pomeroy, a railroad official. A post office was opened in Alva (an extinct town) in 1871, but it was moved to Jamestown in 1878. The town located itself on the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

===1911 fire===
 In 1911 the entire downtown business district was destroyed by a fire. Few records remain of that fire, but the townspeople subsequently rebuilt the downtown commercial district. Three towns in the area had devastating downtown fires on the same night: Jamestown, Courtland, and Glasco. Damage was reported to amount to $500,000 at the time.

===2000 fire===
History repeated itself on January 28, 2000 when another fire consumed several buildings on Main Street and spread to the city hall. And again, history repeated itself as the town rebuilt. Mayor Judy Hill stated, &quot;A fire like that can destroy a small town, but instead it ignited a community spirit here.&quot; In a few days, Jamestown was having town meetings to make plans for the future.

===Rebuilding town===
The funeral home in Jamestown was selected as the temporary city office and meeting place. More than 50 people (out of a population of 307 at the time) came to town meetings there and the citizens organized into several committees to begin work.

Today, Jamestown has a new community center with daycare facilities and a thriving downtown activities center with a health clinic, public library, and several businesses.

==Geography==

==Economy==

Jamestown is mostly a small agricultural community. There is a local bank that services accounts through the area. Through local efforts and federal funding, a community center, activities center, and public library have been added to the downtown area. A large number of residents complete their shopping in nearby Concordia, Kansas.

The opening day of hunting season brings an influx of people who enjoy small bird game hunting. Also, the nearby Jamestown Wildlife Area (commonly called &quot;Jamestown Lake&quot;) provides fishing for local anglers seeking small fish such as perch, crappie, and bass.

A weekly newspaper called the &quot;Jamestown Settler&quot; was published from 1977 until 1983. Other papers were published from time to time, including &quot;The Kansas Optimist&quot; from 1904 until 1965 and &quot;The Quill&quot; from 1888–1890.

==Education==
The community is served by Concordia USD 333 public school district.

In 1911, local residents of Jamestown transferred some property to School District 32 to create the Jamestown Schools. Kansas public schools underwent reorganization and in 1962, the &quot;old&quot; school district 32 entered a Quit Claim Deed and transferred the property to Unified School District 333. The Jamestown School provided classes for grades 1-12 in one building and also maintained a second building for industrial arts classes. The school also kept a playground and athletic field.

Jamestown maintained a public school until the junior high school and high school was closed in 1980. The elementary school was closed in 1983. The student population was always considered small compared to many other area public schools, and in the later years the enrollment fell to an average of between only six and eight students per grade level. Jamestown residents are currently served by Concordia USD 333 public school district.

Records from October 1984 show a Resolution to Transfer the property from USD 333 back to the City of Jamestown. The main building has been demolished and only the gym stands today.

Jamestown High School athletic teams were known as the Jamestown Jayhawks and competed in the Pike Trail League, primarily made up of small local schools in the area. Students participated in 8-man football, volleyball, basketball, and track &amp; field.
