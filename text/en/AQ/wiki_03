<text>Bucknell University is a private liberal-arts college in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1846 as the University at Lewisburg, it now consists of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Freeman College of Management, and the College of Engineering. It offers 65 majors and 70 minors in the sciences and humanities. Located just south of Lewisburg, the campus rises above the West Branch of the Susquehanna River.

Approximately 3,700 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students attend the university. The school is a member of the Patriot League in NCAA Division I athletics. Its nickname is the Bucknell Bison, while its mascot is Bucky the Bison.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
Founded in 1846 as the University at Lewisburg, Bucknell traces its origin to a group of Baptists from White Deer Valley Baptist Church who deemed it &quot;desirable that a Literary Institution should be established in Central Pennsylvania, embracing a High School for male pupils, another for females, a College and also a Theological Institution.&quot;

The group&#x27;s efforts for the institution began to crystallize in 1845, when Stephen William Taylor, a professor at Madison University (now Colgate University) in Hamilton, New York, was asked to prepare a charter and act as general agent for the development of the university. The charter for the University at Lewisburg, granted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and approved by the governor on February 5, 1846, carried one stipulation–that $100,000 ($ today) be raised before the new institution would be granted full corporate status. 

In 1846, the &quot;school preparatory to the University&quot; opened in the basement of the First Baptist Church in Lewisburg. Known originally as the Lewisburg High School, it became in 1848 the Academic and Primary Department of the University at Lewisburg.

The school&#x27;s first commencement was held on August 20, 1851, for a graduation class of seven men. Among the board members attending was James Buchanan, who would become the 15th President of the United States. Stephen Taylor officiated as his last act before assuming office as president of Madison University. One day earlier, the trustees had elected Howard Malcom as the first president of the university, a post he held for six years.

===Female Institute===

Although the Female Institute began instruction in 1852, it wasn&#x27;t until 1883 that college courses were opened to women. Bucknell, though, was committed to equal educational opportunities for women. This commitment was reflected in the words of David Jayne Hill of the Class of 1874, and president of the college from 1879 to 1888: &quot;We need in Pennsylvania, in the geographical centre of the state, a University, not in the German but in the American sense, where every branch of non-professional knowledge can be pursued, regardless of distinction of sex. I have no well-matured plan to announce as to the sexes; but the Principal of the Female Seminary proposes to inaugurate a course for females equal to that pursued at Vassar; the two sexes having equal advantages, though not reciting together.&quot; Within five years of opening, enrollment had grown so sharply that the college built a new hall–Larison Hall–to accommodate the Female Institute.

===Benefactor William Bucknell===
In 1881, facing dire financial circumstances, the college turned to William Bucknell, a charter member of the board of trustees, for help. His donation of $50,000 ($ today) saved the college from ruin. In 1886, in recognition of Bucknell&#x27;s support of the college, the trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the University at Lewisburg to Bucknell University. Bucknell Hall, the first of several buildings given to the institution by Bucknell, was initially a chapel and for more than a half century the site of student theatrical and musical performances. Today, it houses the Stadler Center for Poetry.

===Continued expansion===

The 40 years from 1890 until 1930 saw a steady increase in the number of faculty members and students. When the Depression brought a drop in enrollment in 1933, several members of the faculty were &quot;loaned&quot; to found a new institution: Bucknell Junior College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Today, that institution is a four-year university, Wilkes University, independent of Bucknell since 1947. The depression era also saw the commissioning by President Homer Rainey (1931–35) of architect Jens Larson to design Bucknell&#x27;s master plan. Subsequent expansion of the university still largely adheres to this plan.

The post-War period saw a dramatic increase in higher education enrollment across the United States, thanks first to the G.I. Bill and then to the baby boom. Like other institutions, Bucknell&#x27;s campus grew to accommodate a growing student body, and the college broke ground on many of the academic buildings that comprise upper campus. Chief among these is the Ellen Clarke Bertrand Library, commissioned in 1946 under Bucknell President and former Governor of Maine Horace Hildreth and opened in 1951. Other major additions from the building spree of the 1950s and 60s include the Olin Science Building and Coleman, Marts and Swartz Halls.

===Building for the future===
A growing reputation and changing expectations for undergraduate education in the United States called for improved facilities. The 1970s brought construction of the Elaine Langone Center, the Gerhard Fieldhouse and the Computer Center. In the 1980s, the capacity of Bertrand Library was doubled, facilities for engineering were substantially renovated, and the Weis Center for the Performing Arts was inaugurated.

Heading into the 21st century, new facilities for the sciences included the renovation of the Olin Science Building, the construction of the Rooke Chemistry Building in 1990 and a new Biology Building in 1991. The Weis Music Building was inaugurated in 2000, the O&#x27;Leary Building for Psychology and Geology opened in the fall of 2002, the new Kenneth Langone Recreational Athletic Center opened in 2003 and the Breakiron Engineering Building in 2004.

==Campus==
===Grounds===
Bucknell&#x27;s campus comprises more than 100 buildings located over a gentle rise adjacent to the West Branch Susquehanna River. The campus is divided into Lower Campus and Upper Campus by Miller Run and the Grove, a stand of oak trees that ascends the slope. Lower Campus consists primarily of student housing and the institution&#x27;s sports facilities. Upper Campus mainly contains academic buildings. It offers views northwest across the Buffalo Valley toward Mount Nittany and southeast across the Susquehanna River toward Montour Ridge. Bucknell&#x27;s campus forms a cohesive architectural ensemble due to the sustained use of brick and the recurrent themes of Georgian style. The institution&#x27;s first building, Taylor Hall, was constructed in 1848. The oldest residential hall on the campus is Daniel C. Roberts Hall (originally known as Old Main in 1858). Its newest building, Holmes Hall, was inaugurated in 2021.
===Non-academic facilities===

Rooke Chapel is the non-denominational setting for campus worship, weddings, and celebrations. The chapel was a gift of Robert Levi Rooke (class of 1913), a member of the board of trustees. The chapel is named in memory of Rooke&#x27;s parents and was inaugurated on October 25, 1964.

Christy Mathewson–Memorial Stadium is a 13,100-seat multi-purpose stadium built in 1924 and renovated in 1989, when it was also renamed in honor of Christy Mathewson (class of 1902), a New York Giants Hall of Fame pitcher.

The Bucknell Farm was established in 2018, building on the success of the Lewisburg Community Garden, a partnership between Bucknell University and the Borough of Lewisburg. The organic farm overlooking Montour Ridge offers learning and service opportunities for students and provides fresh, local produce for the institution&#x27;s dining system. Along with a 1.76-megawatt solar array installed in 2022, the farm reflects Bucknell&#x27;s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and long-term environmental sustainability.

Bucknell Greenhouse is located on the fourth floor of the Biology Building. In 2023, the Century Plant (&quot;Agave americana&quot;) bloomed for the first time in thirty years. The greenhouse contains three ecosystems: a desert, wetlands, and tropical and temperate forests.

In 2023, the school began the first part of the Bucknell Greenway, what will be a educational recreation path around campus, while also connecting to the athletic fields across U.S. Route 15.

==Academics==
Bucknell has a total enrollment of around 3,950 undergraduate and thirty graduate students. With around 400 faculty, the faculty to student ratio is 9:1, with the average class size of approximately twenty students. Bucknell has traditionally had strong engineering programs. With the addition for the Freeman College of Management in 2017, Bucknell offers a balance of foundational liberal-arts study and pre-professional training, a statistic reflected in the 25% of students who choose to double major. In 2021, the largest majors were Accounting and Finance (79 graduates), Political Science and Government (76 graduates), and Economics (67 graduates). For the years between 2015 and 2021, 18% of students reported pursuing post-graduate study within nine months of graduating. 

===College of Arts and Sciences===

The College of Arts and Sciences anchors Bucknell University in the liberal-arts tradition. Its three divisions—arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences and mathematics—host 275 faculty members in 34 departments and 66% percent of all students enrolled in fifty majors. The college emphasizes intellectual community in diversity, transformative education for the common good, mentorship that encourages students to lead examined lives and leading-edge research and scholarship.

<text>A kibbutz ( / , ; : kibbutzim / ) is an intentional community in Israel that was traditionally based on agriculture. The first kibbutz, established in 1910, was Degania. Today, farming has been partly supplanted by other economic branches, including industrial plants and high-tech enterprises. Kibbutzim began as utopian communities, a combination of socialism and Zionism. In recent decades, some kibbutzim have been privatized and changes have been made in the communal lifestyle. A member of a kibbutz is called a &quot;kibbutznik&quot; ( / ; plural &quot;kibbutznikim&quot; or &quot;kibbutzniks&quot;), the suffix &quot;-nik&quot; being of Slavic origin.

In 2010, there were 270 kibbutzim in Israel with a total population of 126,000. Their factories and farms account for 9% of Israel&#x27;s industrial output, worth US$8 billion, and 40% of its agricultural output, worth over US$1.7 billion. Some kibbutzim had also developed substantial high-tech and military industries. For example, in 2010, Kibbutz Sasa, containing some 200 members, generated US$850 million in annual revenue from its military-plastics industry.

Currently, the kibbutzim are organised in the secular Kibbutz Movement, with some 230 kibbutzim, the Religious Kibbutz Movement with 16 kibbutzim, and the much smaller religious Poalei Agudat Yisrael, with two kibbutzim, all part of the wider communal settlement movement.

== History ==
=== The first kibbutzim ===
The kibbutzim were founded by members of the Bilu movement who emigrated to Palestine. Like the members of the First Aliyah (1881-1903) who came before them and established agricultural villages, most members of the Second Aliyah planned to become farmers, almost the sole career available in the agrarian economy of Ottoman Palestine.

The first kibbutz was Degania Alef, founded in 1910.

Some founders of the Kibbutz movement in Israel were influenced by the ideals of Ancient Sparta, particularly in education and communal living.

Yosef Baratz, one of the pioneers of the kibbutz movement, wrote a book about his experiences.

Though Baratz and others wanted to farm the land themselves, becoming independent farmers was not a realistic option in 1909. As Arthur Ruppin, a proponent of Jewish agricultural colonization of the Trans-Jordan, would later say, &quot;The question was not whether group settlement was preferable to individual settlement; it was rather one of either group settlement or no settlement at all.&quot;

Ottoman Palestine was a harsh environment. The Galilee was swampy, the Judaean Mountains rocky, and the south of the country, the Negev, was a desert. To make things more challenging, most of the settlers had no prior farming experience. The sanitary conditions were also poor. Malaria, typhus and cholera were rampant. Bedouins would raid farms and settled areas. Sabotage of irrigation canals and burning of crops were also common. Living collectively was simply the most logical way to be secure in an unwelcoming land. On top of safety considerations, establishing a farm was a capital-intensive project; collectively, the founders of the kibbutzim had the resources to establish something lasting, while independently they did not.

Finally, the land had been purchased by the greater Jewish community. From around the world, Jews dropped coins into Jewish National Fund &quot;Blue Boxes&quot; for land purchases in Palestine. In 1909, Baratz, nine other men, and two women established themselves at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee near the Arab village of Umm Juni/Juniya. These teenagers had hitherto worked as day laborers converting wetlands for human development, as masons, or as hands at the older Jewish settlements. Their dream was now to work for themselves, building up the land. They called their community &quot;Kvutzat Degania&quot; (lit. &quot;collective of wheat&quot; or &quot;community of cereal grains&quot;), now Degania Alef.

The founders of Degania endured backbreaking labor: &quot;The body is crushed, the legs fail, the head hurts, the sun burns and weakens,&quot; wrote one of the pioneers. At times, half of the kibbutz members could not report for work and many left. Despite the difficulties, by 1914, Degania had fifty members. Other kibbutzim were founded around the Sea of Galilee and the nearby Jezreel Valley.

=== During the British Mandate ===

The fall of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, followed by the arrival of the British, brought with it benefits for the Jewish community of Palestine and its kibbutzim. The Ottoman authorities had made immigration to Palestine difficult and restricted land purchases. Rising antisemitism forced many Jews to flee Eastern Europe. To escape the pogroms, tens of thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to Palestine in the early 1920s, in a wave of immigration that was called the Third Aliyah.

Zionist Jewish youth movements flourished in the 1920s, from right-wing movements like Betar to left-wing socialist groups such as Dror, Brit Haolim, Qadima, HabBonim (now Habonim Dror), and Hashomer Hatzair. In contrast to those who came as part of the Second Aliyah, these youth group members had some agricultural training before embarking. Members of the Second Aliyah and Third Aliyah were also less likely to be Russian, since emigration from Russia was closed off after the Russian Revolution. European Jews who settled on kibbutzim between the World Wars were from other countries in Eastern Europe, including Germany.

In the early days, communal meetings were limited to practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz on the shores of the Kinneret, one woman said: &quot;Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [they were] nights of searching for one another—that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, it seemed to me that from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens... At the center of our camp a fire burns, and under the weight of the hora the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs&quot;.

Kibbutzim founded in the 1920s tended to be larger than the kibbutzim like Degania that were founded prior to World War I. Degania had had twelve members at its founding. Eyn Harod, founded only a decade later, began with 215 members.

Kibbutzim grew and flourished in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1922, there were 700 people living on kibbutzim in Palestine. By 1927, the number had risen to 2,000. When World War II erupted, 24,105 people were living on 79 kibbutzim, comprising 5% of the Jewish population of Mandate Palestine. In 1950, the figures went up to 65,000, accounting for 7.5% of the population. In 1989, the kibbutz population peaked at 129,000. By 2010, the number decreased to about 100,000; the number of kibbutzim in Israel was 270.

=== Development of kibbutz movements ===
In 1927, the United Kibbutz Movement was established. Several Hashomer Hatzair kibbutzim banded together to form Kibbutz Artzi. In 1936, Socialist League of Palestine was founded, and served as an urban ally of HaKibbutz HaArtzi. In 1946, HaKibbutz HaArtzi and the Socialist League combined to form the Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party of Palestine which in 1948, merged with Ahdut HaAvoda to form the left-wing Mapam party.
In 1928, Degania and other small kibbutzim formed &quot;Hever Hakvutzot&quot; (&quot;The Kvutzot Association&quot;). Kvutzot were deliberately small, not exceeding 200 members, in the belief that this was imperative for maintaining trust. Kvutzot did not have youth-group affiliations in Europe. Kibbutzim affiliated with the United Kibbutz Movement took in as many members as they could. Givat Brenner eventually came to have more than 1,500 members. Artzi kibbutzim were also more devoted to gender equality than other kibbutzim. Women called their husbands &quot;ishi&quot; (&quot;my man&quot;) rather than the customary Hebrew word for husband &quot;ba&#x27;ali&quot; (lit. &quot;my master&quot;). The children slept in children&#x27;s houses and visited their parents only a few hours a day.

There were also differences in religion. Kibbutz Artzi and United Kibbutz Movement kibbutzim were secular, even staunchly atheistic, proudly trying to be &quot;monasteries without God&quot;. Although most mainstream kibbutznikim also disdained the Orthodox Judaism of their parents, they wanted their new communities to have Jewish characteristics nonetheless. Friday nights were still Shabbat with a white tablecloth and fine food and work was not done on Saturday if it could be avoided. Only later did some kibbutzim adopt Yom Kippur as the day to discuss fears for the future of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim also had collective Bar and Bat Mitzvahs for their children.

Kibbutznikim did not pray three times a day like their parents and grandparents, but would mark holidays like Shavuot, Sukkot, and Passover with dances, meals, and celebrations. One Jewish holiday, Tu BiShvat, the &quot;birthday of the trees&quot; was substantially revived by kibbutzim. All in all, holidays with some kind of agricultural component, like Passover and Sukkot, were the most significant for kibbutzim.

Religious kibbutzim were established in clusters before the establishment of the State, creating the Religious Kibbutz Movement. The first religious kibbutz was Ein Tzurim, founded in 1946.

=== Statebuilding ===
Arab opposition increased as the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the wave of Jewish settlers to Palestine began to tilt the demographic balance of the area. Arabs responded with bloody riots in Jerusalem in 1920, Jaffa in 1921 and in Hebron in 1929. In the late 1930s, Arab–Jewish violence became virtually constant; the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine is also known as the &quot;Great Uprising&quot; in Palestinian historiography.

Kibbutzim began to assume a more prominent military role. Rifles were purchased or manufactured and kibbutz members drilled and practiced shooting. Yigal Allon, an Israeli soldier and statesman, explained the role of kibbutzim in the military activities of the Yishuv:

Kibbutzim also played a role in defining the borders of the Jewish state-to-be. By the late 1930s, when it appeared that Palestine would be partitioned between Arabs and Jews, kibbutzim were established in outlying areas to ensure that the land would be incorporated into the Jewish state. In 1946, on the day after Yom Kippur, eleven new &quot;Tower and Stockade&quot; kibbutzim were hurriedly established in the northern part of the Negev to give Israel a better claim to this arid, but strategically important, region. The Marxist faction of the kibbutz movement, Kibbutz Artzi, favoured a one-state solution over partition, but advocated free Jewish immigration, which the Arabs opposed.

Kibbutzniks fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, emerging from the conflict with enhanced prestige in the nascent State of Israel. Members of Kibbutz Degania were instrumental in stopping the Syrian tank advance into the Galilee with Molotov cocktails. Maagan Michael manufactured the bullets for the Sten guns that won the war. Maagan Michael&#x27;s clandestine ammunition factory was later separated from the kibbutz and grew into Israel Military Industries.

== After the establishment of the state ==
The establishment of Israel and the flood of Jewish refugees from Europe and the Arab world presented challenges and opportunities for kibbutzim. The immigrant tide offered kibbutzim a chance to expand through new members and inexpensive labour, but it also meant that Ashkenazi kibbutzim would have to adapt to Jews whose background was far different from their own. Until the 1950s, nearly all kibbutzniks were from Eastern Europe, culturally different from the Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Iraq. Many kibbutzim hired Mizrahi Jews as labourers but were less inclined to grant them membership.

Ideological disputes were also widespread, leading to painful splits, sometimes even of individual kibbutzim, and to polarisation and animosity among members. Israel had been initially recognized by both the United States and the Soviet Union. For the first three years of its existence, Israel was in the Non-Aligned Movement, but David Ben-Gurion gradually began to take sides with the West. The question of which side of the Cold War Israel should choose created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even had Marxist members leave. The disillusionment particularly set in after the Slánský trial in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried.

Another controversy involved the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany. Should kibbutz members turn over income that was the product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would that mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.

The split between different factions within the kibbutz movement evolved between 1948 and 1954, when finally three kibbutz federations emerged, each aligned to a different Labour party: Ihud with Mapai, Meuhad with Ahdut HaAvoda, and Artzi with Mapam.

Kibbutzniks enjoyed a steady and gradual improvement in their standard of living in the first few decades after independence. In the 1960s, the kibbutzim standard of living improved faster than Israel&#x27;s general population. Most kibbutz swimming pools date from the 1960s.
Kibbutzim also continued to play an outsize role in Israel&#x27;s defence apparatus. In the 1950s and 1960s many kibbutzim were in fact founded by an Israel Defense Forces group called Nahal. Many of these 1950s and 1960s Nahal kibbutzim were founded on the precarious and porous borders of the state. In the Six-Day War, when Israel lost 800 soldiers, 200 of them were from kibbutzim. The prestige that kibbutzniks enjoyed in Israel in the 1960s was reflected in the Knesset. Though only 4% of Israelis were kibbutzniks, kibbutzniks made up 15% of Israel&#x27;s parliament.

As late as the 1970s, kibbutzim seemed to be thriving in every way. Kibbutzniks performed working-class, or even peasant-class, occupations, yet enjoyed a middle-class lifestyle.

=== Decline and restructuring ===

With time, the kibbutz members&#x27; sense of identification with the kibbutz and its goals decreased. This process originated from personal frustrations among the kibbutz members as a result of internal processes, from the growing stratification and inequality due to the growth of capitalistic practices, and a generation born and raised in the kibbutzim that did not necessarily inherit their parents’ fiery ideological and motivational drive to “settle the land”. Over the years, some kibbutz members established professional careers outside the kibbutz, accumulating power, privileges and prestige. The balance between individual values and values of the kibbutz began to tip, and work motivation was affected. An emphasis was placed on social compensation to encourage productivity. These processes occurred in parallel with a severe economic crisis (itself a sub-component of the Israeli economic crisis of the 1980s).

* The privatization processes and the adoption of non-cooperative beliefs in all of the Israeli society, affected the moral and structural support of kibbutzim, and with the years penetrated the new generations of the kibbutzim.
* The kibbutzim were built on the attempt to create a permanent and institutionalized framework, which would be able to set a pattern of conduct that would successfully handle the implementation of shared values. The attempt to place such a regular pattern required creativity in the adoption of kibbutz practices to its growth and changing kibbutz system and encompassing society, but kibbutz leadership suppressed innovators and critical thinkers, causing either failures to deal with changes or adoption of capitalist solutions that negated kibbutz basic principles.
* The kibbutzim had rural patterns of settlements, while over the years the Israeli society began adopting urban patterns of settlements. The lack of match between the patterns of the kibbutz society and the majority of the Israeli society, appealed the strong linkage between the kibbutzim with the entire Israeli society, a principle that did not allow the continuation of the collaborative model (because of the internal weakening and the loss of the all-Israeli legitimacy).
* The kibbutzim were established during the pioneer period and were the fulfilment of the Zionist vision, as during that period of time every member was required to give the maximum from himself for the good of the collective: the kibbutz and the state. In addition, as a group it was easier to deal with the common problems of the individuals—which allowed the recruitment of a large number of people for maintaining the safety of the community at that time, and therefore this way of life was suited for the Zionist goals more than other forms of life at that time.
* The original concept of the kibbutzim was based to a large extent on self-sacrifice of its members for the sake of abstract foundations and not on the cancellation of work, and therefore after the pioneer period the linkage between the kibbutz members decreased, due to the decline in the pioneering spirit and the decline in the importance of the self-sacrifice values.
* When the kibbutz was perceived as an initiator for values and national objectives, it was very much appreciated in the Israeli society and it was easier for the members to identify themselves with the kibbutz, its function and its significance. With the decrease of its appreciation and the minimizing of the social significances in the Israeli society, the kibbutz identity weakened.
* The globalization processes and the kibbutz failure to block them exposed the kibbutz society to a different type of culture. For example, after kibbutz members were allowed to have television sets in their own homes, the kibbutz members were exposed to &quot;the good life&quot; in which people were compensated for their work and could buy themselves different luxurious items. The kibbutzim were not capable of dealing with these processes.
* The collapse of the Communist bloc resulted in the weakening of Socialist beliefs around the world, including in the kibbutz society.

During the 1980s, following the peak of the kibbutzim crisis, many people started leaving their kibbutzim, and there was considerable tension due to the economic situation. In order to cope with the situation, some kibbutzim began to change in various ways.

The changes that occurred could be divided into three main types:
* Extensive privatization of the kibbutz services—in fact, such privatization had been introduced over the past two decades in many kibbutzim. Most of these privatization processes, however, were made in matters that were considered relatively minor. Currently, many kibbutzim that have privatized (some of them with subsidies) have also privatized the education and health systems, which were once considered untouchable.
* &quot;Differential wage&quot;—one famous characteristic of the kibbutzim was that each kibbutz member received an equal budget according to his or her needs, regardless of what job they held. In many kibbutzim, members are now paid differentially based on the work they do.
* &quot;Association of properties&quot;—refers to the transfer of some of the properties belonging to the kibbutz, in its capacity as a cooperative commonality, to the ownership of individual kibbutz members. This is actually true privatization (unlike the services privatization). These assets include the homes where the members live and a sort of a &quot;stock&quot; in the manufacturing component of the kibbutz. This change allows kibbutz members to sell and bequeath both types of properties, within certain limitations.

Since the mid-1990s, the number of kibbutzim making significant changes in their lifestyle has continued to grow, while the resistance to these changes has gradually decreased, with only a few dozen kibbutzim still functioning under more traditional models. It is important to note, however, that each kibbutz has undergone different processes of change. There are many people, outside and inside the kibbutzim, who claim these changes bring the end of the kibbutz concept. Among the communities that have recently officially ceased being kibbutzim are Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, HagGoshrim in the Upper Galilee, Beyt Nir in the Negev, etc.

These processes have created the &quot;renewing kibbutz&quot; ()—a kibbutz settlement pattern not fully based on the original values of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim continuing under the original kibbutz values are associated with the &quot;collaborative model&quot; ().

;New compensation models
There are now three kibbutz compensation models. 1) The traditional collective &quot;kibbutz/kibbutz shitufi&quot;, in which members are compensated equally, regardless of what work each member does; 2) the mixed model &quot;kibbutz/kibbutz meshulav&quot;, in which each member is given a small percentage of his or their salary along with a basic component given equally to all kibbutz members; and 3) the renewing &quot;kibbutz/kibbutz mithadesh&quot;, in which a member&#x27;s income consists solely of their individual income from his work and sometimes includes income from other kibbutz sources.

According to a survey conducted by the University of Haifa 188 of all kibbutzim (72%) are now converted to the &quot;renewing kibbutz&quot; model, which could be described as more individualistic kibbutz. Dr. Shlomo Getz, head of the Institute for the Research of the Kibbutz and the Cooperative Idea believes that by the end of 2012, there will be more kibbutzim switching to some alternative model.

== Ideology ==
First Aliyah immigrants were largely religious, but those of the Second Aliyah were mainly secular. A Jewish work ethic thus replaced religious practice. Berl Katznelson, a Labor Zionist leader articulated this when he said &quot;Everywhere the Jewish labourer goes, the divine presence goes with him.&quot;

The first kibbutzim were founded in the upper Jordan Valley, the Jezreel Valley and the Sharon coastal plain. The land was available for purchase because it was marshy and malaria-infested. The Zionists believed that the Arab population would be grateful for the economic benefits that developing the land would bring. Their approach was that the enemies of the Arab peasants were the Arab landowners (called &quot;effendis&quot;), not fellow Jewish farmers.

Kibbutz members were not classic Marxists though their system partially resembled Communism. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels both shared a disdain for conventional formulations of the nation state and Leninists were hostile to Zionism. Nevertheless, in the late 1930s, two kibbutz leaders, Tabenkin and Yaari, initially attracted to anarchist ideas, pushed their movements to reverence of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship and of Stalin whom many called Shemesh HaAmim (&quot;The Sun of the Nations&quot;).

The USSR voted at the UN for establishment of Israel. Stalin became hostile to Israel after it became apparent that Israel would not turn communist, so the USSR began serving diplomatic and military interests of various nations in the Arab world. This caused major crises and mass exit in both Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi kibbutzim, especially after the 1952 Rudolf Slánský Prague show trials in which most of the accused and executed party functionaries were Jews and the 1953 Doctors&#x27; plot in Moscow of mostly Jews. Nonetheless many kibbutzim cancelled Purim celebrations when Stalin collapsed on March 1, 1953. Despite Communist atrocities and increasing state antisemitism in the USSR and its satellites many in the far left kibbutz movement, like Hashomer Hatzair (The Young Guard) viewed Stalin with awe and leader of the &quot;peace camp&quot;. The party paper Al HaMishmar (On the Watch) presented this view.
Kibbutzim were run as collective enterprises within Israel&#x27;s partly free market system. Internally kibbutzim also practiced active democracy, with elections held for kibbutz functions and full participation in national elections in which the members generally voted along the lines of the kibbutz movement ideology. Jewish religious practices were banned or discouraged in many far left kibbutzim.

Kibbutzim were not the only contemporary communal enterprises: pre-war Palestine also saw the development of communal villages called &quot;moshavim&quot;. In a &quot;moshav&quot;, marketing and major farm purchases were collective, but other aspects of life were private.

In 2009, most votes from kibbutzim went to Kadima, Labor, and Meretz.

== Communal life ==
The principle of equality was taken extremely seriously up until the 1970s. Kibbutzniks did not individually own tools, or even clothing. Gifts and income received from outside were turned over to the common treasury. If a member received a gift in services—like a visit to a relative or a trip abroad paid for by a parent—there could be arguments at members&#x27; meetings about the propriety of accepting such a gift. Up until recently, members ate meals together in the communal dining hall. This was seen as an important aspect of communal life.

=== Children ===

When the first children were born at the kibbutz there were inevitably some ethical dilemmas that needed to be solved. One of these was that the kibbutz was striving for equality, including the equality of the sexes. Women were only seen as separate because they gave birth to children, automatically tying them to the domestic sphere. In order to liberate women and promote gender equality, they could not be tied to solely domestic duties and child care giving. The Kibbutz wanted to give women the opportunity to continue their work in the agricultural sector and industrial sector. As such, Chayuta Bussel states: &quot;Communal education is the first step towards woman&#x27;s liberation.&quot;

Along with gender equality, the issue of parenting under the communal way of life was a concern. The parental tendency is to view the child as a personal possession and to dominate them. The founding members of the kibbutz agreed that this was not conducive to community life. They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.

To solve these issues the founders created the communal children&#x27;s houses, where the children would spend most of their time; learning, playing and sleeping. Parents spent three to four hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and before dinner.

Collective childrearing was also a way to escape the patriarchal society that the founders came from. Children would not be dependent on their fathers economically, socially, legally or otherwise and this would eliminate the father&#x27;s authority and uproot the patriarchy.

In the children&#x27;s houses, trained nurses and teachers were the care givers. It was felt that relationships of the children and their parents would be better because parents would not have to be the sole disciplinarians. Children grew up in the community environment and grew up with children who were born in the same year as them. The financial responsibility of the children was shared by the community.

The founders of the Kibbutz sought a dynamic education for their children, that can be summed up in this statement from the founders of Kibbutz Degania:
From formal education to knowledge acquired from life, From the book to the physical work. From a discipline based on blind obedience to a regime of activity and creation in an atmosphere of freedom.

The adults in the community did their best to make the children&#x27;s house into a children&#x27;s home. They fully furnished them to accommodate every age group. &quot;It is surrounded by a courtyard, well equipped for the growing child&#x27;s needs, with flowers and bushes, hiding places, and playgrounds.&quot;

Under Freud&#x27;s influence, the importance of the early years of childhood development were understood by the Kibbutz and much emphasis was put on fostering the child&#x27;s sense of individuality, creativity, and basic trust. In practice transmission of family traditions and views was replaced by indoctrination into kibbutz and kibbutz movement views and also resulted in much uniformity vs. individuality. Significantly, this method of child rearing was not only &quot;collectivization&quot; of children, but a near complete conscious break with a cornerstone of Jewish life: focus on family, especially the nuclear family.

Although, for many of the original founders of the Kibbutz, the arrival of children was a sobering experience: &quot;When we saw our first children in the playpen, hitting one another, or grabbing toys just for themselves, we were overcome with anxiety. What did it mean that even an education in communal life couldn&#x27;t uproot these egotistical tendencies? The utopia of our initial social conception was slowly, slowly destroyed.&quot;

==== Child rearing ====
From the 1920s until the 1970s, most kibbutzim had a system whereby the children would sleep in communal children&#x27;s homes, called &#x27;Beit Yeladim&#x27; (בית ילדים), instead of in their parents&#x27; apartments.
Although the children were not raised directly by their parents, they knew who their parents were and formed close bonds with them. Throughout the morning, parents looked forward to the end of the work day when they could go to the children&#x27;s house and pick up the children to play with them and dote on them.

Children&#x27;s societies were one of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children&#x27;s societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.

Some children who went through children&#x27;s societies said they loved the experience, others remain ambivalent. One vocal group maintains that growing up without one&#x27;s parents was very difficult. Years later, a kibbutz member described her childhood in a children&#x27;s society:
Allowed to suckle every four hours, left to cry and develop our lungs, we grew up without the basic security needed for survival. Sitting on the potty at regular intervals next to other children doing the same, we were educated to be the same; but we were, for all that, different... At night the grownups leave and turn off all the lights. You know you will wet the bed because it is too frightening to go to the lavatory.
Examples of children raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt from a nearby city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat a few of the chocolates. Then the child will go over to the rest of the group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.

In a 1977 study, Fox compared the separation effects experienced by kibbutz children when removed from their mother, compared with removal from their caregiver (called a &quot;metapelet&quot; in Hebrew). He found that the child showed separation distress in both situations but, when reunited, children were significantly more attached to their mothers than to the &quot;metapelet&quot;. The children protested subsequent separation from their mothers when the &quot;metapelet&quot; was reintroduced to them. However, kibbutzim children shared high bonding with their parents as compared to those who were sent to boarding schools, because children in a kibbutz spent three to four hours with their parents every day.

In another study by Scharf, the group brought up in a communal environment within a kibbutz showed less ability in coping with imagined situations of separation than those who were brought up with their families. This has far reaching implications for child attachment adaptability and therefore institutions like kibbutzim. These interesting kibbutz techniques are controversial with or without these studies.

A mixture of criticism and nostalgia by some 20 adults born in Kibbutzim in the 1930s was documented in the 2007 film &quot;Children of the Sun&quot;. The film raised much controversy and brought about a flood of reactions in favor and against the practices of child raising in Kibbutzim in those early years of the Kibbutz. Interviews were interlaced with original footage.

The organisation of child rearing within the kibbutzim was largely based around adult imperatives rather than what was best for the children; collective parenting was seen as a means of establishing gender equality between men and women. This was a common feature of many utopian communities.

=== Higher education and intellectuality ===
On the ongoing continuity with their previously often more intellectual livelihoods, Spiro notes that it was commonly claimed to be:artificial and parasitic; but [then] physical labor, detached from intellectual and artistic values, is boorish and stultifying. What was needed was a synthesis of the two, and thus arose the notion of the “synthetic personality,” as it is termed by The Movement, the person who combines in a harmonious whole an attachment to the soil; a joy in work; and an appreciation for, if not creativity in, art, science, and literature. It is not a “landed gentry,” but a “landed intelligentsia,” that represents the kibbutz’s self-image.Thus it is that, although the formal education of the average &quot;chaver&quot; rarely included college training and many of them did not complete high school, the intellectual level of Kiryat Yedidim is probably higher than that of the average urban community, and is incomparably higher than that of the average rural community. The casual conversation overheard in the fields includes literature, politics, science, international problems, and other intellectual topics.

At the same time, he also critiques:Although the intellectualism of many of the chaverim is readily apparent, the auto-didactic nature of their learning is equally apparent. One is struck, in discussion with them, with the absence of the qualification, the reservation, the tentative attitude. This characteristic may stem, too, from yet another aspect of their intellectualism—its consumptive rather than productive nature. In all areas of “Culture,” the chaverim are primarily consumers rather than producers. In like manner, they are training their children to appreciate, but not to create art, science, and scholarship. Indeed, the intellectual or artistic creator, to the extent that he permits his intellectual productivity to interfere with his economic productivity, is not highly regarded. Since they are not engaged in productive scholarship and, indeed, are not trained in the tools of scholarship, the kibbutz intellectuals lack that primary destroyer of the dogmatic attitude—research.

Accordingly, in the beginning, higher education was not valued as very important to the Kibbutz as most of the work was in agriculture. As the kibbutz changed and moved towards manufacturing and industry, more young people went to universities and colleges to pursue higher education. The total percentage of members studying at universities among kibbutz students rose from 38 percent in 1978 to 54 percent [in 1990]. Originally the Kibbutz paid college tuition in full, but in the 1980s with the kibbutz crisis, some began to pay a smaller share of tuition costs.

=== Gender equality ===
The role of gender equality on the kibbutz is very complex and has gone through cycles since the founding of the first kibbutzim. Since there were many different kibbutzim, women had different experiences at each particular one. Some say that women were and are completely equal to men on the kibbutz while others insist there has always been inequality.
In the early days of the movement, kibbutzim tended to be male-dominated with significantly more male members. Nevertheless, women performed many of the same tasks as men. Both men and women worked in the fields, performed guard duty, and heavy labor. However, mostly women filled the traditional female roles, such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.

In the first couple of decades there was no traditional marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.

When the first children were born at the kibbutz, the founders were worried that this would tie the women to domestic service. They thought that the only difference between a man and a woman was that women gave birth and thus were automatically tied to the children and domestic duties. The communal dining and laundry were already a part of the kibbutz from the start. Of course they were implemented for reasons of living communally, but also to emancipate women from these duties so they were free to work in other sectors. With the arrival of the children, it was decided that they would be raised communally and sleep communally to free women to work in other fields. The desire to liberate women from traditional maternal duties was an ideological underpinning of the children&#x27;s society system. Women were &quot;emancipated from the yoke of domestic service&quot; in that their children were taken care of, and the laundry and cooking was done communally.

Women born on kibbutzim were much less reluctant to perform traditional female roles. Eventually most women gravitated towards the service sector. The second generation of women who were born on the kibbutz eventually got rid of the children&#x27;s houses and the Societies of Children. Most found that although they had a positive experience growing up in the children&#x27;s house, wanted their own children at home with them.
The documentary &#x27;Full Circle&#x27; summarizes the change in the women&#x27;s view of equality on the kibbutz. The original Utopian goal of the founders was complete gender equality. Children lived in the children&#x27;s houses. Freed from domestic duties, women participated in the industrial, agricultural and economic sectors alongside men. However, in the 1960s, while the rest of the Western world demanded equality of the sexes and embraced feminism, the second generation of kibbutz born women began to return to more traditional gender roles. They rejected the ideal achieved by their grandparents and returned to domestic duties such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of children. Today, most women do not participate in the economic and industrial sectors of the kibbutz. They even embraced traditional marriage. Women often played a major part in this transition, often framing their arguments in terms of what they saw as the &quot;natural needs&quot; of womanhood and motherhood.

Another example of the change in the original egalitarian nature of the kibbutz is that the founders of the kibbutz did not use the traditional Hebrew word for husband, &quot;ba&#x27;al&quot; (, BAH-al), because the word is otherwise used to mean &quot;master&quot; or &quot;owner&quot; and implies that the wife is submissive to her dominant spouse.

Statistical data proves that the majority of women work in the service and domestic sectors while men work in the production sector. According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither in the domain of work nor in the area of politics in the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 percent of the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 percent of the men. That same year, 15.2 percent of the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 percent of the men. The situation was the same in political life.

By 1979, only 9 percent of the women were engaged in some type of farming activity. &quot;[In 1979] only 12 percent of the female labor force is permanently assigned to productive branches, compared to 50 percent in 1920.&quot; Females comprise 84 percent of the service workers and the educational workers.

Also, although there was a &quot;masculinization of women&quot; at one point, there was no corresponding &quot;feminization&quot; of men. Women may have worked the fields, but men did not work in childcare.

The sociologist Arnold W. Green argues that all this may be an illustrative example of a more general tendency:The phenomenon is worldwide: women are concentrated in fields which require, singly or in combination, housewifely skills, patience and routine, manual dexterity, sex appeal, contact with children. The generalization holds for the Israeli kibbutz, with its established ideal of sexual equality. A “regression” to a separation of “women’s work” from “men’s work” occurred in the division of labor, to a state of affairs which parallels that elsewhere. The kibbutz is dominated by males and traditional male attitudes, on balance to the content of both sexes.

=== Social life ===
Along with property and ideology, social lives were also held in common. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, not as an issue of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as another way of expressing communal values. In the beginning, some kibbutzim husbands and wives were discouraged from sitting together, as marriage was an expressed form of exclusivity.
In &quot;The Kibbutz Community and Nation Building&quot;, Paula Rayman reports that Kibbutz Har refused to buy teakettles for its members in the 1950s; the issue being not the cost but that couples owning teakettles would mean more time spent together in their apartments, rather than with the community in the dining hall.

In the beginning, members were not allowed individual items, like teakettles and everything was strictly communal. Starting around the 1950s and 1960s, people were entitled to individual property, like teakettles, books, radios etc. According to Criden and Gelb &quot;The equality problem only becomes serious when there are gross deviations from basic principles&quot;. Having a few books was fine, but having a private car was unacceptable. Items like cars were communally owned and had to be requested in advance by members or used for work related duties.

Communal life proved hard for some. Every kibbutz saw some new members quit after a few years. Since kibbutzniks had no individual bank accounts, any purchase not made at the kibbutz canteen had to be approved by a committee, a potentially humiliating and time-wasting experience.
Kibbutzim also had their share of members who were not hard workers, or who abused common property; there would always be resentment against these &quot;parasites&quot;. Although according to Criden and Gelb, the vast majority of people on kibbutzim are not free-loaders. They state that their chief weapon against free-loaders is public opinion. People who do not pull their own weight in the community are frowned upon and their opinions are not taken seriously by the community and they are not given any responsibility.
Finally, kibbutzim, as small, isolated communities, tended to be places of gossip, exacerbated by lack of privacy and the regimented work and leisure schedules.

Although major decisions about the future of the kibbutz were made by consensus or by voting, day-to-day decisions about where people would work were made by elected leaders. Typically, kibbutzniks would learn their assignments by consulting the duty sheet at the dining hall.

Kibbutz memoirs from the Pioneer era report that kibbutz meetings varied from heated arguments to free-flowing philosophical discussions, whereas memoirs and accounts from kibbutz observers from the 1950s and 1960s report that kibbutz meetings were businesslike but poorly attended.

Kibbutzim attempted to rotate people into different jobs. One week a person might work in planting, the next with livestock, the week after in the kibbutz factory and the following week in the laundry. Even managers would have to work in menial jobs. Through rotation, people took part in every kind of work, but it interfered with any process of specialization.

Aversion to sex was not part of the kibbutz ideology; to this end, teenagers were not segregated at night in children&#x27;s societies, yet many visitors to kibbutzim were astonished at how conservative the communities tended to be. In &quot;Children of the Dream&quot;, Bruno Bettelheim quoted a kibbutz friend, &quot;at a time when the American girls preen themselves, and try to show off as much as possible sexually, our girls cover themselves up and refuse to wear clothing that might show their breasts or in any other fashion be revealing.&quot;
Kibbutz divorce rates were and are extremely low. Unfortunately from the point of view of the adults in the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the Westermarck effect—a form of reverse sexual imprinting whereby even unrelated children, if raised together from an early age, tend to reject each other as potential partners. The children who grew up together in the children&#x27;s houses considered their peers brothers and sisters and had close lasting bonds with each other.

From the beginning, kibbutzim had a reputation as culture-friendly and nurturing of the arts. Many kibbutzniks became writers, actors, or artists. Kibbutzim typically offer theatre companies, choirs, orchestras, athletic leagues, and special-interest classes. In 1953 Givat Brenner staged the play &quot;My Glorious Brothers&quot;, about the Maccabee revolt, building a real village on a hilltop as a set, planting real trees, and performing for 40,000 people. Following kibbutz work practices of the time, all the actors were members of the kibbutz, and all performed as part of their work assignments.

=== Crime ===
Although there have been sensational crimes on kibbutzim, overall the crime rate is lower than the national average by a significant margin.

== Psychological aspects ==
=== Emotional involvement ===
Three researchers who wrote about psychological life on kibbutzim were Melford E. Spiro (1958), Bruno Bettelheim (1969) and Michael Baizerman (1963). All concluded that a kibbutz upbringing led to individuals&#x27; having greater difficulty in making strong emotional commitments thereafter, such as falling in love or forming a lasting friendship. On the other hand, they appear to find it easier to have a large number of less-involved friendships, and a more active social life.

Some researchers came to the conclusion that children growing up in these tightly knit communities tended to see the other children around them as ersatz siblings and preferred to seek mates outside the community when they reached maturity. Some theorize that living amongst one another on a daily basis virtually from birth on produced an extreme version of the Westermarck effect, which diminished teenage kibbutzniks&#x27; sexual attraction to one another. Partly as a result of not finding a mate from within the kibbutz, youth often abandon kibbutz life as adults.

=== Private property ===
The era of independent Israel kibbutzim attracted interest from sociologists and psychologists who attempted to study the effects of life without private property and the effects of life being brought up apart from one&#x27;s parents.

Bettelheim suggested that the lack of private property was the cause of the lack of emotions in kibbutzniks. He wrote, &quot;nowhere more than in the kibbutz did I realize the degree to which private property, in the deep layers of the mind, relates to private emotions. If one is absent, the other tends to be absent as well&quot;. (See primitivism and primitive communism for a general discussion of these concepts).

=== Group pressure to conform ===
In Kibbutz life, group pressure to conform is particularly strong. It is a subject of debate within the kibbutz movement as to how successful kibbutz education was in developing the talents of gifted children. Several kibbutz-raised children look back and say that the communal system stifled ambition; others say that bright children were nonetheless encouraged. Bruno Bettelheim, in his &quot;Children of the Dream&quot; (1969), had predicted that kibbutz education would yield mediocrity: &quot;[kibbutz children] will not be leaders or philosophers, will not achieve anything in science or art.&quot; However, it has been noted that although kibbutzim comprise only 5% of the Israeli population, surprisingly large numbers of kibbutzniks become teachers, lawyers, doctors, and political leaders.

In the 1990s, a journalist tracked down the specific class of children Bettelheim had interviewed back in the 1960s at &quot;Kibbutz Atid&quot; (now called Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan). The journalist found that the children were highly accomplished in academia, business, music, and the military. &quot;Bettelheim got it totally wrong.&quot;

== Economics ==

Kibbutzim in the early days tried to be self-sufficient in all agricultural goods, from eggs to dairy to fruits to meats, but realized this was not possible. Land was generally provided by the Jewish National Fund. Later, they became dependent on government subsidies.

Even before the establishment of the State of Israel, kibbutzim began to branch out from agriculture into manufacturing. Kibbutz Degania Alef opened a factory for diamond cutting tools that came to have a gross turnover of several US million dollars a year. Kibbutz Hatzerim has a factory for drip irrigation equipment. Netafim is a multinational corporation that grosses over US$300 million a year. Maagan Michael branched out from making bullets to making plastics and medical tools, and running an ulpan. These enterprises bring in over US$100 million a year. A great wave of kibbutz industrialization came in the 1960s, and only 15% of kibbutz members worked in agriculture.

Hiring seasonal workers was always a point of controversy in the kibbutz movement. During harvest time, when hands were needed, labourers were sought outside the kibbutz. The founders of the kibbutz movement wanted to redeem the Jewish nation through manual labour, and hiring non-Jews to do hard tasks was not consistent with that idea. In the 1910s Kibbutz Degania vainly searched for Jewish masons to build their homes, but could not find Jewish stonemasons, and hired Arabs.

In the 1970s kibbutzim frequently hired Arab labourers. From the 1990s, teams of foreign workers were brought in, many from Thailand and China.

Kibbutzim have branched out into tourism, among them Kiryat Anavim, Lavi and Nahsholim. Many kibbutzim rent out homes or run guesthouses. Several kibbutzim, such as Kibbutz Lotan and Kfar Ruppin, operate bird-watching vacations and eco tours. These tours showcase their development of sustainable technologies such as mud huts and compostable toilets.

In 2010, there were 270 kibbutzim in Israel with population of 126,000.

Today, some Kibbutzim operate major industrial ventures. Their factories and farms account for 9% of Israel&#x27;s industrial output, worth US$8 billion, and 40% of its agricultural output, worth over US$1.7 billion. For example, in 2010, Kibbutz Sasa, containing some 200 members, generated US$850 million in annual revenue from its military-plastics industry. Kibbutz Ketura is leading Israel&#x27;s development of solar technology, becoming a popular eco tourism attraction.

== Types ==
There are three kibbutz movements:
# The Kibbutz Movement, which constitutes an umbrella organization of two separate movements and ideologies: the United Kibbutz Movement, founded in 1979 as a merger of two older movements: the United Kibbutz and Union of Kvutzot and Kibbutzim, and Kibbutz Artzi Hashomer Hatzair
# Religious Kibbutz Movement Hapoel HaMizrachi
# Poalei Agudat Yisrael

Many kibbutzim were initially established by Nahal groups affiliated with Israeli youth movements, among them HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, Hashomer Hatzair and HaMachanot HaOlim.

Following many changes the kibbutzim went through during the years and following the appeal made to Israeli High Court of Justice by the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition in 2001 in which the state was required to redefine the exact definition of a kibbutz in order to define the rightful benefits the kibbutzim members should be granted by law. The reactivated legal definition was given to the Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel on the December 15, 2005 (תקנות סיווג הקיבוצים). According to this classification there are three types of kibbutzim:
# Kibbutz Shitufi (): a kibbutz still preserving a cooperative system.
# Kibbutz MitChadesh (): a community with a number of cooperative systems in its intentions (guaranteed minimal income within the community, partnership in the ownership of the production means, partnership in the ownership of the lands, etc.).
# Urban kibbutz (): a community existing within an existing settlement (city). Since the 1970s around 100 urban kibbutzim have been founded within existing Israeli cities. They have no enterprises of their own and all of their members work in the non-kibbutz sector. Examples include Tamuz in Beit Shemesh (near Jerusalem); Horesh in Kiryat Yovel, Jerusalem; Beit Yisrael in Gilo, Jerusalem and Migvan in Sderot.

A mixed moshav-kibbutz type of settlement can be called a moshbutz.

== Legal reforms after privatisation ==
Some kibbutzim have been involved in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz Glil Yam, near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatisation. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz Beit Oren applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of cooperative societies to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of cooperative society. The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining hall, and privatising the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.

This case resulted in the Government establishing the &quot;Ben-Rafael Committee&quot; chaired by Tel Aviv University professor Eliezer Ben-Rafael to recommend a new legal definitions that will suit the development of the kibbutz, and to submit an opinion on the allocation of apartments to kibbutz members. The committee submitted a detailed report with two new legal classifications to the settlements known today as kibbutzim. The first classification was named &#x27;communal kibbutz&#x27;, identical to the traditional definition of a kibbutz. The second classification was called the &#x27;renewing kibbutz&#x27; and included developments and changes in lifestyle, provided that the basic principles of mutual guarantee and equality are preserved. In light of the above, the committee recommended that instead of the current legal definition of kibbutz, two different determinations will be created, as follows.

* a) Communal kibbutz: a society for settlement, being a separate settlement, organised on the basis of collective ownership of possession, of self-employment, and of equality and cooperation in production, consumption and education.
* b) Renewing kibbutz: it should fulfill the same conditions quoted above for the &#x27;communal kibbutz&#x27;, with the additional condition that it maintains mutual guarantee among its members, and its articles of association includes some or all of the following:
** relative wages according to the individual contribution or to seniority allocation of apartments
** allocation of productive means to its members, excluding land, water
** productive quotas, provided that the cooperative society will maintain control over the productive means and that the articles of association restrict the negotiability of allocated productive means.

The recommendations were accepted by Cabinet of Israel in 2004.

== Kibbutzim outside of Israel ==
=== The &quot;Kibbutz Buchenwald&quot; ===
The &quot;Kibbutz Buchenwald&quot; is an experience of resilience, self-management and agricultural training, after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald in the spring of 1945. A group of sixteen young surviving men, initially, organized and formed the &quot;Kibbutz Buchenwald&quot;, the first agricultural collective of post-war Germany, in the barracks of the camp, then renamed &quot;Buchenwald displaced persons camp&quot; to prepare the Jews for emigration to Palestine. This place operated for several years and welcomed many members. After the creation of the State of Israel, they founded their own community there in 1948 which was also called initially &quot;Kibbutz Buchenwald&quot; then &quot;Netzer&quot;, then finally Netzer Sereni.

=== Kibbutzim in France ===
From 1933 to 1935, the village of Jugeals-Nazareth hosted , the only Jewish kibbutz in France. An agricultural building was rented by an emissary from Baron Robert de Rothschild to open a farm-school for young French Jews, before their departure for Palestine, conquered by the British in December 1917 with the arrival in Jerusalem in particular of General Edmund Allenby and which was then placed by decision of the League of Nations in 1920 as a mandatory territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Jewish refugees join Makhar, mostly Germans, but also Poles, Lithuanians, Russians, Hungarians, Dutch or Czechs and even Americans. About 500 to 800 kibbutznikim thus cultivated . The rise of anti-Semitism in France and the xenophobic actions of the sub-prefect , however, eventually forced the closure of Makhar. Most of the residents then left for Ayelet HaShahar.

From 1960 to 1963, a Jansenist Catholic kibbutz, inspired by the kibbutzim of Israel, was created by Vincent Thibout, a member of in Pardailhan. He then created a new Christian community, still based on the kibbutz model and self-determined as such, in Malrevers.

== Legacy ==

In his history of Palestine under the British Mandate, &quot;One Palestine, Complete&quot;, &quot;New Historian&quot; Tom Segev wrote of the kibbutz movement:
As against this characterization, numerous students found kibbutzim played a major role in agricultural innovation that advanced the Israeli agriculture to leading the world in some sectors, for instance irrigation. In later era many of their factories led Israeli efforts to gain economic independence by production for export, while their political involvement was of major importance up to 1948. The Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi menaced Ben-Gurion&#x27;s dominance of Yishuv politics in the 1940s, but they failed gaining wide public support in Israeli elections ever since 1949 because of reverence of Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship, which most Israelis denounced. Kibbutzim have been criticized for falling short of living up to their own ideals. Most kibbutzim are not self-sufficient and have to employ non-kibbutz members as farm workers (or later factory workers). What was particularly controversial was the employment of Arab labourers while excluding them from the possibility of joining the Kibbutz as full members.

Some kibbutzim have been criticized for &quot;abandoning&quot; socialist principles and turning to capitalist projects in order to make the kibbutz more self-sufficient economically. Kibbutz Shamir owns an optical products company that is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Numerous kibbutzim have moved away from farming and developed parts of their property for commercial and industrial purposes, building shopping malls and factories on kibbutz land that serve and employ non kibbutz members while the kibbutz retains a profit from land rentals or sales. Conversely, kibbutzim that have not engaged in this sort of development have also been criticized for becoming dependent on state subsidies to survive.

Nonetheless, kibbutzniks played a role in yishuv society and then Israeli society, far out of proportion to their population, and many kibbutzniks have served Israel in positions of leadership. The invention of the Tower and Stockade system by which 52 settlements from 1938 to 1947 largely decided the borders of Israel in the UN 29 November 1947 decision, is attributed to kibbutz member Shlomo Gur.

The establishment of the Palmach underground army in 1942, which won the yishuv crucial military struggle against Palestinian Arabs from 30 November 1947 up to 15 May 1948 that made possible the establishment of the Israeli state, was due to efforts by Tabenkin and other Kibbutz Meuchad leaders. One of them, Yigal Allon and Kibbutz Artzi member Shimon Avidan were the two most important commanders who won the 1948 war, and numerous kibbutz members were Cabinet Ministers who largely shaped Israeli politics from 1955 to 1977. Kibbutz-born Ehud Barak was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2001, and David Ben-Gurion lived most of his life in Tel Aviv, but joined Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev after resigning as Prime Minister in 1953. He remained a member after his return to office in 1955.

Kibbutzim also contributed greatly to the growing Hebrew culture movement. The poet Rachel rhapsodized on the landscape from viewpoints from various Galilee kibbutzim in the 1920s and 1930s. The kibbutz dream of &quot;making the desert bloom&quot; became part of the Israeli dream as well.

<doc id="106203" wikidata="Q3555058" url="?curid=106203" title="Special pleading">
<text>Special pleading is an informal fallacy wherein a person claims an exception to a general or universal principle, but the exception is unjustified. It applies a double standard.

In the classic distinction among material fallacies, cognitive fallacies, and formal fallacies, special pleading most likely falls within the category of cognitive fallacy, because it would seem to relate to &quot;&quot;, rationalization, and diversion (abandonment of discussion). Special pleading also often resembles the &quot;appeal to&quot; logical fallacies.

In medieval philosophy, it was not presumed that wherever a distinction is claimed, a relevant basis for the distinction should exist and be substantiated. Special pleading subverts a presumption of existential import.

== Examples ==
A difficult case is when a possible criticism is made relatively immune to investigation. This immunity may take the forms of:

* Creation of an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; exception to prevent the rule from backfiring against the claim:
**Example: &quot;Everyone has a duty to help the police do their job, no matter who the suspect is. That is why we must support investigations into corruption in the police department. No person is above the law. Of course, if the police come knocking on my door to ask about my neighbors and the robberies in our building, I know nothing. I’m not about to rat on anybody.&quot;
* &quot;You aren&#x27;t like me, so you do not even have a right to think about or hold opinions on my plight.&quot;
** Example: &quot;Keep your advice to yourself. If you didn&#x27;t grow up the way I did, then you can&#x27;t understand.&quot;

==Statistical==
This variation occurs when the interpretation of the relevant statistic is &quot;massaged&quot; by looking for ways to reclassify or requantify data from one portion of results, but not applying the same scrutiny to other categories.

<text>Byzas (Ancient Greek: Βύζας, &quot;Býzas&quot;) was the legendary founder of Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, &quot;Byzántion&quot;), the city later known as Constantinople and then Istanbul.

==Background==
The legendary history of the founding of Byzantium as recorded by later Byzantine authors is most fully preserved in the &quot;Patria of Constantinople&quot; by 6th century writer Hesychius of Miletus. The &quot;Patria&quot; recorded multiple versions of the city&#x27;s founding myth. Hesychius&#x27; preferred account says the city received its name from Io, daughter of the Argive king, who was raped by Inachus and then transformed into a cow. Zeus had fallen in love with Io, and in a jealous fit, Hera sent a gadfly to drive Io from one place to another in torment until she arrived in Thrace, giving birth to Ceroessa, the mother of Byzas by Poseidon, for whom the Golden Horn was named &quot;Ceras&quot;. One tradition holds that the city was founded by the Argives who received an oracle at Delphi with reference to the Golden Horn. Another claims Megarians (led by Byzas) are the founders, and yet another says Byzas is the son of a local nymph, Semystra.

==Founder of Byzantium==
During the 7th century BC, the Greek city-states were expanding and establishing new colonies. The Dorian city-state of Megara, near Athens, was also searching for sites to set up yet another colony. After asking the oracle of Delphi, the Megarean king Nisos sent his son Byzas in search of &quot;the land opposite the city of the blind&quot;.

When Byzas arrived to where the Sea of Marmara meets the Bosporus, on the border of Europe and Asia, he realized the meaning of the oracle. On the Asian shore, opposite to where he was, a colony, Chalcedon, had already been established. Byzas decided that Chalcedon was the prophesied &#x27;city of the blind&#x27;, as it had not taken advantage of the European shore.

To build his new city, he selected the European shore of the south end of Bosporos and gave the new city his name, Byzantion.
Later, Byzas married Fidalea, daughter of king Varvizos (or Varvisios) of Thrace. The inhabitants of ancient Byzantion considered Byzas as their founder and, according to ancient sources, honoured him by raising a statue of Byzas and his wife, Fidalea, in a noticeable place in the city.

The ancients had a very good understanding of the advantages that Byzantion had over Chalcedon, as the colony of Byzantion commanded the entrance to two seas, the entrance to both the Black Sea, through Sea of Bosporos, and the Aegean Sea, through the Sea of Marmaras (Propontis was its ancient name).

Apart from the story of the Pythian oracle of Apollonian Delphi, as described by the Greek geographer and historian Strabo (63 BC - 23 AD) and by the Roman historian Tacitus (1st century AD), there are other versions of the maxim referring to the &quot;blind people&quot;. The Greek historian Herodotos (5th century BC) wrote that when the Persian general Megabazus arrived at Byzantium, he called the people of Chalcedon blind because although they had a choice of sites, they chose the worse one.

<text>Atlantic City, sometimes referred to by its initials A.C., is a Jersey Shore seaside resort city in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

Atlantic City comprises the second half of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses those cities and all of Atlantic County for statistical purposes. Both Atlantic City and Hammonton, as well as the surrounding Atlantic County, are culturally tied to Philadelphia and constitute part of the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area or Delaware Valley, the nation&#x27;s seventh-largest metropolitan area as of 2020.

Located in South Jersey on Absecon Island and known for its taxis, casinos, nightlife, boardwalk, and Atlantic Ocean beaches and coastline, the city is prominently known as the &quot;Las Vegas of the East Coast&quot; and inspired the U.S. version of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, which uses various Atlantic City street names and destinations in the game. New Jersey voters legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City in 1976, and the first casino opened two years later. From 1921 to 2004, Atlantic City hosted the Miss America pageant, which later returned to the city from 2013 to 2018.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 38,497, a decline of 1,061 (−2.7%) from the 2010 census count of 39,558, which in turn reflected a decrease of 959 (−2.4%) from the 40,517 counted in the 2000 census.

The city was incorporated on May 1, 1854, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Galloway Township. It is located on Absecon Island and borders Absecon, Brigantine, Egg Harbor Township, Galloway Township, Pleasantville, Ventnor City, and the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==

Prior to Atlantic City&#x27;s founding, the region served as a summer home for the Lenape, a Native American tribe. While the precise date of European settlement in present-day Atlantic City is not precisely determined, it is commonly thought that it was in 1783, when Jeremiah Leeds built and occupied a year-round home there.

===19th century===
In 1850, present-day Atlantic City was developed into a resort town. Three years later, in early 1853, it was named Atlantic City.

Because of its location in South Jersey, which hugs the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was then viewed by developers as prime real estate and a potential resort town. In 1853, the city&#x27;s first commercial hotel, the Belloe House, was built at the intersection of Massachusetts and Atlantic Avenues.

The following year, in 1854, the city was incorporated. The same year, train service began on the Camden and Atlantic Railroad. Built on the edge of the bay, this served as the direct link of this remote parcel of land with Philadelphia, the second-most populous city in the United States at the time and the largest city in Pennsylvania. The same year, construction of the Absecon Lighthouse, designed by George Meade of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, was approved, with work initiated the next year.

By 1874, almost 500,000 passengers a year were coming to Atlantic City by rail. In &quot;Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;Atlantic City&#x27;s Godfather&quot; Jonathan Pitney, known as the &quot;Father of Atlantic City&quot;, initially sought to develop Atlantic City as a health resort. Pitney persuaded municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach in Atlantic City would be beneficial. His successful business relationship with Samuel Richards, an entrepreneur and member of what was then the most influential family in South Jersey, was designed to construct the railroad with the first 600 riders, who &quot;were chosen carefully by Samuel Richards and Jonathan Pitney&quot;:

After arriving in Atlantic City, a second train brought the visitors to the door of the resort&#x27;s first public lodging, the United States Hotel. The hotel was owned by the railroad. It was a sprawling, four-story structure built to house 2,000 guests. It opened while it was still under construction, with only one wing standing, and even that wasn&#x27;t completed. By year&#x27;s end, when it was fully constructed, the United States Hotel was not only the first hotel in Atlantic City but also the largest in the nation. Its rooms totaled more than 600, and its grounds covered some 14 acres.

The first boardwalk was built in 1870 along a portion of the beach in an effort to help hotel owners keep sand out of their lobbies. Businesses were restricted and the boardwalk was removed each year at the end of the peak season. Because of its effectiveness and popularity, the boardwalk was expanded in length and width, and modified several times in subsequent years.

Prior to the destructive 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane, the historic length of the boardwalk was about and it extended from Atlantic City to Longport, through Ventnor and Margate.

The first road connecting the city to the mainland at Pleasantville was completed in 1870 and charged a 30-cent toll. Albany Avenue was the first road to the mainland available without a toll.

By 1878, because of the growing popularity of the city, one railroad line could no longer keep up with demand. Soon, the Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railway was also constructed to transport tourists to Atlantic City. At this point massive hotels like the United States Hotel and Surf House, as well as smaller rooming houses, had sprung up all over town. The United States Hotel took up a full city block between Atlantic, Pacific, Delaware, and Maryland Avenues. These hotels were not only impressive in size, but featured the most up-to-date amenities, and were considered quite luxurious for their time.

In 1883, salt water taffy was conceived in Atlantic City by David Bradley. The traditional story is that Bradley&#x27;s shop close to the beach was flooded with ocean water after a storm, soaking his taffy. He sold the &quot;salt water taffy&quot; to a girl, who walked down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley&#x27;s mother was in the back of the store when the sale was made, and loved the name, giving the candy its name.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, Atlantic City experienced a radical building boom. Many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels. Two of the city&#x27;s most distinctive hotels were the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and the Traymore Hotel.

In 1902, Josiah White III bought a parcel of land near Ohio Avenue and the boardwalk, where he started construction and built the Queen Anne style Marlborough House. The hotel was a success. In 1905, he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land adjacent to his Marlborough House. In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm made use of reinforced concrete, a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848, and Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867. The hotel&#x27;s Spanish and Moorish themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence. White named the new hotel the Blenheim and merged the two hotels into the Marlborough-Blenheim. Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City was later constructed at this location.

The Traymore Hotel was located at the corner of Illinois Avenue and the boardwalk. Constructed in 1879 as a small boarding house, the hotel grew through a series of uncoordinated expansions. By 1914, the hotel&#x27;s owner, Daniel White, Josiah White&#x27;s half-brother, taking a hint from the Marlborough-Blenheim, commissioned the firm of Price and McLanahan to build an even bigger hotel. Rising 16 stories, the tan brick and gold-capped hotel would become one of the city&#x27;s best-known landmarks. The hotel made use of ocean-facing hotel rooms by jutting its wings farther from the main portion of the hotel along Pacific Avenue.

One by one, additional large hotels were constructed along the boardwalk, including the Brighton, Chelsea, Shelburne, Ambassador, Ritz Carlton, Mayflower, Madison House, and the Breakers. The Quaker-owned Chalfonte House, opened in 1868, and Haddon House, opened in 1869, flanked North Carolina Avenue at the beach end. Over the years, their original wood-frame structures would be enlarged, and even moved closer to the beach. The modern Chalfonte Hotel, eight stories tall, opened in 1904. The modern Haddon Hall was built in stages and was completed in 1929, at eleven stories. By this time, they were under the same ownership and merged into the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel, becoming the city&#x27;s largest hotel with nearly 1,000 rooms. By 1930, the Claridge, the city&#x27;s last large hotel before the casinos, opened its doors.

The 400-room Claridge was built by a partnership that included renowned Philadelphia contractor John McShain. At 24 stories, it would become known as the &quot;Skyscraper by the Sea&quot;.

With tourism peaking in the 1920s, the period is often considered by historians to be Atlantic City&#x27;s golden age. During Prohibition, which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933, much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. During Prohibition, racketeer and political boss Enoch L. &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City. Because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the implicit approval of local officials, it was easily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, and the resort&#x27;s popularity grew further. The city then dubbed itself as &quot;The World&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Nucky Johnson&#x27;s income, which reached as much as $500,000 annually, came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks on construction projects.

During this time, Atlantic City was led by mayor Edward L. Bader, known for his contributions to the construction, athletics and aviation of Atlantic City. Despite opposition, he had Atlantic City purchase the land that became the city&#x27;s municipal airport and high school football stadium, both of which were later named Bader Field in his honor. He led the initiative, in 1923, to construct the Atlantic City High School at Albany and Atlantic Avenues. Bader, in November 1923, initiated a public referendum, during the general election, at which time residents approved the construction of a Convention Center. The city passed an ordinance approving a bond issue for $1.5 million to be used for the purchase of land for Convention Hall, now known as the Boardwalk Hall, finalized on September 30, 1924. Bader was also a driving force behind the creation of the Miss America competition.

In May 1929, Johnson hosted a conference for organized crime figures from all across America that created a National Crime Syndicate. The men who called this meeting were Masseria family lieutenant Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano and former Chicago South Side Gang boss Johnny &quot;the Fox&quot; Torrio, with heads of the Bugs and Meyer Mob, Meyer Lansky and Benjamin Siegel, being used as muscle for the meeting.

Gangster and businessman Al Capone attended the conference and was photographed walking along the Atlantic City boardwalk with Johnson.

The 1930s through the 1960s were a heyday for nightclub entertainment. Popular venues on the white-populated south side included the 500 Club, the Clicquot Club, and the Jockey Club. In the Northside neighborhood, home to African Americans in the racially segregated city, a black entertainment district reigned on Kentucky Avenue.

Four major nightclubs, Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, Grace&#x27;s Little Belmont, and Wonder Gardens, drew both black and white patrons. During the summer tourist season, jazz and R&amp;B music could be heard into the wee hours of the morning. Soul food restaurants and ribs joints also lined Kentucky Avenue, including Wash&#x27;s Restaurant, Jerry&#x27;s and Sap&#x27;s.

Like many older East Coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic decline in the mid-to-late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the &quot;Inlet&quot; became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort&#x27;s decline were multi-layered. First, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. The advent of suburbia also played a significant role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. Finally, the rise of relatively cheap jet airline service allowed visitors to travel to year-round resort places such as Miami Beach and the Bahamas.

The city hosted the 1964 Democratic National Convention which nominated Lyndon Johnson for president and Hubert Humphrey as vice president. The convention and the press coverage it generated, however, cast a harsh light on Atlantic City, which by then was in the midst of a long period of economic decline. Many felt that the friendship between Johnson and Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes led Atlantic City to host the Democratic Convention.

By the late 1960s, many of the resort&#x27;s once great hotels were suffering from high vacancy rates. Most of them were either shut down, converted to cheap apartments, or converted to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade. Prior to and during the advent of legalized gambling, many of these hotels were demolished. The Breakers, The Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, the Traymore and the Marlborough-Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, only the Claridge, the Dennis, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City, a condo complex, and Resorts Atlantic City. The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 and was gutted to become the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, only reusing the steelwork of the original building. Smaller hotels off the boardwalk, such as the Madison also survived.

====Legalized gambling====

In an effort at revitalizing the city, New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum, approving casino gambling for Atlantic City; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass. Immediately after the legislation passed, the owners of the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel began converting it into the Resorts International. It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26, 1978.

Other casinos were soon constructed along the Boardwalk and, later, in the marina district for a total of nine today. The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems, as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods.

While Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas as a gambling city in the United States, Donald Trump helped bring big name boxing bouts to the city to attract customers to his casinos. Mike Tyson fought most of his fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s, which helped Atlantic City achieve national attention as a gambling resort and vacation destination.

Several highrise condominiums were built for use as permanent residences or second homes. By end of the decade, it was one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States.

===21st century===
====Legalized sports betting====

On June 27, 2017, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear &quot;Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association&quot; and heard oral arguments in December 2017. Then, on May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional. The act was overturned, allowing New Jersey to move ahead with plans to implement legalized sports betting.

Despite being the state to initiate the landmark ruling, New Jersey was actually the third state to legalize sports betting after Nevada and Delaware. In June 2018, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy signed the legislation into law, and several New Jersey–based casino brands subsequently opened sportsbooks, especially in Atlantic City.

With the redevelopment of the Las Vegas Strip and the opening of Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut in the early 1990s, along with newly built casinos in the nearby Philadelphia metro area in the 2000s, Atlantic City&#x27;s tourism began to decline due to its failure to diversify away from gambling. In 1999 the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partnered with Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn to develop a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the Marina. Nicknamed &quot;The Tunnel Project&quot;, Steve Wynn planned the proposed &#x27;Mirage Atlantic City&#x27; around the idea that he would connect the $330 million tunnel stretching from the Atlantic City Expressway to his new resort. The roadway was later officially named the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, and funnels incoming traffic off of the expressway into the city&#x27;s marina district and the city of Brigantine.

Although Wynn&#x27;s plans for development in the city were scrapped in 2002, the tunnel opened in 2001. The new roadway prompted Boyd Gaming in partnership with MGM/Mirage to build Atlantic City&#x27;s newest casino. Borgata opened in July 2003, and its success brought an influx of developers to Atlantic City with plans for building grand, Las Vegas-style mega casinos to revitalize the aging city.

Owing to economic conditions and the late 2000s recession, many of the proposed mega casinos never advanced further than the initial planning stage. One of these developers was Pinnacle Entertainment, which purchased the Sands Atlantic City for $250–$270 million and closed it on November 11, 2006 with plans to replace it with a larger casino. The following year, the resort was demolished in an implosion, the first of its kind in Atlantic City. While Pinnacle Entertainment intended to replace it with a $1.5-$2-billion casino resort, the company canceled its construction plans and sold the land for $29.5 million. MGM Resorts International announced in October 2007 that it would pull out of all development for Atlantic City, effectively ending its plans for the MGM Grand Atlantic City.

In 2006, Morgan Stanley purchased directly north of the Showboat Atlantic City for a new $2-billion-plus casino resort. Revel Entertainment Group was named as the project&#x27;s developer for the Revel Casino. Revel was hindered with many problems, the biggest setback occurring in April 2010 when Morgan Stanley, the owner of 90% of Revel Entertainment Group, decided to discontinue funding for continued construction and put its stake in Revel up for sale. Early in 2010, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill offering tax incentives to attract new investors and complete the job, but a poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind released in March 2010 showed that 60% of voters opposed the legislation, and two of three of those who opposed it &quot;strongly&quot; opposed it. Ultimately, Governor Chris Christie offered Revel $261 million in state tax credits to assist the casino once it opened.

Revel completed all of the exterior work and had continued work on the interior after finally receiving the funding necessary to complete construction, and had a soft opening in April 2012 before being fully open the next month. Ten months later, in February 2013, after serious losses and a write-down in the value of the resort from $2.4 billion to $450 million, Revel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It was restructured but still could not carry on and re-entered bankruptcy on June 19, 2014. It was put up for sale, however as no suitable bids were received the resort closed its doors in September 2014. The property was bought by AC Ocean Walk, LLC for $200 million in 2017, and reopened in 2018 as Ocean Casino Resort.

In the wake of the closures and declining revenue from casinos, Governor Christie said in September 2014 that the state would consider a 2015 referendum to end the 40-year-old monopoly that Atlantic City holds on casino gambling and allowing gambling in other municipalities. With casino revenue declining from $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.9 billion in 2013, the state saw a drop in money from its 8% tax on those earnings, which is used to fund programs for senior citizens and the disabled.

On October 29, 2012, &quot;Superstorm Sandy&quot; struck Atlantic City and caused flooding and power-outages but left minimal damage to any of the tourist areas. The storm produced an all-time record low barometric pressure reading of 943 mb (27.85&quot;) for not only Atlantic City, but the state of New Jersey.

In 2019, the Atlantic City area had the highest rates of foreclosures in the nation. This has disproportionately affected Black residents in neighborhoods segregated by redlining, a legacy that is mirrored by the values of properties on the Monopoly game board.

After several casino closures and the COVID-19 pandemic, strikes and pickets were being threatened in June 2022 by casino employees which were short-staffed and wanted pay raises.

=== Food desert ===
Atlantic City is widely known as a food desert, with the nearest fully-functioning supermarket being located in neighboring Ventnor City, which is away from the majority of Atlantic City&#x27;s population. As a result, proposals for a supermarket were floated beginning in May 2021, and Atlantic City&#x27;s City Council gave permission to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to look for a contender to build a supermarket.

As of December 2023, there was only one functioning supermarket in Atlantic City, the Save-A-Lot food store located in Renaissance Plaza, an area of the city known for its significant homeless population and drug use. The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority has proposed a new supermarket that would be located on an empty parking lot behind the Tanger Outlets and near the Atlantic City Expressway.

Groundbreaking for a ShopRite supermarket had taken place in October 2021, after Village Super Market received $18.7 million from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to construct the store. The supermarket was expected to be completed by December 2022, although no construction or building had happened on the site, which drew attention from residents. After the time for the contract expired, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) announced that the deal with Village Super Market (VSM) was dead and that they were looking for new contenders. VSM created a new plan for CRDA and the city&#x27;s Council to review and by July 2023, it and a Chinese conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong emerged as the two candidates to build the supermarket. However, as of November 2023, no further progress had been made on the construction plans and the two proposals were still &quot;being reviewed.&quot;

===Tourism district===

In July 2010, Governor Chris Christie announced that a state takeover of the city and local government &quot;was imminent&quot;. Comparing regulations in Atlantic City to an &quot;antique car&quot;, Atlantic City regulatory reform was a key piece of Governor Chris Christie&#x27;s plan to reinvigorate an industry mired in a four-year slump in revenue and hammered by fresh competition from casinos in the surrounding states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and more recently, Maryland. In January 2011, Chris Christie announced the creation of the Atlantic City Tourism District, a state-run district encompassing the boardwalk casinos, the marina casinos, the Atlantic City Outlets, and Bader Field. Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind poll surveyed New Jersey voters&#x27; attitudes on the takeover. A February 2011 survey showed that 43% opposed the measure while 29% favored direct state oversight. The poll also found that even South Jersey voters expressed opposition to the plan; 40% reported they opposed the measure and 37% reported they were in favor of it.

On April 29, 2011, the boundaries for the state-run tourism district were set. The district would include heavier police presence, as well as beautification projects and infrastructure improvements. The CRDA would oversee all functions of the district and make changes to attract new businesses and attractions. New construction has already resulted in cases of eminent domain being used to seize properties for development.

The tourism district would comprise several key areas in the city: the Marina District, Ducktown, Chelsea, South Inlet, Bader Field, and Gardner&#x27;s Basin. Also included are 10 roadways that lead into the district, including several in the city&#x27;s northern end, or North Beach. Gardner&#x27;s Basin, which is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium, was initially left out of the tourism district, while a residential neighborhood in the Chelsea section was removed from the final boundaries, owing to complaints from the city. Also, the inclusion of Bader Field in the district was controversial and received much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford, who cast the lone &quot;no&quot; vote on the creation of the district citing its inclusion.

===Casinos and gambling===
The history of gambling in Atlantic City traces back to Prohibition and the 1920s, with racketeer Louis Kuehnle running an underground hotel and casino. Enoch &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson followed and furthered Atlantic City&#x27;s rise through the Roaring Twenties as a destination for drinking, gambling, and nightlife. In 1974, New Jersey voters voted 60%–40% against legalizing casino gambling at four sites statewide, but two years later approved by 56%–44% a new referendum which legalized casinos, but restricted them to Atlantic City. Resorts Atlantic City was the first casino to open, in May 1978, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony featuring Governor of New Jersey Brendan Byrne. Atlantic City is considered the &quot;Gambling Capital of the East Coast&quot;, and currently has nine large casinos. In 2011, New Jersey&#x27;s then 12 casinos employed approximately 33,000 employees, had 28.5 million visitors, made $3.3 billion in gaming revenue, and paid $278 million in taxes. They are regulated by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement.

In the wake of the economic downturn following the Great Recession and the legalization of gambling in adjacent and nearby states (including Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania), four casino closures took place in 2014: the Atlantic Club on January 13; the Showboat on August 31; the Revel, which was Atlantic City&#x27;s second-newest casino, on September 2; and Trump Plaza, which originally opened in 1984, and was the poorest performing casino in the city, on September 16.

Executives at Trump Entertainment Resorts, whose sole remaining property at the time was the Trump Taj Mahal, said in 2013 that they were considering the option of selling the Taj and winding down and exiting the gaming and hotel business. Trump Taj Mahal closed October 10, 2016, after failing to come to terms with union workers.

Caesars Entertainment executives have been reconsidering the future of their three remaining Atlantic City properties (Bally&#x27;s, Caesars and Harrah&#x27;s), in the wake of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the company&#x27;s casino operating unit in January 2015. In 2020, Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City was acquired by Bally&#x27;s Corporation. Gross gaming revenue of the city&#x27;s nine operating casinos in 2022 totaled $2.79 billion, a 9% increase from the $2.55 billion earned the previous year.

====Current casinos====
:a The Wild Wild West Casino, which opened on July 2, 1997, and has an American Old West theme, was part of Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City until 2020, when it became part of Caesars.

===Boardwalk===

The Atlantic City Boardwalk opened on June 26, 1870, a temporary structure erected for the summer season that was the first boardwalk in the world. At long, the Atlantic City Boardwalk is also the world&#x27;s longest and busiest boardwalk.

The Boardwalk starts at Absecon Inlet in the north and runs along the beach south-west to the city limit away then continues into Ventnor City. Casino/hotels front the boardwalk, as well as retail stores, restaurants, and amusements. Notable attractions include the Boardwalk Hall, House of Blues, and the Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! museum.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed the northern part of the boardwalk fronting Absecon Inlet, in the residential section called South Inlet. The oceanfront boardwalk in front of the Atlantic City casinos survived the storm with minimal damage.

The first pier along the boardwalk, Applegate&#x27;s Pier, opened in 1884. It was acquired by John L. Young in 1891, who expanded and operated it as Young&#x27;s Ocean Pier, but it was mostly destroyed in a 1912 fire. The remaining part of the pier was rebuilt in 1922 as the Central Pier, which is still in operation.

A Heinz-owned pier named Heinz Pier was destroyed in the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane.

The most famous Atlantic City pier was Steel Pier, which opened in 1898, and which once billed itself as &quot;The Showplace of the Nation&quot;. It closed in 1978, and was mostly destroyed in a 1982 fire. It was rebuilt in the late 1980s and is now operated as an amusement pier across from the Hard Rock.

Steeplechase Pier opened in 1899 and operated until 1986. It suffered significant damage in a 1988 fire, and the remnants of the pier were removed in 1996. The &quot;Steeplechase Pier Heliport&quot; on Steel Pier is named in its honor.

Captain John L. Young opened &quot;Young&#x27;s Million Dollar Pier&quot; in 1906, and on the seaward side &quot;erected a marble mansion&quot;, fronted by a formal garden, with lighting and landscaping designed by Young&#x27;s longtime friend Thomas Alva Edison. Million Dollar Pier once rivaled Steel Pier as Atlantic City&#x27;s leading pier, but after suffering decades of decline, was rebuilt into a shopping mall in the 1980s, known as &quot;Shops on Ocean One&quot;. In 2006, the Ocean One mall was bought, renovated and re-branded as &quot;The Pier Shops at Caesars&quot; and in 2015, it was renamed &quot;Playground Pier&quot;. In September 2023, it was renamed &quot;ACX1 Studios&quot; for the film and entertainment production studios that took over the building, with a planned grand reopening containing a mixture of retail, restaurants, creative space, and production studios in summer of 2024.

Garden Pier, located opposite Ocean Casino Resort, once housed a movie theater, and is now home to the Atlantic City Historical Museum.

===Shopping===

Atlantic City has many different shopping districts and malls, many of which are located inside or adjacent to the casino resorts. Several smaller themed retail and dining areas in casino hotels include the Borgata Shops and The Shoppes at Water Club inside Borgata, the Waterfront Shops inside of Harrah&#x27;s, Spice Road inside the Trump Taj Mahal, while Resorts Casino Hotel has a small collection of stores and restaurants. Major shopping malls are also located in and around Atlantic City.

Atlantic City shops include:
* Playground Pier, an underwater-themed indoor high end shopping center located on the Million Dollar Pier formerly known as &quot;Shops on Ocean One&quot;. The four-story shopping mall contains themed floors.
* Tanger Outlets The Walk, an outdoor outlet shopping center spanning several blocks. The only outlet mall in Atlantic County, The Walk opened in 2003 and is undergoing an expansion.
* The Quarter at Tropicana, an old Havana-themed indoor shopping center at the Tropicana, which contains over 40 stores, restaurants, and nightclubs.

===Exhibition===

Boardwalk Hall, formally known as the &quot;Historic Atlantic City Convention Hall&quot;, is an arena in Atlantic City along the boardwalk. Boardwalk Hall was Atlantic City&#x27;s primary convention center until the opening of the Atlantic City Convention Center in 1997. The Atlantic City Convention Center includes of showroom space, 5 exhibit halls, 45 meeting rooms with of space, a garage with 1,400 parking spaces, and an adjacent Sheraton hotel. Both the Boardwalk Hall and Convention Center are operated by the Atlantic City Convention &amp; Visitors Authority.

==Arts and culture==
===&quot;Monopoly&quot;===
Atlantic City (sometimes referred to as &quot;Monopoly City&quot;) has become well-known over the years for its portrayal in the U.S. version of the popular board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, in which properties on the board are named after locations in and near Atlantic City. While the original incarnation of the game did not feature Atlantic City, it was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins learned the game, and took it back to Atlantic City. After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names, and taught it to a group of friends, who ultimately passed in on to Charles Darrow, who made some modifications to the game and claimed it as his own invention. The relative prices of the places on the board reflect to some extent the social status of neighborhoods at the time, with wealthy white streets being worth more, and streets where Black and Asian residents lived being cheaper.

Marvin Gardens, the leading yellow property on the board, is actually a misspelling of the original location name, &quot;Marven Gardens&quot;. The misspelling was said to have been introduced by Charles Todd and passed on when his home-made &quot;Monopoly&quot; board was copied by Charles Darrow and thence Parker Brothers. It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of Marven Gardens for the misspelling, although the spelling error was not corrected.

Some of the actual locations that correspond to board elements have changed since the game&#x27;s release. Illinois Avenue was renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in the 1980s. St. Charles Place no longer exists, as the Showboat Casino Hotel was developed where it once ran.

The &quot;Short Line&quot; is believed to refer to the Shore Fast Line, a streetcar line that served Atlantic City, or a bus route. The B&amp;O Railroad did not serve Atlantic City.

===Attractions===
Ever since Atlantic City&#x27;s growth as a resort town, numerous attractions and tourist traps have originated in the city. A popular fixture in the early 20th century at the Steel Pier was horse diving, which was introduced by William &quot;Doc&quot; Carver. The Steel Pier featured several other novelty attractions, including the Diving Bell, human high-divers and a water circus. Advertisements for the Steel Pier in its heyday featured plaster sculptures set upon wooden bases along roads leading up to Atlantic City. By the end of World War II, many animal demonstrations declined in popularity after criticisms of animal abuse and neglect.
Rolling chairs, which were introduced in 1876 and in continuous use since 1887, have been a boardwalk fixture to this day. While powered carts appeared in the 1960s, the original and most common were made of wicker. The wicker canopied chairs-on-wheels are manually pushed the length of the boardwalk by attendants, much like a rickshaw. A tram service was introduced in 2015, initially using the warning announcements that had been used on Wildwood&#x27;s tram cars until it was changed after complaints from Wildwood.

The Absecon Lighthouse is a coastal lighthouse located in the South Inlet section of Atlantic City overlooking Absecon Inlet. It is the tallest lighthouse in the state of New Jersey and is the third tallest masonry lighthouse in the United States. Construction began in 1854, with the light first lit on January 15, 1857. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1933 and although the light still shines every night, it is no longer an active navigational aid. Gardner&#x27;s Basin, which is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium as well as small shops and restaurants, is located a short distance north of Absecon Light.
While located south of Atlantic City in Margate City, Lucy the Elephant has become almost an icon for the Atlantic City area. Lucy is a six-story elephant-shaped example of novelty architecture, constructed of wood and tin sheeting in 1882 by James V. Lafferty in an effort to sell real estate and attract tourism. Over the years, Lucy had served as a restaurant, business office, cottage, and tavern (the last closed by Prohibition). Lucy had fallen into disrepair by the 1960s and was scheduled for demolition. The structure was moved and refurbished as a result of a &quot;Save Lucy&quot; campaign in 1970 and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and is open as a museum.

===Miss America pageant===
Atlantic City was the home of the Miss America competition, hosting the event from its inception until 2004, and again from 2013 to 2018. The Miss America competition originated on September 7, 1921, as a two-day beauty contest, and it included state contestants as well as women from various cities around the country. The event that year was called the &quot;Atlantic City Pageant&quot;, and the winner of the grand prize, Margaret Gorman, took home the 3-foot Golden Mermaid trophy. Gorman was not called &quot;Miss America&quot; until 1922, when she re-entered the pageant and lost to Mary Campbell. The pageant was initiated to extend the tourist season after the Labor Day weekend. The pageant has been nationally televised since 1954. It peaked in the early 1960s, when it was repeatedly the highest-rated program on American television. It was seen as a symbol of the United States, with Miss America often being referred to as the female equivalent of the President. The pageant&#x27;s longtime emcee, Bert Parks, hosted the event from 1955 to 1979. At the Atlantic City Convention Center, there is a interactive statue of Parks holding a crown. When a visitor puts their head inside the crown, sensors activate a recorded playback of his &quot;There She Is...&quot; line through speakers hidden behind nearby bushes.

===&quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;===

The television show &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, an American series from cable network HBO set in Atlantic City during the Prohibition era, raised interest in the Roaring Twenties-era city. Starring Steve Buscemi, the show was adapted from a chapter about historical criminal kingpin Enoch &quot;Nucky&quot; Johnson (who is renamed &quot;Enoch Thompson&quot; in the show) in Nelson Johnson&#x27;s book, &quot;Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City&quot;.

==Government==

=== Local government ===

Atlantic City is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government (Plan D), implemented by direct petition effective as of July 1, 1982. The city is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The governing body of Atlantic City comprises the Mayor and the City Council, all elected on a partisan basis to serve four-year terms of office as part of the November general election. The council includes nine members, who are elected on a staggered basis, with one member from each of six wards and three serving at-large. The six ward seats are up for election together and the mayoral seat and the council at-large seats are up for vote together two years later. The City Council exercises the legislative power of the municipality for the purpose of holding Council meetings to introduce ordinances and resolutions to regulate City government. In addition, Council members review budgets submitted by the Mayor; provide for an annual audit of the city&#x27;s accounts and financial transactions; organize standing committees and hold public hearings to address important issues which impact Atlantic City. Former Mayor Bob Levy created the Atlantic City Ethics Board in 2007, but the Board was dissolved two years later by vote of the Atlantic City Council.

, the Mayor is Democrat Marty Small Sr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2025. Small succeeded Frank M. Gilliam Jr. following his resignation on October 3, 2019. Small initially served as mayor on an interim basis for an unexpired term ending on December 31, 2021. Members of the City Council are Council President Council President Aaron &quot;Sporty&quot; Randolph (D, 2027; 1st Ward), Council Vice President Kaleem Shabazz (D, 2027; 3rd Ward), George &quot;Animal&quot; Crouch (D, 2027; 4th Ward), LaToya Dunston (D, 2027; Second Ward – elected to serve an unexpired term), Jesse O. Kurtz (R, 2027; 6th Ward), Stephanie Marshall (D, 2025; At-Large), George Tibbitt (D, 2025; At-Large), Bruce Weekes (D, 2025; At-Large) and Maria Lacca (R, 2027; 5th Ward).

In 2024, Democrat Muhammed &quot;Anjum&quot; Zia, who served as a councilman for the 5th ward, was removed from office after it was found the he did not reside in Atlantic City, but instead with his family in Egg Harbor Township. He was ousted from the city council, and in a court-ordered special election that November, Republican Maria Lacca, who brought about the investigation against Zia, flipped the seat, becoming the first Republican to win it since 1988. She became one out of two Republicans now currently on Atlantic City&#x27;s council, with the other being councilman Jesse O. Kurtz of the 6th ward.

In May 2020, voters rejected by a 3–1 margin a referendum that would have changed the city to a council-manager form of government which would have reduced the size of the city council and shifted responsibility for day-to-day operation from an elected mayor to an appointed city manager.

In December 2019, LaToya Dunston was selected from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to serve the remainder of the term of the Second Ward seat that had been held by Marty Small until he stepped down when he was appointed as mayor. In January 2020, Dunston was appointed to fill the Second Ward seat expiring in December 2023 that Small had won in November 2019 but declined to fill; Dunston will serve on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

====Mayoral disappearance and resignation====
Following questions about false claims he had made about his military record, Mayor Bob Levy left City Hall in September 2007 in a city-owned vehicle for an unknown destination. After a 13-day absence, his lawyer revealed that Levy was in Carrier Clinic, a rehabilitation hospital. Levy resigned in October 2007 and then-Council President William Marsh assumed the office of Mayor and served six weeks until an interim mayor was named.

<text>The Parliaments were an American vocal quintet from Plainfield, New Jersey, United States. Originally formed in the back room of a barbershop in 1956, the quintet was named after the cigarette brand. The Parliaments initially performed doo-wop music; after some early personnel changes their lineup solidified with George Clinton, Ray Davis, Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas. Clinton was group leader and manager, and part owner of the barbershop where the group convened to entertain customers. The group later changed its style, evolving into the bands Parliament and Funkadelic, which found success in the 1970s.

==History==
The group was originally based on Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, but by the 1960s had developed a unique sound based on emerging styles of soul and funk music, with a notable penchant for bizarre lyrics. The group struggled for hits during most of the 1960s, recording singles on a variety of small record labels. They switched labels many times, and released several double-sided singles without success, including &quot;Poor Willie&quot; (on Apt), &quot;Lonely Island&quot; (on Flipp) and &quot;Heart Trouble&quot; (on Golden World). Eventually, Clinton gained employment at Motown Records as a songwriter and producer, making weekly trips to Detroit to produce for The Pets, Roy Handy, and other acts. In 1967 the Parliaments released &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot; on Revilot and finally achieved a hit single, with the song reaching No. 3 R&amp;B and No. 20 Pop on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In reality, Clinton was the only member of the Parliaments to appear in the song, as the other members were unable to travel to Detroit for the recording session (session singers and musicians rounded out the recording). To capitalize on the single&#x27;s success, Clinton put together a backing band for a tour, expanding the Parliaments to the five singers plus five backing musicians.

After the success of &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot;, Clinton became embroiled in a contractual dispute surrounding the bankruptcy of Revilot Records and temporarily lost the rights to the name &quot;The Parliaments.&quot; In order to continue recording for other labels, Clinton renamed the entire ensemble Funkadelic (a name coined by bassist Billy Bass Nelson). Clinton positioned Funkadelic as a funk-rock band featuring the five backing musicians with the five Parliaments singers as uncredited guests. When Revilot declared bankruptcy the Parliaments were sold to Atlantic Records, and Clinton abandoned doo-wop to avoid working for Atlantic. Even with Funkadelic operating as a recording and touring entity, in 1970 Clinton relaunched the Parliaments as a new R&amp;B-based funk band, now known as Parliament. The lineup still consisted of the five original singers plus the five backing musicians, with the two acts signed to different labels and marketed as performing different types of funk.

Several songs from the early repertoire of the Parliaments would be re-recorded on future Parliament and Funkadelic albums, including &quot;Testify,&quot; &quot;The Goose,&quot; &quot;All Your Goodies Are Gone,&quot; &quot;Fantasy Is Reality,&quot; &quot;Good Ole Music,&quot; &quot;I Can Feel The Ice Melting,&quot; &quot;What You Been Growing,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Wait,&quot; and &quot;That Was My Girl.&quot; In 1995, many of the original Parliaments tracks were reissued on the Goldmine/Soul label on the album &quot;Testifyin&quot;&#x27;.

==The Silk Palace==
The West End of Plainfield, New Jersey was once home to the Silk Palace, a barbershop at 216 Plainfield Avenue owned in part by Clinton, staffed by various members of Parliament-Funkadelic and known as the &quot;hangout for all the local singers and musicians&quot; in Plainfield&#x27;s 1950s and 1960s doo-wop, soul, rock and proto-funk music scene.

<doc id="106214" wikidata="Q3109048" url="?curid=106214" title="Molten globule">
<text>In molecular biology, the term molten globule (MG) refers to protein states that are more or less compact (hence the &quot;globule&quot;), but are lacking the specific tight packing of amino acid residues which creates the solid state-like tertiary structure of completely folded proteins (hence the &quot;molten&quot;). 

Protein folding is navigated by a dynamic interplay of secondary and tertiary interactions. Two extreme folding pathway models have been formulated. In the first - the framework model - rapidly formed secondary structure elements assemble into a native tertiary structure. In the second - the hydrophobic collapse model - the formation of a loosely packed tertiary structure precedes secondary structure acquisition. A nucleation-condensation mechanism involving concomitant formation of short and long-range interactions combines features of both extreme models and thereby represents a unifying mechanism of protein folding.

During folding, proteins span a continuum of conformers starting from the denature and ending at the native state. Although often considered a statistical random coil, the denatured state can retain residual structure that mediates (re)folding. For instance, staphylococcal nuclease retains native-like topology in 8M urea, while nonnative lysozyme contains hydrophobic clusters held together by long-range interactions. By rapidly adjusting experimental conditions to favor native structure formation, relatively compact protein folding intermediates have been observed. These kinetic intermediates - coined molten globules - exhibit native-like secondary structure and fluctuating tertiary structure. 

The molten globule state can also be thermodynamically accessed under mildly denaturing conditions. It was found, for example, in cytochrome c, which conserves a native-like secondary structure content but without the tightly packed protein interior, under low pH and high salt concentration. For cytochrome c and some other proteins, it has been shown that the molten globule state is a &quot;thermodynamic state&quot; clearly different both from the native and the denatured state, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a third equilibrium (i.e., intermediate) state.

The term &quot;molten globule&quot; may be used to describe various types of partially-folded protein states found in slightly denaturing conditions such as low pH (generally pH = 2), mild denaturant, or high temperature. Molten globules are collapsed and generally have some native-like secondary structure but a dynamic tertiary structure as seen by far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, respectively. These traits are similar to those observed in the transient intermediate states found during the folding of certain proteins, especially globular proteins that undergo hydrophobic collapse, and therefore the term &quot;molten globule&quot; is also used to refer to certain protein folding intermediates corresponding to the narrowing region of the folding funnel higher in energy than the native state but lower than the denatured state. The molten globule ensembles sampled during protein folding and unfolding are thought to be roughly similar.

The MG structure is believed to lack the close packing of amino acid side chains that characterize the native state (&lt;chem&gt;N&lt;/chem&gt;) of a protein. The transition from a denatured (&lt;chem&gt;U&lt;/chem&gt;) state to a molten globule may be a two state process

: &lt;chem&gt;U &lt;-&gt; MG&lt;/chem&gt;

Or it may be a continuous transition, with no cooperativity and no apparent &quot;switch&quot; from one form to the other. The folding of some proteins can be modeled as a three-state kinetic process:

: &lt;chem&gt;U &lt;-&gt; MG &lt;-&gt; N&lt;/chem&gt;

One of the difficulties in &quot;de novo&quot; protein design is achieving the side chain packing needed to create a stable native state rather than an ensemble of molten globules. Given a desired backbone conformation, side chain packing can be designed using variations of the dead-end elimination algorithm; however, attempts to design proteins of novel folds have difficulty using this method due to an absence of plausible backbone models.

<text>Cooperative binding occurs in molecular binding systems containing more than one type, or species, of molecule and in which one of the partners is not mono-valent and can bind more than one molecule of the other species. In general, molecular binding is an interaction between molecules that results in a stable physical association between those molecules.

Cooperative binding occurs in a molecular binding system where two or more &quot;ligand&quot; molecules can bind to a &quot;receptor&quot; molecule. Binding can be considered &quot;cooperative&quot; if the actual binding of the first molecule of the ligand to the receptor changes the binding affinity of the second ligand molecule. The binding of ligand molecules to the different sites on the receptor molecule do not constitute mutually independent events. Cooperativity can be positive or negative, meaning that it becomes more or less likely that successive ligand molecules will bind to the receptor molecule. 

Cooperative binding is observed in many biopolymers, including proteins and nucleic acids. Cooperative binding has been shown to be the mechanism underlying a large range of biochemical and physiological processes.

== History and mathematical formalisms ==
=== Christian Bohr and the concept of cooperative binding ===
In 1904, Christian Bohr studied hemoglobin binding to oxygen under different conditions. When plotting hemoglobin saturation with oxygen as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen, he obtained a sigmoidal (or &quot;S-shaped&quot;) curve. This indicates that the more oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, the easier it is for more oxygen to bind - until all binding sites are saturated. In addition, Bohr noticed that increasing CO2 pressure shifted this curve to the right - i.e. higher concentrations of CO2 make it more difficult for hemoglobin to bind oxygen. This latter phenomenon, together with the observation that hemoglobin&#x27;s affinity for oxygen increases with increasing pH, is known as the Bohr effect.

A receptor molecule is said to exhibit cooperative binding if its binding to ligand scales non-linearly with ligand concentration. Cooperativity can be positive (if binding of a ligand molecule increases the receptor&#x27;s apparent affinity, and hence increases the chance of another ligand molecule binding) or negative (if binding of a ligand molecule decreases affinity and hence makes binding of other ligand molecules less likely). The &quot;fractional occupancy&quot; formula_1 of a receptor with a given ligand is defined as the quantity of ligand-bound binding sites divided by the total quantity of ligand binding sites:

:formula_2

If formula_3, then the protein is completely unbound, and if formula_4, it is completely saturated. If the plot of formula_1 at equilibrium as a function of ligand concentration is sigmoidal in shape, as observed by Bohr for hemoglobin, this indicates positive cooperativity. If it is not, no statement can be made about cooperativity from looking at this plot alone.

The concept of cooperative binding only applies to molecules or complexes with more than one ligand binding sites. If several ligand binding sites exist, but ligand binding to any one site does not affect the others, the receptor is said to be non-cooperative. Cooperativity can be homotropic, if a ligand influences the binding of ligands of the same kind, or heterotropic, if it influences binding of other kinds of ligands. In the case of hemoglobin, Bohr observed homotropic positive cooperativity (binding of oxygen facilitates binding of more oxygen) and heterotropic negative cooperativity (binding of CO2 reduces hemoglobin&#x27;s facility to bind oxygen.)

Throughout the 20th century, various frameworks have been developed to describe the binding of a ligand to a protein with more than one binding site and the cooperative effects observed in this context.

=== The Hill equation ===
The first description of cooperative binding to a multi-site protein was developed by A.V. Hill. Drawing on observations of oxygen binding to hemoglobin and the idea that cooperativity arose from the aggregation of hemoglobin molecules, each one binding one oxygen molecule, Hill suggested a phenomenological equation that has since been named after him: 

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the &quot;Hill coefficient&quot;, formula_8 denotes ligand concentration, formula_9 denotes an apparent association constant (used in the original form of the equation), formula_10 is an empirical dissociation constant, and formula_11 a microscopic dissociation constant (used in modern forms of the equation, and equivalent to an formula_12). If formula_13, the system exhibits negative cooperativity, whereas cooperativity is positive if formula_14. The total number of ligand binding sites is an upper bound for formula_7. The Hill equation can be linearized as:

:formula_16

The &quot;Hill plot&quot; is obtained by plotting formula_17 versus formula_18. In the case of the Hill equation, it is a line with slope formula_19 and intercept formula_20. This means that cooperativity is assumed to be fixed, i.e. it does not change with saturation. It also means that binding sites always exhibit the same affinity, and cooperativity does not arise from an affinity increasing with ligand concentration.

=== The Adair equation ===
G.S. Adair found that the Hill plot for hemoglobin was not a straight line, and hypothesized that binding affinity was not a fixed term, but dependent on ligand saturation. Having demonstrated that hemoglobin contained four hemes (and therefore binding sites for oxygen), he worked from the assumption that fully saturated hemoglobin is formed in stages, with intermediate forms with one, two, or three bound oxygen molecules. The formation of each intermediate stage from unbound hemoglobin can be described using an apparent macroscopic association constant formula_21. The resulting fractional occupancy can be expressed as:

:formula_22

Or, for any protein with &quot;n&quot; ligand binding sites:

:formula_23

where &quot;n&quot; denotes the number of binding sites and each formula_21 is a combined association constant, describing the binding of &quot;i&quot; ligand molecules.
By combining the Adair treatment with the Hill plot, one arrives at the modern experimental definition of cooperativity (Hill, 1985, Abeliovich, 2005). The resultant Hill coefficient, or more correctly the slope of the Hill plot as calculated from the Adair Equation, can be shown to be the ratio between the variance of the binding number to the variance of the binding number in an equivalent system of non-interacting binding sites. Thus, the Hill coefficient defines cooperativity as a statistical dependence of one binding site on the state of other site(s).

=== The Klotz equation ===
Working on calcium binding proteins, Irving Klotz deconvoluted Adair&#x27;s association constants by considering stepwise formation of the intermediate stages, and tried to express the cooperative binding in terms of elementary processes governed by mass action law. In his framework, formula_25 is the association constant governing binding of the first ligand molecule, formula_26 the association constant governing binding of the second ligand molecule (once the first is already bound) etc. For formula_1, this gives:

:formula_28

It is worth noting that the constants formula_25, formula_26 and so forth do not relate to individual binding sites. They describe &quot;how many&quot; binding sites are occupied, rather than &quot;which ones&quot;. This form has the advantage that cooperativity is easily recognised when considering the association constants. If all ligand binding sites are identical with a microscopic association constant formula_9, one would expect formula_32 (that is formula_33) in the absence of cooperativity. We have positive cooperativity if formula_21 lies above these expected values for formula_35.

The Klotz equation (which is sometimes also called the Adair-Klotz equation) is still often used in the experimental literature to describe measurements of ligand binding in terms of sequential apparent binding constants.

=== Pauling equation ===
By the middle of the 20th century, there was an increased interest in models that would not only describe binding curves phenomenologically, but offer an underlying biochemical mechanism. Linus Pauling reinterpreted the equation provided by Adair, assuming that his constants were the combination of the binding constant for the ligand (formula_9 in the equation below) and energy coming from the interaction between subunits of the cooperative protein (formula_37 below). Pauling actually derived several equations, depending on the degree of interaction between subunits. Based on wrong assumptions about the localization of hemes, he opted for the wrong one to describe oxygen binding by hemoglobin, assuming the subunit were arranged in a square. The equation below provides the equation for a tetrahedral structure, which would be more accurate in the case of hemoglobin:

:formula_38

=== The KNF model===
Based on results showing that the structure of cooperative proteins changed upon binding to their ligand, Daniel Koshland and colleagues refined the biochemical explanation of the mechanism described by Pauling. The Koshland-Némethy-Filmer (KNF) model assumes that each subunit can exist in one of two conformations: active or inactive. Ligand binding to one subunit would induce an immediate conformational change of that subunit from the inactive to the active conformation, a mechanism described as &quot;induced fit&quot;. Cooperativity, according to the KNF model, would arise from interactions between the subunits, the strength of which varies depending on the relative conformations of the subunits involved. For a tetrahedric structure (they also considered linear and square structures), they proposed the following formula:

:formula_39

Where formula_40 is the constant of association for X, formula_41 is the ratio of B and A states in the absence of ligand (&quot;transition&quot;), formula_42 and formula_43 are the relative stabilities of pairs of neighbouring subunits relative to a pair where both subunits are in the A state (Note that the KNF paper actually presents formula_44, the number of occupied sites, which is here 4 times formula_1).

=== The MWC model ===

The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for concerted allosteric transitions went a step further by exploring cooperativity based on thermodynamics and three-dimensional conformations. It was originally formulated for oligomeric proteins with symmetrically arranged, identical subunits, each of which has one ligand binding site. According to this framework, two (or more) interconvertible conformational states of an allosteric protein coexist in a thermal equilibrium. The states - often termed tense (T) and relaxed (R) - differ in affinity for the ligand molecule. The ratio between the two states is regulated by the binding of ligand molecules that stabilizes the higher-affinity state. Importantly, all subunits of a molecule change states at the same time, a phenomenon known as &quot;concerted transition&quot;.

The allosteric isomerisation constant &quot;L&quot; describes the equilibrium between both states when no ligand molecule is bound: formula_46. If &quot;L&quot; is very large, most of the protein exists in the T state in the absence of ligand. If &quot;L&quot; is small (close to one), the R state is nearly as populated as the T state. The ratio of dissociation constants for the ligand from the T and R states is described by the constant &quot;c&quot;: formula_47. If formula_48, both R and T states have the same affinity for the ligand and the ligand does not affect isomerisation. The value of &quot;c&quot; also indicates how much the equilibrium between T and R states changes upon ligand binding: the smaller &quot;c&quot;, the more the equilibrium shifts towards the R state after one binding. With formula_49, fractional occupancy is described as:

:formula_50

The sigmoid Hill plot of allosteric proteins can then be analysed as a progressive transition from the T state (low affinity) to the R state (high affinity) as the saturation increases. The slope of the Hill plot also depends on saturation, with a maximum value at the inflexion point. The intercepts between the two asymptotes and the y-axis allow to determine the affinities of both states for the ligand. 


In proteins, conformational change is often associated with activity, or activity towards specific targets. Such activity is often what is physiologically relevant or what is experimentally measured. The degree of conformational change is described by the state function formula_51, which denotes the fraction of protein present in the formula_52 state. As the energy diagram illustrates, formula_51 increases as more ligand molecules bind. The expression for formula_51 is:

:formula_55

A crucial aspect of the MWC model is that the curves for formula_1 and formula_51 do not coincide, i.e. fractional saturation is not a direct indicator of conformational state (and hence, of activity). Moreover, the extents of the cooperativity of binding and the cooperativity of activation can be very different: an extreme case is provide by the bacteria flagella motor with a Hill coefficient of 1.7 for the binding and 10.3 for the activation. The supra-linearity of the response is sometimes called ultrasensitivity.

If an allosteric protein binds to a target that also has a higher affinity for the R state, then target binding further stabilizes the R state, hence increasing ligand affinity. If, on the other hand, a target preferentially binds to the T state, then target binding will have a negative effect on ligand affinity. Such targets are called allosteric modulators.

Since its inception, the MWC framework has been extended and generalized. Variations have been proposed, for example to cater for proteins with more than two states, proteins that bind to several types of ligands or several types of allosteric modulators and proteins with non-identical subunits or ligand-binding sites.

== Examples ==
The list of molecular assemblies that exhibit cooperative binding of ligands is very large, but some examples are particularly notable for their historical interest, their unusual properties, or their physiological importance.

 As described in the historical section, the most famous example of cooperative binding is hemoglobin. Its quaternary structure, solved by Max Perutz using X-ray diffraction, exhibits a pseudo-symmetrical tetrahedron carrying four binding sites (hemes) for oxygen. Many other molecular assemblies exhibiting cooperative binding have been studied in great detail.

=== Multimeric enzymes ===
The activity of many enzymes is regulated by allosteric effectors. Some of these enzymes are multimeric and carry several binding sites for the regulators.

Threonine deaminase was one of the first enzymes suggested to behave like hemoglobin and shown to bind ligands cooperatively. It was later shown to be a tetrameric protein.

Another enzyme that has been suggested early to bind ligands cooperatively is aspartate trans-carbamylase. Although initial models were consistent with four binding sites, its structure was later shown to be hexameric by William Lipscomb and colleagues.

=== Ion channels ===
Most ion channels are formed of several identical or pseudo-identical monomers or domains, arranged symmetrically in biological membranes. Several classes of such channels whose opening is regulated by ligands exhibit cooperative binding of these ligands.

It was suggested as early as 1967 (when the exact nature of those channels was still unknown) that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors bound acetylcholine in a cooperative manner due to the existence of several binding sites. The purification of the receptor and its characterization demonstrated a pentameric structure with binding sites located at the interfaces between subunits, confirmed by the structure of the receptor binding domain.

Inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptors form another class of ligand-gated ion channels exhibiting cooperative binding. The structure of those receptors shows four IP3 binding sites symmetrically arranged.

=== Multi-site molecules ===
Although most proteins showing cooperative binding are multimeric complexes of homologous subunits, some proteins carry several binding sites for the same ligand on the same polypeptide. One such example is calmodulin. One molecule of calmodulin binds four calcium ions cooperatively. Its structure presents four EF-hand domains, each one binding one calcium ion. The molecule does not display a square or tetrahedron structure, but is formed of two lobes, each carrying two EF-hand domains. 

=== Transcription factors ===
Cooperative binding of proteins onto nucleic acids has also been shown. A classical example is the binding of the lambda phage repressor to its operators, which occurs cooperatively. Other examples of transcription factors exhibit positive cooperativity when binding their target, such as the repressor of the TtgABC pumps (n=1.6), as well as conditional cooperativity exhibited by the transcription factors HOXA11 and FOXO1.

Conversely, examples of negative cooperativity for the binding of transcription factors were also documented, as for the homodimeric repressor of the &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; cytochrome P450cam hydroxylase operon (n=0.56).

=== Conformational spread and binding cooperativity ===
Early on, it has been argued that some proteins, especially those consisting of many subunits, could be regulated by a generalized MWC mechanism, in which the transition between R and T state is not necessarily synchronized across the entire protein. In 1969, Wyman proposed such a model with &quot;mixed conformations&quot; (i.e. some protomers in the R state, some in the T state) for respiratory proteins in invertebrates.

Following a similar idea, the conformational spread model by Duke and colleagues subsumes both the KNF and the MWC model as special cases. In this model, a subunit does not automatically change conformation upon ligand binding (as in the KNF model), nor do all subunits in a complex change conformations together (as in the MWC model). Conformational changes are stochastic with the likelihood of a subunit switching states depending on whether or not it is ligand bound and on the conformational state of neighbouring subunits. Thus, conformational states can &quot;spread&quot; around the entire complex.

==Impact of upstream and downstream components on module&#x27;s ultrasensitivity==
In a living cell, ultrasensitive modules are embedded in a bigger network with upstream and downstream components. These components may constrain the range of inputs that the module will receive as well as the range of the module&#x27;s outputs that network will be able to detect. The sensitivity of a modular system is affected by these restrictions. The dynamic range limitations imposed by downstream components can produce effective sensitivities much larger than that of the original module when considered in isolation.

<text>Incarnations of Immortality is an eight-book fantasy series by Piers Anthony. The books each focus on one of eight supernatural &quot;offices&quot; (Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, Evil, Good, and Night) in a fictional reality and history parallel to ours, with the exception that society has advanced both magic and modern technology. The series covers the adventures and struggles of a group of humans called &quot;Incarnations&quot;, who hold these supernatural positions for a certain time.

The title alludes to William Wordsworth&#x27;s 1804 poem &quot;&quot;.

==Characters==

===Family tree===




Note: Colors for each of the Incarnations used are from the covers of their respective books.
Note: Gawain II was conceived by Norton and Orlene, but has Gawain&#x27;s genetic material instead of Norton&#x27;s (a favor performed by Gaea)

Relationships:

* Zane (Thanatos, the Incarnation of Death) is the lover and protector of Luna Kaftan (Niobe&#x27;s granddaughter).
* Norton (Chronos, the Incarnation of Time) is the lover of Orlene (who becomes Good) as well as the lover of Clotho.
* Niobe (Clotho, and later Lachesis, Aspects of the Incarnation of Fate) is Orb&#x27;s (Gaea) mother, and grandmother to Luna (Death&#x27;s lover), and Orlene (Good). She is also lover to Chronos.
* Mym (Mars, the Incarnation of War) is father to Orlene (Good) and former lover of Orb (Gaea).
* Orb (Gaea, Mother Nature) is mother to Orlene (Good), daughter to Niobe (Clotho/Lachesis, Fate), and former lover of Mym (War).
* Parry (Satan, the Incarnation of Evil) is married to Orb (Mother Nature), and stepfather to Orlene (Good).
* Orlene (God, sometimes called &quot;the Goddess&quot;, the Incarnation of Good) is Nature&#x27;s daughter, War&#x27;s daughter, Fate&#x27;s granddaughter, Time&#x27;s lover and mother to his biological son (prior to either of them taking their office), Evil&#x27;s stepdaughter, and Death&#x27;s wife&#x27;s cousin.

In &quot;Under a Velvet Cloak&quot;, Kerena (Nox, Incarnation of Night) is the lover of the original Sir Gawain, Knight of the Round Table, and mother of the original Gawain (Gaw-Two) who was tainted at birth and destined to die early. Kerena&#x27;s quest to save Gaw-Two is what eventually leads her to become Nox, the Incarnation of Night and Keeper of Secrets. Gawain (Orlene&#x27;s ghost husband) is the direct descendant of Sir Gawain, and carries the family taint, so the second Gaw-Two, born to Orlene and Ghost Gawain, is also tainted and destined to die early. Nox is also the great-aunt (many times removed) to Niobe and her children and grandchildren.

===Lesser Incarnations===
*Hypnos: Incarnation of Sleep
*JHVH: Incarnation of Jewish God (assumed to be Jehovah)

====Lesser Incarnations serving Nature/Gaea====
*Eros: Incarnation of Love
*Hope: Incarnation of Hope
*Phobos &amp; Deimos: Named after the Greek gods of fear and panic. These lesser Incarnations act as assistants to Gaea (Nature). Their functions are not explained in the books (although presumably they have similar natures to their Greek equivalents).

====Lesser Incarnations serving War/Mars====
*Pestilence: disease in general, but especially consistent with the aftermath of battles.
*Conquest: manager of individual battles
*Famine: starvation consistent with battles (although this incarnation has served Death/Thanatos on at least one occasion)
*Slaughter: a representation of the bloodshed associated with battles
* The essentials formed a covenant

==Cultural references==
* The Showtime series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; was inspired by the book &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;.
* In 2007, Anthony wrote that Disney had sold the TV rights to &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot; to Touchstone/ABC, which were &quot;filming a pilot program&quot;. In 2009 Javier Grillo-Marxuach wrote a pilot for the series for ABC, but it was not picked up.

<text>Parliament was an American funk band formed in 1968 by George Clinton as a flagship act of his P-Funk collective. Evolving out of an earlier vocal group, Parliament became associated with a more commercial and less rock-oriented sound than its sister act Funkadelic. Their work incorporated Afrofuturism concepts, horn arrangements, synthesizer, and outlandish theatrics. The band scored a number of Top 10 hits, including the million-selling 1976 single &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker),&quot; and Top 40 albums such as &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; (1975).

==History==
Parliament was originally The Parliaments, a doo-wop vocal group based at a Plainfield, New Jersey barbershop. The group was formed in the late 1950s and included George Clinton, Ray Davis, Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas. Clinton was the group leader and manager. The group scored a hit single in 1967 with &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot; (co-written by Clinton) on Revilot Records. To capitalize on this chart success, Clinton formed a touring band, featuring teenage barbershop employee Billy Nelson on bass and his friend Eddie Hazel on guitar, with the line-up eventually rounded out by Tawl Ross on guitar, Tiki Fulwood on drums, and Mickey Atkins on organ.

During a contractual dispute with Revilot, Clinton temporarily lost the rights to the name &quot;The Parliaments&quot;, and signed the ensemble to Westbound Records as Funkadelic, which Clinton positioned as a funk-rock band featuring the five touring musicians with the five Parliaments singers as uncredited guests. With Funkadelic as a recording and touring entity in its own right, in 1970 Clinton relaunched the singing group, now known as Parliament, at first featuring the same ten members. Clinton was now the leader of two different acts, Parliament and Funkadelic, which featured the same members, but were marketed as creating two different types of funk.

The Parliament album entitled &quot;Osmium&quot; was released on Invictus Records in 1970, and was later reissued on CD with non-album tracks as both &quot;Rhenium&quot; and &quot;First Thangs&quot;. &quot;Osmium&quot; featured a mostly psychedelic soul sound that was more similar to the Funkadelic albums of the period, than to the later Parliament albums. The song &quot;The Breakdown&quot; was released separately as a single, and reached No. 30 on the R&amp;B chart in 1971. Due to continuing contractual problems and the fact that Funkadelic releases were more successful at the time, Clinton temporarily abandoned the name Parliament (which he revived in 1974).

Following &quot;Osmium&quot;, the line-up of Parliament-Funkadelic began going through many changes and was expanded significantly, with the addition of important members such as keyboardist Bernie Worrell in 1970, singer/guitarist Garry Shider in 1971, and bassist Bootsy Collins (recruited from the James Brown backing band) in 1972. Dozens of singers and musicians would contribute to future Parliament-Funkadelic releases. Clinton relaunched Parliament in 1974 and signed the act to Casablanca Records. Parliament, now augmented by the Horny Horns (also recruited from James Brown&#x27;s band) was positioned as a smoother R&amp;B-based funk ensemble with intricate horn and vocal arrangements, and as a counterpoint to the guitar-based funk-rock of Funkadelic. By this point, Parliament and Funkadelic were touring as a combined entity known as Parliament-Funkadelic or simply P-Funk (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton&#x27;s rapidly growing stable of funk artists).

The album &quot;Up for the Down Stroke&quot; was released in 1974, with &quot;Chocolate City&quot; following in 1975. Both performed strongly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album chart and were moderately successful on the pop chart. Parliament began its period of greatest mainstream success with the concept album &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; (1975), the lyrics of which launched much of the P-Funk mythology. The subsequent albums &quot;The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein&quot; (1976), &quot;Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome&quot; (1977), and &quot;Motor Booty Affair&quot; (1978) all reached high on both the R&amp;B and Pop charts, while Funkadelic was also experiencing significant mainstream success. Parliament scored the No. 1 R&amp;B singles &quot;Flash Light&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Aqua Boogie&quot; in 1978.

The rapidly expanding ensemble of musicians and singers in the Parliament-Funkadelic enterprise, as well as Clinton&#x27;s problematic management practices, began to take their toll by the late 1970s. Original Parliaments members Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas, who had been with Clinton since the barbershop days in the late 1950s, departed acrimoniously in 1977, after disputes over Clinton&#x27;s management. Other important group members like singer/guitarist Glenn Goins and drummer Jerome Brailey left Parliament-Funkadelic in 1978 after disputes over Clinton&#x27;s management. Two further Parliament albums, &quot;Gloryhallastoopid&quot; (1979) and &quot;Trombipulation&quot; (1980) were less successful than the albums from the group&#x27;s prime 1975-1978 period.

In the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at Casablanca Records, George Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton &amp; the P-Funk All-Stars. The P-Funk All-Stars continued to record and tour into the 1990s and 2000s, and regularly perform classic Parliament songs.

Parliament reformed in January 2018 and released the song &quot;I&#x27;m Gon Make U Sick O&#x27;Me&quot;, which features the rapper Scarface. This was the first new Parliament release in 38 years. Clinton also announced the title of a new Parliament album, &quot;Medicaid Fraud Dogg&quot;, which was released on May 22, 2018. Most of the 23 tracks on the album were written by Clinton in collaboration with his son, Tracey Lewis. Guest musicians on the album include former long-time James Brown collaborators Fred Wesley and Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis.

<doc id="106231" wikidata="Q178593" url="?curid=106231" title="Macromolecule">
<text>A macromolecule is a very large molecule important to biological processes, such as a protein or nucleic acid. It is composed of thousands of covalently bonded atoms. Many macromolecules are polymers of smaller molecules called monomers. The most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers (nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates) and large non-polymeric molecules such as lipids, nanogels and macrocycles. Synthetic fibers and experimental materials such as carbon nanotubes are also examples of macromolecules.

== Definition ==

The term &quot;macromolecule&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;molecule&quot;) was coined by Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger in the 1920s, although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions &quot;high molecular compounds&quot; (in excess of 1,000 atoms). At that time the term &quot;polymer&quot;, as introduced by Berzelius in 1832, had a different meaning from that of today: it simply was another form of isomerism for example with benzene and acetylene and had little to do with size.

Usage of the term to describe large molecules varies among the disciplines. For example, while biology refers to macromolecules as the four large molecules comprising living things, in chemistry, the term may refer to aggregates of two or more molecules held together by intermolecular forces rather than covalent bonds but which do not readily dissociate.

According to the standard IUPAC definition, the term &quot;macromolecule&quot; as used in polymer science refers only to a single molecule. For example, a single polymeric molecule is appropriately described as a &quot;macromolecule&quot; or &quot;polymer molecule&quot; rather than a &quot;polymer,&quot; which suggests a substance composed of macromolecules.

Because of their size, macromolecules are not conveniently described in terms of stoichiometry alone. The structure of simple macromolecules, such as homopolymers, may be described in terms of the individual monomer subunit and total molecular mass. Complicated biomacromolecules, on the other hand, require multi-faceted structural description such as the hierarchy of structures used to describe proteins. In British English, the word &quot;macromolecule&quot; tends to be called &quot;high polymer&quot;.

== Properties ==

Macromolecules often have unusual physical properties that do not occur for smaller molecules.

Another common macromolecular property that does not characterize smaller molecules is their relative insolubility in water and similar solvents, instead forming colloids. Many require salts or particular ions to dissolve in water. Similarly, many proteins will denature if the solute concentration of their solution is too high or too low.

High concentrations of macromolecules in a solution can alter the rates and equilibrium constants of the reactions of other macromolecules, through an effect known as macromolecular crowding. This comes from macromolecules excluding other molecules from a large part of the volume of the solution, thereby increasing the effective concentrations of these molecules.

== Linear biopolymers ==
All living organisms are dependent on three essential biopolymers for their biological functions: DNA, RNA and proteins. Each of these molecules is required for life since each plays a distinct, indispensable role in the cell. The simple summary is that DNA makes RNA, and then RNA makes proteins.

DNA, RNA, and proteins all consist of a repeating structure of related building blocks (nucleotides in the case of DNA and RNA, amino acids in the case of proteins). In general, they are all unbranched polymers, and so can be represented in the form of a string. Indeed, they can be viewed as a string of beads, with each bead representing a single nucleotide or amino acid monomer linked together through covalent chemical bonds into a very long chain.

In most cases, the monomers within the chain have a strong propensity to interact with other amino acids or nucleotides. In DNA and RNA, this can take the form of Watson–Crick base pairs (G–C and A–T or A–U), although many more complicated interactions can and do occur.

=== Structural features ===
Because of the double-stranded nature of DNA, essentially all of the nucleotides take the form of Watson–Crick base pairs between nucleotides on the two complementary strands of the double helix.

In contrast, both RNA and proteins are normally single-stranded. Therefore, they are not constrained by the regular geometry of the DNA double helix, and so fold into complex three-dimensional shapes dependent on their sequence. These different shapes are responsible for many of the common properties of RNA and proteins, including the formation of specific binding pockets, and the ability to catalyse biochemical reactions.

==== DNA is optimised for encoding information ====
DNA is an information storage macromolecule that encodes the complete set of instructions (the genome) that are required to assemble, maintain, and reproduce every living organism.

DNA and RNA are both capable of encoding genetic information, because there are biochemical mechanisms which read the information coded within a DNA or RNA sequence and use it to generate a specified protein. On the other hand, the sequence information of a protein molecule is not used by cells to functionally encode genetic information.

DNA has three primary attributes that allow it to be far better than RNA at encoding genetic information. First, it is normally double-stranded, so that there are a minimum of two copies of the information encoding each gene in every cell. Second, DNA has a much greater stability against breakdown than does RNA, an attribute primarily associated with the absence of the 2&#x27;-hydroxyl group within every nucleotide of DNA. Third, highly sophisticated DNA surveillance and repair systems are present which monitor damage to the DNA and repair the sequence when necessary. Analogous systems have not evolved for repairing damaged RNA molecules. Consequently, chromosomes can contain many billions of atoms, arranged in a specific chemical structure.

==== Proteins are optimised for catalysis ====
Proteins are functional macromolecules responsible for catalysing the biochemical reactions that sustain life. Proteins carry out all functions of an organism, for example photosynthesis, neural function, vision, and movement.

The single-stranded nature of protein molecules, together with their composition of 20 or more different amino acid building blocks, allows them to fold in to a vast number of different three-dimensional shapes, while providing binding pockets through which they can specifically interact with all manner of molecules. In addition, the chemical diversity of the different amino acids, together with different chemical environments afforded by local 3D structure, enables many proteins to act as enzymes, catalyzing a wide range of specific biochemical transformations within cells. In addition, proteins have evolved the ability to bind a wide range of cofactors and coenzymes, smaller molecules that can endow the protein with specific activities beyond those associated with the polypeptide chain alone.

==== RNA is multifunctional ====
RNA is multifunctional, its primary function is to encode proteins, according to the instructions within a cell&#x27;s DNA. They control and regulate many aspects of protein synthesis in eukaryotes.

RNA encodes genetic information that can be translated into the amino acid sequence of proteins, as evidenced by the messenger RNA molecules present within every cell, and the RNA genomes of a large number of viruses. The single-stranded nature of RNA, together with tendency for rapid breakdown and a lack of repair systems means that RNA is not so well suited for the long-term storage of genetic information as is DNA.

In addition, RNA is a single-stranded polymer that can, like proteins, fold into a very large number of three-dimensional structures. Some of these structures provide binding sites for other molecules and chemically active centers that can catalyze specific chemical reactions on those bound molecules. The limited number of different building blocks of RNA (4 nucleotides vs &gt;20 amino acids in proteins), together with their lack of chemical diversity, results in catalytic RNA (ribozymes) being generally less-effective catalysts than proteins for most biological reactions.

The Major Macromolecules:
== Branched biopolymers ==

Carbohydrate macromolecules (polysaccharides) are formed from polymers of monosaccharides. Because monosaccharides have multiple functional groups, polysaccharides can form linear polymers (e.g. cellulose) or complex branched structures (e.g. glycogen). Polysaccharides perform numerous roles in living organisms, acting as energy stores (e.g. starch) and as structural components (e.g. chitin in arthropods and fungi). Many carbohydrates contain modified monosaccharide units that have had functional groups replaced or removed.

Polyphenols consist of a branched structure of multiple phenolic subunits. They can perform structural roles (e.g. lignin) as well as roles as secondary metabolites involved in signalling, pigmentation and defense.

== Synthetic macromolecules ==
Some examples of macromolecules are synthetic polymers (plastics, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubber), graphene, and carbon nanotubes. Polymers may be prepared from inorganic matter as well as for instance in inorganic polymers and geopolymers. The incorporation of inorganic elements enables the tunability of properties and/or responsive behavior as for instance in smart inorganic polymers.

<doc id="106232" wikidata="Q1309349" url="?curid=106232" title="P-Funk mythology">
<text>The P-Funk mythology is a group of recurring characters, themes, and ideas primarily contained in the output of George Clinton&#x27;s bands Parliament and Funkadelic. This &quot;funkology&quot; was outlined in album liner notes and song lyrics, in addition to album artwork, costumes, advertisements, and stage banter. P-Funk&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Seussian afrofunk&quot; is often cited as a critical component of the Afrofuturism movement.

==Background==

George Clinton&#x27;s space-age mythology began to emerge with the release of Funkadelic&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1970. Later that same year, Parliament released their debut album &quot;Osmium&quot;. Clinton&#x27;s cosmology was largely absent from the latter release, and it took longer to blossom in Parliament&#x27;s output. Generally speaking, Parliament was a dance-oriented band, while Funkadelic was more serious and psychedelic.

The two bands shared personnel, and Clinton blurred the lines between them both by referring to his touring band as &quot;A Parliafunkadelicment Thang&quot;. The shorthand for this conglomerate became &quot;P-Funk&quot;, and it grew to include offshoots like P-Funk All Stars, Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, Parlet, The Brides of Funkenstein, The Horny Horns, and solo albums by Eddie Hazel and Bernie Worrell. By the mid 70s, P-Funk was a massively successful group of acts. A ranking of the top live acts of 1977 included three bands from the conglomerate in the top fifteen slots.

After the bands&#x27; earlier releases, Clinton began to feel that something more conceptual was in order, and he expressed deep admiration for The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; as &quot;the classiest two pieces of music I had ever seen where everything related to each other. So I wanted to do one of those kinds of things.&quot; Clinton settled on the extraterrestrial concept because of its originality, saying, &quot;Put niggas in places that you don&#x27;t usually see &#x27;em. And &quot;nobody&quot; had seen &#x27;em on no spaceships! Once you seen &#x27;em sittin&#x27; on spaceships like it was Cadillac then it was funny, cool.&quot;

The primary author of the P-Funk mythology aside from George Clinton was Pedro Bell, who illustrated the liners for many of P-Funk&#x27;s releases. Bell&#x27;s felt-tip illustrations included prolonged essays that expanded the mythos of Clinton&#x27;s lyrics with a complementary syntax that &quot;forged a new realm of black language&quot;. Though Bell coined terms like &quot;Rumpasaurus&quot; and made extensive contributions to the P-Funk mythology, his work has been largely overlooked.

Clinton has pointed to the show &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; as an influence in his elaborate narrative, but more importantly, he and Bootsy Collins allegedly encountered a UFO together while driving to Detroit. Clinton recalls light bouncing from one side of the street to the other, and remarking to Collins, &quot;The Mothership was angry with us for giving up the funk without permission.&quot; The bouncing light eventually focused on their car, and Clinton asked Collins to &quot;step on it&quot;.

The P-Funk mythology was just one tool in the conglomerate&#x27;s arsenal. By the mid-1970s, Clinton was rebranding funk as many things at once, &quot;an aesthetic, a marketing ploy, a black cultural nationalist battle-plan and a way of being if not a spiritual discipline.&quot; He was drawing on everything from &quot;hipster lingo of the beboppers, early black radio deejays and the apocalyptic anti-slavemassa edicts of the Nation of Islam&quot; as well as the Yippies and the Black Panthers. Clinton was positioning P-Funk as a &quot;radical response to the American police state&quot; and &quot;the antithesis of everything that was sterile, one-dimensional, monochromatic, arhythmic and otherwise against freedom of bodily expression in the known universe.&quot; In its simplest iteration, Clinton posited that &quot;funk&quot; was equivalent with the &quot;truth&quot;.

== Funkadelic ==

Funkadelic albums are generally more abstract than Parliament&#x27;s. Rather than tell the story of a cast of characters, the mythology of Funkadelic is defined as a socially conscious spiritualism. One of the defining traits of the P-Funk mythology is that it is indeed a form of social commentary in that it &quot;took all the cheese America had to offer and ran with it, taking the fashions and technology of the day to their ultimate, preposterous conclusions, amplifying the aesthetics of the 70s into a throbbing, fish-eyed cartoon of itself, and in so doing glorified American culture and their role in its continuing evolution.&quot;

On &quot;Mommy, What&#x27;s a Funkadelic?&quot;, the opening track of Funkadelic&#x27;s 1970 self-titled debut album, Clinton&#x27;s cosmology starts to emerge with the lines, &quot;By the way, my name is Funk...I am not of your world...Hold still, baby, I won&#x27;t do you no harm...I am Funkadelic, dedicated to the feeling of good.&#x27;&quot; The same introduction of &quot;Funkadelic&quot; is repeated at the outset of the album&#x27;s closing track &quot;What Is Soul&quot;.

On Funkadelic&#x27;s second album, &quot;Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow&quot; (1970), funk is posited as a path to enlightenment in the title track: &quot;Open up your funky mind and you can fly...Free your mind and your ass will follow...The kingdom of heaven is within&quot;. This sentiment is echoed in subsequent songs like &quot;Standing on the Verge of Getting It On&quot; (1974) which contains the verse, &quot;Music is designed to free your funky mind. We have come to help you cope out into another reality&quot;. A more scatological iteration comes in the song &quot;Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad (The Doo Doo Chasers)&quot; (1978) where &quot;funk&quot; is defined as &quot;the P-Preparation, The prune juice of the mind, A mental, musical bowel movement, Groove-lax...A psychological turd remover, A neurological enema&quot;.

Many of the lyrics in P-Funk songs imply that the band is merely a medium for a godhead that takes the form of funk. At other times, the band or Clinton are cast as priestly beings tasked with guiding humanity through music. In the song &quot;Phunklords&quot;, they sing, &quot;We are the Phunklords...Sent to you from eons away
just to spread some funk your way&quot;. At the beginning of &quot;The Electronic Spanking of War Babies&quot;, Clinton explains that he was &quot;adopted by aliens&quot; at the age of 17, and that &quot;they have long since programmed me to return with this message.&quot; The liner notes of &quot;Standing on the Verge of Getting It On&quot; explain that, &quot;On the Eighth Day, the Cosmic Strumpet of Mother Nature was spawned to envelope this Third Planet in FUNKADELICAL VIBRATIONS. And she birthed Apostles Ra, Hendrix, Stone, and CLINTON to preserve all funkiness of man unto eternity... But! Fraudulent forces of obnoxious JIVATION grew...only seedling GEORGE remained! As it came to be, he did indeed begat FUNKADELIC to restore Order Within the Universe.&quot;

The title of the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; (1971), became a lasting concept in the P-Funk mythology. The title track opens the album with the incantation, &quot;Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time...for y&#x27;all have knocked her up. I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the Universe.&quot; Maggot brain is a &quot;state of mind&quot; with potentially disastrous consequences if nothing is done about it. The incantation on &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; concludes, &quot;I knew I had to rise above it all or drown in my own shit.&quot; The song &quot;Super Stupid&quot; links maggot brain to fear with lyrics about a protagonist who snorts heroin thinking it is cocaine. Super Stupid is said to have a &quot;maggot brain&quot; and to have &quot;lost the fight and the winner is fear&quot;. The album&#x27;s liner notes reinforce the connection between maggot brain and fear by quoting from the writing of Robert de Grimston, &quot;Fear is the root of man&#x27;s destruction of himself. Without Fear there is no blame. Without blame there is no conflict. Without conflict there is no destruction.&quot;

The liner notes for &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; (1978) are a typical example of how the P-Funk mythology expanded on song lyrics to develop a sprawling, satirical narrative. The liner includes a summary of &quot;The Funk Wars 1984 B.C.&quot;, which is a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Just like George Lucas&#x27; movie, the Funk Wars take place &quot;ONCE UPON A TIME... in a faraway parallel universe&quot;. Instead of Darth Vader, the villain is &quot;BARFT VADA&quot;, and his soldiers wield &quot;Blight Sabers&quot;. VADA has outlawed funk in favor of disco to &quot;maintain mental constipation&quot; and prevent Funkadelica from &quot;deprogramming the population&quot;. The hero, JASPER SPATIC, has invented a Throb Gun, which he unleashes at a disco, triggering an epic battle and defeat for Barft Vada. The story ends with Jasper pondering what would happen the next time Barft Vada caused trouble, hoping that someone would warn people to &quot;THINK! IT AIN&#x27;T ILLEGAL YET!&quot;, which is a chant heard in the live version of &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; that closes the album.

== Parliament ==
Four years after their debut album, Parliament released their second album which makes the first direct reference to the mythology that had taken root in Funkadelic&#x27;s early albums. On &quot;I Just Got Back (From the Fantasy, Ahead of Our Time in the Four Lands of Ellet)&quot;, the narrator announces &quot;I just got back from another world&quot;. It is located &quot;across the mountain and through the seas, past the moon, beyond all the things that we&#x27;ve dreamed about&quot;. The place was so beautiful that the narrator did not want to leave, but felt that he must return to help the listener be a parent and to &quot;show you the way, the right way, I feel you gotta live&quot;. Though the song was written by a street performer named Peter Chase, it bears all the narrative hallmarks of the P-Funk cosmology, with its voyage to a distant planet and a return after a long absence bearing enlightenment for a suffering audience.

=== &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; ===

The P-Funk mythology begins in earnest on Parliament&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Mothership Connection&quot;, which features Clinton emerging from a spaceship on the cover. The first track, &quot;P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)&quot; begins in the same way as the title track from &quot;Chocolate City&quot;, the band&#x27;s previous album. A DJ talks directly to the audience as if he is on the radio, but on this album, the station call sign is announced as &quot;WEFUNK&quot;. It is broadcasting from outer space &quot;directly from the Mothership&quot;. The DJ reveals his name as &quot;The Lollipop Man, alias the Long-Haired Sucker.&quot; He exhorts the listener to lay their body on the radio in order to be healed by the music because &quot;Funk not only moves, it can re-move&quot;.

In the next song, &quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child)&quot;, the titular Starchild explains, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; the Mothership Connection&quot; and that &quot;we have returned to claim the Pyramids.&quot; Starchild invites the listener to &quot;come on up to the Mothership&quot;. He later asks, &quot;Are you hip to Easter Island? The Bermuda Triangle?&quot;, reinforcing the ancient aliens imagery of the song. &quot;Unfunky UFO&quot; depicts a spaceship full of people from &quot;a dying world&quot; who sing, &quot;We&#x27;re unfunky and we&#x27;re obsolete&quot;. They are desperate for some funk, wanting to &quot;take your funk and make it mine&quot; and begging the listener to &quot;show me how to funk like you do&quot;. This primal need for funk is echoed in the highest-charting song from the album, &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot;, with its pleas of &quot;Give up the funk...we gotta have that funk&quot;. The album&#x27;s closing track introduces an important concept in the P-Funk mythology with its title: &quot;Night Of The Thumpasorous Peoples&quot;. The lyrics are primarily &quot;gaga googoo&quot;, but the Thumpasorous lineage is a recurring feature in subsequent releases.

Parliament&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein&quot;, is the motherlode for the narrative of their legendary stage show. The first half of the album introduces key characters like Dr. Funkenstein and expands on terms like &quot;Thumpasorous&quot;.

=== &quot;Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome&quot;===
With the P-Funk Earth Tour in high gear, Parliament released &quot;Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome&quot; in 1977. The first track, &quot;Bop Gun (Endangered Species)&quot;, weaponizes funk as a self-protection device: &quot;When the syndrome is around, don&#x27;t let your guard down. All you got to do is call on the funk...to dance is a protection...On guard! Protect yourself!...Shoot them with the bop gun&quot; The next song, &quot;Sir Nose d&#x27;Voidoffunk (Pay Attention - B3M)&quot;, introduces the title character who claims to be &quot;the subliminal seducer&quot; and &quot;devoid of funk&quot;. Sir Nose claims that Starchild may have won a battle, but that he will return. Later in the song, Starchild appears, &quot;chasing noses away&quot;, and proclaims himself &quot;Protector of the Pleasure Principle&quot;. &quot;Nose&quot; instantly became a recurring term for negativity in the P-Funk mythology, prompting lines like &quot;a funk a day keeps the Nose away&quot;. The concept for the character originated in &quot;The Pinocchio Theory&quot; by Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, which asserts that if &quot;you fake the funk; your nose got to grow&quot;. Sir Nose is &quot;Cro-Nasal&quot;, predating the Cro-Magnon and the Neanderthal.

&quot;Funkentelechy&quot; sees a return of DJ Lollipop as he narrates a free-association meditation on overstimulation, which he terms &quot;urge overkill&quot;, from things like pills and commercial jingles for Big Macs and Whoppers. Playing off Aristotle&#x27;s concept of entelechy, DJ Lollipop, who also claims the name of &quot;Mr. Prolong&quot; during the song, reassures the listener that &quot;this is mood de-control&quot; and the &quot;pleasure principle has been rescued&quot;. The last song on the album, &quot;Flash Light&quot;, was Parliament&#x27;s first #1 single. It contains a glancing reference to the P-Funk mythology when the Nose finds the funk, with the aid of the titular device, and begins to &quot;Get on down&quot;. The ethos of the song, and Parliament as well, is that even the Nose can become funky because &quot;Everybody&#x27;s got a little light under the sun&quot;.

=== Later albums ===
Parliament&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Motor Booty Affair&quot; begins with &quot;Mr. Wiggles&quot;. The titular character is a variation on DJ Lollipop. Now, WEFUNK is located in Emerald City in downtown Atlantis. The title character of the second song is &quot;Rumpofsteelskin&quot; who is so unfunky that &quot;he don&#x27;t rust and he don&#x27;t bend&quot;. With the album set underwater, swimming becomes akin to dancing, and in &quot;Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)&quot; Sir Nose returns to announce that he cannot swim and hates water. Overton Loyd&#x27;s album art depicted the motto &quot;We got ta raise Atlantis to the top&quot;, signifying the need for upward social mobility among African-Americans.

On &quot;Gloryhallastoopid&quot; (1979), Sir Nose defeats Starchild and turns him into a mule in &quot;Theme From The Black Hole&quot;. While gloating over his victory, Sir Nose alludes to multiple songs from &quot;Funkentelechy&quot; and &quot;Clones&quot; with taunts like &quot;Where&#x27;s your flashlight? Where&#x27;s your bop gun? Where&#x27;s the Doctor (Funkenstein), Starchild?&quot;.

== Stage show==
By the mid-1970s, Clinton had flooded the market with P-Funk and sought to capitalize by mounting a stage show he called &quot;Mothership Connection&quot;, also known as the P-Funk Earth Tour. The stage show employed the techniques of glam rock productions like David Bowie&#x27;s Diamond Dogs Tour. P-Funk even used KISS&#x27; rehearsal hangar in Newburgh, NY to prepare for the tour. One of the recurring highlights of the show was the arrival of the Mothership, a prop designed by Jules Fisher. Casablanca Records underwrote the $200,000 budget for the show, which featured intergalactic outfits and space-age imagery. Clinton viewed the show as an antidote to the &quot;placebo syndrome&quot; of anodyne mass market music.

The film of P-Funk&#x27;s Halloween 1976 concert at the Houston Summit provides an excellent snapshot of what the Earth Tour production was like. The incantation from &quot;Prelude&quot; from &quot;The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein&quot; plays in darkness as spotlights illuminate a pyramid with the Eye of Providence at its summit, echoing the official seal of the United States:

::Funk upon a time, in the days of the Funkapus, the concept of specially-designed Afronauts capable of funkatizing galaxies was first laid on man-child.
::But was later repossessed, and placed among the secrets of the pyramids until a more positive attitude towards this most sacred phenomenon, Clone Funk, could be acquired...

::...It would wait, along with its co-inhabitants of kings and pharaohs, like sleeping beauties with a kiss that would release them to multiply in the image of the chosen one: Dr Funkenstein...

The show is loosely structured around preparing the pyramid for the resurrection of the Afronauts, with dim oblations paid by members of the troupe during the first half of the set. Occasionally, an animated film based on Overton Loyd&#x27;s album art would be shown during the concerts. The film loosely follows the plot of &quot;Funkentelechy Vs. The Placebo Syndrome&quot; with Starchild and his Bop Gun facing off against Sir Nose and his Snooze Gun. During the film, band members would encourage the audience to shine their flashlights to help the Mothership return. Concertgoers could purchase customized flashlights as part of the tour&#x27;s merchandising.

A half hour later, the band plays &quot;Children of Production&quot; which expands on the clone imagery of &quot;Prelude&quot;. The song is sung by the titular &quot;children&quot; who explain that Dr. Funkenstein &quot;forenotioned the shortcomings of your condition&quot; and cloned the children to &quot;blow the cobwebs out your mind&quot;. The band launches into &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; which explicitly links back to the concepts of &quot;Prelude&quot; in its introduction, &quot;Citizens of the Universe, Recording Angels, we have returned to claim the pyramids, partying on the Mothership.&quot; The band vamps over the closing mantra of the song, &quot;Swing down, sweet chariot. Stop, and let me ride&quot; as guitarist Glenn Goins exhorts the audience to sing along. Other members of the band warn that the mothership will not come if the audience does not do its part. Goins starts to repeatedly wail, &quot;I see the Mothership coming!&quot; as the spaceship finally comes into view, shrouded in smoke and shooting off a fusillade of magnesium sparks.

After the Mothership lands, Clinton appears at the top of a staircase as if he has emerged from the spaceship. He is dressed as Dr. Funkenstein, and the band launches into his titular song where he sings, &quot;...call me the big pill, Dr. Funkenstein, the disco fiend with the monster sound, the cool ghoul with the bump transplant&quot;. Dr. Funkenstein proclaims that he is &quot;preoccupied and dedicated to the preservation of the motion of hips&quot;, to which the Children of Production reply, &quot;We love to funk you, Funkenstein. Your funk is the best!&quot;

The parody of &quot;Swing Down Sweet Chariot&quot; is in line with so much of P-Funk&#x27;s work, which relies heavily on appropriation. That this particular song is reworked to herald the arrival of the Mothership, which offers salvation from an unfunky existence, also aligns with the provenance of the song. Like many spirituals, &quot;Swing Down Sweet Chariot&quot; read superficially about deliverance to Heaven on a chariot like Elijah, but it also contained coded messages about escape to the North. By appropriating the song to score the arrival of the Mothership, it becomes a modern-day chariot sent to deliver the audience not back home to Africa, but to Outer Space. Clinton&#x27;s stage show created a narrative link from the Egyptian pyramids, which often were used to symbolize black pride in a past achievements, to a Utopian vision of existence off-world. P-Funk was telling a tale of once and future greatness to a marginalized audience in a time of intense social upheaval. Their music afforded the black community an alternative to their oppressive environment with tales of the potential for black wealth and power.

== P-Funk mythology in popular culture ==
* The 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; features George Clinton as the Funktipus, the DJ of the in-game funk radio station Bounce FM, which is apparently broadcast from the Party Ship.
* Adult Swim&#x27;s 2010 animated special &quot;&quot; featured psychedelic aliens voiced by George Clinton and Bootsy Collins.
* Playing on the storyline of &quot;Mothership Connection&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Old Gregg&quot; (season 2, episode 5), depicts the Funk as a living, multi-breasted extraterrestrial entity accidentally tossed overboard the Mothership by George Clinton. The episode further contains a sly reference to mythology with offerings of maggot-laced items at the local pub frequented by stodgy local fishermen. Near the episode&#x27;s end, transformed by milk from the Funk, characters Howard Moon and Vince Noir perform a maritime parody of &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot;.
* Filmmaker Yvonne Smith created an animated segment for her documentary, &quot;Parliament-Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove&quot;, featuring a P-Funk mythology-inspired character, &quot;Afronaut.&quot; The character was voiced by comedian Eddie Griffin. The documentary first aired on PBS in October 2005 as part of the &quot;Independent Lens&quot; series.
* In the 2015 episode of Doctor Who, &quot;The Zygon Invasion,&quot; the Doctor refers to himself as &#x27;Doctor Funkenstein&#x27;.

<text>A pipette (sometimes spelled as pipet) is a type of laboratory tool commonly used in chemistry and biology to transport a measured volume of liquid, often as a media dispenser. Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision, from single piece glass pipettes to more complex adjustable or electronic pipettes. Many pipette types work by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and selectively releasing this vacuum to draw up and dispense liquid. Measurement accuracy varies greatly depending on the instrument.

==History==
The first simple pipettes were made of glass, such as Pasteur pipettes. Large pipettes continue to be made of glass; others are made of squeezable plastic for situations where an exact volume is not required.

The first micropipette was patented in 1957 by Dr Heinrich Schnitger (Marburg, Germany). The founder of the company Eppendorf, Dr. Heinrich Netheler, inherited the rights and started the commercial production of micropipettes in 1961.

The adjustable micropipette is a Wisconsin invention developed through interactions among several people, primarily inventor Warren Gilson and Henry Lardy, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Nomenclature==
Although specific names exist for each type of pipette, in practice, any type can be referred to as a &quot;pipette&quot;. Pipettes that dispense less than 1000 μL are sometimes distinguished as micropipettes.

The terms &quot;pipette&quot; and &quot;pipet&quot; are used interchangeably despite minor historical differences in their usage.

==Common pipettes==
=== Air displacement micropipettes ===
Air displacement micropipettes are a type of adjustable micropipette that deliver a measured volume of liquid; depending on size, it could be between about 0.1 μL to 1,000 μL (1 mL). These pipettes require disposable tips that come in contact with the fluid.

These pipettes operate by piston-driven air displacement. A vacuum is generated by the vertical travel of a metal or ceramic piston within an airtight sleeve. As the piston moves upward, driven by the depression of the plunger, a vacuum is created in the space left vacant by the piston. The liquid around the tip moves into this vacuum (along with the air in the tip) and can then be transported and released as necessary. These pipettes are capable of being very precise and accurate. However, since they rely on air displacement, they are subject to inaccuracies caused by the changing environment, particularly temperature and user technique. For these reasons, this equipment must be carefully maintained and calibrated, and users must be trained to exercise correct and consistent technique.

The micropipette was invented and patented in 1960 by Dr. Heinrich Schnitger in Marburg, Germany. Afterwards, the co-founder of the biotechnology company Eppendorf, Dr. Heinrich Netheler, inherited the rights and initiated the global and general use of micropipettes in labs. In 1972, the adjustable micropipette was invented at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by several people, primarily Warren Gilson and Henry Lardy.

Types of air displacement pipettes include:
* adjustable or fixed
* volume handled
* Single-channel, multi-channel or repeater
* conical tips or cylindrical tips
* standard or locking
* manual or electronic
* manufacturer

Irrespective of brand or expense of pipette, every micropipette manufacturer recommends checking the calibration at least every six months, if used regularly. Companies in the drug or food industries are required to calibrate their pipettes quarterly (every three months). Schools which are conducting chemistry classes can have this process annually. Those studying forensics and research where a great deal of testing is commonplace will perform monthly calibrations.
==== Electronic pipette ====

To minimize the possible development of musculoskeletal disorders due to repetitive pipetting, electronic pipettes commonly replace the mechanical version.


===Positive displacement pipette===

These are similar to air displacement pipettes, but are less commonly used and are used to avoid contamination and for volatile or viscous substances at small volumes, such as DNA. The major difference is that the disposable tip is a microsyringe (plastic), composed of a capillary and a piston (movable inner part) which directly displaces the liquid.

===Volumetric pipettes===

Volumetric pipettes or bulb pipette allow the user to measure a volume of solution extremely precisely (precision of four significant figures). These pipettes have a large bulb with a long narrow portion above with a single graduation mark as it is calibrated for a single volume (like a volumetric flask). Typical volumes are 20, 50, and 100 mL. Volumetric pipettes are commonly used to make laboratory solutions from a base stock as well as prepare solutions for titration.

=== Graduated pipettes ===

Graduated pipettes are a type of macropipette consisting of a long tube with a series of graduations, as on a graduated cylinder or burette, to indicate different calibrated volumes. They also require a source of vacuum; in the early days of chemistry and biology, the mouth was used. The safety regulations included the statement: &quot;Never pipette by mouth KCN, NH3, strong acids, bases and mercury salts&quot;. Some pipettes were manufactured with two bubbles between the mouth piece and the solution level line, to protect the chemist from accidental swallowing of the solution.

===Pasteur pipette===
Pasteur pipettes are plastic or glass pipettes used to transfer small amounts of liquids, but are not graduated or calibrated for any particular volume. The bulb is separate from the pipette body. Pasteur pipettes are also called teat pipettes, droppers, eye droppers and chemical droppers.

===Transfer pipettes===

Transfer pipettes, also known as Beral pipettes, are similar to Pasteur pipettes but are made from a single piece of plastic and their bulb can serve as the liquid-holding chamber.
==Specialized pipettes==
===Pipetting syringe===

Pipetting syringes are hand-held devices that combine the functions of volumetric (bulb) pipettes, graduated pipettes, and burettes. They are calibrated to ISO volumetric A grade standards. A glass or plastic pipette tube is used with a thumb-operated piston and PTFE seal which slides within the pipette in a positive displacement operation. Such a device can be used on a wide variety of fluids (aqueous, viscous, and volatile fluids; hydrocarbons; essential oils; and mixtures) in volumes between 0.5 mL and 25 mL. This arrangement provides improvements in precision, handling safety, reliability, economy, and versatility. No disposable tips or pipetting aids are needed with the pipetting syringe.

===Van Slyke pipette===
The Van Slyke pipette, invented by Donald Dexter Van Slyke, is a graduated pipette commonly used in medical technology with serologic pipettes for volumetric analysis.

===Ostwald–Folin pipette===
The Ostwald–Folin pipette, developed by Wilhelm Ostwald and refined by Otto Folin, is a type of volumetric pipette used to measure viscous fluids such as whole blood or serum.
===Winkler–Dennis gas combustion pipette===
The Winkler–Dennis gas combustion pipette, developed by Clemens Winkler and refined by Louis Munroe Dennis, is an apparatus for the controlled reaction of liquids under a mild electric current and a supply of oxygen.

===Glass micropipette===
Glass micropipettes are fabricated in a micropipette puller and are typically used in a micromanipulator. These are used to physically interact with microscopic samples, such as in the procedures of microinjection and patch clamping. Most micropipettes are made of borosilicate, aluminosilicate or quartz with many types and sizes of glass tubing being available. Each of these compositions has unique properties which will determine suitable applications.
====Microfluidic pipette====
A recent introduction into the micropipette field integrates the versatility of microfluidics into a freely positionable pipette platform. At the tip of the device, a localized flow zone is created which allows for constant control of the nanolitre environment, directly in front of the pipette. The pipettes are made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is formed using reactive injection molding. Interfacing of these pipettes using pneumatics enables multiple solutions to be loaded and switched on demand, with solution exchange times of 100ms. This type of pipette was invented by Alar Ainla, and currently situated in the Biophysical Technology Lab. at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.

=== Extremely low volume pipettes ===
A zeptolitre pipette has been developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The pipette is made of a carbon shell, within which is an alloy of gold-germanium. The pipette was used to learn about how crystallization takes place.

=== Pipette aids ===
A variety of devices have been developed for safer, easier, and more efficient pipetting. For example, a motorized pipette controller can aid liquid aspiration or dispensing using volumetric pipettes or graduated pipettes; a tablet can interact in real-time with the pipette and guide a user through a protocol; and a pipette station can help to control the pipette tip immersion depth and improve ergonomics.

===Robots===

Pipette robots are capable of manipulating pipettes just as humans would do.

==Calibration==
Pipette recalibration is an important consideration in laboratories using these devices. It is the act of determining the accuracy of a measuring device by comparison with NIST traceable reference standards. Pipette calibration is essential to ensure that the instrument is working according to expectations and as per the defined regimes or work protocols. Pipette calibration is considered to be a complex affair because it includes many elements of calibration procedure and several calibration protocol options as well as makes and models of pipettes to consider.

==Posture and injuries==

Proper pipetting posture is the most important element in establishing good ergonomic work practices. During repetitive tasks such as pipetting, maintaining body positions that provide a maximum of strength with the least amount of muscular stress is important to minimize the risk of injury. A number of common pipetting techniques have been identified as potentially hazardous due to biomechanical stress factors. Recommendations for corrective pipetting actions, made by various US governmental agencies and ergonomics experts, are presented below.

;Winged elbow pipetting
:Technique: elevated, “winged elbow”. The average human arm weighs approximately 6% of the total body weight. Holding a pipette with the elbow extended (winged elbow) in a static position places the weight of the arm onto the neck and shoulder muscles and reduces blood flow, thereby causing stress and fatigue. Muscle strength is also substantially reduced as arm flexion is increased.
:Corrective action: Position elbows as close to the body as possible, with arms and wrists extended in straight, neutral positions (handshake posture). Keep work items within easy reach to limit extension and elevation of arm. Arm/hand elevation should not exceed 12” from the worksurface.

;Over rotated arm pipetting
:Technique: Over-rotated forearm and wrist. Rotation of the forearm in a supinated position (palm up) and/or wrist flexion increases the fluid pressure in the carpal tunnel. This increased pressure can result in compression of soft tissues like nerves, tendons and blood vessels, causing numbness in the thumb and fingers.
:Corrective action: Forearm rotation angle near 45° pronation (palm down) should be maintained to minimize carpal tunnel pressure during repetitive activity.

;Clenched fist pipetting
:Technique: Tight grip (clenched fist). Hand fatigue results from continuous contact between a hard object and sensitive tissues. This occurs when a firm grip is needed to hold a pipette, such as when jamming on a tip, and results in diminished hand strength.
:Corrective action: Use pipettes with hooks or other attributes that allow a relaxed grip and/or alleviate need to constantly grip the pipette. This will reduce tension in the arm, wrist and hand.

;Thumb plunger pipetting
:Technique: Concentrated area of force (contact stress between a hard object and sensitive tissues). Some devices have plungers and buttons with limited surface areas, requiring a great deal of force to be expended by the thumb or other finger in a concentrated area.
:Corrective action: Use pipettes with large contoured or rounded plungers and buttons. This will disperse the pressure used to operate the pipette across the entire surface of the thumb or finger, reducing contact pressure to acceptable levels.

;Incorrect posture can have a strong impact on available strength arm strength pipetting
:Technique: elevated arm. Muscle strength is substantially reduced when arm flexion is increased. 
:Corrective action: Keep work items within easy reach to limit extension and elevation of arm. Arm/hand elevation should also not exceed 12” from the worksurface.

;Elbow strength pipetting
:Technique: Elbow flexion or abduction. Arm strength diminishes as elbow posture is deviated from a 90° position.
:Corrective action: Keep forearm and hand elevation within 12” of the worksurface, which will allow the elbow to remain near a 90° position.

Unlike traditional axial pipettes, ergonomic pipetting can affect posture and prevent common pipetting injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other musculoskeletal disorders. To be &quot;ergonomically correct&quot; significant changes to traditional pipetting postures are essential, like:
minimizing forearm and wrist rotations, keeping a low arm and elbow height and relaxing the shoulders and upper arms.
== Pipette stand ==
Typically the pipettes are vertically stored on holder called pipette stands. In case of electronic pipettes, such stands can recharge their batteries. The most advanced pipette stands can directly control electronic pipettes.

== Alternatives ==
An alternative technology, especially for transferring small volumes (micro and nano litre range) is acoustic droplet ejection.

<text>Cognition is the &quot;mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses&quot;. It encompasses all aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as: perception, attention, thought, imagination, intelligence, the formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem-solving and decision-making, comprehension and production of language. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge to discover new knowledge.

Cognitive processes are analyzed from very different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, musicology, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, biology, systemics, logic, and computer science. These and other approaches to the analysis of cognition (such as embodied cognition) are synthesized in the developing field of cognitive science, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cognition&quot; dates back to the 15th century, where it meant &quot;thinking and awareness&quot;. The term comes from the Latin noun (&#x27;examination&#x27;, &#x27;learning&#x27;, or &#x27;knowledge&#x27;), derived from the verb , a compound of (&#x27;with&#x27;) and (&#x27;know&#x27;). The latter half, , itself is a cognate of a Greek verb, &quot;&quot; ().

== Early studies ==
Despite the word &quot;cognitive&quot; itself dating back to the 15th century, attention to &quot;cognitive processes&quot; came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, beginning with Aristotle (384–322 BCE) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence, that is, scientific information that is gathered through observation and conscientious experimentation. Two millennia later, the groundwork for modern concepts of cognition was laid during the Enlightenment by thinkers such as John Locke and Dugald Stewart who sought to develop a model of the mind in which ideas were acquired, remembered and manipulated.

During the very early nineteenth century cognitive models were developed both in philosophy—particularly by authors writing about the philosophy of mind—and within medicine, especially by physicians seeking to understand how to cure madness. In Britain, these models were studied in the academy by scholars such as James Sully at University College London, and they were even used by politicians when considering the national Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75).

As psychology emerged as a burgeoning field of study in Europe, whilst also gaining a following in America, scientists such as Wilhelm Wundt, Herman Ebbinghaus, Mary Whiton Calkins, and William James would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition.

=== Early theorists ===
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) emphasized the notion of what he called &quot;introspection&quot;: examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful with describing their feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific. Though Wundt&#x27;s contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be too subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words (for instance, &#x27;EAS&#x27;). He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them. Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of the same. Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a &quot;learning curve&quot; and a &quot;forgetting curve&quot;. His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory 

Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on human memory capacity. A common theory, called the recency effect, can be attributed to the studies that she conducted. The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Calkin&#x27;s theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus.

William James (1842–1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt&#x27;s emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus&#x27; use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James&#x27; most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot; which preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.

René Descartes (1596–1650) was a seventeenth-century philosopher who came up with the phrase &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot;, which means &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; He took a philosophical approach to the study of cognition and the mind, with his Meditations he wanted people to meditate along with him to come to the same conclusions as he did but in their own free cognition.

== Psychology ==

In psychology, the term &quot;cognition&quot; is usually used within an information processing view of an individual&#x27;s psychological functions, and such is the same in cognitive engineering. In the study of social cognition, a branch of social psychology, the term is used to explain attitudes, attribution, and group dynamics. However, psychological research within the field of cognitive science has also suggested an embodied approach to understanding cognition. Contrary to the traditional computationalist approach, embodied cognition emphasizes the body&#x27;s significant role in the acquisition and development of cognitive capabilities.

Human cognition is conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as memory, association, concept formation, pattern recognition, language, attention, perception, action, problem solving, and mental imagery. Traditionally, emotion was not thought of as a cognitive process, but now much research is being undertaken to examine the cognitive psychology of emotion; research is also focused on one&#x27;s awareness of one&#x27;s own strategies and methods of cognition, which is called metacognition. The concept of cognition has gone through several revisions through the development of disciplines within psychology.

Psychologists initially understood cognition governing human action as information processing. This was a movement known as cognitivism in the 1950s, emerging after the Behaviorist movement viewed cognition as a form of behavior. Cognitivism approached cognition as a form of computation, viewing the mind as a machine and consciousness as an executive function. However; post cognitivism began to emerge in the 1990s as the development of cognitive science presented theories that highlighted the necessity of cognitive action as embodied, extended, and producing dynamic processes in the mind. The development of Cognitive psychology arose as psychology from different theories, and so began exploring these dynamics concerning mind and environment, starting a movement from these prior dualist paradigms that prioritized cognition as systematic computation or exclusively behavior.

=== Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development ===

For years, sociologists and psychologists have conducted studies on cognitive development, i.e. the construction of human thought or mental processes.

Jean Piaget was one of the most important and influential people in the field of developmental psychology. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do &quot;abstract symbolic reasoning&quot;. His work can be compared to Lev Vygotsky, Sigmund Freud, and Erik Erikson who were also great contributors in the field of developmental psychology. Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children, having studied his own three children and their intellectual development, from which he would come to a theory of cognitive development that describes the developmental stages of childhood.

=== Beginning of cognition ===
Studies on cognitive development have also been conducted in children beginning from the embryonal period to understand when cognition appears and what environmental attributes stimulate the construction of human thought or mental processes. Research shows the intentional engagement of fetuses with the environment, demonstrating cognitive achievements. However, organisms with simple reflexes cannot cognize the environment alone because the environment is the cacophony of stimuli (electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations). Their sensation is too limited by the noise to solve the cue problem–the relevant stimulus cannot overcome the noise magnitude if it passes through the senses (see the binding problem). Fetuses need external help to stimulate their nervous system in choosing the relevant sensory stimulus for grasping the perception of objects. The Shared intentionality approach proposes a plausible explanation of perception development in this earlier stage. Initially, Michael Tomasello introduced the psychological construct of Shared intentionality, highlighting its contribution to cognitive development from birth. This primary interaction provides unaware collaboration in mother-child dyads for environmental learning. Later, Igor Val Danilov developed this notion, expanding it to the intrauterine period and clarifying the neurophysiological processes underlying Shared intentionality. According to the Shared intentionality approach, the mother shares the essential sensory stimulus of the actual cognitive problem with the child. By sharing this stimulus, the mother provides a template for developing the young organism&#x27;s nervous system.

Recent findings in research on child cognitive development and advances in inter-brain neuroscience experiments have made the above proposition plausible. Based on them, the shared intentionality hypothesis introduced the notion of pre-perceptual communication in the mother-fetus communication model due to nonlocal neuronal coupling. This nonlocal coupling model refers to communication between two organisms through the copying of the adequate ecological dynamics by biological systems indwelling one environmental context, where a naive actor (Fetus) replicates information from an experienced actor (Mother) due to intrinsic processes of these dynamic systems (embodied information) but without interacting through sensory signals. The Mother&#x27;s heartbeats (a low-frequency oscillator) modulate relevant local neuronal networks in specific subsystems of both her and the nervous system of the fetus due to the effect of the interference of the low-frequency oscillator (Mother heartbeats) and already exhibited gamma activity in these neuronal networks (interference in physics is the combination of two or more electromagnetic waveforms to form a resultant wave). Therefore, the subliminal perception in a fetus emerges due to Shared intentionality with the mother that stimulates cognition in this organism even before birth.

Another crucial question in understanding the beginning of cognition is memory storage about the relevant ecological dynamics by the naive nervous system (i.e., memorizing the ecological condition of relevant sensory stimulus) at the molecular level – an engram. Evidence derived using optical imaging, molecular-genetic and optogenetic techniques in conjunction with appropriate behavioural analyses continues to offer support for the idea that changing the strength of connections between neurons is one of the major mechanisms by which engrams are stored in the brain.

Two (or more) possible mechanisms of cognition can involve both quantum effects and synchronization of brain structures due to electromagnetic interference.

=== Common types of tests on human cognition ===
====Serial position====
The &quot;Serial-position effect&quot; is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information at the beginning of the sequence, called the &quot;primacy effect&quot;, and information at the end of the sequence, called the &quot;recency effect&quot;. Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.

====Word superiority====
The &quot;word superiority effect experiment&quot; presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40 ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. In theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.

====Brown–Peterson====
In the &quot;Brown–Peterson cohomology experiment&quot;, participants are briefly presented with a trigram and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words is in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human short-term memory.

====Memory span====
During the &quot;memory span experiment&quot;, each subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.

====Visual search====
In one version of the &quot;visual search experiment&quot;, a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the &quot;featured&quot; search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the &quot;conjunctive&quot; search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.

====Knowledge representation====
The semantic network of knowledge representation systems have been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the leveling and sharpening of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by Bartlett. The semantic differential used factor analysis to determine the main meanings of words, finding that the ethical value of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in free recall. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in George Miller&#x27;s WordNet. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with computational systems such as neural networks, latent semantic analysis (LSA), Bayesian analysis, and multidimensional factor analysis. The meanings of words are studied by all the disciplines of cognitive science.

== Metacognition ==
== Improving cognition ==
===Physical exercise===
Aerobic and anaerobic exercise have been studied concerning cognitive improvement. There appear to be short-term increases in attention span, verbal and visual memory in some studies. However, the effects are transient and diminish over time, after cessation of the physical activity. People with Parkinson&#x27;s disease has also seen improved cognition while cycling, while pairing it with other cognitive tasks.

===Dietary supplements===
Studies evaluating phytoestrogen, blueberry supplementation and antioxidants showed minor increases in cognitive function after supplementation but no significant effects compared to placebo. Another study on the effects of herbal and dietary supplements on cognition in menopause show that soy and Ginkgo biloba supplementation could improve women&#x27;s cognition.

===Pleasurable social stimulation===
Exposing individuals with cognitive impairment (i.e. dementia) to daily activities designed to stimulate thinking and memory in a social setting, seems to improve cognition. Although study materials are small, and larger studies need to confirm the results, the effect of social cognitive stimulation seems to be larger than the effects of some drug treatments.

===Other methods===
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been shown to improve cognition in individuals without dementia 1 month after treatment session compared to before treatment. The effect was not significantly larger compared to placebo. Computerized cognitive training, utilizing a computer based training regime for different cognitive functions has been examined in a clinical setting but no lasting effects has been shown.

<text>An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is mostly shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, also known as sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as . The word &quot;aqueous&quot; (which comes from &quot;aqua&quot;) means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in, water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. Since water is frequently used as the solvent in experiments, the word solution refers to an aqueous solution, unless the solvent is specified.

A &quot;non-aqueous solution&quot; is a solution in which the solvent is a liquid, but is not water.

== Characteristics ==
Substances that are &quot;hydrophobic&quot; (&#x27;water-fearing&#x27;) do not dissolve well in water, whereas those that are &quot;hydrophilic&quot; (&#x27;water-friendly&#x27;) do. An example of a hydrophilic substance is sodium chloride. In an aqueous solution the hydrogen ions () and hydroxide ions () are in Arrhenius balance ( = &quot;Kw&quot; = 1 x 10−14 at 298 K).
Acids and bases are aqueous solutions, as part of their Arrhenius definitions. An example of an Arrhenius acid is hydrogen chloride (HCl) because of its dissociation of the hydrogen ion when dissolved in water. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is an Arrhenius base because it dissociates the hydroxide ion when it is dissolved in water.

Aqueous solutions may contain, especially in the alkaline zone or subjected to radiolysis, hydrated atomic hydrogen and hydrated electrons.

== Electrolytes ==
Aqueous solutions that conduct electric current efficiently contain strong electrolytes, while ones that conduct poorly are considered to have weak electrolytes. Those strong electrolytes are substances that are completely ionized in water, whereas the weak electrolytes exhibit only a small degree of ionization in water. The ability for ions to move freely through the solvent is a characteristic of an aqueous strong electrolyte solution. The solutes in a weak electrolyte solution are present as ions, but only in a small amount.

Nonelectrolytes are substances that dissolve in water yet maintain their molecular integrity (do not dissociate into ions). Examples include sugar, urea, glycerol, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).

== Reactions ==
Reactions in aqueous solutions are usually metathesis reactions. Metathesis reactions are another term for double-displacement; that is, when a cation displaces to form an ionic bond with the other anion. The cation bonded with the latter anion will dissociate and bond with the other anion.

A common metathesis reaction in aqueous solutions is a precipitation reaction. This reaction occurs when two aqueous strong electrolyte solutions mix and produce an insoluble solid, also known as a precipitate. The ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether the substance can match or exceed the strong attractive forces that water molecules generate between themselves. If the substance lacks the ability to dissolve in water, the molecules form a precipitate.

When writing the equations of precipitation reactions, it is essential to determine the precipitate. To determine the precipitate, one must consult a chart of solubility. Soluble compounds are aqueous, while insoluble compounds are the precipitate. There may not always be a precipitate. Complete ionic equations and net ionic equations are used to show dissociated ions in metathesis reactions. When performing calculations regarding the reacting of one or more aqueous solutions, in general one must know the concentration, or molarity, of the aqueous solutions.

<text>Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container. Impurities in the original water that do not boil below or near the boiling point of water remain in the original container. Thus, distilled water is a type of purified water.

==History==

Drinking water has been distilled from seawater since at least about AD 200, when the process was clearly described by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Its history predates this, as a passage in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorologica&quot; refers to the distillation of water. Captain Israel Williams of the &quot;Friendship&quot; (1797) improvised a way to distill water, which he described in his journal.

==Applications==
In chemical and biological laboratories, as well as in industry, in some appliances, deionized water or reverse osmosis water can be used instead of distilled water as a cheaper alternative.
If exceptionally high-purity water is required, double distilled water is used.

In general, non-purified water could cause or interfere with chemical reactions as well as leave mineral deposits after boiling away. One method of removing impurities from water and other fluids is distillation.

For example, ions commonly found in tap water would drastically reduce lifespans of lead–acid batteries used in cars and trucks. These ions are not acceptable in automotive cooling systems because they corrode internal engine components and deplete typical antifreeze anti-corrosion additives.

Any non-volatile or mineral components in water are left behind when the water evaporates or boils away. Water escaping as steam, for example from a boiler of heating system or steam engine, leaves behind any dissolved materials leading to mineral deposits known as boiler scale.
Low-volume humidifiers such as cigar humidors can use distilled water to avoid mineral deposits.

Certain biological applications require controlled impurities, especially in experiments. For example, distilling water to be added to an aquarium would remove known and unknown non-volatile contaminants. Living things require specific minerals; adding distilled water to an ecosystem, such as an aquarium, would reduce the concentration of these minerals. Fish and other living things that have evolved to survive in lakes and oceans should be expected to thrive at mineral ranges found in their original habitat.

Controlled impurities as well as equipment reliability are critically important in medical applications where, for example, distilled water is used in continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to humidify air for breathing. Distilled water will not leave contaminants behind when the humidifier in the CPAP machine evaporates the water.

It is also possible for brewers to blend distilled water with hard water to mimic the soft waters of Plzeň.

Another application was to increase the density of the air to assist early airplane jet engines during takeoff in &#x27;hot and high&#x27; atmospheric conditions, as was used on the early Boeing 707.

===Use in steam irons===
Distilled water can be used in steam irons for pressing clothes to minimize the build-up of limescale in hard water areas shortening the lifespan of steam irons. Some steam irons have built in filters to remove minerals from the water meaning standard tap water can be used.

==Equipment to distill water==
Until World War II, distilling seawater to produce fresh water was time-consuming and expensive in fuel. The saying was: &quot;It takes one gallon of fuel to make one gallon of fresh water.&quot; Shortly before the war, Dr. R. V. Kleinschmidt developed a compression still, which became known as the Kleinschmidt still, for extracting fresh water from seawater or contaminated water. By compressing the steam produced by boiling water, of fresh water could be extracted from seawater for every gallon () of fuel used. During World War II this equipment became standard on Allied ships and on trailer mounts for armies. This method was in widespread use in ships and portable water distilling units during the latter half of the century. Modern vessels now use flash-type evaporators to boil seawater, heating the water to between and evaporating the water in a vacuum; this is then collected as condensation before being stored.

Solar stills can be relatively simple to design and build, with very cheap materials.

Distilling water with commercial equipment will almost completely remove all dissolved minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, fluoride, potassium, iron, and zinc leaving a TDS of &lt;1PPM, and reduce its electrical conductivity to &lt;2 μS/cm. Typical tap water has electrical conductivity in the range of 200–800 μS/cm. The pH of distilled water is always slightly lower than 7 (neutral) because distilled water will absorb small amounts of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere which forms traces of carbonic acid and lowers the pH of distilled water to around 5.8 pH (very weakly acidic).

== Drinking distilled water ==

Bottled distilled water can usually be found in supermarkets or pharmacies, and home water distillers are available as well. Water purification, such as distillation, is especially important in regions where water resources or tap water is not suitable for ingesting without boiling or chemical treatment.

Municipal water supplies almost always contain trace components at levels which are regulated to be safe for consumption. Some other components such as trace levels of aluminium may result from the treatment process. Fluoride and other ions are not removed through conventional water filter treatments. However, distillation eliminates most impurities.

Distilled water is also used for drinking water in arid seaside areas lacking sufficient freshwater, via desalination of seawater.

==Health effects==
Distillation removes all minerals from water. This results in demineralised water, which has not been proven to be healthier than drinking water. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralised water in 1982, and its experiments in humans found that demineralised water increased diuresis and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium, and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10 mg/L with 20–30 mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20 mg/L minimum and a 40–80 mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2–4 mmol/L. At water hardness above 5 mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. For fluoride the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5–1.0 mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5 mg/L to avoid dental fluorosis.

Water filtration and distillation devices are becoming increasingly common in households. Municipal water supplies often have minerals added or have trace impurities at levels which are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as volatile organic compounds, fluoride, and an estimated &gt;75,000 other chemical compounds are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.

The drinking of distilled water as a replacement for drinking water has been both advocated and discouraged for health reasons. Distilled water lacks minerals and ions, such as calcium, that play key roles in biological functions, such as in nervous system homeostasis, and are normally found in potable water. The lack of naturally occurring minerals in distilled water has raised some concerns. The &quot;Journal of General Internal Medicine&quot; published a study on the mineral contents of different waters available in the US. The study found that &quot;drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of calcium, magnesium, and sodium and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals&quot;. It encouraged people to &quot;check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs&quot;. Since distilled water is devoid of minerals, mineral intake through diet is needed to maintain good health.

The consumption of &quot;hard&quot; water (water with minerals) is associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects. As noted in the &quot;American Journal of Epidemiology&quot;, consumption of hard drinking water is negatively correlated with atherosclerotic heart disease.

<text>Harvey Washington Wiley (October 18, 1844 – June 30, 1930) was an American chemist who advocated successfully for the passage of the landmark Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and subsequently worked at the Good Housekeeping Institute laboratories. He was the first commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration. Wiley’s advocacy for stricter food and drug regulations indirectly contributed to Coca-Cola’s decision to remove cocaine from its formula in the early 20th century. This move addressed public health concerns but has drawn modern criticism for its impact on drug policy perceptions.

In 1904 Wiley was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1910 he was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute.

==Early life and career==

Wiley was born on October 18, 1844, in a log farmhouse in Republican Township, in Jefferson County, Indiana, the son of a lay Presbyterian preacher and farmer, Preston Pritchard Wiley and Lucinda Maxwell. The sixth of seven children, Wiley was raised on a 125-acre farm with a creek that emptied into the Wabash River, a tributary of the Ohio River. Wiley&#x27;s parents were conductors on the Underground Railroad as the southernmost point in Indiana, across the river from slave-owning Kentucky.

He enrolled in nearby Hanover College in 1863 and studied for about one year until he enlisted with the Union Army in 1864, during the American Civil War. He finished the war as a corporal in Company I of the 137th Indiana Infantry Regiment. He returned to Hanover in 1865, majored in the humanities and was a top graduate (A.B.) in 1867. Wiley earned his M.D. from Indiana Medical College in 1871. He was professor of Greek and Latin at Butler College, Indianapolis, 1868–70.

After earning his medical degree Wiley taught chemistry at the Medical College, where he led Indiana&#x27;s first laboratory course in chemistry beginning in 1873. At Harvard University, he was awarded a B.S. degree in 1873 after only a few months of intense effort. He then accepted a faculty position in chemistry at Purdue University, which held its first classes in 1874. He was also appointed state chemist of Indiana.

In 1878, Wiley went to Germany where he attended the lectures of August Wilhelm von Hofmann—the celebrated German discoverer of organic tar derivatives like aniline. While there, Wiley was elected to the prestigious German Chemical Society founded by Hofmann. Wiley spent most of his time in the Imperial Food Laboratory in Bismarck working with Eugene Sell, mastering the use of the polariscope and studying sugar chemistry. Upon his return to Purdue, Wiley was asked by the Indiana State Board of Health to analyze the sugars and syrups on sale in the state to detect any adulteration. He spent his last years at Purdue studying sorghum culture and sugar chemistry, working to help develop a strong domestic sugar industry. His first published paper in 1881 discussed the adulteration of sugar with glucose.

Wiley commissioned a medical journalist, Wedderburn, to write out his findings in a manner understandable to public and politicians. Areas of concern included Embalmed Milk (adding formaldehyde to milk); adding copper sulphate to tinned French beans to make them green etc. These problems were mainly associated with getting food to large city populations.

The embalmed beef scandal relating to the troop rations in the American-Cuban war of 1898 finally brought the industry to the public interest.

==Government career==
Wiley was offered the position of Chief Chemist in the United States Department of Agriculture by George Loring, the Commissioner of Agriculture, in 1882. Loring was seeking to replace his chemist with someone who would employ a more objective approach to the study of sorghum, whose potential as a sugar source was far from proven. Wiley accepted the offer after being passed over for the presidency of Purdue, allegedly because he was &quot;too young and too jovial&quot;, unorthodox in his religious belief, and also a bachelor. Wiley brought to Washington a practical knowledge of agriculture, a sympathetic approach to the problems of agricultural industry and an untapped talent for public relations.

After assisting Congress in their earliest questions regarding the safety of the chemical preservatives then being employed in foods, Wiley was appropriated $5,000 in 1902 to study the effects of a diet including various preservatives, on human volunteers. These &quot;poison squad&quot; studies drew national attention to the need for a federal food and drug law. These tests were called Hygienic Table Trials. The subjects received $5 a month and free food to be systematically poisoned. 12 volunteers were chosen. One additive was added per trial but he struggled to find non-adulterated products to add the poisons to. First to be tested was borax which tightened old meat which was starting to decompose. The borax was fed to the men in meat and dairy products. Some were given borax and some were not in order to control the study. The volunteers became known as The Poison Squad.

Wiley was originally aiming just to get foods labelled to correctly show their additives. However, he concluded that certain chemicals should be banned. The food industry rose in protest. The proposed Food Bill of 1902 failed to even register a vote, being defeated by lobbyists. He sought the support of female groups, not due to their direct political influence (as they still had none) but due to the domestic pressure which they could exert. The campaign spilled into wider community health and welfare, calling for public (municipal) control of all water supplies and sewer systems. His campaign gained weight when Fannie Farmer joined and paralleled the call for &quot;pure food&quot;.

Heinz were one of the first companies to join the push for pure food and changed their recipe for tomato ketchup in 1902 to replace chemical preservatives with vinegar and introducing very hygienic practices into their factories.

In 1905, the Poison Squad was set to work on salicylic acid which was used in multiple products. It was found to cause bleeding of the stomach.

In December 1905, Wiley organized a meeting of more progressive food producers (including Heinz) plus female activists with Theodore Roosevelt to lobby for safe food legislation. Upton Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;The Jungle&quot; revealed inside information from the slaughterhouses of Chicago which caused great consternation. This non-scientific expose of the canned meat industry reminded Roosevelt of his experiences with shoddy meat in Cuba in 1898. In June 1906 this led to the passing of the Meat Inspection Act (controlling slaughterhouses) and the Food and Drug Act (looking at prohibition of additives). 

The law allowed new chemicals to be added to the list of banned additives. The first one to target was Formaldehyde which in 1907 was found to be highly dangerous despite widespread use.

President Roosevelt brought one of his heroes, Ira Remsen, in to monitor Wiley. This was bound to create conflict as Wiley had raised concerns regarding the president&#x27;s use of saccharin which had been invented by Remsen. This was intended to curb Wiley who had been having large shipments of food and additives condemned.

Wiley soon became a crusader and coalition builder in support of national food and drug regulation. His work, and that of Alice Lakey, spurred one million American women to write to the White House in support of the Pure Food and Drug Act.

Wiley was nicknamed &quot;Father of the Pure Food and Drugs Act&quot; when it became law in 1906. He wrote two editions of &quot;Foods and Their Adulteration&quot; (1907 and 1911), which described for an audience of non-specialists the history, preparation and subsequent adulteration of basic foodstuffs. He was a founding father of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, and left a broad and substantial legacy to the American pure food movement as its &quot;crusading chemist&quot;.

Wiley targeted Coca-Cola in 1909, not because of its use of cocaine which had ceased a few years before, but because of the excessive use of caffeine which was proven to be addictive. The fears were particularly regarding children. This went to trial in 1911 where Coca-Cola argued it could be drunk with no ill effects whether addictive or not. The courts decided that Wiley had gone too far and Coca-Cola were found not guilty of breaching the Food and Drug Act: see &quot;United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola&quot;. President Taft was pressured into firing Wiley but the press supported his continuing.

The enforcement of the federal Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry, instead of the Department of Commerce or the Department of the Interior, which was a tribute to the scientific qualifications that the Bureau of Chemistry brought to its studies of food and drug adulteration, and misbranding. The first food and drug inspectors were hired to complement the work of the laboratory scientists, and an inspection program was launched which revolutionized the country&#x27;s food supply within the first decade under the new federal law.

Wiley&#x27;s tenure generated controversy over his administration of the 1906 statute. Concerns over chemical preservatives, which had not been specifically addressed in the law, continued to be problematic. The Secretary of Agriculture appointed a Referee Board of Consulting Scientists, headed by Ira Remsen of Johns Hopkins University, to repeat Wiley&#x27;s human trials of preservatives. The use of saccharin, bleached flour, caffeine, and benzoate of soda were all important issues which had to be settled by the courts in the early days under the new law.

Under Wiley&#x27;s leadership, however, the Bureau of Chemistry grew significantly in strength and stature after assuming responsibility for enforcement of the 1906 Act. Between 1906 and 1912, Wiley&#x27;s staff expanded from 110 to 146. Appropriations, which had been $155,000 in 1906, were $963,780 in 1912. The Bureau moved into its own building and used the healing symbol of Aesculapius&#x27;s staff, or Ophiuchus. In 1911, his enemies urged his dismissal from the Department of Agriculture over the technicality that an expert in his department had been paid above the legal rate. But later in the year, President William Howard Taft wrote a letter that fully exonerated Wiley.

On March 15, 1912, Wiley resigned his leadership of the Chemistry Bureau because, from nearly the beginning, he had been antagonized in the enforcement of the Pure Food And Drugs Act, and he had seen the fundamental principles of that act either paralyzed or discredited. Taft expressed his regret at Wiley&#x27;s resignation and Agriculture Secretary James Wilson spoke highly of how &quot;valuable&quot; Wiley had been, and in turn, Wiley thanked Wilson for the &quot;personal kindness and regard shown him.&quot;

==Work at &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;==
After his resignation from government work in 1912, Wiley took over the laboratories of &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; Magazine, where he continued his work on behalf of the consuming public. Director, Bureau of Foods, Sanitation and Health was Wiley&#x27;s official title. His disapprobation of “drugged” products included cola drinks; he warned against the caffeine in them vehemently. In a famous action he brought against The Coca-Cola Company in 1911, he contended that it was illegal to use the name Coca-Cola when there was no actual cocaine in the drink, and also that it was illegal for it to contain caffeine as an additive. Perversely, this was as much as to say that the product ought to have contained cocaine and not caffeine. Still, the case was a landmark in developing standards for truth in labeling. The beverage continued to be brewed, even as of late September 2016, with de-cocaine-ized coca leaves and cola nuts.

He remained with &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; for 18 years.

He was famed for giving his &quot;seal of approval&quot; to multiple products, a concept which has been widely reused. The idea, which he established, is now known as the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

==Death==

Harvey Wiley died at his home in Washington, D.C., on June 30, 1930, the 24th anniversary of the signing of the Pure Food and Drug law.

He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery with his wife, Anna Kelton Wiley (1877–1964), whom he married in 1911. His grave is inscribed &quot;Father of the Pure Food Law&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Liberty Ship S.S. &quot;Harvey W. Wiley&quot; was one of 2751 World War II Liberty Ships built between 1941 and 1945. She was a tanker laid down September 15, 1943, launched October 15, 1943, sold by the government in 1947, and scrapped in 1969.

The U.S. Post Office issued a 3-cent postage stamp in Wiley&#x27;s honor on June 27, 1956, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the 1906 Act.

The Harvey W. Wiley Award is AOAC International&#x27;s most prestigious scientific award; it was established in 1956 and has been presented annually since 1957 to a scientist (or group of scientists) who have made an outstanding contribution to analytical method development in an area of interest to AOAC International. AOAC International was founded in 1884 as the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists. Wiley was a founding member, President in 1886, Secretary from 1889 to 1912, and Honorary President until his death in 1930.

Wiley has several buildings named in his honor. He was honored by Hanover College with a &quot;Wiley Residence Hall&quot; inaugurated in 1956. He was also honored by Purdue University in 1958 when the &quot;Harvey W. Wiley Residence Hall&quot; was opened northwest of the main academic campus. The FDA&#x27;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) operations are located in the Harvey W. Wiley Federal Building in College Park, Maryland, which was constructed in 2001 and named after Wiley in 2002.

His birthplace near Kent is commemorated with an Indiana historic marker sign placed at the corner of IN-256 and CR-850W. The marker was sponsored by the Association of Food and Drug Officials and erected in 1981.

French State Leaders named him a Chevalier of the Order of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1909.

The Harvey Washington Wiley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry is an honor established through the chemistry department at Purdue University. The position has been occupied since 1997 by Dr. Dale W. Margerum.

The home he built at Somerset, Maryland, in 1893, the Wiley-Ringland House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Wiley&#x27;s achievements are the subject of Deborah Blum&#x27;s 2018 nonfiction book &quot;The Poison Squad: One Chemist&#x27;s Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century&quot;, which was the basis for &quot;The Poison Squad&quot;, a documentary film that first aired on &quot;American Experience&quot; on January 28, 2020.

Some libertarian philosophers cite Wiley&#x27;s work as a cornerstone to increasing the breadth and depth of state coercion in the United States, arguing that freedom in medicine, food, and the right to bodily self-ownership began a sharp decline with his measures.

<doc id="106256" wikidata="Q845326" url="?curid=106256" title="Allosteric regulation">
<text>In the fields of biochemistry and pharmacology an allosteric regulator (or allosteric modulator) is a substance that binds to a site on an enzyme or receptor distinct from the active site, resulting in a conformational change that alters the protein&#x27;s activity, either enhancing or inhibiting its function. In contrast, substances that bind directly to an enzyme&#x27;s active site or the binding site of the endogenous ligand of a receptor are called orthosteric regulators or modulators.

The site to which the effector binds is termed the &quot;allosteric site&quot; or &quot;regulatory site&quot;. Allosteric sites allow effectors to bind to the protein, often resulting in a conformational change and/or a change in protein dynamics. Effectors that enhance the protein&#x27;s activity are referred to as &quot;allosteric activators&quot;, whereas those that decrease the protein&#x27;s activity are called &quot;allosteric inhibitors&quot;.

Allosteric regulations are a natural example of control loops, such as feedback from downstream products or feedforward from upstream substrates. Long-range allostery is especially important in cell signaling. Allosteric regulation is also particularly important in the cell&#x27;s ability to adjust enzyme activity.

The term &quot;allostery&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;allos&quot; (), &quot;other&quot;, and &quot;stereos&quot; (), &quot;solid (object)&quot;. This is in reference to the fact that the regulatory site of an allosteric protein is physically distinct from its active site. Allostery contrasts with substrate presentation which requires no conformational change for an enzyme&#x27;s activation. The term &quot;orthostery&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek orthós () meaning “straight”, “upright”, “right” or “correct”.

== Ortho vs. allosteric inhibitors ==

=== Orthosteric ===

# Binding Site: Orthosteric inhibitors bind directly to the enzyme&#x27;s active site, where the substrate normally binds.
# Mechanism of Action: By occupying the active site, these inhibitors prevent the substrate from binding, thereby directly blocking the enzyme&#x27;s catalytic activity.
# Competitive Inhibition: Most orthosteric inhibitors compete with the substrate for the active site, which means their effectiveness can be reduced if substrate concentration increases.

=== Allosteric ===

# Binding Site: Allosteric inhibitors bind to a site on the enzyme that is distinct and separate from the active site, known as the allosteric site.
# Mechanism of Action: Binding to the allosteric site induces a conformational change in the enzyme that can either reduce the affinity of the active site for the substrate or alter the enzyme&#x27;s catalytic activity. This indirect interference can inhibit the enzyme&#x27;s function even if the substrate is present.
# Non-Competitive Inhibition: Allosteric inhibitors often exhibit non-competitive inhibition, meaning their inhibitory effect is not dependent on the substrate concentration.

== Models ==

Many allosteric effects can be explained by the &quot;concerted&quot; MWC model put forth by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux, or by the sequential model (also known as the KNF model) described by Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer. Both postulate that protein subunits exist in one of two conformations, tensed (T) or relaxed (R), and that relaxed subunits bind substrate more readily than those in the tense state. The two models differ most in their assumptions about subunit interaction and the preexistence of both states. For proteins in which subunits exist in more than two conformations, the allostery landscape model described by Cuendet, Weinstein, and LeVine, can be used. Allosteric regulation may be facilitated by the evolution of large-scale, low-energy conformational changes, which enables long-range allosteric interaction between distant binding sites.

=== Concerted model ===

The concerted model of allostery, also referred to as the symmetry model or MWC model, postulates that enzyme subunits are connected in such a way that a conformational change in one subunit is necessarily conferred to all other subunits. Thus, all subunits must exist in the same conformation. The model further holds that, in the absence of any ligand (substrate or otherwise), the equilibrium favors one of the conformational states, T or R. The equilibrium can be shifted to the R or T state through the binding of one ligand (the allosteric effector or ligand) to a site that is different from the active site

=== Sequential model ===

The sequential model of allosteric regulation holds that subunits are not connected in such a way that a conformational change in one induces a similar change in the others. Thus, all enzyme subunits do not necessitate the same conformation. Moreover, the sequential model dictates that molecules of a substrate bind via an induced fit protocol. While such an induced fit converts a subunit from the tensed state to relaxed state, it does not propagate the conformational change to adjacent subunits. Instead, substrate-binding at one subunit only slightly alters the structure of other subunits so that their binding sites are more receptive to substrate. To summarize:

* subunits need not exist in the same conformation
* molecules of substrate bind via induced-fit protocol
* conformational changes are not propagated to all subunits

=== Morpheein model ===

The morpheein model of allosteric regulation is a dissociative concerted model.

A morpheein is a homo-oligomeric structure that can exist as an ensemble of physiologically significant and functionally different alternate quaternary assemblies. Transitions between alternate morpheein assemblies involve oligomer dissociation, conformational change in the dissociated state, and reassembly to a different oligomer. The required oligomer disassembly step differentiates the morpheein model for allosteric regulation from the classic MWC and KNF models.

Porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) is the prototype morpheein.

=== Ensemble models ===

Ensemble models of allosteric regulation enumerate an allosteric system&#x27;s statistical ensemble as a function of its potential energy function, and then relate specific statistical measurements of allostery to specific energy terms in the energy function (such as an intermolecular salt bridge between two domains). Ensemble models like the ensemble allosteric model and allosteric Ising model assume that each domain of the system can adopt two states similar to the MWC model. The allostery landscape model introduced by Cuendet, Weinstein, and LeVine allows for the domains to have any number of states and the contribution of a specific molecular interaction to a given allosteric coupling can be estimated using a rigorous set of rules. Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to estimate a system&#x27;s statistical ensemble so that it can be analyzed with the allostery landscape model.

== Allosteric modulation ==

Allosteric modulation is used to alter the activity of molecules and enzymes in biochemistry and pharmacology. For comparison, a typical drug is made to bind to the active site of an enzyme which thus prohibits binding of a substrate to that enzyme causing a decrease in enzyme activity. Allosteric modulation occurs when an effector binds to an allosteric site (also known as a regulatory site) of an enzyme and alters the enzyme activity. Allosteric modulators are designed to fit the allosteric site to cause a conformational change of the enzyme, in particular a change in the shape of the active site, which then causes a change in its activity. In contrast to typical drugs, modulators are not competitive inhibitors. They can be positive (activating) causing an increase of the enzyme activity or negative (inhibiting) causing a decrease of the enzyme activity. The use of allosteric modulation allows the control of the effects of specific enzyme activities; as a result, allosteric modulators are very effective in pharmacology. In a biological system, allosteric modulation can be difficult to distinguish from modulation by substrate presentation.

== Energy sensing model ==

An example of this model is seen with the &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, a bacterium that is perfectly suited to adapt to living in the macrophages of humans. The enzyme&#x27;s sites serve as a communication between different substrates. Specifically between AMP and G6P. Sites like these also serve as a sensing mechanism for the enzyme&#x27;s performance.

=== Positive modulation ===

Positive allosteric modulation (also known as &quot;allosteric activation&quot;) occurs when the binding of one ligand enhances the attraction between substrate molecules and other binding sites. An example is the binding of oxygen molecules to hemoglobin, where oxygen is effectively both the substrate and the effector. The allosteric, or &quot;other&quot;, site is the active site of an adjoining protein subunit. The binding of oxygen to one subunit induces a conformational change in that subunit that interacts with the remaining active sites to enhance &quot;their&quot; oxygen affinity.
Another example of allosteric activation is seen in cytosolic IMP-GMP specific 5&#x27;-nucleotidase II (cN-II), where the affinity for substrate GMP increases upon GTP binding at the dimer interface.

=== Negative modulation ===

Negative allosteric modulation (also known as &quot;allosteric inhibition&quot;) occurs when the binding of one ligand decreases the affinity for substrate at other active sites. For example, when 2,3-BPG binds to an allosteric site on hemoglobin, the affinity for oxygen of all subunits decreases. This is when a regulator is absent from the binding site.

Direct thrombin inhibitors provides an excellent example of negative allosteric modulation. Allosteric inhibitors of thrombin have been discovered that could potentially be used as anticoagulants.

Another example is strychnine, a convulsant poison, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the glycine receptor. Glycine is a major post-synaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. Strychnine acts at a separate binding site on the glycine receptor in an allosteric manner; i.e., its binding lowers the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine. Thus, strychnine inhibits the action of an inhibitory transmitter, leading to convulsions.

Another instance in which negative allosteric modulation can be seen is between ATP and the enzyme phosphofructokinase within the negative feedback loop that regulates glycolysis. Phosphofructokinase (generally referred to as PFK) is an enzyme that catalyses the third step of glycolysis: the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. PFK can be allosterically inhibited by high levels of ATP within the cell. When ATP levels are high, ATP will bind to an allosteric site on phosphofructokinase, causing a change in the enzyme&#x27;s three-dimensional shape. This change causes its affinity for substrate (fructose-6-phosphate and ATP) at the active site to decrease, and the enzyme is deemed inactive. This causes glycolysis to cease when ATP levels are high, thus conserving the body&#x27;s glucose and maintaining balanced levels of cellular ATP. In this way, ATP serves as a negative allosteric modulator for PFK, despite the fact that it is also a substrate of the enzyme.

== Types ==

=== Homotropic ===

A homotropic allosteric modulator is a substrate for its target protein, as well as a regulatory molecule of the protein&#x27;s activity. It is typically an activator of the protein. For example, O2 and CO are homotropic allosteric modulators of hemoglobin. Likewise, in IMP/GMP specific 5&#x27; nucleotidase, binding of one GMP molecule to a single subunit of the tetrameric enzyme leads to increased affinity for GMP by the subsequent subunits as revealed by sigmoidal substrate versus velocity plots.

=== Heterotropic ===

A heterotropic allosteric modulator is a regulatory molecule that is not the enzyme&#x27;s substrate. It may be either an activator or an inhibitor of the enzyme. For example, H+, CO2, and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate are heterotropic allosteric modulators of hemoglobin. Once again, in IMP/GMP specific 5&#x27; nucleotidase, binding of GTP molecule at the dimer interface in the tetrameric enzyme leads to increased affinity for substrate GMP at the active site indicating towards K-type heterotropic allosteric activation.

As has been amply highlighted above, some allosteric proteins can be regulated by both their substrates and other molecules. Such proteins are capable of both homotropic and heterotropic interactions.

=== Essential activators ===
Some allosteric activators are referred to as &quot;essential&quot;, or &quot;obligate&quot; activators, in the sense that in their absence, the activity of their target enzyme activity is very low or negligible, as is the case with N-acetylglutamate&#x27;s activity on carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, for example.

== Non-regulatory allostery ==

A non-regulatory allosteric site is any non-regulatory component of an enzyme (or any protein), that is not itself an amino acid. For instance, many enzymes require sodium binding to ensure proper function. However, the sodium does not necessarily act as a regulatory subunit; the sodium is always present and there are no known biological processes to add/remove sodium to regulate enzyme activity. Non-regulatory allostery could comprise any other ions besides sodium (calcium, magnesium, zinc), as well as other chemicals and possibly vitamins.

== Pharmacology ==

Allosteric modulation of a receptor results from the binding of allosteric modulators at a different site (a &quot;regulatory site&quot;) from that of the endogenous ligand (an &quot;active site&quot;) and enhances or inhibits the effects of the endogenous ligand. Under normal circumstances, it acts by causing a conformational change in a receptor molecule, which results in a change in the binding affinity of the ligand. In this way, an allosteric ligand modulates the receptor&#x27;s activation by its primary ligand, and can be thought to act like a dimmer switch in an electrical circuit, adjusting the intensity of the response.

For example, the GABAA receptor has two active sites that the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binds, but also has benzodiazepine and general anaesthetic agent regulatory binding sites. These regulatory sites can each produce positive allosteric modulation, potentiating the activity of GABA. Diazepam is a positive allosteric modulator at the benzodiazepine regulatory site, and its antidote flumazenil is a receptor antagonist.

More recent examples of drugs that allosterically modulate their targets include the calcium-mimicking cinacalcet and the HIV treatment maraviroc.

=== Allosteric sites as drug targets ===

Allosteric proteins are involved in, and are central in many diseases, and allosteric sites may represent a novel drug target. There are a number of advantages in using allosteric modulators as preferred therapeutic agents over classic orthosteric ligands. For example, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) allosteric binding sites have not faced the same evolutionary pressure as orthosteric sites to accommodate an endogenous ligand, so are more diverse. Therefore, greater GPCR selectivity may be obtained by targeting allosteric sites. This is particularly useful for GPCRs where selective orthosteric therapy has been difficult because of sequence conservation of the orthosteric site across receptor subtypes. Also, these modulators have a decreased potential for toxic effects, since modulators with limited co-operativity will have a ceiling level to their effect, irrespective of the administered dose. Another type of pharmacological selectivity that is unique to allosteric modulators is based on co-operativity. An allosteric modulator may display neutral co-operativity with an orthosteric ligand at all subtypes of a given receptor except the subtype of interest, which is termed &quot;absolute subtype selectivity&quot;. If an allosteric modulator does not possess appreciable efficacy, it can provide another powerful therapeutic advantage over orthosteric ligands, namely the ability to selectively tune up or down tissue responses only when the endogenous agonist is present. Oligomer-specific small molecule binding sites are drug targets for medically relevant morpheeins.

== Synthetic allosteric systems ==
There are many synthetic compounds containing several noncovalent binding sites, which exhibit conformational changes upon occupation of one site. Cooperativity between single binding contributions in such supramolecular systems is positive if occupation of one binding site enhances the affinity Δ&quot;G&quot; at a second site, and negative if the affinity isn&#x27;t highered. Most synthetic allosteric complexes rely on conformational reorganization upon the binding of one effector ligand which then leads to either enhanced or weakened association of second ligand at another binding site. Conformational coupling between several binding sites is in artificial systems usually much larger than in proteins with their usually larger flexibility. The parameter which determines the efficiency (as measured by the ratio of equilibrium constants Krel = KA(E)/KA in presence and absence of an effector E ) is the conformational energy needed to adopt a closed or strained conformation for the binding of a ligand A.

In many multivalent supramolecular systems direct interaction between bound ligands can occur, which can lead to large cooperativities. Most common is such a direct interaction between ions in receptors for ion-pairs. This cooperativity is often also referred to as allostery, even though conformational changes here are not necessarily triggering binding events.

== Online resources ==

=== Allosteric Database ===
Allostery is a direct and efficient means for regulation of biological macromolecule function, produced by the binding of a ligand at an allosteric site topographically distinct from the orthosteric site. Due to the often high receptor selectivity and lower target-based toxicity, allosteric regulation is also expected to play an increasing role in drug discovery and bioengineering. The AlloSteric Database (ASD) provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of the structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules. Currently, ASD contains allosteric proteins from more than 100 species and modulators in three categories (activators, inhibitors, and regulators). Each protein is annotated with detailed description of allostery, biological process and related diseases, and each modulator with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area. Integrating the information of allosteric proteins in ASD should allow the prediction of allostery for unknown proteins, to be followed with experimental validation. In addition, modulators curated in ASD can be used to investigate potential allosteric targets for a query compound, and can help chemists to implement structure modifications for novel allosteric drug design.

=== Allosteric residues and their prediction ===
Not all protein residues play equally important roles in allosteric regulation. The identification of residues that are essential to allostery (so-called “allosteric residues”) has been the focus of many studies, especially within the last decade. In part, this growing interest is a result of their general importance in protein science, but also because allosteric residues may be exploited in biomedical contexts. Pharmacologically important proteins with difficult-to-target sites may yield to approaches in which one alternatively targets easier-to-reach residues that are capable of allosterically regulating the primary site of interest. These residues can broadly be classified as surface- and interior-allosteric amino acids. Allosteric sites at the surface generally play regulatory roles that are fundamentally distinct from those within the interior; surface residues may serve as receptors or effector sites in allosteric signal transmission, whereas those within the interior may act to transmit such signals.

Montañez was recognized by Ring Magazine as one of history&#x27;s most prolific knockout winners with 56 knockout wins, and one of the Latinos with the most knockout wins—while only being knocked out twice himself. He also ranks as number 14 in boxing history, also recognized by Ring Magazine, among boxers with most wins in a row, totalling 88 wins in a row.

Montanez began boxing in 1931, and captured the Puerto Rican lightweight title in 1933. A European tour followed, and he registered victories in Spain, France, England, and Italy. He was next showcased in New York, and scored wins over Aldo Spoldi and Frankie Klick among others. That set up a non-title bout with lightweight king Lou Ambers, which Montanez won in a 10-round decision—he was thereafter dubbed the “uncrowned champion.” Impressive wins over formidable foes Eddie Ran, Wesley Ramey, and Freddie “Red” Cochrane set up a title bout with Ambers on the September 23, 1937, “Carnival of Champions” show at the Polo Grounds in New York City. Although he was defeated for the world championship (L 15), observers say he deserved the decision against Ambers. Montanez bounced back to continue his winning ways in bouts with Jackie “Kid” Berg and Young Peter Jackson.

Montañez went for the world title two times, losing to Lou Ambers on points. and then Henry Armstrong by a TKO in round 9.

Montañez reached great popularity in Puerto Rico, New York City, and Latin America, and his collection of photos with celebrities is considered one of the largest in Puerto Rico. He had well over 250 pictures with celebrities such as Celia Cruz, Joe Louis, Jersey Joe Walcott, Cantinflas and some former Puerto Rico Governors and other famous people displayed on his house&#x27;s walls.

Montañez was elected to the &quot;Salon de la Fama del Deporte Cayeyano&quot; in July 2004.

Montañez has a stadium named after him, the &quot;Pedro Montañez Municipal Stadium&quot; in Cayey. It is the home of the Toritos de Cayey Double A baseball team, which was named after him, and it also was the Benigno Fernandez Garcia Jr. High School&#x27;s field day competitions&#x27; site.

==Hall of Fame==
In December 2006, Montañez was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame and in 2007 he was inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame located @ 360 N Peterboro St, Canastota, NY 13032

<doc id="106262" wikidata="Q156394" url="?curid=106262" title="What Women Want">
<text>What Women Want is a 2000 American romantic fantasy comedy film written by Josh Goldsmith, Cathy Yuspa, and Diane Drake, directed by Nancy Meyers, and starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.

The film was released on December 15, 2000 by Paramount Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, with a North American domestic gross of $182 million and a worldwide gross of $374 million against a budget of $70 million, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2000.

A loose remake, &quot;What Men Want&quot;, was released in 2019, starring Taraji P. Henson and Aldis Hodge.

==Plot==

The mother of Nick Marshall, a Chicago advertising executive, was a Las Vegas showgirl. Raised by beautiful women who spoiled the boy as an adored mascot, and with tough casino men as role models, the adult Nick is a chauvinist skilled at selling products to men and seducing women.

Nick expects a promotion at the advertising firm Sloane Curtis, but his manager Dan Wanamaker instead announces that he is hiring top rival Darcy Maguire to broaden the firm&#x27;s appeal to women. Meanwhile, Nick&#x27;s estranged 15-year-old daughter, Alex, is staying with him while his remarried former wife, Gigi, is on her honeymoon. Nick embarrasses Alex, who resents his over-protectiveness when he meets her older boyfriend, Cameron.

Darcy tasks the staff, including Nick, to develop advertising ideas for a series of feminine products she distributes at the staff meeting. He falls into his home bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, shocking himself, and is knocked unconscious.

Awakening to discover that he can hear women&#x27;s thoughts, Nick at first dislikes the ability after learning that most women, especially at work, dislike him and consider him sleazy. Nick&#x27;s former therapist Dr. Perkins advises him to use the skill to his advantage, noting that he can answer the question Sigmund Freud died unable to answer: &quot;What do women want?&quot;

Nick telepathically eavesdrops on Darcy&#x27;s ideas but gradually becomes interested in her. Alex resents Nick&#x27;s years of neglect, but they start to bond while he takes her shopping for a prom dress. After Nick telepathically finds out that Alex intends to sleep with Cameron the night of the prom, he attempts to give her some advice. He tells her Cameron is not interested in her for who she is, just for what he can do with her in bed. Alex, thinking Nick is being over-protective and trying to sabotage her prom, rejects his advice.

Nick and Darcy spend more time together, becoming romantic. However, he steals Darcy&#x27;s idea for a new Nike ad campaign aimed at women, though he later regrets his actions, especially as it leads to Dan firing Darcy. Nick persuades him to rehire her, saying the ad was her idea and is eventually successful.

Over time, Nick succeeds in repairing his relationships with female acquaintances, especially those at work. He loses his gift during a severe thunder and lightning storm while on his way to see the company secretary, Erin, who has been contemplating suicide. He offers her a position for which he had previously turned her down; she accepts.

When Cameron dumps Alex at the prom for refusing to have sex, Nick finds and consoles her, cementing their newly repaired relationship. He visits Darcy and explains everything. She fires him but then forgives him, and they share a kiss.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;What Women Want&quot; made $33.6 million during its opening weekend. The film topped the box office upon opening, dethroning &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. Additionally, it had the highest December opening weekend of all time, surpassing &quot;Scream 2&quot;. This record would last until 2001 when &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; took it. For its second weekend, &quot;What Women Want&quot; was overtaken by Helen Hunt&#x27;s other film &quot;Cast Away&quot;. It went on to make $182.8 million domestically and $374.1 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2000.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 54% based on 122 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Even though Gibson is a good sport in his role, &quot;What Women Want&quot; is a rather conventional, fluffy comedy-romance that doesn&#x27;t make good use of its premise.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In a lukewarm review, Kimberley Jones of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; praised Gibson&#x27;s performance and likened parts of the film to classic screwball comedies, but felt the ending became a &quot;dull, drawn-out morality play&quot;. Roger Ebert wrote the movie &quot;doesn&#x27;t flow so much as leap from one good scene to another over the crevices of flat scenes in between ... it&#x27;s not boring and is often very funny&quot;. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; was critical: &quot;Although &quot;What Women Want&quot; is being marketed toward women, it does nothing but condescend to them.&quot;

===Awards===
For his portrayal of Nick Marshall, Gibson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actor—Comedy/Romance. Hunt won the latter award in the Favorite Actress—Comedy/Romance category, while Mark Feuerstein and Marisa Tomei each received a nomination in the supporting categories. It also garnered Tomei a nod for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture, while Ashley Johnson was nominated at the Young Artist Awards.

For his score, composer Alan Silvestri won the ASCAP Award for Top Box Office Films, it received a Saturn Award nomination for &quot;Best Fantasy Film&quot; from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, US. The film also won the Bogey Award in Platin from the Bogey Awards, Germany. It was also nominated for the Best Casting for Feature Film, Comedy from the Casting Society of America, US. It received the Golden Screen Award in Germany.

==Legacy==
===Remake===
In 2009, the website Pajiba published an article reporting that producer and scriptwriter Peter Chiarelli was working on a sequel, which would re-imagine the concept from the viewpoint of a woman who could hear men&#x27;s thoughts. Cameron Diaz was courted to star as its lead. The film was released in 2019 as &quot;What Men Want&quot; with Taraji P. Henson in the lead role.

===Foreign market remakes===
&quot;Aga Bai Arrecha!&quot; in 2004 is a Marathi film directed by Kedar Shinde from India that is loosely based on &quot;What Women Want&quot;.

<doc id="106269" wikidata="Q88399897" url="?curid=106269" title="Test tube">
<text>A test tube, also known as a culture tube or sample tube, is a common piece of laboratory glassware consisting of a finger-like length of glass or clear plastic tubing, open at the top and closed at the bottom.

Test tubes are usually placed in special-purpose racks.

==Types and usage==

===Chemistry===

Test tubes intended for general chemical work are usually made of glass, for its relative resistance to heat. Tubes made from expansion-resistant glasses, mostly borosilicate glass or fused quartz, can withstand high temperatures up to several hundred degrees Celsius.

Chemistry tubes are available in a multitude of lengths and widths, typically from 10 to 20 mm wide and 50 to 200 mm long. The top often features a flared lip to aid pouring out the contents.

A chemistry test tube typically has a flat bottom, a round bottom, or a conical bottom. Some test tubes are made to accept a ground glass stopper or a screw cap. They are often provided with a small ground glass or white glaze area near the top for labelling with a pencil.

Test tubes are widely used by chemists to handle chemicals, especially for qualitative experiments and assays. Their spherical bottom and vertical sides reduce mass loss when pouring, make them easier to wash out, and allow convenient monitoring of the contents. The long, narrow neck of test tube slows down the spreading of gases to the environment.

Test tubes are convenient containers for heating small amounts of liquids or solids with a Bunsen burner or alcohol burner. The tube is usually held by its neck with a clamp or tongs. By tilting the tube, the bottom can be heated to hundreds of degrees in the flame, while the neck remains relatively cool, possibly allowing vapours to condense on its walls. A boiling tube is a large test tube intended specifically for boiling liquids.

A test tube filled with water and upturned into a water-filled beaker is often used to capture gases, e.g. in electrolysis demonstrations.

A test tube with a stopper is often used for temporary storage of chemical or biological samples.

===Biosciences===
Culture tubes are test tubes used in biology and related sciences for handling and culturing all kinds of live organisms, such as molds, bacteria, seedlings, plant cuttings, etc.. Some racks for culture tubes are designed to hold the tubes in a nearly horizontal position, so as to maximize the surface of the culture medium inside.

Culture tubes for biology are usually made of clear plastic (such as polystyrene or polypropylene) by injection molding and are often discarded after use. Plastic test tubes with a screwtop cap are often called &quot;Falcon tubes&quot; after a line manufactured by Becton Dickinson.

Some sources consider that the presence of a lip is what distinguishes a test tube from a culture tube.

===Clinical medicine===
In clinical medicine, sterile test tubes with air removed, called vacutainers, are used to collect and hold samples of physiological fluids such as blood, urine, pus, and synovial fluid. These tubes are commonly sealed with a rubber stopper and often have a specific additive placed in the tube with the stopper color indicating the additive. For example, a &quot;blue-top tube&quot; is a 5 ml test tube containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant, used to collect blood for coagulation and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing. Small vials used in medicine may have a snap-top (also called a hinge cap) molded as part of the vial.
===Other uses===

Test tubes are sometimes put to casual uses outside of lab environments, e.g. as flower vases, glassware for certain weak shots, or containers for spices. They can also be used for raising queen ants during their first months of development.

== Variants ==
=== Boiling tube ===
A boiling tube is a small cylindrical vessel used to strongly heat substances in the flame of a Bunsen burner. A boiling tube is essentially a scaled-up test tube, being about 50% larger.

They are designed to be wide enough to allow substances to boil violently as opposed to a test tube, which is too narrow; a boiling liquid can explode out of the end of test tubes when they are heated, as there is no room for bubbles of gas to escape independently of the surrounding liquid. This phenomenon is called bumping.

=== Ignition tube ===
An ignition tube is used in much the same way as a boiling tube, except it is not as large and thick-walled. It is primarily used to hold small quantities of substances which are undergoing direct heating by a Bunsen burner or other heat source. This type of tube is used in the sodium fusion test.

Ignition tubes are often difficult to clean due to the small bore. When used to heat substances strongly, some char may stick to the walls as well. They are usually disposable.

<doc id="106270" wikidata="Q898668" url="?curid=106270" title="Plasmolysis">
<text>Plasmolysis is the process in which cells lose water in a hypertonic solution. The reverse process, deplasmolysis or cytolysis, can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a lower external osmotic pressure and a net flow of water into the cell. Through observation of plasmolysis and deplasmolysis, it is possible to determine the tonicity of the cell&#x27;s environment as well as the rate solute molecules cross the cellular membrane.

==Etymology==
The term plasmolysis is derived from the Latin word ‘plasma’ meaning ‘matrix’ and the Greek word ‘lysis’, meaning ‘loosening’.

== Turgidity ==

A plant cell in hypotonic solution will absorb water by endosmosis, so that the increased volume of water in the cell will increase pressure, making the protoplasm push against the cell wall, a condition known as turgor. Turgor makes plant cells push against each other in the same way and is the main line method of support in non-woody plant tissue. Plant cell walls resist further water entry after a certain point, known as full turgor, which stops plant cells from bursting as animal cells do in the same conditions. This is also the reason that plants stand upright. Without the stiffness of the plant cells the plant would fall under its own weight. Turgor pressure allows plants to stay firm and erect, and plants without turgor pressure (known as flaccid) wilt. A cell will begin to decline in turgor pressure only when there is no air spaces surrounding it and eventually leads to a greater osmotic pressure than that of the cell. Vacuoles play a role in turgor pressure when water leaves the cell due to hyperosmotic solutions containing solutes such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sucrose.

== Plasmolysis ==
 If a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, the plant cell loses water and hence turgor pressure by plasmolysis: pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell shrink and crumple. A continued decrease in pressure eventually leads to cytorrhysis – the complete collapse of the cell wall. Plants with cells in this condition wilt. After plasmolysis the gap between the cell wall and the cell membrane in a plant cell is filled with hypertonic solution. This is because as the solution surrounding the cell is hypertonic, exosmosis takes place and the space between the cell wall and cytoplasm is filled with solutes, as most of the water drains away and hence the concentration inside the cell becomes more hypertonic. There are some mechanisms in plants to prevent excess water loss in the same way as excess water gain. Plasmolysis can be reversed if the cell is placed in a hypotonic solution. Stomata close to help keep water in the plant so it does not dry out. Wax also keeps water in the plant. The equivalent process in animal cells is called crenation. 
The liquid content of the cell leaks out due to exosmosis. The cell collapses, and the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall (in plants). Most animal cells consist of only a phospholipid bilayer (plasma membrane) and not a cell wall, therefore shrinking up under such conditions.

Plasmolysis only occurs in extreme conditions and rarely occurs in nature. It is induced in the laboratory by immersing cells in strong saline or sugar (sucrose) solutions to cause exosmosis, often using &quot;Elodea&quot; plants or onion epidermal cells, which have colored cell sap so that the process is clearly visible. Methylene blue can be used to stain plant cells.

Plasmolysis is mainly known as shrinking of cell membrane in hypertonic solution and great pressure.

Plasmolysis can be of two types, either concave plasmolysis or convex plasmolysis. Convex plasmolysis is always irreversible while concave plasmolysis is usually reversible. During concave plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast partially shrinks from the cell wall due to half-spherical, inwarding curving pockets forming between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. During convex plasmolysis, the plasma membrane and the enclosed protoplast shrinks completely from the cell wall, with the plasma membrane&#x27;s ends in a symmetrically, spherically curved pattern.

<doc id="106272" wikidata="Q7298020" url="?curid=106272" title="Ray Reyes">
<text>Ray Reyes León (March 13, 1970 – April 30, 2021) was a Puerto Rican singer who was a member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo.

==Career==
He was born in New York City and was raised in Levittown, a neighborhood in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, the son of Ramon Reyes and Carmen Leon. He became a member of Menudo in early 1983. Reyes came to substitute Xavier Serbiá in the band, and joined the band right in the middle of Menudo&#x27;s golden era.

Reyes amassed great popularity among Menudo fans, although he was known as the &quot;chubby one&quot; of the band. That nickname was started because, when he joined Menudo, Edgardo Diaz put him on a strict diet. That information was leaked out to all gossip magazines, which published the information immediately.

Ray&#x27;s first album with Menudo was 1983&#x27;s A Todo Rock, where he sang lead vocals on &quot;Si Tu No Estas&quot;, &quot;Chicle De Amor&quot;, and &quot;Zumbador&quot;. He continued through the time when Menudo had the number 1 hit &quot;Indianapolis&quot; from the same album and when Menudo started making it to the covers of Tiger Beat and other major teen magazines, and also when Menudo became famous in Brazil, the Philippines, and Japan.

His next 3 albums recorded as a member of the band were all recorded in 1984. &quot;Reaching Out&quot; was the first one of &#x27;84 and the band&#x27;s first album in English. Ray sang lead vocals on &quot;That&#x27;s What You Do&quot;. &quot;Mania&quot; was the second album of &#x27;84 and the band&#x27;s first album in Portuguese. Ray sang lead vocals on &quot;Quero Ser&quot;. &quot;Evolución&quot; was the third album of &#x27;84, it was also the last album recorded in 1984. Ray sang lead vocals on &quot;Persecución&quot; and &quot;Yo No Fui&quot;. It was also Ray&#x27;s last album recorded as a member of Menudo.

Ray was forced to leave the band after only 2 years in the group due to a sudden growth spurt. In 1986, the solo album &quot;Una Y Otra Vez&quot; was released in Spanish and the album &quot;Minha Musica&quot; in Portuguese. In 1988, he joined former Menudos Rene Farrait and Johnny Lozada in Proyecto M, once again substituting Serbiá. Proyecto M went on to enjoy great success in Puerto Rico and Venezuela.

In 1997 he came up with the idea of doing an ex Menudos&#x27; concert and reunited 6 of the golden era with former Menudo bandmates Miguel Cancel, Ricky Melendez, Charlie Massó and Johnny Lozada as well as Farrait for a single concert named El Reencuentro in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum (12,000 capacity) in San Juan. The concert did so well, that they finished doing 7 shows in two weekends and then went on a worldwide tour. They also had the record of most performances in that coliseum with 11 concerts. He produced their gold-certified live album El Reencuentro: 15 Años Después released by Fonovisa Records.

==Personal life==
Ray Reyes married twice and had a son, Marcos Reyes, and a daughter, Cecilia Reyes. His father, Rey Reyes Sr., ran several successful business ventures. His younger brother Raul Reyes, who was his lifetime musical collaborator, also participated by recording backing vocals, helping the group in several TV Commercials, Menudo TV Specials and the record productions, &quot;A Todo Rock&quot;, &quot;Menudo Mania&quot;, &quot;Reaching Out&quot;, and &quot;Evolucion&quot; as well with Proyecto M &amp; El Reencuentro productions. He had a career as lead singer of Puerto Rican rock band Radio Pirata.

Per the documentary &#x27;Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed,&#x27; prior to his death, Reyes was working to expose the years of child sexual abuse allegedly committed against dozens of young boys by Menudo founder Edgardo Diaz, which also allegedly involved RCA executive José Menendez, who, along with his wife, Kitty, was later slain by his sons Lyle and Erik after many years of alleged child sexual abuse committed against them.

==Death==
On April 30, 2021, Ray Reyes died in Puerto Rico. Reyes was the second member of Menudo to die; Anthony Galindo, the first, preceded him by six months. Reyes died of a massive heart attack.

<doc id="106274" wikidata="Q2138272" url="?curid=106274" title="New Orleans Regional Transit Authority">
<text>The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA or NORTA) is a public transportation agency based in New Orleans. The agency was established by the Louisiana State Legislature in 1979, and has operated bus and historic streetcar service throughout the city since 1983, when it took over the city&#x27;s mass transit system after nearly six decades&#x27; control by New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (now Entergy New Orleans). In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , making the Regional Transit Authority the largest public transit agency in the state of Louisiana.

Basic rates for all modes, except ferries, are $1.25 per boarding (or $0.40 for 65 and up, disabled and Medicare, $0.50 for 5–17). 24-hour Jazzy Passes are $3, or $1 for youth and $0.80 for seniors, good for all modes including ferries. There are free transfer cards, good for next 120 minutes of unlimited use (round-trips/stopovers prohibited). Under 5 with a limit of three per paid rider can board for free. Transfers to ferries from busses/streetcars require paying difference in rates.

==Hurricane Katrina==
City buses were used before Hurricane Katrina hit to transport people to a refuge of last resort, of what&#x27;s now the Caesars Superdome. Much of the city flooded due to the storm. The NORTA Administration building on Plaza Drive appears to have been in of water. Almost eighty-five percent of the fleet was rendered useless and inoperative; 146 city buses were visible outdoors in the flood at the 2817 Canal St. facility, while only 22 were at 3900 Desire Pky. The 8201 Willow St. facility was one block within the flood but was built above street level. The buses at the flooded facilities were mostly written off.

All but one of the streetcars built in the 1990s and 2000s were severely damaged in the flooding resulting from the hurricane. The historic Perley Thomas-built streetcars of the St. Charles line were undamaged in the disaster. The damaged streetcars, which had been built by hand on the property by local workers, were repaired in the same facility with components from Brookville Equipment Co.

===Post-disaster recovery===
, service had been restored to certain areas as they became habitable again. However, there was no 24-hour service on any bus or streetcar line, except for the St. Charles streetcar line. Streetcars were returned to the full length of Canal St. and the Riverfront, initially using the historic St. Charles Line streetcars, which had not been damaged, as had the red Canal cars. In 2008, the St. Charles streetcar resumed running the entire length of its route. By early 2009, the red Canal streetcars were repaired and had taken over service on the Canal and Riverfront Lines.

The buses that have been restored to operation have returned to several major thoroughfares, including Elysian Fields Avenue, Esplanade Avenue, Claiborne Avenue, St. Claude Avenue, Judge Perez Drive, General Meyer Avenue, Lapalco Boulevard, Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and the Chef Menteur Highway. And just a few express routes, Morrison Express, Lake Forest Express, Read-Crowder Express and Airport Express, serving both Eastern New Orleans, and New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport in Kenner, La. have been reinstated so far.

Service enhancements as of October 2, 2016:

Operate the new N. Rampart/St. Claude Avenue streetcar from Elysian Fields to UPT via Rampart St. and Loyola Ave. Loyola/UPT line will no longer operate on Canal St. to the river, nor on Riverfront to the French Quarter stop.

Restore service to Canal Street on the 15-Freret and 28-MLK buses.

== New Links Bus Routes ==
In September 2022, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority announced that they would be almost entirely changing the lines, names, and wait times for the authority starting on September 25, 2022. The changes were made after a survey was conducted containing 3,000 people saying that the old lines had been outdated, and were not convenient for everyday use. For 4 days after the new routes started, RTA offered free boarding on all buses, streetcars, and the Algiers Point Ferry.

The changes were part of the New Links Network, a project designed to upgrade the transit authority to service the people of New Orleans.

Upgrades from the previous lines include more access to jobs and landmarks, reduced wait times, longer service times, and faster transfers/connections.

On July 18, 2022, the authority released Le Pass, a new trip planner and ticket app. It includes tickets and tracking for both RTA and Jefferson Transit buses. On August 29, 2022, RTA shut down ticket buying on the old RTA GoMobile app. Le Pass updated from the old routes on September 25, 2022.

No changes were made to the streetcars or ferries.

==Governance==
The body in charge of making major decisions for the RTA is the Board of Commissioners. The board consists of appointees by the Mayor of New Orleans and of some appointees by the President of Jefferson Parish. The RTA Board has the overall authority for transit in New Orleans including setting fares, overseeing service and operations, developing operating budgets, approving each year&#x27;s annual transportation development plan, and deciding upon capital purchases and expansions.

Under contract to the RTA Board of Commissioners, Transdev formerly managed all day-to-day aspects of the transit agency on behalf of the RTA Board. Transdev handled operations and service, safety issues, vehicle maintenance, customer care, route design and scheduling, human resources, administration, ridership growth, capital planning, grant administration, communications, purchasing, and other agency functions. Transdev was under contract to and reported to the RTA Board of Commissioners. The company operates public transportation for some 5,000 transit authorities around the world. Transdev (then Veolia Transport) was hired in 2008.

, Transdev no longer manages the RTA. All bus, streetcar, and paratransit operators, and also maintenance personnel, are now employees of RTA. Ferry services continue to be operated for RTA by LabMar Ferry Services.

<doc id="106279" wikidata="Q648366" url="?curid=106279" title="Hank Snow">
<text>Clarence Eugene &quot;Hank&quot; Snow (May 9, 1914 – December 20, 1999) was a Canadian-American country music guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He recorded 140 albums and charted more than 85 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts between 1950 and 1980. Snow had success on country music record charts with his songs including: &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On,&quot; &quot;The Golden Rocket,&quot; &quot;The Rhumba Boogie,&quot; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Hurt Anymore,&quot; &quot;Let Me Go, Lover!,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere,&quot; and &quot;Hello Love.&quot;

Hank Snow wrote songs about a wide range of topics including joy, freedom, travel, anguish, and love. His work was often inspired by his personal experiences, such as his childhood in a small town in rural Nova Scotia. He experienced extreme poverty, abuse, and physically punishing labor during the Great Depression. His mother encouraged him to pursue his dream of becoming an entertainer, like his idol, country star Jimmie Rodgers.

Snow received various music awards and is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. The Hank Snow Home Town Museum in Liverpool, Nova Scotia is dedicated to his life and work.

==Early life==
Clarence Eugene &quot;Hank&quot; Snow was born on May 9, 1914 in the small community of Brooklyn in Queens County, Nova Scotia to George Snow (1886–1966) and Maude Marie Hatt (1889–1953). He was the fifth of six children, of whom the two eldest died in infancy. His parents were married on November 10, 1909, in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. In his autobiography, Snow describes his parents&#x27; struggle to feed their four remaining children during hard financial times. His father worked for low pay as a foreman in sawmills, often far from home, while his mother helped support the family by washing clothes and scrubbing floors. Both parents showed musical talent. Snow said his father loved to sing, and described his mother as an accomplished singer who played piano during silent films at the local theatre and sometimes performed in minstrel shows. She also enjoyed playing her pump organ.

Snow&#x27;s parents legally separated when he was eight, and the local Overseer of the Poor decided he and his siblings should be taken from their mother due to her financial difficulties. One sister moved in with an aunt while the other two were sent to separate foster homes. Snow went to live with his paternal grandmother, who forbade him from mentioning his mother and abused him. After divorcing his father, Hank&#x27;s mother married Charles Tanner in 1930. Tanner was frequently violent and abusive towards Snow. Gradually, Snow began visiting his mother in nearby Liverpool, and eventually, after his grandmother&#x27;s attempt to send him to reform school failed, he was allowed to rejoin his mother. 

===Musical beginnings===
After his mother&#x27;s remarriage, she ordered a Hawaiian steel guitar and lessons, along with 78 rpm gramophone records. Initially, she forbade Snow from touching it, but later, she was amazed by his skill. He was soon playing for neighbours and others.

===Life at sea===
In 1926, Snow worked on a fishing schooner as a &quot;flunky&quot; or cabin boy. The job was unpaid, but Snow was allowed to sell cod tongues and fish he caught. After one trip, he used his earnings to buy a guitar and chord book. In 1927 or 1928, he heard radio broadcasts of country artists like Vernon Dalhart and Carson Robison, which inspired him to sing and play for his crewmates.

In August 1930, Snow&#x27;s schooner nearly wrecked on Sable Island, but they were saved by a change in wind. Witnessing other vessels lost in the storm, he vowed to never return to sea.

===Life after sailing===

Snow returned home and worked at various odd jobs, including peddling fish, transporting passengers, unloading ships, and working in the woods. In September 1935, he married Minnie Blanche Aalders. Their son, Jimmie Rodgers Snow, was born soon after.

==Career==
===Early music career===
Snow bought a new guitar and, playing in the style of Jimmie Rodgers, performed in a fish house and a minstrel show in Bridgewater. He later auditioned for Halifax radio station CHNS, and was hired for a Saturday evening show. He adopted the stage name &quot;Hank, The Yodeling Ranger,&quot; and performed in various venues, gaining popularity through radio broadcasts.

===Canadian years===
Snow auditioned for RCA Victor in Montreal, Quebec in 1936, securing a recording contract. His weekly CBC radio show and touring brought him national recognition in Canada, and in the late 1940s his records began to gain popularity with American country music stations.

===Nashville===
Snow moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1949, releasing records for RCA Victor under the name &quot;Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger.&quot; His performance at the Grand Ole Opry in 1950 brought him widespread attention in the United States. His song &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot; became a number-one hit, holding the top spot for 21 weeks. Other number-one hits followed, including &quot;The Golden Rocket&quot; and &quot;The Rhumba Boogie&quot;. His rendition of Australian country singer Geoff Mack&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot; popularized the song in North America. While performing in Renfro Valley, Snow worked with a young Hank Williams. In 1953, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Snow&#x27;s son, Jimmie Rodgers Snow, had signed with RCA Victor and would record with his father.

===Rainbow Ranch===
After the success of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On,&quot; Snow purchased a ranch home in Madison, Tennessee, which he named Rainbow Ranch. In recent years the home has been restored by Snow&#x27;s family. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Davidson County, Tennessee on November 27, 2018.

===Elvis Presley===
Snow helped launch the career of Elvis Presley by giving him stage time at the Grand Ole Opry and by introducing him to Colonel Tom Parker. They formed a management partnership, but Snow eventually left the management team.

===Later career===
Snow became a naturalized American citizen in 1958. He continued to reference Canada in his work, such as in his 1968 album &quot;My Nova Scotia Home&quot;. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1978 and several Canadian music halls of fame. His autobiography, &quot;The Hank Snow Story&quot;, was published in 1994. He also established the Hank Snow International Foundation For Prevention Of Child Abuse.

==Illness and death==
Snow retired in 1996 due to respiratory problems. He died on December 20, 1999, at his Rainbow Ranch in Madison, Tennessee, and was buried in Nashville&#x27;s Spring Hill Cemetery. His wife Minnie died on May 12, 2003.

==Legacy==

Many artists have covered his music, including Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, Ray Charles, Ashley MacIsaac, Johnny Cash, and Emmylou Harris. His song &quot;Hello Love&quot; was used to open broadcasts of &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;. At 59 years and 11 months old, he became the oldest country artist to have a number-one hit, a record that stood for more than 26 years. In Robert Altman&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Nashville&quot;, a character was partly based on Snow. He is portrayed by David Wenham in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Elvis&quot;. He is referenced in Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s song &quot;The Wino and I Know&quot;. The fictional Finnish snow god, Heikki Lunta, from Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, is named after him.

<text>A centrifuge is a device that uses centrifugal force to subject a specimen to a specified constant force - for example, to separate various components of a fluid. This is achieved by spinning the fluid at high speed within a container, thereby separating fluids of different densities (e.g. cream from milk) or liquids from solids. It works by causing denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and moved to the centre. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, while low-density substances rise to the top. A centrifuge can be a very effective filter that separates contaminants from the main body of fluid.

Industrial scale centrifuges are commonly used in manufacturing and waste processing to sediment suspended solids, or to separate immiscible liquids. An example is the cream separator found in dairies. Very high speed centrifuges and ultracentrifuges able to provide very high accelerations can separate fine particles down to the nano-scale, and molecules of different masses. Large centrifuges are used to simulate high gravity or acceleration environments (for example, high-G training for test pilots). Medium-sized centrifuges are used in washing machines and at some swimming pools to draw water out of fabrics. Gas centrifuges are used for isotope separation, such as to enrich nuclear fuel for fissile isotopes.

== History ==
English military engineer Benjamin Robins (1707–1751) invented a whirling arm apparatus to determine drag. In 1864, Antonin Prandtl proposed the idea of a dairy centrifuge to separate cream from milk. The idea was subsequently put into practice by his brother, Alexander Prandtl, who made improvements to his brother&#x27;s design, and exhibited a working butterfat extraction machine in 1875.

== Types ==
A centrifuge machine can be described as a machine with a rapidly rotating container that applies centrifugal force to its contents. There are multiple types of centrifuge, which can be classified by intended use or by rotor design:

Types by rotor design:
* Fixed-angle centrifuges are designed to hold the sample containers at a constant angle relative to the central axis.
* Swinging head (or swinging bucket) centrifuges, in contrast to fixed-angle centrifuges, have a hinge where the sample containers are attached to the central rotor. This allows all of the samples to swing outwards as the centrifuge is spun.
* Continuous tubular centrifuges do not have individual sample vessels and are used for high volume applications.

Types by intended use:
* Laboratory centrifuges, are general-purpose instruments of several types with distinct, but overlapping, capabilities. These include clinical centrifuges, superspeed centrifuges and preparative ultracentrifuges.
* Analytical ultracentrifuges are designed to perform sedimentation analysis of macromolecules using the principles devised by Theodor Svedberg.
* Haematocrit centrifuges are used to measure the volume percentage of red blood cells in whole blood.
* Gas centrifuges, including Zippe-type centrifuges, for isotopic separations in the gas phase.

Industrial centrifuges may otherwise be classified according to the type of separation of the high density fraction from the low density one.

Generally, there are two types of centrifuges: the filtration and sedimentation centrifuges. For the filtration or the so-called screen centrifuge, the drum is perforated and is inserted with a filter, for example a filter cloth, wire mesh or lot screen. The suspension flows through the filter and the drum with the perforated wall from the inside to the outside. In this way, the solid material is restrained and can be removed. The kind of removing depends on the type of centrifuge, for example manually or periodically. Common types are:
* Centrifugal oil filters
* Screen/scroll centrifuges (Screen centrifuges, where the centrifugal acceleration allows the liquid to pass through a screen of some sort, through which the solids cannot go (due to granulometry larger than the screen gap or due to agglomeration))
* Pusher centrifuges
* Peeler centrifuges
* Inverting filter centrifuges
* Sliding discharge centrifuges
* Pendulum centrifuges
* Sedimentation centrifuges
In the centrifuges, the drum is a solid wall (not perforated). This type of centrifuge is used for the purification of a suspension. For the acceleration of the natural deposition, process of suspension the centrifuges use centrifugal force. With so-called overflow centrifuges, the suspension is drained off and the liquid is added constantly. Common types are:
* Separator centrifuges (Continuous liquid); common types are:
** Self-cleaning Centrifuges
** Solid bowl centrifuges
** Conical plate centrifuges
* Tubular centrifuges
* Decanter centrifuges, in which there is no physical separation between the solid and liquid phase, rather an accelerated settling due to centrifugal acceleration.

Though most modern centrifuges are electrically powered, a hand-powered variant inspired by the whirligig has been developed for medical applications in developing countries.

Many designs have been shared for free and open-source centrifuges that can be digitally manufactured. The open-source hardware designs for hand-powered centrifuge for larger volumes of fluids with a radial velocity of over 1750 rpm and over 50 N of relative centrifugal force can be completely 3-D printed for about $25. Other open hardware designs use custom 3-D printed fixtures with inexpensive electric motors to make low-cost centrifuges (e.g. the Dremelfuge that uses a Dremel power tool) or CNC cut out OpenFuge.

== Uses ==

=== Laboratory separations ===
A wide variety of laboratory-scale centrifuges are used in chemistry, biology, biochemistry and clinical medicine for isolating and separating suspensions and immiscible liquids. They vary widely in speed, capacity, temperature control, and other characteristics. Laboratory centrifuges often can accept a range of different fixed-angle and swinging bucket rotors able to carry different numbers of centrifuge tubes and rated for specific maximum speeds. Controls vary from simple electrical timers to programmable models able to control acceleration and deceleration rates, running speeds, and temperature regimes. Ultracentrifuges spin the rotors under vacuum, eliminating air resistance and enabling exact temperature control. Zonal rotors and continuous flow systems are capable of handing bulk and larger sample volumes, respectively, in a laboratory-scale instrument.
An application in laboratories is blood separation. Blood separates into cells and proteins (RBC, WBC, platelets, etc.) and serum. DNA preparation is another common application for pharmacogenetics and clinical diagnosis. DNA samples are purified and the DNA is prepped for separation by adding buffers and then centrifuging it for a certain amount of time. The blood waste is then removed and another buffer is added and spun inside the centrifuge again. Once the blood waste is removed and another buffer is added the pellet can be suspended and cooled. Proteins can then be removed and the entire thing can be centrifuged again and the DNA can be isolated completely. Specialized cytocentrifuges are used in medical and biological laboratories to concentrate cells for microscopic examination.

=== Isotope separation ===

Other centrifuges, the first being the Zippe-type centrifuge, separate isotopes, and these kinds of centrifuges are in use in nuclear power and nuclear weapon programs.

=== Aeronautics and astronautics ===
Human centrifuges are exceptionally large centrifuges that test the reactions and tolerance of pilots and astronauts to acceleration above those experienced in the Earth&#x27;s gravity.

The first centrifuges used for human research were used by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin. The first large-scale human centrifuge designed for aeronautical training was created in Germany in 1933.

The US Air Force at Brooks City Base, Texas, operates a human centrifuge while awaiting completion of the new human centrifuge in construction at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The centrifuge at Brooks City Base is operated by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine for the purpose of training and evaluating prospective fighter pilots for high-&quot;g&quot; flight in Air Force fighter aircraft.

The use of large centrifuges to simulate a feeling of gravity has been proposed for future long-duration space missions. Exposure to this simulated gravity would prevent or reduce the bone decalcification and muscle atrophy that affect individuals exposed to long periods of freefall.

Non-Human centrifuge

At the European Space Agency (ESA) technology center ESTEC (in Noordwijk, the Netherlands), an diameter centrifuge is used to expose samples in fields of life sciences as well as physical sciences. This Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) began operation in 2007. Samples can be exposed to a maximum of 20 times Earth&#x27;s gravity. With its four arms and six freely swinging out gondolas it is possible to expose samples with different g-levels at the same time. Gondolas can be fixed at eight different positions. Depending on their locations one could e.g. run an experiment at 5 and 10g in the same run. Each gondola can hold an experiment of a maximum . Experiments performed in this facility ranged from zebra fish, metal alloys, plasma, cells, liquids, Planaria, Drosophila or plants.

=== Industrial centrifugal separator ===
Industrial centrifugal separator is a coolant filtration system for separating particles from liquid like, grinding machining coolant. It is usually used for non-ferrous particles separation such as, silicon, glass, ceramic, and graphite etc. The filtering process does not require any consumption parts like filter bags, which saves the earth from harm.

===Geotechnical centrifuge modeling===
Geotechnical centrifuge modeling is used for physical testing of models involving soils. Centrifuge acceleration is applied to scale models to scale the gravitational acceleration and enable prototype scale stresses to be obtained in scale models. Problems such as building and bridge foundations, earth dams, tunnels, and slope stability, including effects such as blast loading and earthquake shaking.

===Synthesis of materials===
High gravity conditions generated by centrifuge are applied in the chemical industry, casting, and material synthesis. The convection and mass transfer are greatly affected by the gravitational condition. Researchers reported that the high-gravity level can effectively affect the phase composition and morphology of the products.

=== Commercial applications ===

* Standalone centrifuges for drying (hand-washed) clothes – usually with a water outlet.
* Washing machines are designed to act as centrifuges to get rid of excess water in laundry loads.
* Centrifuges are used in the attraction , located at Epcot in Walt Disney World, which propels riders using a combination of a centrifuge and a motion simulator to simulate the feeling of going into space.
* In soil mechanics, centrifuges utilize centrifugal acceleration to match soil stresses in a scale model to those found in reality.
* Large industrial centrifuges are commonly used in water and wastewater treatment to dry sludges. The resulting dry product is often termed cake, and the water leaving a centrifuge after most of the solids have been removed is called centrate.
* Large industrial centrifuges are also used in the oil industry to remove solids from the drilling fluid.
* Disc-stack centrifuges used by some companies in the oil sands industry to separate small amounts of water and solids from bitumen
* Centrifuges are used to separate cream (remove fat) from milk; see Separator (milk).

== Mathematical description ==

Protocols for centrifugation typically specify the amount of acceleration to be applied to the sample, rather than specifying a rotational speed such as revolutions per minute. This distinction is important because two rotors with different diameters running at the same rotational speed will subject samples to different accelerations. During circular motion the acceleration is the product of the radius and the square of the angular velocity formula_1, and the acceleration relative to &quot;g&quot; is traditionally named &quot;relative centrifugal force&quot; (RCF). The acceleration is measured in multiples of &quot;&quot;g&quot; (or × &quot;g&quot;&quot;), the standard acceleration due to gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface, a dimensionless quantity given by the expression:

: formula_2

where
:formula_3 is earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration,
:formula_4 is the rotational radius,
:formula_1 is the angular velocity in radians per unit time

This relationship may be written as
: formula_6

or

: formula_7

where
:formula_8 is the rotational radius measured in millimeters (mm), and
:formula_9 is rotational speed measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).

To avoid having to perform a mathematical calculation every time, one can find nomograms for converting RCF to rpm for a rotor of a given radius. A ruler or other straight edge lined up with the radius on one scale, and the desired RCF on another scale, will point at the correct rpm on the third scale. Based on automatic rotor recognition, modern centrifuges have a button for automatic conversion from RCF to rpm and vice versa.

<doc id="106285" wikidata="Q329266" url="?curid=106285" title="Crater Lake">
<text>Crater Lake (Klamath: ) is a volcanic crater lake in south-central Oregon in the Western United States. It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is a tourist attraction for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a caldera that was formed around 7,700 (± 150) years ago
by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama. No rivers flow into or out of the lake; the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 150 years. With a depth of , the lake is the deepest in the United States. In the world, it ranks eleventh for maximum depth, as well as fifth for mean depth.

Crater Lake features two small islands. Wizard Island, located near the western shore of the lake, is a cinder cone about in size. Phantom Ship, a natural rock pillar, is located near the southern shore.

Since 2002, one of Oregon&#x27;s regular-issue license-plate design has featured Crater Lake and a one-time plate surcharge is used to support the operation of Crater Lake National Park. The commemorative Oregon State Quarter, which was released by the United States Mint in 2005, features an image of Crater Lake on its reverse.

The lake and surrounding park areas offer many recreational activities, including hiking, biking, snowshoeing, fishing, and cross-country skiing, and during the summer, campgrounds and lodges at Crater Lake are open to visitors.

== Location ==
Crater Lake is in Klamath County, around northwest of the county seat of Klamath Falls, and about northeast of the city of Medford.

A Native American connection with this area has been traced back to before the eruption of Mount Mazama. Archaeologists have found sandals and other artifacts buried under layers of ash, dust, and pumice that antedate the eruption roughly 7,700 years ago. Crater Lake remains significant to the Klamath tribes today. The Klamath name for the lake is &quot;Giiwas&quot;.

In June 1853, Isaac Skeeter, John Wesley Hillman, and another man were the first non-Native Americans to report sighting the lake, while on a mining trip; Skeeter named it &quot;Deep Blue Lake,&quot; inspired by Hillman&#x27;s description of the site. The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and finally Crater Lake.


== Dimensions and depth ==
The lake is across, with a caldera rim ranging in elevation from and an average lake depth of . The lake&#x27;s maximum depth has been measured at , which fluctuates slightly as the weather changes. On the basis of maximum depth, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America (after Great Slave Lake in Canada), and the eleventh-deepest lake in the world. Crater Lake is often cited as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this ranking excludes Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which is beneath about of ice, and the recent depth soundings of O&#x27;Higgins/San Martín Lake, which is along the border of Chile and Argentina.

When considering the mean, or average depth of lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest lake in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world. Crater Lake Institute Director and limnologist Owen Hoffman states that &quot;Crater Lake is the deepest, when compared on the basis of average depth among lakes whose basins are entirely above sea level. The average depths of Lakes Baikal and Tanganyika are deeper than Crater Lake; however, both have basins that extend below sea level.&quot;

== Geology ==

Mount Mazama, part of the Cascade Range volcanic arc, was built up mostly of andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite over a period of at least 400,000 years. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama. About of rhyodacite was erupted in this event. Since that time, all eruptions on Mazama have been confined to the caldera.

Lava eruptions later created a central platform, Wizard Island, Merriam Cone, and other, smaller volcanic features, including a rhyodacite dome that was eventually created atop the central platform. Sediments and landslide debris also covered the caldera floor.

Eventually, the caldera cooled, allowing rain and snow to accumulate and form a lake. Landslides from the caldera rim thereafter formed debris fans and turbidite sediments on the lake bed. Fumaroles and hot springs remained common and active during this period. Also after some time, the slopes of the lake&#x27;s caldera rim more or less stabilized, streams restored a radial drainage pattern on the mountain, and dense forests began to revegetate the barren landscape. It is estimated that about 720 years was required to fill the lake to its present depth of . Much of this occurred during a period when the prevailing climate was less moist than at present.

Some hydrothermal activity remains along the lake floor, suggesting that at some time in the future, Mazama may erupt once again.

== Climate ==

Crater Lake features a subalpine climate, with the rare dry-summer type (Köppen classification &quot;Dsc&quot;) owing to its high elevation and – like all of Oregon – the strong summer influence of the North Pacific High. In the summer, the weather is mild and dry, but in the winter is cold and the powerful influence of the Aleutian Low allows for enormous snowfalls averaging per year and maximum snow cover averaging . This snow does not usually melt until mid-July, and allows for substantial glaciers on adjacent mountains. In the winter of 1949/1950 as much as of snow fell, while the less complete snow cover records show cover as high as occurred during another particularly unsettled winter in 1981/1982. The heaviest daily snowfall was , which occurred as recently as February 28, 1971; or more in one storm has occurred in both June and September. Hard frost is possible even into the summer, and the average window for freezing temperatures is August 20 through July 10, while for measurable (≥) snowfall, September 28 through June 11.


==Ecology==
Since the collapse of Mount Mazama due to a volcanic eruption formed Crater Lake, no fish inhabited the lake until William Gladstone Steel decided to stock it in 1888 to allow for fishing. Regular stocking continued until 1941, when it was evident that the fish could maintain a stable population without outside interference. Six species of fish were originally stocked, but only two species have survived: kokanee salmon and rainbow trout, with the former being the most plentiful. Fishing in Crater Lake is promoted because the fish species are not indigenous to the lake.

Crater Lake is also known for the &quot;Old Man of the Lake&quot;, a full-sized tree which is now a log that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for over a century. The low temperature of the water has slowed the decomposition of the wood, hence its longevity.

In 1987, scientists sent a submersible down to the depths of Crater Lake to obtain more information about the geology at the bottom of the lake, and inspect moss samples found in moss beds as deep as .

Due to several unique factors, mainly that the lake has no inlets or tributaries, the waters of Crater Lake are some of the purest in the world because of the absence of pollutants. Clarity readings from a Secchi disk have consistently been measured as being , which is very clear for any natural body of water. In 1997, scientists recorded a record clarity of .

The lake has relatively high levels of dissolved salts, total alkalinity, and conductivity. The average pH has generally ranged between 7 and 8.

== Sacred significance ==

The Klamath tribe of Native Americans, whose oral history describes their ancestors witnessing the collapse of Mount Mazama and the formation of Crater Lake, regard the lake as an &quot;abode to the Great Spirit&quot;. Klamath oral history tells of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao (a prominent feature at Crater Lake is Llao Rock). Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called &quot;giiwas&quot; in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.

== Recreation ==
Located north of the city of Klamath Falls and northeast of Medford, Crater Lake can be reached from U.S. Route 97 on the east, on the southwest by Highway 62, and on the northwest by Highway 138. Crater Lake and the remnants of Mount Mazama can be seen from Rim Drive, a road that surrounds the caldera, which is the only part within the Crater Lake National Park where vehicles are permitted. The Garfield Peak Trail, which runs east from the Crater Lake Lodge, offers views from above the lake&#x27;s surface, with Mount Shasta visible southward. Another trail runs for from Rim Drive&#x27;s eastern edge to Mount Scott, which offers views of central and southern Oregon such as the Three Sisters located north of Mazama and Mount Thielsen, also to the north. The Cleetwood trail leads for down the northern flank of the caldera rim, eventually reaching Cleetwood Cove where boat trips run from late June or early July throughout the summer season to Wizard Island. Wizard Island can be climbed, offering views of Crater Lake.

Swimming is permitted in Crater Lake, but the only legal and safe way to get to the shore is by following Cleetwood Cove trail and people can enter the water from there. Other activities include fishing and a 2-hour boat tour around the lake provided by a Park Ranger from Crater Lake National Park.

As the region lies within a national park area, collecting rocks within the vicinity is prohibited unless a permit is obtained. The park&#x27;s facilities lie at Rim Village, at the southern edge of the caldera. Lodging and camping facilities open during the summer season between May and October. No lodges, gas stations, or camping areas remain open from October through late May. Popular activities within Crater Lake National Park include biking, fishing, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing.

<doc id="106286" wikidata="Q253854" url="?curid=106286" title="Classical Latin">
<text>Classical Latin is the form of Literary Latin recognized as a literary standard by writers of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. It formed parallel to Vulgar Latin around 75 BC out of Old Latin, and developed by the 3rd century AD into Late Latin. In some later periods, the former was regarded as good or proper Latin; the latter as debased, degenerate, or corrupted. The word &quot;Latin&quot; is now understood by default to mean &quot;Classical Latin&quot;; for example, modern Latin textbooks almost exclusively teach Classical Latin.

Cicero and his contemporaries of the late republic referred to the Latin language, in contrast to other languages such as Greek, as or . They distinguished the common vernacular, however, as Vulgar Latin (&quot;sermo vulgaris&quot; and &quot;sermo vulgi&quot;), in contrast to the higher register that they called , sometimes translated as &quot;Latinity&quot;. &quot;Latinitas&quot; was also called (&quot;speech of the good families&quot;), &quot;sermo urbanus&quot; (&quot;speech of the city&quot;), and in rare cases &quot;sermo nobilis&quot; (&quot;noble speech&quot;). Besides the noun &quot;Latinitas&quot;, it was referred to with the adverb &quot;latine&quot; (&quot;in (good) Latin&quot;, literally &quot;Latinly&quot;) or its comparative &quot;latinius&quot; (&quot;in better Latin&quot;, literally &quot;more Latinly&quot;).

&quot;Latinitas&quot; was spoken and written. It was the language taught in schools. Prescriptive rules therefore applied to it, and when special subjects like poetry or rhetoric were taken into consideration, additional rules applied. Since spoken &quot;Latinitas&quot; has become extinct (in favor of subsequent registers), the rules of &quot;politus&quot; (polished) texts may give the appearance of an artificial language. However, &quot;Latinitas&quot; was a form of &quot;sermo&quot; (spoken language), and as such, retains spontaneity. No texts by Classical Latin authors are noted for the type of rigidity evidenced by stylized art, with the exception of repetitious abbreviations and stock phrases found on inscriptions.

The standards, authors and manuals from the Classical Latin period formed the model for the language taught and used in later periods across Europe and beyond. While the Latin used in different periods deviated from &quot;Classical&quot; Latin, efforts were periodically made to relearn and reapply the models of the Classical period, for instance by Alcuin during the reign of Charlemagne, and later during the Renaissance, producing the highly classicising form of Latin now known as Neo-Latin.

==Philological constructs==

===Classical===
&quot;Good Latin&quot; in philology is known as &quot;classical&quot; Latin literature. The term refers to the canonical relevance of literary works written in Latin in the late Roman Republic, and early to middle Roman Empire. &quot;[T]hat is to say, that of belonging to an exclusive group of authors (or works) that were considered to be emblematic of a certain genre.&quot; The term &quot;classicus&quot; (masculine plural &quot;classici&quot;) was devised by the Romans to translate Greek ἐγκριθέντες (encrithentes), and &quot;select&quot; which refers to authors who wrote in a form of Greek that was considered model. Before then, the term &quot;classis&quot;, in addition to being a naval fleet, was a social class in one of the diachronic divisions of Roman society in accordance with property ownership under the Roman constitution. The word is a transliteration of Greek κλῆσις (clēsis, or &quot;calling&quot;) used to rank army draftees by property from first to fifth class.

&quot;Classicus&quot; refers to those in the &quot;prima classis&quot; (&quot;first class&quot;), such as the authors of polished works of &quot;Latinitas&quot;, or &quot;sermo urbanus&quot;. It contains nuances of the certified and the authentic, or &quot;testis classicus&quot; (&quot;reliable witness&quot;). It was under this construct that Marcus Cornelius Fronto (an African-Roman lawyer and language teacher) used &quot;scriptores classici&quot; (&quot;first-class&quot; or &quot;reliable authors&quot;) in the second century AD. Their works were viewed as models of good Latin. This is the first known reference (possibly innovated during this time) to Classical Latin applied by authors, evidenced in the authentic language of their works.

===Canonical===

Imitating Greek grammarians, Romans such as Quintilian drew up lists termed &quot;indices&quot; or &quot;ordines&quot; modeled after the ones created by the Greeks, which were called &quot;pinakes&quot;. The Greek lists were considered classical, or &quot;recepti scriptores&quot; (&quot;select writers&quot;). Aulus Gellius includes authors like Plautus, who are considered writers of Old Latin and not strictly in the period of classical Latin. The classical Romans distinguished Old Latin as &quot;prisca Latinitas&quot; and not &quot;sermo vulgaris&quot;. Each author&#x27;s work in the Roman lists was considered equivalent to one in the Greek. In example, Ennius was the Latin Homer, Aeneid was the equivalent of Iliad, etc. The lists of classical authors were as far as the Roman grammarians went in developing a philology. The topic remained at that point while interest in the &quot;classici scriptores&quot; declined in the medieval period as the best form of the language yielded to medieval Latin, inferior to classical standards.

The Renaissance saw a revival in Roman culture, and with it, the return of Classic (&quot;the best&quot;) Latin. Thomas Sébillet&#x27;s &quot;Art Poétique&quot; (1548), &quot;les bons et classiques poètes françois&quot;, refers to Jean de Meun and Alain Chartier, who the first modern application of the words. According to Merriam Webster&#x27;s &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, the term classical (from &quot;classicus)&quot; entered modern English in 1599, some 50 years after its re-introduction to the continent. In Governor William Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; (1648), he referred to synods of a separatist church as &quot;classical meetings&quot;, defined by meetings between &quot;young men&quot; from New England and &quot;ancient men&quot; from Holland and England. In 1715, Laurence Echard&#x27;s &quot;Classical Geographical Dictionary&quot; was published. In 1736, Robert Ainsworth&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius&quot; turned English words and expressions into &quot;proper and classical Latin.&quot; In 1768, David Ruhnken&#x27;s &quot;Critical History of the Greek Orators&quot; recast the molded view of the classical by applying the word &quot;canon&quot; to the &quot;pinakes&quot; of orators after the Biblical canon, or list of authentic books of the Bible. In doing so, Ruhnken had secular catechism in mind.

===Ages of Latin===

In 1870, Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der Römischen Literatur&quot; (&quot;A History of Roman Literature&quot;) defined the philological notion of classical Latin through a typology similar to the Ages of Man, setting out the Golden and Silver Ages of classical Latin. Wilhem Wagner, who published Teuffel&#x27;s work in German, also produced an English translation which he published in 1873. Teuffel&#x27;s classification, still in use today (with modifications), groups classical Latin authors into periods defined by political events rather than by style.

Teuffel went on to publish other editions, but the English translation of &quot;A History of Roman Literature&quot; gained immediate success.

In 1877, Charles Thomas Cruttwell produced a similar work in English. In his preface, Cruttwell notes &quot;Teuffel&#x27;s admirable history, without which many chapters in the present work could not have attained completeness.&quot; He also credits Wagner.

Cruttwell adopts the time periods found in Teuffel&#x27;s work, but he presents a detailed analysis of style, whereas Teuffel was more concerned with history. Like Teuffel, Cruttwell encountered issues while attempting to condense the voluminous details of time periods in an effort to capture the meaning of phases found in their various writing styles. Like Teuffel, he has trouble finding a name for the first of the three periods (the current Old Latin phase), calling it &quot;from Livius to Sulla.&quot; He says the language &quot;is marked by immaturity of art and language, by a vigorous but ill-disciplined imitation of Greek poetical models, and in prose by a dry sententiousness of style, gradually giving way to a clear and fluent strength...&quot; These abstracts have little meaning to those not well-versed in Latin literature. In fact, Cruttwell admits &quot;The ancients, indeed, saw a difference between Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius, but it may be questioned whether the advance would be perceptible by us.&quot;

In time, some of Cruttwell&#x27;s ideas become established in Latin philology. While praising the application of rules to classical Latin (most intensely in the Golden Age, he says &quot;In gaining accuracy, however, classical Latin suffered a grievous loss. It became cultivated as distinct from a natural language... Spontaneity, therefore, became impossible and soon invention also ceased... In a certain sense, therefore, Latin was studied as a dead language, while it was still a living.&quot;

Also problematic in Teuffel&#x27;s scheme is its appropriateness to the concept of classical Latin. Cruttwell addresses the issue by altering the concept of the classical. The &quot;best&quot; Latin is defined as &quot;golden&quot; Latin, the second of the three periods. The other two periods (considered &quot;classical&quot;) are left hanging. By assigning the term &quot;pre-classical&quot; to Old Latin and implicating it to post-classical (or post-Augustan) and silver Latin, Cruttwell realized that his construct was not accordance with ancient usage and assertions: &quot;[T]he epithet classical is by many restricted to the authors who wrote in it [golden Latin]. It is best, however, not to narrow unnecessarily the sphere of classicity; to exclude Terence on the one hand or Tacitus and Pliny on the other, would savour of artificial restriction rather than that of a natural classification.&quot; The contradiction remains—Terence is, and is not a classical author, depending on the context.

==Authors of the Golden Age==

Teuffel&#x27;s definition of the &quot;First Period&quot; of Latin was based on inscriptions, fragments, and the literary works of the earliest known authors. Though he does use the term &quot;Old Roman&quot; at one point, most of these findings remain unnamed. Teuffel presents the Second Period in his major work, &quot;das goldene Zeitalter der römischen Literatur&quot; (&quot;Golden Age of Roman Literature&quot;), dated 671–767 AUC (83 BC – AD 14), according to his own recollection. The timeframe is marked by the dictatorship of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix and the death of the emperor Augustus. Wagner&#x27;s translation of Teuffel&#x27;s writing is as follows:

The Ciceronian Age was dated 671–711 AUC (83–43 BC), ending just after the death of Marcus Tullius Cicero. The Augustan 711–67 AUC (43 BC – 14 AD) ends with the death of Augustus. The Ciceronian Age is further divided by the consulship of Cicero in 691 AUC (63 BC) into a first and second half. Authors are assigned to these periods by years of principal achievements.

The Golden Age had already made an appearance in German philology, but in a less systematic way. In a translation of Bielfeld&#x27;s &quot;Elements of universal erudition&quot; (1770):The Second Age of Latin began about the time of Caesar [his ages are different from Teuffel&#x27;s], and ended with Tiberius. This is what is called the Augustan Age, which was perhaps of all others the most brilliant, a period at which it should seem as if the greatest men, and the immortal authors, had met together upon the earth, in order to write the Latin language in its utmost purity and perfection... and of Tacitus, his conceits and sententious style is not that of the golden age...Evidently, Teuffel received ideas about golden and silver Latin from an existing tradition and embedded them in a new system, transforming them as he thought best.

In Cruttwell&#x27;s introduction, the Golden Age is dated 80 BC – AD 14 (from Cicero to Ovid), which corresponds to Teuffel&#x27;s findings. Of the &quot;Second Period&quot;, Cruttwell paraphrases Teuffel by saying it &quot;represents the highest excellence in prose and poetry.&quot; The Ciceronian Age (known today as the &quot;Republican Period&quot;) is dated 80–42 BC, marked by the Battle of Philippi. Cruttwell omits the first half of Teuffel&#x27;s Ciceronian, and starts the Golden Age at Cicero&#x27;s consulship in 63 BC—an error perpetuated in Cruttwell&#x27;s second edition. He likely meant 80 BC, as he includes Varro in Golden Latin. Teuffel&#x27;s Augustan Age is Cruttwell&#x27;s Augustan Epoch (42 BC – 14 AD).

=== Republican ===
The literary histories list includes all authors from Canonical to the Ciceronian Age—even those whose works are fragmented or missing altogether. With the exception of a few major writers, such as Cicero, Caesar, Virgil and Catullus, ancient accounts of Republican literature praise jurists and orators whose writings, and analyses of various styles of language cannot be verified because there are no surviving records. The reputations of Aquilius Gallus, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, and many others who gained notoriety without readable works, are presumed by their association within the Golden Age. A list of canonical authors of the period whose works survived in whole or in part is shown here:
* Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC), highly influential grammarian
* Titus Pomponius Atticus (112/109 – 35/32), publisher and correspondent of Cicero
* Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BC), orator, philosopher, essayist, whose works define golden Latin prose and are used in Latin curricula beyond the elementary level
* Servius Sulpicius Rufus (106–43 BC), jurist, poet
* Decimus Laberius (105–43 BC), writer of mimes
* Marcus Furius Bibaculus (1st century BC), writer of &quot;ludicra&quot;
* Gaius Julius Caesar (100–44 BC), general, statesman, historian
* Gaius Oppius (1st century BC), secretary to Julius Caesar, probable author under Caesar&#x27;s name
* Gaius Matius (1st century BC), public figure, correspondent with Cicero
* Cornelius Nepos (100–24 BC), biographer
* Publilius Syrus (1st century BC), writer of mimes and maxims
* Quintus Cornificius (1st century BC), public figure and writer on rhetoric
* Titus Lucretius Carus (Lucretius; 94–50 BC), poet, philosopher
* Publius Nigidius Figulus (98–45 BC), public officer, grammarian
* Aulus Hirtius (90–43 BC), public officer, military historian
* Gaius Helvius Cinna (1st century BC), poet
* Marcus Caelius Rufus (87–48 BC), orator, correspondent with Cicero
* Gaius Sallustius Crispus (86–34 BC), historian
* Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (Cato the Younger; 95–46 BC), orator
* Publius Valerius Cato (1st century BC), poet, grammarian
* Gaius Valerius Catullus (Catullus; 84–54 BC), poet
* Gaius Licinius Macer Calvus (82–47 BC), orator, poet

=== Augustan ===

The Golden Age is divided by the assassination of Julius Caesar. In the wars that followed, a generation of Republican literary figures was lost. Cicero and his contemporaries were replaced by a new generation who spent their formative years under the old constructs, and forced to make their mark under the watchful eye of a new emperor. The demand for great orators had ceased, shifting to an emphasis on poetry. Other than the historian Livy, the most remarkable writers of the period were the poets Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. Although Augustus evidenced some toleration to republican sympathizers, he exiled Ovid, and imperial tolerance ended with the continuance of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

Augustan writers include:
* Publius Vergilius Maro (Virgil, spelled also as Vergil; 70 – 19 BC),
* Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65 – 8 BC), known for lyric poetry and satires
* Sextus Aurelius Propertius (50 – 15 BC), poet
* Albius Tibullus (54–19 BC), elegiac poet
* Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC – AD 18), poet
* Titus Livius (64 BC – AD 12), historian
* Grattius Faliscus (a contemporary of Ovid), poet
* Marcus Manilius (1st century BC and AD), astrologer, poet
* Gaius Julius Hyginus (64 BC – AD 17), librarian, poet, mythographer
* Marcus Verrius Flaccus (55 BC – AD 20), grammarian, philologist, calendarist
* Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (80–70 BC — after 15 BC), engineer, architect
* Marcus Antistius Labeo (d. AD 10 or 11), jurist, philologist
* Lucius Cestius Pius (1st century BC &amp; AD), Latin educator
* Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus (1st century BC), historian, naturalist
* Marcus Porcius Latro (late 1st century BC – early 1st century AD), rhetorician
* Gaius Valgius Rufus (consul 12 BC), poet

== Authors of the Silver Age ==
In his second volume, &quot;Imperial Period&quot;, Teuffel initiated a slight alteration in approach, making it clear that his terms applied to Latin and not just to the period. He also changed his dating scheme from AUC to modern BC/AD. Though he introduces &quot;das silberne Zeitalter der römischen Literatur&quot;, (The Silver Age of Roman Literature) from the death of Augustus to the death of Trajan (14–117 AD), he also mentions parts of a work by Seneca the Elder, a &quot;wenig Einfluss der silbernen Latinität&quot; (a slight influence of silver Latin). It is clear that his mindset had shifted from Golden and Silver Ages to Golden and Silver Latin, also to include &quot;Latinitas&quot;, which at this point must be interpreted as Classical Latin. He may have been influenced in that regard by one of his sources E. Opitz, who in 1852 had published &quot;specimen lexilogiae argenteae latinitatis&quot;, which includes Silver Latinity. Though Teuffel&#x27;s First Period was equivalent to Old Latin and his Second Period was equal to the Golden Age, his Third Period &quot;die römische Kaiserheit&quot; encompasses both the Silver Age and the centuries now termed Late Latin, in which the forms seemed to break loose from their foundation and float freely. That is, men of literature were confounded about the meaning of &quot;good Latin.&quot; The last iteration of Classical Latin is known as Silver Latin. The Silver Age is the first of the Imperial Period, and is divided into &quot;die Zeit der julischen Dynastie (&quot;14–68); &quot;die Zeit der flavischen Dynastie&quot; (69–96), and &quot;die Zeit des Nerva und Trajan&quot; (96–117). Subsequently, Teuffel goes over to a century scheme: 2nd, 3rd, etc., through 6th. His later editions (which came about towards the end of the 19th century) divide the Imperial Age into parts: 1st century (Silver Age), 2nd century (the Hadrian and the Antonines), and the 3rd through 6th centuries. Of the Silver Age proper, Teuffel points out that anything like freedom of speech had vanished with Tiberius:

The content of new literary works was continually proscribed by the emperor, who exiled or executed existing authors and played the role of literary man, himself (typically badly). Artists therefore went into a repertory of new and dazzling mannerisms, which Teuffel calls &quot;utter unreality.&quot; Cruttwell picks up this theme:


In Cruttwell&#x27;s view (which had not been expressed by Teuffel), Silver Latin was a &quot;rank, weed-grown garden,&quot; a &quot;decline.&quot; Cruttwell had already decried what he saw as a loss of spontaneity in Golden Latin. Teuffel regarded the Silver Age as a loss of natural language, and therefore of spontaneity, implying that it was last seen in the Golden Age. Instead, Tiberius brought about a &quot;sudden collapse of letters.&quot; The idea of a decline had been dominant in English society since Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Once again, Cruttwell evidences some unease with his stock pronouncements: &quot;The &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny shows how much remained to be done in fields of great interest.&quot; The idea of Pliny as a model is not consistent with any sort of decline. Moreover, Pliny did his best work under emperors who were as tolerant as Augustus had been. To include some of the best writings of the Silver Age, Cruttwell extended the period through the death of Marcus Aurelius (180 AD). The philosophic prose of a good emperor was in no way compatible with either Teuffel&#x27;s view of unnatural language, or Cruttwell&#x27;s depiction of a decline. Having created these constructs, the two philologists found they could not entirely justify them. Apparently, in the worst implication of their views, there was no such thing as Classical Latin by the ancient definition, and some of the very best writing of any period in world history was deemed stilted, degenerate, unnatural language.

The Silver Age furnishes the only two extant Latin novels: Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; and Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;.

===Through the death of Marcus Aurelius, 180 AD===
Of the additional century granted by Cruttwell to Silver Latin, Teuffel says: &quot;The second century was a happy period for the Roman State, the happiest indeed during the whole Empire... But in the world of letters the lassitude and enervation, which told of Rome&#x27;s decline, became unmistakeable... its forte is in imitation.&quot; Teuffel, however, excepts the jurists; others find other &quot;exceptions&quot;, recasting Teuffels&#x27;s view.

==Stylistic shifts==
Style of language refers to repeatable features of speech that are somewhat less general than the fundamental characteristics of a language. The latter provides unity, allowing it to be referred to by a single name. Thus Old Latin, Classical Latin, Vulgar Latin, etc., are not considered different languages, but are all referred to by the term, Latin. This is an ancient practice continued by moderns rather than a philological innovation of recent times. That Latin had case endings is a fundamental feature of the language. Whether a given form of speech prefers to use prepositions such as &quot;ad&quot;, &quot;ex&quot;, &quot;de,&quot; for &quot;to&quot;, &quot;from&quot; and &quot;of&quot; rather than simple case endings is a matter of style. Latin has a large number of styles. Each and every author has a style, which typically allows his prose or poetry to be identified by experienced Latinists. Problems in comparative literature have risen out of group styles finding similarity by period, in which case one may speak of Old Latin, Silver Latin, Late Latin as styles or a phase of styles.

The ancient authors themselves first defined style by recognizing different kinds of &quot;sermo&quot;, or &quot;speech&quot;. By valuing Classical Latin as &quot;first class&quot;, it was better to write with &quot;Latinitas&quot; selected by authors who were attuned to literary and upper-class languages of the city as a standardized style. All &quot;sermo&quot; that differed from it was a different style. Thus, in rhetoric, Cicero was able to define sublime, intermediate, and low styles within Classical Latin. St. Augustine recommended low style for sermons. Style was to be defined by deviation in speech from a standard. Teuffel termed this standard &quot;Golden Latin&quot;.

John Edwin Sandys, who was an authority in Latin style for several decades, summarizes the differences between Golden and Silver Latin as follows:

Silver Latin is to be distinguished by:

* &quot;an exaggerated conciseness and point&quot;
* &quot;occasional archaic words and phrases derived from poetry&quot;
* &quot;increase in the number of Greek words in ordinary use&quot; (the Emperor Claudius in Suetonius refers to &quot;both our languages,&quot; Latin and Greek)
* &quot;literary reminiscences&quot;
* &quot;The literary use of words from the common dialect&quot; (&quot;dictare&quot; and &quot;dictitare&quot; as well as classical &quot;dicere&quot;, &quot;to say&quot;)

<doc id="106289" wikidata="Q977919" url="?curid=106289" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)">
<text>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a 1982 adventure video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600 and based on the film of the same name. The game&#x27;s objective is to guide the eponymous character through various screens to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.

The game was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw, who intended it to be an innovative adaptation, but Atari held unrealistic expectations for sales based on the international box-office success of the film. Negotiations for the game rights ended in late July 1982, giving Warshaw just over five weeks to develop the game in time to meet the production schedule for the 1982 Christmas season. The final release received negative reviews. The game is often cited as one of the worst of all time and one of the biggest commercial failures in video game history. It is cited as a major contributing factor to the video game crash of 1983, and has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture as a cautionary tale about the dangers of rushed game development and studio interference.

In what was once deemed only an urban legend, reports from 1983 stated that as a result of overproduction and returns, unsold cartridges were secretly buried in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, and covered with a layer of concrete. In April 2014, diggers hired to investigate the claim confirmed that the landfill contained several &quot;E.T.&quot; cartridges, among other games. James Heller, the former Atari manager who was in charge of the burial, was at the excavation, and admitted to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various games (not just &quot;E.T.&quot;) were buried. Marty Goldberg, co-author of the book &quot;Atari Inc.: Business Is Fun&quot;, added that the dump was in fact a clearing out of the Texas Atari manufacturing plant&#x27;s unused cartridge stock of a number of titles, as well as console and computer parts. According to , only 10% of the approximately 1,300 recovered were &quot;E.T.&quot; cartridges.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;E.T.&quot; is an adventure game in which players control the alien E.T. from a top-down perspective. The objective is to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). There is no overall time limit. The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese&#x27;s Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. Once the call is made, a clock appears at the top right of the screen; E.T. has to arrive at the landing zone before it reaches zero. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on-screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliott will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player finds a geranium in one of the wells. According to the manual, a game can end &quot;when E.T. runs out of energy or when you decide to quit playing&quot;.

The game is divided into six environments, each representing a different setting from the film. To accomplish the objective, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective.

== Development ==
Following the commercial success of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; in June 1982, Steve Ross, CEO of Atari&#x27;s parent company Warner Communications, began negotiations with the film&#x27;s director Steven Spielberg and its distributor Universal Pictures to acquire a license to produce a video game based on the film. Later that month, Warner announced its exclusive worldwide rights to market coin-operated and console games based on &quot;E.T.&quot; Although the exact details of the transaction were not disclosed in the announcement, it was later reported that Atari had paid ( when adjusted for inflation to ) for the rights, a high figure for video game licensing at the time. When asked by Ross what he thought about making an &quot;E.T.&quot;-based video game, Atari CEO Ray Kassar replied: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a dumb idea. We&#x27;ve never really made an action game out of a movie.&quot; An arcade game based on the &quot;E.T.&quot; property had also been planned, but this was deemed to be impossible given the short deadline.

On July 27, 1982, after negotiations were completed, Kassar called Howard Scott Warshaw to commission him as developer of the video game adaptation. Kassar informed him that Spielberg asked for Warshaw specifically and that development had to be completed by September 1 to meet a production schedule for the Christmas holiday season. Although Warshaw had spent over a year working on consecutive development schedules for games (seven months working on &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot; and six months on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;), he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg&#x27;s request. Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based on a film he enjoyed, &quot;provided we reach the right arrangement&quot;. Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw and an all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii in compensation. Warshaw was flown via private jet to Warner Brothers Studios to meet with Spielberg.

Warshaw used those days to design the structure and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, the path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a six-sided world that players could &quot;float&quot; around as the setting, and adapted part of the film&#x27;s plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. The player would need to gather parts for a phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. Warshaw considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the film, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game world.

Warshaw and other Atari executives presented this design to Spielberg, who was not enthusiastic. According to Warshaw, Spielberg asked him: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t you do something more like &quot;Pac-Man&quot;?&quot; Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality he saw in the original film. (Warshaw later stated that, in retrospect, Spielberg&#x27;s idea might have had merit.) He spent the remaining time programming. Atari graphic designer Jerome Domurat assisted Warshaw with creating graphics for the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability of the video game industry at the time. Due to time limitations, Atari skipped audience testing. Emanual Gerard, then part of the Office of the President of Warner, later suggested that the company had fallen into a false sense of security by the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.

== Reception ==
Anticipation for the &quot;E.T.&quot; video game was high, and Atari was hoping it would be a sought-after Christmas gift. In early December 1982, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that video games based on successful films, specifically &quot;E.T.&quot;, would become &quot;an increasingly profitable source&quot; for video game development. At first, retailers ordered more supplies than what was expected to be sold, but Atari received an increasing number of order cancellations as new competitors entered the market, which the company had not anticipated. John Hubner and William Kistner of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; have attributed the cancellations to changes Atari initiated in its relationship to distributors. On November 1, 1982, Atari informed them that their contracts were canceled and that exclusive deals would be established with select distributors. Hubner and Kistner believed the action prompted retailers to cancel orders, which Atari had not properly tracked.

&quot;E.T.&quot; enjoyed initial commercial success, being among the top four on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 15 Video Games&quot; sales list in December 1982 and January 1983. The game sold over copies by the end of 1982. However, at least 669,000 copies were later returned in 1983. One retailer said that &quot;mostly grandmothers&quot; bought the game; because of word-of-mouth, children preferred the best-selling &quot;Pitfall!&quot;

Hubner and Kistner commented that the large number of produced cartridges may have resulted in excess inventory regardless of &quot;E.T.&quot;″s success. Even though the game was a bestseller during the holiday season, retailers still stated that its sales figures did not meet expectations. Warner Communications also expressed disappointment at the number of sales. Lower-than-expected sales figures combined with excess inventory, which produced a negative supply and demand event, prompted retailers to repeatedly discount the price. According to Ray Kassar, about three and a half million of the four million produced were sent back to the company as unsold inventory or customer returns. Despite sales figures, the quantity of unsold merchandise, coupled with the expensive film license and the large number of returns, made &quot;E.T.&quot; a major financial failure for Atari.

=== Critical response ===
While reviews of the film were acclaimed, the game was largely received negatively by critics, with common complaints focused on the gameplay and visuals. In contemporary reviews, &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s Nicholas Pileggi described it as a loser when compared to other games Atari could have released during the time period, such as &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Frogger&quot;, and &quot;Video Games&quot; called it &quot;really for kids (the littler ones)&quot;. In 1984, &quot;Softline&quot; readers named the game the second-worst Atari program of 1983, after &quot;Congo Bongo&quot;.

Nevertheless, the game received some positive contemporary reviews. An editor for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; described it as a difficult game to learn to play, but believed it was worth dedicating the time. &quot;Vidiot&quot;″s Kevin Christopher criticized the protagonist&#x27;s repeated falling down back into holes, but considered it &quot;about the only flaw with an otherwise A-1 game.&quot; &quot;Arcade Express&quot; scored it six out of ten in December 1982. Len Albin of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that &quot;after seeing the motion picture &quot;E.T.&quot; 14 times, there&#x27;s no more suspense left—unless you bring home this one-player cartridge&quot;, adding that &quot;it’s certain that your patience won&#x27;t run out—if you&#x27;re a kid. (Adults may prefer to wait for a game based on &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;.)&quot;

In much later reviews, Kevin Bowen of GameSpy&#x27;s Classic Gaming called the gameplay &quot;convoluted and inane&quot;, also criticizing its story for departing from the serious tone of the film, and author Steven Kent described the game as &quot;infamous&quot; within the industry, citing &quot;primitive&quot; graphics, &quot;dull&quot; gameplay, and a &quot;disappointing story&quot;. Modern critics have also bemoaned the gameplay&#x27;s repetitive use of falling down holes. Emru Townsend of &quot;PC World&quot; discussed the game with a group, and found a universal dislike for the pits that E.T. falls into, describing it as &quot;monotonous&quot;. Writer Sean &quot;Seanbaby&quot; Reiley also criticized the pits, claiming that they are &quot;time-consuming&quot; and &quot;difficult to leave without falling back in&quot;. Trent Ward, a former &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer, commented that this element prompted him to immediately return the game for a refund after purchasing it in his youth, and the children who found games in the New Mexico landfill gave the &quot;E.T.&quot; cartridges away because, as one later said, the &quot;game sucked ... you couldn&#x27;t finish it&quot;. Classic Gaming argued that despite the negative reception, the game can be enjoyable after the player has learned to navigate the pits.

In published materials written more than a decade after its initial release, &quot;E.T.&quot; has been universally panned by critics and is frequently listed as the worst video game ever made. Reiley ranked it number one in a list of the 20 worst games of all time in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 150th issue. Michael Dolan, deputy editor of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine, said it was the worst video game of all time. Townsend placed &quot;E.T.&quot; at the top of his list of worst video games, and said that &quot;about a third of the people I quizzed came up with this title almost instantly, and it&#x27;s not hard to see why.&quot; GameTrailers ranked it second worst on their &quot;Top Ten Best and Worst Games of All Time&quot; list.

Critics often attribute the poor quality to the short development time. Townsend commented that the rushed development was very apparent. Warshaw&#x27;s contributions have been met with mixed responses. Classic Gaming called the game poorly designed, while &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Levi Buchanan stated the &quot;impossibly tight schedule&quot; given to Warshaw absolves him of blame. Warshaw does not express regret for his part in &quot;E.T.&quot;, and believes he created a good game given the time available to him.

== Impact ==
&quot;E.T.&quot; is often cited as one of the most important video games. &quot;GamePro&quot;, GameTrailers and Bowen cite the game as the first poor quality-film–video-game tie-in. Patrick O&#x27;Luanaigh of SCi Games called it the most famous disaster story among film-inspired video games as well as within the industry. GamePro publication named it second-worst movie game ever, citing it as an example of how poor gameplay can bring negative reception to strong licenses.

===Effect on Atari===
As early as January 1983, after Atari admitted that the game had sold poorly, an industry executive said that &quot;the lesson of &quot;E.T.&quot; has not been lost on the industry&quot;. The game is associated as a cause of the video game industry crisis of 1983. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Earl Paige reported that the large number of unsold &quot;E.T.&quot; games, along with an increase in competition, prompted retailers to demand official return programs from video game manufacturers. However, even before &quot;E.T&quot; was released, the industry was in an overall economic downturn from multiple factors, and &quot;E.T&quot; itself did not contribute greatly to the collapse, outside of Atari, by mid-1983. The release timing led to the game gaining the reputation of being responsible for the 1983 crash.

By the end of 1982, Atari had begun to lose dominance as more competitors entered the market. GameSpy&#x27;s Classic Gaming called &quot;E.T.&quot; Atari&#x27;s biggest mistake, as well as the largest financial failure in the industry. Reiley commented that the game&#x27;s poor quality was responsible for ending the product life of the Atari 2600. Occurring soon after &quot;Pac-Man&quot;″s negative critical response on the Atari 2600, &quot;E.T.&quot;″s poor reception was attributed by Kent to have had a negative impact on Atari&#x27;s reputation and profitability. Authors Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost echoed similar comments about &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot;″s combined effect on the company&#x27;s reputation and the industry&#x27;s reaction. Buchanan also cited the game as a factor in Atari and the industry&#x27;s crash. He stated that the large amount of unsold merchandise was a financial burden to Atari, which pushed the company into debt.

==Legacy==
=== Atari video game burial ===
In September 1983, the &quot;Alamogordo Daily News&quot; of Alamogordo, New Mexico, reported in a series of articles that between ten and twenty semi-trailer truckloads of Atari boxes, cartridges, and systems from an Atari storehouse in El Paso, Texas, were crushed and buried at the landfill within the city, which was covered with concrete. It was Atari&#x27;s first dealings with the landfill, which was chosen because no scavenging was allowed and its garbage was crushed and buried nightly. Atari officials and others gave differing reports of what was buried, but it has been speculated that most unsold copies of &quot;E.T.&quot; are buried in this landfill, crushed and encased in cement. The story of the buried cartridges was erroneously regarded by some as an urban legend, with skeptics—including Warshaw—disregarding the official accounts.

On May 28, 2013, the Alamogordo City Commission approved Fuel Industries, an Ottawa-based entertainment company, for six months of landfill access both to create a documentary about the legend and to excavate the burial site. On April 26, 2014, remnants of &quot;E.T.&quot; and other Atari games were discovered in the early hours of the excavation. The burial of the E.T. cartridges was also the basis for the independent 2014 science fiction comedy &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie&quot;, based on the webseries of the same name, and featured Howard Scott Warshaw.

In December 2014, the Smithsonian Institution added an excavated cartridge of &quot;E.T.&quot; to their collection. In 2015, The Henry Ford museum added several excavated cartridges and a video touchpad, a sample of landfill dirt taken from the site of the burial, and items of clothing worn by the excavation team to their collection. A selection of these items are on permanent display. The Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, England, also received some artefacts from the desert, which are on permanent display in the museum gallery.

=== Attempts to improve the game ===
In 2006, Dennis Debro disassembled &quot;E.T.&quot;, added comments to the generated source code, and released it to the public. In January 2013, programmer David Richardson released several unofficial fixes for the game. Patches included the removal of pixel-perfect collision detection, which caused E.T. to fall into a pit every time his sprite touched a pit entry.

<doc id="106291" wikidata="Q2029259" url="?curid=106291" title="Ultracentrifuge">
<text>An ultracentrifuge is a centrifuge optimized for spinning a rotor at very high speeds, capable of generating acceleration as high as (approx. ). There are two kinds of ultracentrifuges, the preparative and the analytical ultracentrifuge. Both classes of instruments find important uses in molecular biology, biochemistry, and polymer science.

==History==
In 1924 Theodor Svedberg built a centrifuge capable of generating 7,000 g (at 12,000 rpm), and called it the ultracentrifuge, to juxtapose it with the Ultramicroscope that had been developed previously. In 1925-1926 Svedberg constructed a new ultracentrifuge that permitted fields up to 100,000 g (42,000 rpm). Modern ultracentrifuges are typically classified as allowing greater than 100,000 g. Svedberg won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1926 for his research on colloids and proteins using the ultracentrifuge.

In early 1930s, Émile Henriot found that suitably placed jets of compressed air can spin a bearingless top to very high speeds and developed an ultracentrifuge on that principle. Jesse Beams from the Physics Department at the University of Virginia first adapted that principle to a high-speed camera, and then started improving Henriot&#x27;s ultracentrifuge, but his rotors consistently overheated.

Beam&#x27;s student Edward Greydon Pickels solved the problem in 1935 by vacuumizing the system, which allowed a reduction in friction generated at high speeds. Vacuum systems also enabled the maintenance of constant temperature across the sample, eliminating convection currents that interfered with the interpretation of sedimentation results.
In 1946, Pickels cofounded Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.) to market analytical and preparative ultracentrifuges based on his design. Pickels considered his design to be too complicated for commercial use and developed a more easily operated, “foolproof” version. But even with the enhanced design, sales of analytical centrifuges remained low, and Spinco almost went bankrupt. The company survived by concentrating on sales of preparative ultracentrifuge models, which were becoming popular as workhorses in biomedical laboratories. In 1949, Spinco introduced the Model L, the first preparative ultracentrifuge to reach a maximum speed of 40,000 rpm. In 1954, Beckman Instruments (later Beckman Coulter) purchased the company, forming the basis of its Spinco centrifuge division.

==Instrumentation==
Ultracentrifuges are available with a wide variety of rotors suitable for a great range of experiments. Most rotors are designed to hold tubes that contain the samples. &quot;Swinging bucket rotors&quot; allow the tubes to hang on hinges so the tubes reorient to the horizontal as the rotor initially accelerate. &quot;Fixed angle rotors&quot; are made of a single block of material and hold the tubes in cavities bored at a predetermined angle. &quot;Zonal rotors&quot; are designed to contain a large volume of sample in a single central cavity rather than in tubes. Some zonal rotors are capable of dynamic loading and unloading of samples while the rotor is spinning at high speed.

Preparative rotors are used in biology for pelleting of fine particulate fractions, such as cellular organelles (mitochondria, microsomes, ribosomes) and viruses. They can also be used for gradient separations, in which the tubes are filled from top to bottom with an increasing concentration of a dense substance in solution. Sucrose gradients are typically used for separation of cellular organelles. Gradients of caesium salts are used for separation of nucleic acids. After the sample has spun at high speed for sufficient time to produce the separation, the rotor is allowed to come to a smooth stop and the gradient is gently pumped out of each tube to isolate the separated components.

==Hazards==
The tremendous rotational kinetic energy of the rotor in an operating ultracentrifuge makes the catastrophic failure of a spinning rotor a serious concern, as it can explode spectacularly. Rotors conventionally have been made from high strength-to-weight metals such as aluminum or titanium. The stresses of routine use and harsh chemical solutions eventually cause rotors to deteriorate. Proper use of the instrument and rotors within recommended limits and careful maintenance of rotors to prevent corrosion and to detect deterioration is necessary to mitigate this risk.

More recently some rotors have been made of lightweight carbon fiber composite material, which are up to 60% lighter, resulting in faster acceleration/deceleration rates. Carbon fiber composite rotors also are corrosion-resistant, eliminating a major cause of rotor failure.

<text>A catecholamine (; abbreviated CA) is a monoamine neurotransmitter, an organic compound that has a catechol (benzene with two hydroxyl side groups next to each other) and a side-chain amine.

Catechol can be either a free molecule or a substituent of a larger molecule, where it represents a 1,2-dihydroxybenzene group.

Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid tyrosine, which is derived from dietary sources as well as synthesis from phenylalanine. Catecholamines are water-soluble and are 50% bound to plasma proteins in circulation.

Included among catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and dopamine. Release of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands is part of the fight-or-flight response.

Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine.

Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues.

==Structure==
Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain.

==Production and degradation==
===Location===

Catecholamines are produced mainly by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and the postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. Dopamine, which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is largely produced in neuronal cell bodies in two areas of the brainstem: the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra, the latter of which contains neuromelanin-pigmented neurons. The similarly neuromelanin-pigmented cell bodies of the locus coeruleus produce norepinephrine. Epinephrine is produced in small groups of neurons in the human brain which express its synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase; these neurons project from a nucleus that is adjacent (ventrolateral) to the area postrema and from a nucleus in the dorsal region of the solitary tract.

===Biosynthesis===

Dopamine is the first catecholamine synthesized from DOPA. In turn, norepinephrine and epinephrine are derived from further metabolic modification of dopamine. The enzyme dopamine hydroxylase requires copper as a cofactor (not shown in the diagram) and DOPA decarboxylase requires PLP (not shown in the diagram). The rate limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis through the predominant metabolic pathway is the hydroxylation of -tyrosine to -DOPA.

Catecholamine synthesis is inhibited by alpha-methyl-&quot;p&quot;-tyrosine (AMPT), which inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase.

The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine are precursors for catecholamines. Both amino acids are found in high concentrations in blood plasma and the brain. In mammals, tyrosine can be formed from dietary phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, found in large amounts in the liver. Insufficient amounts of phenylalanine hydroxylase result in phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder that leads to intellectual deficits unless treated by dietary manipulation. Catecholamine synthesis is usually considered to begin with tyrosine. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts the amino acid -tyrosine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (-DOPA). The hydroxylation of -tyrosine by TH results in the formation of the DA precursor -DOPA, which is metabolized by aromatic -amino acid decarboxylase (AADC; see Cooper et al., 2002) to the transmitter dopamine. This step occurs so rapidly that it is difficult to measure -DOPA in the brain without first inhibiting AADC. In neurons that use DA as the transmitter, the decarboxylation of -DOPA to dopamine is the final step in formation of the transmitter; however, in those neurons using norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine (adrenaline) as transmitters, the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), which converts dopamine to yield norepinephrine, is also present. In still other neurons in which epinephrine is the transmitter, a third enzyme phenylethanolamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (PNMT) converts norepinephrine into epinephrine. Thus, a cell that uses epinephrine as its transmitter contains four enzymes (TH, AADC, DBH, and PNMT), whereas norepinephrine neurons contain only three enzymes (lacking PNMT) and dopamine cells only two (TH and AADC).

===Degradation===

Catecholamines have a half-life of a few minutes when circulating in the blood. They can be degraded either by methylation by catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferases (COMT) or by deamination by monoamine oxidases (MAO).

MAOIs bind to MAO, thereby preventing it from breaking down catecholamines and other monoamines.
Catabolism of catecholamines is mediated by two main enzymes: catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase (COMT) which is present in the synaptic cleft and cytosol of the cell and monoamine oxidase (MAO) which is located in the mitochondrial membrane. Both enzymes require cofactors: COMT uses Mg2+ as a cofactor while MAO uses FAD. The first step of the catabolic process is mediated by either MAO or COMT which depends on the tissue and location of catecholamines (for example degradation of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft is mediated by COMT because MAO is a mitochondrial enzyme). The next catabolic steps in the pathway involve alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and aldehyde reductase. The end product of epinephrine and norepinephrine is vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) which is excreted in the urine. Dopamine catabolism leads to the production of homovanillic acid (HVA).

==Function==

===Modality===
Two catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine, act as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and as hormones in the blood circulation. The catecholamine norepinephrine is a neuromodulator of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system but is also present in the blood (mostly through &quot;spillover&quot; from the synapses of the sympathetic system).

High catecholamine levels in blood are associated with stress, which can be induced from psychological reactions or environmental stressors such as elevated sound levels, intense light, or low blood sugar levels.

Extremely high levels of catecholamines (also known as catecholamine toxicity) can occur in central nervous system trauma due to stimulation or damage of nuclei in the brainstem, in particular, those nuclei affecting the sympathetic nervous system. In emergency medicine, this occurrence is widely known as a &quot;catecholamine dump&quot;.

Extremely high levels of catecholamine can also be caused by neuroendocrine tumors in the adrenal medulla, a treatable condition known as pheochromocytoma.

High levels of catecholamines can also be caused by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) deficiency, known as Brunner syndrome. As MAO-A is one of the enzymes responsible for degradation of these neurotransmitters, its deficiency increases the bioavailability of these neurotransmitters considerably. It occurs in the absence of pheochromocytoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and carcinoid syndrome, but it looks similar to carcinoid syndrome with symptoms such as facial flushing and aggression.

Acute porphyria can cause elevated catecholamines.

===Effects===
Catecholamines cause general physiological changes that prepare the body for physical activity (the fight-or-flight response). Some typical effects are increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and a general reaction of the sympathetic nervous system. Some drugs, like tolcapone (a central COMT-inhibitor), raise the levels of all the catecholamines. Increased catecholamines may also cause an increased respiratory rate (tachypnoea) in patients.

Catecholamine is secreted into urine after being broken down, and its secretion level can be measured for the diagnosis of illnesses associated with catecholamine levels in the body. Urine testing for catecholamine is used to detect pheochromocytoma.

===Function in plants===

== Testing for catecholamines ==
Catecholamines are secreted by cells in tissues of different systems of the human body, mostly by the nervous and the endocrine systems. The adrenal glands secrete certain catecholamines into the blood when the person is physically or mentally stressed and this is usually a healthy physiological response. However, acute or chronic excess of circulating catecholamines can potentially increase blood pressure and heart rate to very high levels and eventually provoke dangerous effects. Tests for fractionated plasma free metanephrines or the urine metanephrines are used to confirm or exclude certain diseases when the doctor identifies signs of hypertension and tachycardia that don&#x27;t adequately respond to treatment. Each of the tests measure the amount of adrenaline and noradrenaline metabolites, respectively called metanephrine and normetanephrine.

Blood tests are also done to analyze the amount of catecholamines present in the body.

Catecholamine tests are done to identify rare tumors at the adrenal gland or in the nervous system. Catecholamine tests provide information relative to tumors such as: pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma.

<text>The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) is an L band Distributed Time Division Multiple Access (DTDMA) network radio system used by the United States Department of Defense and their allies to support data communications needs, principally in the air and missile defense community. It produces a spread spectrum signal using Frequency-shift keying (FSK) and Phase-shift keying (PSK) to spread the radiated power over a wider spectrum (range of frequencies) than normal radio transmissions. This reduces susceptibility to noise, jamming, and interception. In JTIDS Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (similar to cell phone technology), each time interval (e.g., 1 second) is divided into time slots (e.g. 128 per second). Together, all 1536 time slots in a 12-second interval are called a &quot;frame&quot;. Each time slot is &quot;bursted&quot; (transmitted) at several different carrier frequencies sequentially. Within each slot, the phase angle of the transmission burst is varied to provide PSK. Each type of data to be transmitted is assigned a slot or block of slots (channel) to manage information exchanges among user participation groups. In traditional TDMA, the slot frequencies remain fixed from second to second (frame to frame). In JTIDS TDMA, the slot frequencies and/or slot assignments for each channel do not remain fixed from frame to frame but are varied in a pseudo-random manner. The slot assignments, frequencies, and information are all encrypted to provide computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform to include Air Force fighters and Navy submarines.

The full development of JTIDS commenced in 1981 when a contract was placed with Singer-Kearfott (later GEC-Marconi Electronic Systems, now BAE Systems E&amp;IS). Fielding proceeded slowly throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s with rapid expansion (following 9/11) in preparation for Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Development is now carried out by Data Link Solutions, a joint BAE/Rockwell Collins company, ViaSat, and the MIDS International consortium.

== About ==
JTIDS is one of the family of radio equipment implementing what is called Link 16. Link 16, a highly-survivable radio communications design to meet the most stringent requirements of modern combat, provides reliable Situational Awareness (SA) for fast-moving forces. Link 16 equipment has proven, in detailed field demonstrations as well as in the AWACS and JSTARS deployment in Desert Storm, the capability of basic Link 16 to exchange user data at 115 kbit/s, error-correction-coded. (Compare this to typical tactical systems at 16 kbit/s, which also have to accommodate overheads in excess of 50% to supply the same transmission reliability.)

While principally a data network, Link 16 radios can provide high quality voice channels and navigation services as accurate as any in the inventory. Every Link 16 user can identify itself to other similarly equipped platforms at ranges well beyond what Mark XII Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems can provide. Additionally, Link 16-equipped platforms capable of identification through other means (such as radar and TENCAP Blue Force Tracking) can pass that &quot;indirect&quot; identification data as part of its SA exchange. The capabilities of Link 16 are best represented by the JTIDS or its follow-on Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) terminals. The TADIL-J message format forms the basis for the mandates in the DoD Tactical Data Link Management Plan.

There are benefits to the full-scale implementation of the two key elements of Link-16: (1) the message &quot;catalog&quot; and (2) the specific radio waveform (i.e., frequency hopped, Lx-band CPSM, spread-spectrum and Reed–Solomon coding, omni-directional broadcast). Link 16 terminals implement the &quot;NI&quot; node-to-node protocols as well as one or more of the ICD-compliant user interfaces.

==Origin and history==

JTIDS began with an advanced planning study sponsored by the Air Force Electronic Systems Division (ESD) Advanced Plans (XR) at L.G. Hanscom Air Force Base. The study was conducted by the MITRE Corporation in 1967 and the principal investigators were Vic Desmarines who later became MITRE President and Gordon Welchman who had been instrumental in breaking the German Enigma machine code as the head of &quot;Hut 6&quot; at Bletchley Park, England. Gordon wrote a book titled &quot;The Hut 6 Story&quot; which described his activities and contains some additional information about his work at MITRE. The study concluded that on the battlefield valuable information was available that was not getting to the combat forces that needed it because of fundamental deficiencies in communications architecture. Gordon suggested a radical architecture where elements that had critical information could broadcast it and units that needed the information could selectively process what was of immediate value. This was a significant departure from the circuit-oriented communications architectures then in use and a way to eliminate overcrowding and confusion in the radio nets used to interconnect aircraft and some ground forces. A second recommendation was the need for a consistent and reliable basis for position which was available to all combat elements dubbed a &quot;Common Position Grid&quot;. The overall study was called &quot;Control and Surveillance of Friendly Forces&quot; CASOFF.

The advanced planning study was well received both at MITRE and ESD and it was decided to pursue a practical design to see if these ideas could be translated into a usable system. In 1968 MITRE Technical Director John H. Monahan appointed C. Eric Ellingson to head this effort and Ellingson put together a technical team to pursue these ideas. Early on it became apparent that the CASOFF architecture was sufficiently radical that a &quot;proof of concept&quot; activity was needed to better understand and ultimately demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of such an approach. The demonstration system used a synchronized Time Division Multiple Access architecture and incorporated position location as an integral part of the communications process. Because funds were extremely limited every effort was made to use already available equipment. Transmitters were surplus AN/APX-25 IFF transponders and data processing was accomplished using surplus IBM 4piTC-2 computers that were obtained from the F-111 terrain avoidance program. The unique components called the Control and Display Units (CDU) were built in the MITRE laboratory.

By 1970 an operating TDMA system had been constructed and ground stations were installed at Boston Hill in Andover MA, Millstone Hill in Groton MA, MITRE in Bedford, MA and Prospect Hill in Waltham, MA. An airborne terminal was also installed in an ESD T-29 Navigation Trainer. Tests of both the communications architecture and position location capability were conducted and the overall system design was shown to be practical. Note that this demonstration preceded GPS, Ethernet and the internet each of which incorporated similar principles. It is also worth noting that these experiments would not have been possible without the support of John Klotz of DOD/DDR&amp;E.

In 1972 General Ken Russell, the AWACS System Program Office chief asked Ellingson if MITRE could support a 1973 demonstration of AWACS to key NATO personnel in Europe. The idea was to bring the AWACS data to the ground command and control centers in selected locations throughout Europe to show how AWACS could augment their existing air defense capability. Russell thought that the MITRE CASOFF demonstration system could do the job. Ellingson responded in the affirmative and immediately set about to implement the needed interfaces with the various NATO systems and equipping a KC135 aircraft that was to be used as a relay.

In 1973 the AWACS demonstration took place with interfaces to the British Linesman system, the French Strida II system, the NATO Ground Environment System in Germany and an element of the U.S. 407L Tactical Command and Control System in Belgium and 407L systems at Sembach and Neu Ulm in Germany. An Army NIKE site at the Fliegerhorst Caserne near Hanau Germany was also equipped. The demonstration was very successful and generated great NATO interest in both AWACS and JTIDS.

During this period the name of the program underwent several iterations. John Klotz didn&#x27;t like acronyms and dubbed the program &quot;Tactical Position Location/Common Grid Capability&quot; which immediately became Tipplekeg. Next the program was called Position Location Reporting and Control of Tactical Aircraft (PLRACTA). At the time of the first European demonstration the program was known as Seek Bus. Finally in 1973 DOD created a joint program office with the Air Force as Executive agent and Col. Breeden Brentnall was appointed as System Program Office Chief. The Joint Service SPO was co-located with Ellingson&#x27;s development group at MITRE. From then on, the program was officially known as Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). However, since NATO didn&#x27;t use the term &quot;joint&quot; in their system descriptions, the Class 1 Hughes Improved Terminal (HIT) installed on the NATO E-3A was referred to in Boeing documentation as the &quot;ECM Resistant Communications System (ERCS).&quot;

A second European demonstration of AWACS and JTIDS was conducted in 1975 under the direction of AWACS SPO Director Gen. (Larry) Lawrence A. Skantze. An interface with the Navy NTDS system was added and demonstrated aboard a Guided Missile Cruiser in the Mediterranean. Dignitaries were able to view AWACS data at various NTDS locations including a Nuclear Aircraft Carrier. As a result of these demonstrations, and resulting NATO interest, a NATO JTIDS program was instituted called Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS).

During this period contracts were awarded to Hughes Aircraft (Ground Systems Group) to develop a terminal suitable for operational use in AWACS and ground command and control systems and to Singer Kearfott Corporation, now BAE Systems, to develop a terminal suitable for fighter aircraft installation. The Hughes effort was led by Bob Kramp and the Singer effort by John Sputz. In concert with contractor efforts a MITRE team led by Myron Leiter and consisting of communications and digital signal processing engineers refined the JTIDS design to optimize interference rejection and link performance. The results of these efforts were incorporated into performance specifications and provided guidance to the contractors. Operational considerations were provided by experienced Air Force combat pilots Col. Ken Kronlund and Col. Cliff Miller as well as valuable inputs from the Air Force Tactical Fighter Weapons Center. A pair of jet instrument trainers were equipped with F-15 like displays and were used to evaluate display techniques and understand pilot work load and benefits.

Ellingson was promoted to Associate Technical Director of the MITRE Command and Control Division in 1979, became Technical Director for the MITRE Communications Division in 1982 and in 1986 Technical Director for the MITRE Command and Control Division. During this period he did not have day-to-day management responsibility for the program but did have oversight responsibility. Ellingson retired from MITRE in 1989.

JTIDS was not created by a single individual. Rather it was the culmination of a group of individuals each having expertise in specific disciplines including but not limited to system engineering, operational analysis, cost benefit analysis, message standards, software development, communications, signal processing, vulnerability analysis, error detection and correction, antenna design, multipath analysis, electromagnetic compatibility mechanical engineering, navigation, specification generation and others. For a considerable period during JTIDS conception as many as 50 people were employed full-time in its development with as many as 50 more in part-time supporting roles.
In the ensuing years the program has transitioned from an intensive development effort to a more classical acquisition effort. Development has continued but efforts have been oriented more toward incorporation of breakthroughs in technology and efforts to improve quality and reduce size, weight and cost. In the early 1990s the Navy took over the executive management of the program. As the program has expanded throughout the U.S services and NATO a great deal on operational innovation has occurred driven by the basic flexibility of the architecture and the imagination of the operational user. As a result, the operational utility of the system has been enhanced over what was originally envisioned by the early developers. Although the JTIDS system has been a long time in development most of the technology is still &quot;state of the art&quot; and the system should be viable for the foreseeable future.

JTIDS is also used by other members of NATO.

<text>Rostock (; Polabian: &quot;Roztoc&quot;), officially the [[Hanseatic]] and University City of Rostock (), is the largest city in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and lies in the Mecklenburgian part of the state, close to the border with Pomerania. With around 210,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city on the German Baltic coast after Kiel and Lübeck, the eighth-largest city in the area of former East Germany, as well as the 39th-largest city of Germany. Rostock was the largest coastal and most important port city in East Germany.

Rostock stands on the estuary of the River Warnow into the Bay of Mecklenburg of the Baltic Sea. The city stretches for about along the river. The river flows into the sea in the very north of the city, between the boroughs of Warnemünde and Hohe Düne. The city center lies further upstream, in the very south of the city. Most of Rostock&#x27;s inhabitants live on the western side of the Warnow; the area east of the river is dominated by the port, industrial estates, and the forested Rostock Heath. The city&#x27;s coastline east and west of the river mouth is relatively undeveloped, with long sandy beaches prevailing. The name of the city is of Slavic origin.

Rostock is the economic center of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the state&#x27;s only regiopolis (a city outside the core of a metropolitan area). The port of Rostock is the fourth largest port in Germany after the North Sea ports of Hamburg, Bremen/Bremerhaven, and Wilhelmshaven, and the largest port on the German Baltic coast. The ferry routes between Rostock to Gedser in Denmark and to Trelleborg in Southern Sweden are among the busiest between Germany and Scandinavia. Rostock–Laage Airport lies in a rural region southeast of the city.

The city is home to the oldest university in the Baltic region and one of the oldest universities in the world, the University of Rostock, founded in 1419. The university&#x27;s hospital, &quot;Universitätsmedizin Rostock&quot;, is one of two university hospitals in the state, along with &quot;Universitätsmedizin Greifswald&quot; of the University of Greifswald in Western Pomerania.

==History==

===Early history===

In the 11th century Polabian Slavs founded a settlement at the Warnow river called &quot;Roztoc&quot; (*&quot;ras-tokŭ&quot;, Slavic for &quot;fork of a river&quot;); the name Rostock is derived from that designation.

The Danish king Valdemar I set the town on fire in 1161. Afterwards the place was settled by German traders. Initially there were three separate cities:
* &quot;Altstadt&quot; (Old Town) around the &quot;Alter Markt&quot; (Old Market), which had St. Petri (St. Peter&#x27;s Church),
* &quot;Mittelstadt&quot; (Middle Town) around the &quot;Neuer Markt&quot; (New Market), with St. Marien (St. Mary&#x27;s Church) and

* &quot;Neustadt&quot; (New Town) around the &quot;Hopfenmarkt&quot; (Hop Market, now University Square), with St. Jakobi (St. James&#x27;s Church, demolished after World War II).

In 1218, Rostock was granted Lübeck law city rights by Heinrich Borwin, prince of Mecklenburg.

===Hanseatic League===

During the first partition of Mecklenburg following the death of Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg in 1226, Rostock became the seat of the Lordship of Rostock, which survived for almost a century. In 1251, the city became a member of the Hanseatic League. In the 14th century it was a powerful seaport town with 12,000 inhabitants and the largest city in Mecklenburg. Ships for cruising the Baltic Sea were constructed in Rostock. The formerly independent fishing village of Warnemünde at the Baltic Sea became a part of Rostock in 1323, to secure the city&#x27;s access to the sea.

In 1419, the University of Rostock was founded, the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area.

===15th to 18th centuries===
At the end of the 15th century, the dukes of Mecklenburg succeeded in enforcing their rule over the town of Rostock, which had until then been only nominally subject to their rule and essentially independent. They took advantage of a riot known as &quot;Domfehde&quot;, a failed uprising of the impoverished population. Subsequent quarrels with the dukes and persistent plundering led ultimately to a loss of the city&#x27;s economic and political power.
In 1565 there were further clashes with Schwerin that had far-reaching consequences. Among other things, the nobility introduced a beer excise that favoured the dukes. John Albert I advanced on the city with 500 horsemen, after Rostock had refused to take the formal oath of allegiance, and had the city wall razed (slighted) to have a fortress built. The conflict did not end until the first Rostock Inheritance Agreement of 21 September 1573, in which the state princes were guaranteed hereditary rule over the city for centuries and recognizing them as the supreme judicial authority; this bound Rostock for a long time. The citizens razed (or slighted) the fortress the following spring.

From 1575 to 1577 the city walls were rebuilt, as was the &quot;Lagebusch&quot; tower and the &quot;Stein&quot; Gate, in the Dutch Renaissance style. The inscription &quot;sit intra te concordia et publica felicitas&quot; (&quot;Let there be harmony and public happiness within you&quot;), can still be read on the gate, and refers directly to the conflict with the Duke. In 1584 the Second Rostock Inheritance Agreement was enforced, which resulted in a further loss of former city tax privileges. At the same time, these inheritance contracts put paid to Rostock&#x27;s ambition of achieving imperial immediacy, as Lübeck had done in 1226.

The strategic location of Rostock provoked the envy of its rivals. Danes and Swedes occupied the city twice, first during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48) and again from 1700 to 1721. Later in the early 19th century, the French, under Napoleon, occupied the town for about a decade until 1813. In nearby Lübeck-Ratekau, Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, who was born in Rostock and who was one of few generals to fight on after defeat at the Battle of Jena, surrendered to the French in 1806. This was only after furious street fighting in the Battle of Lübeck, in which he led some of the cavalry charges himself. By the time of the surrender, the exhausted Prussians had neither food nor ammunition.

===19th century===

In the first half of the 19th century, Rostock regained much of its economic importance, due at first to the wheat trade, then, from the 1850s, to industry, especially its shipyards. The first propeller-driven steamers in Germany were constructed here.

The city grew in area and population, with new quarters developing in the south and west of the ancient borders of the city. Two notable developments were added to house the increasing population at around 1900:
* &quot;Steintor-Vorstadt&quot; in the south, stretching from the old city wall to the facilities of the new &quot;Lloydbahnhof&quot; (Lloyd Railway Station, now Rostock Hauptbahnhof), was designed as a living quarter. It consisted mostly of large single houses, once inhabited by wealthy citizens.
* &quot;Kröpeliner-Tor-Vorstadt&quot; in the west, was designed to house the working population as well as to provide smaller and larger industrial facilities, such as the Mahn &amp; Ohlerich&#x27;s Brewery (now Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock). The main shipyard, &quot;Neptun&quot;, was nearby at the shore of the river.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, important aircraft manufacturing facilities were situated in the city, such as the Arado Flugzeugwerke in Warnemünde and the Heinkel Works with facilities at various places, including their secondary &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; facility in Schwechat, Austria, as the original Heinkel firm&#x27;s Rostock facilities had been renamed &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot;. The world&#x27;s first airworthy jet plane prototype made its test flights at their facilities in what used to be named the &quot;Rostock&quot;- neighborhood (today&#x27;s &quot;Rostock&quot;-&quot;Schmarl&quot; community, along the west bank of the Unterwarnow estuary).

In the early 1930s, the Nazi Party gained in popularity among Rostock&#x27;s voters, many of whom had suffered economic hardship during the 1920s. In elections in the summer of 1932, when the Nazis achieved 37.3 percent, their greatest national showing in a free election, they polled 40.3 percent in Rostock. A year later, after the Nazi seizure of power and the suppression of other political parties, the Rostock city council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) was composed entirely of Nazis. During &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on 10 November 1938, the synagogue in Rostock&#x27;s Augustenstrasse was destroyed by arson and dozens of Jews were beaten and imprisoned.

Feverish rearmament by the Nazi regime boosted Rostock&#x27;s industrial importance in the late 1930s, and employment soared at the Heinkel and Arado factories, and at the Neptunwerft shipyard. The city&#x27;s population grew from 100,000 in 1935 to 121,192 in 1939.

During World War II, Rostock was subjected to repeated and increasingly heavy bombing attacks, especially by the British Royal Air Force. Targets included the Heinkel and Arado plants and the shipyard, but churches and other historic structures in the city centre were also heavily damaged, among them the 14th-century Nikolaikirche (St Nicholas Church) and Jakobikirche (St Jacob&#x27;s Church). The ruins of the latter were pulled down in 1960.

The city was eventually captured by the Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front on 2 May 1945 during the Stettin-Rostock offensive operation.

After the war, Rostock – now in the German Democratic Republic – became East Germany&#x27;s largest seaport. The state expanded the national shipyards in the district of Warnemünde. The city&#x27;s population, boosted in part by resettled ethnic German refugees who had been expelled from territories in the east, increased in the GDR years to a peak of 260,000. Following the reunification of Germany in 1990, Rostock lost its privileged position as the No. 1 port of the GDR, and the city&#x27;s population declined to about 200,000. However, after 2006, the population increased again. Today, Rostock and Warnemünde are significant tourist destinations on the Baltic Sea.

Since the late 20th century migrants have come to Germany from Turkey and Africa seeking work. In response to high rates of joblessness and increased levels of crime, some Germans took part in the Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots which occurred from 22 to 24 August 1992.

==Population==
Rostock has a population of about 210,000 people and is the largest city in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state. Rostock became a member of Hanseatic League in 15th century, which made Rostock a larger city. Rostock reached its peak of over 100,000 in 1935. In the East Germany era, Rostock was the largest and most important port of East Germany where many sailors and boatmen moved to this city. It also brought many harbour and other industiries to Rostock. Rostock reached its historical peak of population in 1988 with population of about 254,000. After the German Reunification, population Rostock decline due to many people who moved to former West Germany. Since 2003, Rostock&#x27;s population starts to grow again due to students and new companies.

==Politics==

===Districts===

===Symbols===

Rostock has had three different coats of arms, known as the &quot;Signum&quot;, the &quot;Secretum&quot; and the &quot;Sigillum&quot;. The Signum, which can be traced back to 1367, was developed last and is to this day the coat of arms of the city.

The Signum depicts a golden griffin on a blue background, with bars of silver and red, the colours of the Hanseatic League, below. It can be seen not only on flags and houses, and at bus stops, but also on bridges, gullies, fences, ships and restaurants.

===Administration===

Since the 13th century, the governing body of the city has been the city council (&quot;Rat&quot;), first consisting of ten, later of 24 elected aldermen (&quot;Ratsherren&quot;). The chairman of the city council was the city mayor. In the 19th century there were three mayors. Since 1925, the head of the city has borne the title of Mayor. Having been elected by the city council for centuries, since 2002 this position is now elected directly by the citizens of Rostock, following a reform. If a candidate does not achieve an absolute majority in the first round, the two candidates with the most votes stand in a second round.
The current mayor of Rostock is Eva-Maria Kröger of The Left, who was elected mayor in 2022 and took office on 1 February 2023. She won in the second round with 58.4% of votes against senior police officer Michael Ebert, an independent backed by the Christian Democratic Union, Independent Citizens for Rostock, and Free Democratic Party.

The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 November 2022, with a runoff held on 27 November, and the results were as follows:

===Regiopolis Rostock===
Rostock is the first city region that defines itself not only as a city in its boundaries, but as a regiopolis, with a supra-regional sphere of influence. A regiopolis can be compared to a metropolis, but on a smaller scale. This is a sign for the inter-regional cooperation and economic dynamics that can be found in the Rostock area. A taskforce with different actors such as the hanseatic city of Rostock, the administrative district of Rostock, the &quot;Regional Planning Association Middle Mecklenburg/Rostock&quot; and the local business organisations are working on the promotion and advancement of the concept.

==Geography==
===Geographic location===
Rostock is located nearly centrally on Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&#x27;s Baltic Sea coast. The city is crossed by the Warnow.

The seaside part of Rostock, Rostock-Warnemünde, is about to the north of the historic city centre. The west and the southeast are the most densely populated parts of town. The overseas port is to the east of Rostock. Rostock stretches from the Baltic Sea to the south and from east to west.

===Climate===
Rostock has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;) with strong influence of the Baltic Sea, more similar to Denmark and far southern Sweden than to the rest of Germany. The main difference with lower Scandinavia is that the continuous landmass to the south and east enables stronger bursts of heat during summer. In spite of this, the Warnemünde station is generally less warm on the average summer day than on the northern side of the sea. In addition, the maritime influence of the Baltic Sea tempers any Arctic blasts, ensuring slightly milder winters. The Warnemünde station is located on the open sea and thus has a stronger maritime influence and slightly smaller variations than the downtown that is further inland.

The Rostock weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 20 July 2022.
* Its lowest temperature was on 16 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 2011.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1976.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,190 hours in 2018.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,456.6 hours in 1998.

==Main sights==

===Rostock===

One of the most picturesque places in Rostock is the &quot;Neuer Markt&quot; (New Market Square), with the Town Hall – that was originally built in the 13th century in Brick Gothic style, but extensively transformed in the 18th century, with the addition of a Baroque façade and a banqueting hall. The square also preserved six original, carefully restored gable houses from the 15th and 16th centuries. The other historical houses in Hanseatic style that once bordered the square were destroyed in an Allied air-raid in 1942, and rebuilt in a simplified manner.

The 15th-century &quot;Kerkhofhaus&quot; (at Große Wasserstraße, behind the Town Hall) is considered the best-preserved brick Gothic house in Rostock. 

St. Mary&#x27;s Church &quot;Marienkirche&quot;, on Ziegenmarkt, is an imposing Brick Gothic church. Built in the 13th century, it was enlarged and modified at the end of the 14th century into the present cross-shaped basilica. The huge tower was not completed until the end of the 18th century. Inside there is an astronomical clock erected in 1472 by Hans Düringer.
The main pedestrian precinct is &quot;Kröpeliner Straße&quot;, which runs east from the Neuer Markt to the 14th-century &quot;Kröpeliner Tor&quot;, a former town gate. The main buildings of Rostock University lie at Universitätsplatz, near the middle of the street, in front of the lively fountain of &quot;zest for life (Brunnen der Lebensfreude)&quot;, known colloquially as Pornobrunn (fountain of pornography), for its nude sculptures.

The &quot;Kloster St Katharinen&quot; (Convent of St. Catherine), is an old Franciscan monastery founded in 1243, and extended several times during the 14th and 15th centuries. Now used as the seat of the Academy of Music and Theatre (HMT-Rostock).

The Brick Gothic &quot;Nikolaikirche&quot; (St. Nicholas Church), which is the oldest church in Rostock, was built in the mid-13th century. Heavily damaged during World War II and subsequently restored, the building is now used as an exhibition centre and concert hall, due to its outstanding acoustics.

Some parts of the medieval city wall, with four city gates, have survived to the present day. The city has a large population of herring gulls that squawk loudly most days throughout the year.

===Warnemünde===

Warnemünde is the seaside part of Rostock and a major attraction of the city. Locals and tourists alike enjoy the maritime flair of old houses, a large beach, a lighthouse and the old fisherman&#x27;s port.

<text>Scheveningen () is one of the eight districts of The Hague, Netherlands, as well as a subdistrict (&quot;wijk&quot;) of that city. Scheveningen is a modern seaside resort with a long, sandy beach, an esplanade, a pier, and a lighthouse. The beach is popular for water sports such as windsurfing and kiteboarding. The harbour is used for both fishing and tourism.

== History ==

The earliest reference to the name &quot;Sceveninghe&quot; goes back to around 1280. The first inhabitants may have been Anglo-Saxons. Other historians favour a Scandinavian origin. Fishing was the main source of food and income.

The Battle of Scheveningen was fought between English and Dutch fleets off the coast of the village on 10 August 1653. Thousands of people gathered on the shore to watch. In 1660 Montagu&#x27;s flagship picked up the English king at Scheveningen in order to accomplish the Restoration.

A road to neighbouring The Hague was constructed in 1663 (current name: Scheveningseweg).

In 1470, a heavy storm destroyed the church and half the houses. The village was again hit by storms in 1570, 1775, 1825, 1860, 1881, and 1894. After this last storm, the villagers decided to build a harbour. Until then, the fishing boats had had a flat bottom (&quot;bomschuiten&quot;), and were pulled up the beach. By around 1870, over 150 of these boats were in use. Once the harbour had been constructed in 1904, more modern ships replaced the &quot;bomschuiten&quot;.

In 1818, Jacob Pronk constructed a wooden building on a dune near the sea, from where people could bathe from four separate rooms. It marked the start of Scheveningen as a bathing resort. Since then, Scheveningen has attracted numerous tourists from all over Europe, notably from Germany.

The hotel Kurhaus was opened in 1886. The village attracted a number of Dutch artists over the centuries, who painted the &quot;bomschuiten&quot; drawn up on the beach, or fishermen at work in the North Sea. Notable painters who recorded the village include Adriaen van de Velde, Simon de Vlieger, and Hendrik Willem Mesdag, whose large panorama, 14 m high and 120 m wide, preserved the view of Scheveningen in 1881.

The International Skating Union was founded in Scheveningen in 1892.

Anecdotal evidence exists of the name &quot;Scheveningen&quot; being used as a shibboleth during World War II to identify German spies: they would pronounce the initial &quot;Sch&quot; as one consonant (the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative, pronounced approximately like &quot;Sh&quot;), rather than the native Dutch sequence of the voiceless alveolar sibilant followed by the voiceless uvular fricative, &quot;Skh&quot;, as in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;.

Scheveningen was never an independent municipality, but it has its own coat of arms, officially recognised by The Hague local council (proposal 136 of 23 March 1984); even in the Middle Ages, it was part of the same administrative region as The Hague.

Nevertheless, Scheveningen always had a strong identity of its own. For instance, it had its own football club, playing in the highest Dutch division (its name was &quot;Scheveningen Holland Sport&quot;). In the course of the second half of the 20th century, this club was forced to merge with ADO Den Haag.
From 21 April 1960, the pirate radio station Radio Veronica broadcast its programmes from an anchorage in the North Sea about four miles off the Scheveningen coast, originally calling itself Vrije Radio Omroep Nederland (VRON), Free Radio Station [of the] Netherlands. It was joined by Radio Noordzee Internationaal in 1970 and the relaunched Radio Caroline in late 1972. When the Netherlands ratified the Treaty of Strasbourg on 1 September 1974, Veronica applied for legal status and became the VOO, Caroline moved anchorage to the English coast, and RNI closed down. Memorable episodes during this period included the stranding of Radio Veronica&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Norderney&quot;, which lost its anchor in a storm and ran aground on Scheveningen beach on 2 April 1973, and a firebomb attack on RNI&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Mebo II&quot;, on 15 May 1971.

Since the 1970s the population of the original Scheveningen changed as the fishing industry declined and some artists and professionals moved in. Most of the fishermen, captains and trawler owners houses were demolished. Some still remain and have been protected by the authorities, including some of the original &#x27;hofjes&#x27;, in an enclosed area with small row houses on each side.

Slobodan Milošević, the 3rd president of Serbia and Montenegro was found dead in his prison cell on 11 March 2006 while he was being held in the UN war crimes tribunal&#x27;s detention center in Scheveningen.

==Culture==
Until recently, some elderly women still wore local Scheveningen costume, while the local Scheveningen dialect is hardly spoken by young people anymore. 

Because of the closedness of the original village community, many shared the same surnames. This led to the introduction of nicknames in order to distinguish families better. For example, certain members from the Pronk family were known as &#x27;the horse man&#x27;, &#x27;Piet the mouse&#x27;, &#x27;Born without a tooth&#x27; or &#x27;Gerrit de sermon&#x27;. Some common &#x27;typical Scheveningen&#x27; family names are, for example, Bal, Dijkhuizen, Groen, Korving, Den Heijer, Knoester, De Niet, Plugge, Pronk, Rog, Spaans, Taal, Toet, Vrolijk, Zuurmond and Van der Zwan. Through the opening up of the fishing village from the beginning of the 20th century, this phenomenon has gradually become obsolete.

== Events and attractions ==

Annual events include:
*Winter swim on New Year&#x27;s Day, locally known as &quot;Nieuwjaarsduik&quot; (New Year&#x27;s dive). The event is sponsored by Unox who provide soup and oliebollen (to participants. They also give out signature orange Unox beanies, which apart from their aesthetic value also help rescuers identify swimmers.
*Flags Day in spring when the first new herring of the year is auctioned
*Fireworks in summer: once a week and several days during a festival week
*Vreugdevuur from second Christmas Day to New Year&#x27;s Eve: a large competition between two subdivisions of Scheveningen (Duindorp and Scheveningen dorp) to build the largest tower made out of pallets and then light it on fire to signal the beginning of the year, Duindorp currently holds the world record.

<doc id="106301" wikidata="Q427601" url="?curid=106301" title="Cuvette">
<text>In laboratories, a cuvette () is a small tube-like container with straight sides and a circular or square cross-section. It is sealed at one end, and made of a clear, transparent material such as plastic, glass, or fused quartz. Cuvettes are designed to hold samples for spectroscopic measurement, where a beam of light is passed through the sample within the cuvette to measure the absorbance, transmittance, fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, or fluorescence lifetime of the sample. This measurement is done with a spectrophotometer.

== Overview ==

Traditional ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy or fluorescence spectroscopy uses samples that are liquid. Often the sample is a solution, with the substance of interest dissolved within. The sample is placed in a cuvette and the cuvette is placed in a spectrophotometer for testing. The cuvette can be made of any material that is transparent in the range of wavelengths used in the test.

The smallest cuvettes can hold 70 microliters, while the largest can hold 2.5 milliliters or more. The width determines the length of the light path through the sample, which affects the calculation of the absorbance value. Many cuvettes have a light path of , which simplifies calculation of the coefficient of absorption. Most cuvettes have two transparent sides opposite one another so the spectrophotometer light can pass through, although some tests use reflection so only need a single transparent side. For fluorescence measurements, two more transparent sides, at right angles to those used for the spectrophotometer light, are needed for the excitation light. Some cuvettes have a glass or plastic cap for use with hazardous solutions, or to protect samples from air.

== Technique ==

Scratches on the sides of the cuvette that the light passes through scatter light and cause errors. A rubber or plastic rack protects the cuvette from accidentally hitting and being scratched by the machine casing. The solvent and temperature can also affect measurements. Cuvettes to be used in circular dichroism experiments should never be mechanically stressed, as the stress will induce birefringence in the quartz and affect measurements. Analyses are performed by using a conventional scanning spectrophotometer and the usual laboratory cuvette (special vial) that fits into the sample cavity of the instrument.

Fingerprints and droplets of water disrupt light rays during measurement, so low-lint gauze or cloth may be used to wipe clean the outer surface of a cuvette before use. Paper towel or similar may scratch the cuvette. Mild detergent or ethanol may be applied, followed by rinsing with tap water. Acid and alkali are avoided due to their corrosive effects on glass, and acetone is unsuitable when working with plastic cuvettes. If solution is transferred into a cuvette using a Pasteur pipette containing air, bubbles may form inside the cuvette, reducing the purity of a solution and scattering light beams. The finger-clad finger method is used to remove bubbles. The solution contained in the cuvette should be high enough to be in the path of the light source. In case the sample needs incubation at a high temperature, care must be taken to avoid temperatures too hot for the cuvette.

== Types ==
Historically, reusable quartz cuvettes were required for measurements in the ultraviolet range, because glass and most plastics absorb ultraviolet light, creating interference. Today there are disposable plastic cuvettes made of specialized plastics that are transparent to ultraviolet light. Glass, plastic and quartz cuvettes are all suitable for measurements made at longer wavelengths, such as in the visible light range.

&quot;Tandem cuvettes&quot; have a glass barrier medium that extends two-thirds of the way up in the middle, so that measurements can be taken with two solutions separated and again when they are mixed.

Cuvettes are made from quartz, and plastic (disposable) depending upon UV transmission requirements.

=== Plastic ===
Plastic cuvettes are often used in fast spectroscopic assays, where high speed is more important than high accuracy. Plastic cuvettes with a usable wavelength range of 380–780 nm (the visible spectrum) may be disposed of after use, preventing contamination from re-use. They are cheap to manufacture and purchase. Disposable cuvettes can be used in some laboratories where the beam light is not high enough to affect the absorption tolerance and consistency of the value.

Most often Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and Polystyrene (PS) material are used to make the plastic cuvettes.


=== Glass ===
Crown glass has an optimal wavelength range of 340–2500 nm. Glass cuvettes are typically for use in the wavelength range of visible light, whereas fused quartz tends to be used for ultraviolet applications.

=== Quartz ===
Quartz cells provide more durability than plastic or glass. Quartz excels at transmitting UV light, and can be used for wavelengths ranging from 190 to 2500 nm.

==== Fused quartz ====
Fused quartz cells are used for wavelengths below 380 nm, i.e. ultraviolet light.

==== Infrared quartz ====
IR quartz has a usable wavelength range of 220 to 3,500 nm. It is more resistant to chemical attack from the sample solution than other types designed for fluorescence measurements.

=== Sapphire ===
Sapphire cuvettes are the most expensive, though provide the most durable, scratch-resistant, and transmissible material. The transmission extends from UV light to mid-infrared, ranging from 250 to 5,000 nm. Sapphire can withstand the extreme natural condition of some sample solutions and variances in temperature.

== History ==
In 1934, James Franklin Hyde created a combined silica cell, which was free from other extraneous elements, as a liquefying technique of other glass products. In the 1950s, Starna Ltd. improved the method to completely melt a segment of glass using heat without deforming its shape. This innovation has altered the production of inert cuvettes without any thermosetting resin. Before the rectangular cuvette was created, ordinary test tubes were used. As innovation motivated changes in technique, cuvettes were constructed to have focal points over ordinary test tubes.

<doc id="106304" wikidata="Q213452" url="?curid=106304" title="Graduated cylinder">
<text>A graduated cylinder, also known as a measuring cylinder or mixing cylinder, is a common piece of laboratory equipment used to measure the volume of a liquid. It has a narrow cylindrical shape. Each marked line on the graduated cylinder represents the amount of liquid that has been measured.

== Materials and structure ==

Large graduated cylinders are usually made of polypropylene for its excellent chemical resistance or polymethylpentene for its transparency, making them lighter and less fragile than glass. Polypropylene (PP) is easy to repeatedly autoclave; however, autoclaving in excess of about (depending on the chemical formulation: typical commercial grade polypropylene melts in excess of ), can warp or damage polypropylene graduated cylinders, affecting accuracy.

A traditional graduated cylinder is usually narrow and tall so as to increase the accuracy and precision of volume measurement. It has a plastic or glass base (stand, foot, support) and a &quot;spout&quot; for easy pouring of the measured liquid. An additional version is wide and low.

Mixing cylinders have ground glass joints instead of a spout, so they can be closed with a stopper or connected directly with other elements of a manifold. With this kind of cylinder, the metered liquid does not pour directly, but is often removed using a Cannula. A graduated cylinder is meant to be read with the surface of the liquid at eye level, where the center of the meniscus shows the measurement line. Typical capacities of graduated cylinders are from 10 mL to 1000 mL.

== Common uses ==
Graduated cylinders are often used to measure the volume of a liquid. Graduated cylinders are generally more accurate and precise than laboratory flasks and beakers, but they should not be used to perform volumetric analysis; volumetric glassware, such as a volumetric flask or volumetric pipette, should be used, as it is even more accurate and precise. Graduated cylinders are sometimes used to measure the volume of a solid indirectly by measuring the displacement of a liquid.

== Scales and accuracy ==
For accuracy the volume on graduated cylinders is depicted on scales with 3 significant digits: 100mL cylinders have 1ml grading divisions while 10mL cylinders have 0.1 mL grading divisions.

Two classes of accuracy exist for graduated cylinders. Class A has double the accuracy of class B.
Cylinders can have single or double scales. Single scales allow to read the volume from top to bottom (filling volume) while double scale cylinders allow reading for filling and pouring (reverse scale).

Graduated cylinders are calibrated either “to contain” (indicated liquid volume inside the cylinder) and marked as &quot;TC&quot; or “to deliver” (indicated liquid volume poured out, accounting for liquid traces left in the cylinder) and marked “TD”. Formerly the tolerances for “to deliver” and “to contain” cylinders are distinct; however now these are the same. Also, the international symbols “IN” and “EX” are more likely to be used instead of “TC” and “TD” respectively.

== Measurement ==

To read the volume accurately, the observation must be at an eye level and read at the bottom of a meniscus of the liquid level.
The main reason as to why the reading of the volume is done via meniscus is due to the nature of the liquid in a closed surrounded space. By nature, liquid in the cylinder is attracted to the wall around it through molecular forces. This forces the liquid surface to develop either a or shape, depending on the type of the liquid in the cylinder. Reading the liquid at the bottom part of a or the top part of the liquid is equivalent to reading the liquid at its meniscus. From the picture, the level of the liquid will be read at the bottom of the meniscus, which is the concave. The most accurate of the reading that could be done here is reduced down to 1 mL due to the given means of measurement on the cylinder. From this, the derived error is one tenth of the least figure. For instance, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 36.5 mL. The error, give or take 0.1 mL, must be included too. Therefore, the more precise value equates to 36.5 formula_1 0.1; 36.4 or 36.6 mL. Therefore, there are 3 significant figures can be read from the given graduated cylinder picture. Another example, if the reading is done and the value calculated is set to be 40.0 mL. The precise value is 40.0 formula_1 0.1; 40.1 or 39.9 mL.

==History==

The graduated cylinder was first introduced in 1784 by Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, for use in volumetric analysis.

<doc id="106305" wikidata="Q7859451" url="?curid=106305" title="Two suiter">
<text>In contract bridge, a two suiter is a hand containing cards mostly from two of the four suits. Traditionally a hand is considered a two suiter if it contains at least ten cards in two suits, with the two suits not differing in length by more than one card. Depending on suit quality and partnership agreement different classification schemes are viable. The more modern trend is to lower the threshold of ten cards to nine cards and consider 5-4 distributions also two suiters.

The six possible combinations are given the names &quot;major suits&quot; (spades and hearts), &quot;minor suits&quot; (diamonds and clubs), &quot;black suits&quot; (spades and clubs), &quot;red suits&quot; (hearts and diamonds), &quot;pointed suits&quot; (spades and diamonds), and &quot;rounded suits&quot; (hearts and clubs).

When including two suited hands with 5-4 distribution, two suiters have a high likelihood of occurrence, and the modern preemptive style is to incorporate such two-suited hands in the arsenal of preemptive openings. Example of such a preemptive conventional opening is the Muiderberg convention. Some take this aggressive style even further and use Ekren to preemptively open on a 4-4 in the majors. 

Conventional overcalls such as Michaels, Unusual notrump, Ghestem and Raptor are designed to introduce a two suiter over an opening bid of the opponents. Conventions like Landy, DONT, Lionel and CoCa can be used to denote a two suiter over an opposing 1NT bid.

<doc id="106306" wikidata="Q2975847" url="?curid=106306" title="Minor suit">
<text>In contract bridge the minor [[suit (cards)|suits]] are diamonds () and clubs (). They are given that name because contracts made in those suits score less (20 per contracted trick) than contracts made in the major suits (30 per contracted trick), and they rank lower in bidding. In particular, one can make game with a four-level bid in a major suit, while a five-level bid is required in a minor. Of the two minor suits, diamonds rank higher than clubs.

==Suit combinations==
Fundamentally, there are three ways to divide four suits into pairs: by &quot;color&quot;, by &quot;rank&quot; and by &quot;shape&quot; resulting in six possible suit combinations.
* Color is used to denote the &quot;red&quot; suits (hearts and diamonds) and the &quot;black&quot; suits (spades and clubs).
* Rank is used to indicate the &quot;major&quot; (spades and hearts) versus &quot;minor&quot; (diamonds and clubs) suits.
* Shape is used to denote the &quot;pointed&quot; (diamonds and spades, which visually have a sharp point uppermost) versus &quot;rounded&quot; (hearts and clubs) suits. This is used only as a mnemonic.

<doc id="106314" wikidata="Q5300091" url="?curid=106314" title="Double squeeze">
<text>The double squeeze is a type of squeeze play in the card game of bridge.

Double squeezes are a combination of two simple squeezes carried out against both opponents. If both squeezes are executed by the same trick, that is the same squeeze card, the double squeeze is called simultaneous.
If both opponents are squeezed on different tricks (the squeeze card is then a card in the suit that was menacing the opponent squeezed first) the double squeeze is called non-simultaneous.

As there are only four suits in contract bridge the two simple squeezes can only be combined by using a menace for both opponents, the squeeze card being in the fourth suit.

==Example==
The following demonstrates the basics of a double squeeze; south requires the three remaining tricks.
 When the South leads the 2 (the squeeze card), West must keep his A (menaced by dummy&#x27;s king) and gives up his spade guard (spades being the double menace). In the same trick (this is therefore a simultaneous double squeeze), East must keep his Q (menaced by declarer&#x27;s jack), and is forced to discard his low spade. Consequently, the 2 in North is established. 

South completes the play by leading the 6 to the A and wins the last trick with the 2.

<doc id="106320" wikidata="Q11830133" url="?curid=106320" title="Simultaneous double squeeze">
<text>In contract bridge, a simultaneous double squeeze is a double squeeze in which both opponents are squeezed by the same card, as opposed to non-simultaneous double squeeze where the two opponents are squeezed in different tricks.

There are three basic matrices. In each of those, the double menace (the suit guarded by both opponents) must be accompanied by an entry, and the other two (single) menaces need not have one.
1) In the first matrix, the double menace (spades) is in one hand (dummy in the example), accompanied by an entry, and the other two are split between two declarer&#x27;s hands. When the club deuce is played West has to shed a spade, dummy sheds the now useless king of hearts and East is squeezed in the pointed suits. This is a positional squeeze (it would not work with E-W hands reversed).

2) The double menace (spades) is in one hand (declarer&#x27;s) with entries in both hands, and two single menaces are in the other hand. The two of clubs is cashed and again West has to give up the guard in the double menace suit (spades). The now useless king of hearts is played from dummy and East is squeezed in the pointed suits. This is an automatic squeeze (working with hands interchanged), but the declarer has to know which defender guards which suit.

3) This is the most comfortable end position of the three simultaneous double squeeze matrices, because this squeeze is automatic with no guessing game involved. There, the double menace is a 3-card menace with two winners (including an entry) sits opposite the hand with two single menaces. The declarer discards the two of diamonds on the squeeze card (3) regardless of West&#x27;s discard. As long as the squeeze worked, all spades in the North hand must be winners, unless one of our two queens became a master. It&#x27;s not possible with one spade less in the layout: there would be no room in South&#x27;s hand to keep the squeeze card, two red menaces, and an entry card (small spade) in only 3 cards. It is possible, though, (but rare) with a four-card double menace:

<doc id="106321" wikidata="Q1071117" url="?curid=106321" title="Prime Minister of New Zealand">
<text>The prime minister of New Zealand () is the head of government of New Zealand. The prime minister, Christopher Luxon, leader of the New Zealand National Party, took office on 27 November 2023.

The prime minister (informally abbreviated to PM) ranks as the most senior government minister. They are responsible for chairing meetings of Cabinet; allocating posts to ministers within the government; acting as the spokesperson for the government; and providing advice to the sovereign or the sovereign&#x27;s representative, the governor-general. They also have ministerial responsibility for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, which is based in the Beehive in Wellington.

The office exists by a long-established convention, which originated in New Zealand&#x27;s former colonial power, the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The convention stipulates that when the office becomes vacant, the governor-general must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the support, or confidence, of the House of Representatives. This individual is typically the parliamentary leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that house. The prime minister and Cabinet are collectively accountable for their actions to the governor-general, to the House of Representatives, to their political party, and ultimately to the national electorate.

Originally the head of government was titled &quot;colonial secretary&quot; or &quot;first minister&quot;. This was changed in 1869 to &quot;premier&quot;. That title remained in use for more than 30 years, until Richard Seddon changed it to &quot;prime minister&quot; in 1900 during his tenure in the office. Following the declaration of New Zealand as a Dominion in 1907, the term prime minister has been used exclusively in English. In Māori, the title &quot;&quot;, means &quot;premier&quot;. New Zealand prime ministers are styled as &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, a privilege they retain for life.

Forty-two people (thirty-nine men and three women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Henry Sewell taking office on 7 May 1856 as premier. The longest-serving prime minister was Richard Seddon, who served over 13 years, and the shortest-serving was Sewell, who served two weeks.

==Appointment and tenure==
The governor-general appoints a prime minister, like other ministerial positions, on behalf of the monarch. By the conventions of responsible government, the governor-general will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the elected members of parliament (MPs). In making this appointment, convention requires the governor-general to act on the outcome of the electoral process and subsequent discussions between political parties by which the person who will lead the government as prime minister is identified. In practice, the position typically falls to an MP who is the parliamentary leader of the largest political party among those forming the government. The prime minister may lead a coalition government and/or a minority government dependent on support from smaller parties during confidence and supply votes.
Once appointed and sworn in by the governor-general, the prime minister remains in the post until dismissal, resignation, or death in office. They, like all ministers, hold office &quot;during the pleasure of the Governor-General&quot;, so theoretically, the governor-general can dismiss a prime minister at any time; however, convention heavily circumscribes the power to do so. The governor-general retains reserve powers to dismiss a prime minister in certain circumstances, such as those pertaining to a no-confidence motion against the government in the House of Representatives.

Where a prime minister, and by extension, the government, can no longer command the confidence of the house, either by losing a confidence vote or as the result of an election, convention dictates that they should tender their resignation to the governor-general. Under the Constitution Act 1986, general elections are required every three years, setting the maximum period a prime minister can serve without their mandate being renewed.

==Responsibilities and powers==
The office of prime minister is not defined by codified laws but by unwritten customs known as constitutional conventions which developed in Britain and which New Zealand replicated. These conventions depend for the most part on the underlying principle that the prime minister and fellow ministers must not lose the confidence of the democratically elected component of parliament, the House of Representatives. The prime minister is the leader of the Cabinet (itself a body existing by convention) and takes a coordinating role.

The &quot;Cabinet Manual&quot; provides an outline of the prime minister&#x27;s powers and responsibilities.

=== Principal adviser to the sovereign ===
By constitutional convention, the prime minister holds formal power to advise the sovereign. This means that as long as the prime minister has the confidence of parliament, they alone may advise the monarch on:
* appointment or of the governor-general
* amendments to the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General, which most recently occurred in 2006
* the conferment of New Zealand honours (except for honours in the personal gift of the monarch)

===Principal adviser to the governor-general===
As head of government, the prime minister alone has the right to advise the governor-general to:
* appoint, dismiss, or accept the resignation of ministers
* dissolve parliament and issue a writ for an election to be held. The governor-general may reject the advice to dissolve parliament if the prime minister has recently lost a vote of confidence (that is, the governor-general would be using their reserve powers), but none has done so.

===Head of government===
Convention regards the prime minister as &quot;first among equals&quot;. A prime minister does hold the most senior post in government, but must also adhere to any decisions taken by Cabinet, as per the convention of collective ministerial responsibility. The actual ability of a prime minister to give direct orders is largely limited; most of the position&#x27;s power comes about through other means, such as:
* the ability to set the Cabinet agenda, thereby controlling items for discussion
* The ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, and to allocate 
*the influence a prime minister is likely/assumed to have as leader of the dominant political party, which may afford more direct control over subordinates than is attached to the prime ministerial role
* The power gained simply from being central to most significant decision-making, and from being able (as of right) to comment on and criticise any decisions taken by other ministers

Since the 1996 implementation of the MMP electoral system, the role of the prime minister in negotiating and maintaining relationships with support parties has increased, placing some constraints on prime ministerial abilities.

=== Other roles and functions ===
Prime ministers also take on additional portfolios (to prioritise policy areas). Historically, 19th-century premiers looked after the colonial-secretary and finance portfolios. As New Zealand developed, the role of minister of finance became too big; Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon came under criticism for taking on the finance portfolio during his time in office (1975–1984), as it resulted in a large concentration of power in the hands of one individual.

Before 1987 it was common for prime ministers to take the role of minister of foreign affairs, so they could represent New Zealand on the international stage. More recent prime ministers have taken portfolios relevant to their interests, or to promote specific areas they saw as important. For example, David Lange took the education portfolio in his second term; Helen Clark took the role of minister for arts, culture and heritage; John Key served as minister of tourism; and Jacinda Ardern became minister for child-poverty reduction.

Although no longer likely to be the minister of foreign affairs, the prime minister remains responsible for welcoming foreign heads of government, visiting leaders overseas, and attending Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.

Conventionally, the prime minister is the responsible minister for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC; founded in 1990), which has the task of supporting the policy agenda of Cabinet through policy advice and the coordination of the implementation of key government programmes. 

Before 2014, the prime minister was also responsible for the New Zealand Security and Intelligence Service (NZSIS) and for the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB). In 2014, Prime Minister John Key gave himself the new portfolio of National Security and Intelligence and delegated responsibility for SIS and GCSB to other ministers. He also expanded the role of DPMC in security and intelligence. This model has been followed by subsequent prime ministers.

==Privileges of office==
===Salary and perquisites===
Under the Remuneration Authority Act 1977, and the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, a prime minister&#x27;s salary is determined annually by the Remuneration Authority, an independent body established by parliament to set salaries for members of parliament and other government officials. MPs&#x27; salaries were temporarily reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. , the prime minister&#x27;s salary is set at NZ$498,300. In addition, like all other ministers and MPs, the prime minister receives annual allowances for travel and lodging, as do the prime minister&#x27;s spouse and children.
The incumbent prime minister&#x27;s official residence is Premier House, Tinakori Road, Wellington. There the prime minister hosts receptions and events for New Zealand and overseas guests. Unlike the residences of certain other heads of government (e.g. the White House and 10 Downing Street), Premier House does not serve as the government headquarters; the location of the prime minister&#x27;s office is the Beehive, in the parliament precinct a short distance away. The prime minister&#x27;s governmental work is supported by the non-partisan Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The separate Private Office of the Prime Minister provides advice and support on political party matters.

The style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; (abbreviated to &quot;The Rt Hon&quot;) is always granted to the prime minister upon taking office. Former prime ministers retain this style for the remainder of their lives. The written form of address for the head of government should use their full parliamentary title as applicable: &quot;The Right Honourable [name], [post-nominal letters], Prime Minister of New Zealand&quot;. It is also traditional for the monarch to bestow a knighthood or damehood on prime ministers after they leave office, and two prime ministers were knighted while still in office (namely Sir Keith Holyoake in 1970, and Sir Robert Muldoon in 1983).

===Security and transport===

The Diplomatic Protection Service (DPS) is a special branch of the New Zealand Police that is charged with protecting the prime minister (and their family) and other senior government officials, as well as diplomats. 

The DPS provides the prime minister with transport; they are driven in the BMW 7 Series 730LD and 750LI, the latter of which is armoured. Although usually flown domestically on regularly scheduled Air New Zealand flights, the prime minister also makes use of Royal New Zealand Air Force aircraft, usually Boeing 757. The 757 aircraft, which are used for international travel, has been upgraded with work stations, internal air stairs, and military communications capabilities. The 757 fleet is set to be replaced by 2028.

===After office===
Former officeholders are entitled to annuity and travel payments for the rest of their lives. Former prime ministers who held the office for no less than two years are entitled to a yearly rate of $10,900 for each complete year the person held office, with a maximum of $54,500 payable annually. Former prime ministers, when travelling within New Zealand, are eligible to be paid if the travel is for fulfilling commitments related to his or her role as a former prime minister.

Should a serving or former prime minister die, they are accorded a state funeral (subject to the approval of the family). Two prime ministers who died in office were buried in mausoleums: William Massey (died 1925) in the Massey Memorial in Wellington, and Michael Joseph Savage (died 1940) in the Savage Memorial at Bastion Point in Auckland. 

==History==
Assuming that Henry Sewell is counted as the first prime minister, 42 individuals have held the office since it was established. Some of these people have held it on several separate occasions, with the record for maximum number of times being shared between William Fox and Harry Atkinson (both of whom served four times). The longest that anyone has served in the office is 13 years, a record set by Richard Seddon. The first holder of the office, Henry Sewell, led the country for the shortest total time; his only term lasted just 13 days. The shortest term belonged to Harry Atkinson, whose third term lasted only seven days, but Atkinson served longer in total than did Sewell. The youngest was Edward Stafford, who was appointed premier in 1856, at 37 years, 40 days old. The oldest was Walter Nash, who was 78 years old when he left office in 1960 (and 75 upon taking office in 1957).

It is regarded that all New Zealand prime ministers thus far have been Pākehā (New Zealand European), and mostly of British and Irish descent. There was persistent speculation during his lifetime that Norman Kirk (Prime Minister from 1972 to 1974) was Māori and had Kāi Tahu ancestry; he never publicly identified himself as such, and there is no substantial evidence for the claim.

New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world to have had three female heads of government and one of only three countries to have had a female head of government directly succeed another. The first female prime minister was Jenny Shipley of the National Party, who replaced Jim Bolger in late 1997; Shipley was succeeded by Helen Clark in 1999. Jacinda Ardern, the second female leader of the Labour Party after Clark, became prime minister in 2017.

===Early leaders===
On becoming the Colony of New Zealand in 1841, the country was directly governed by a governor, appointed by the Colonial Office in Britain. Self-government was established in 1853, following the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, and the First Parliament met on 24 May 1854.

The origins of the office of prime minister are disputed. Use of the words &quot;prime minister&quot; as a descriptive term dates back to the First Parliament, where they are applied to James FitzGerald and Thomas Forsaith. FitzGerald and Forsaith had no official titles, however, and New Zealand had not yet obtained self-government. As such, they are not usually considered prime ministers in any substantive sense.

The first person to be formally appointed to a position of executive leadership was Henry Sewell, who formed a brief ministry in April 1856, at the beginning of the Second Parliament. Despite his formal leadership role, however, his only actual title was &quot;colonial secretary&quot;, a position comparable to a minister of internal affairs. His successor, William Fox, was also given a formal leadership role but was not a colonial secretary. In 1864 when Frederick Weld became the sixth person appointed to formal leadership, a substantive leadership title, &quot;premier&quot;, appeared. Weld&#x27;s successor, Edward Stafford, briefly changed the title to &quot;first minister&quot;, but it was soon restored to premier during the second tenure of Fox in 1869. From that point, the title &quot;premier&quot; was used almost exclusively for the remainder of the 19th century. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the head of government &quot;being the Prime Minister&quot;.

Initially, premiers acted as mere advisers to the governor—with the governor at times a very active partner. This began to change during the first tenure of Edward Stafford. Stafford met with his ministers and made decisions outside of the Executive Council (which was chaired by the governor), thus establishing the modern convention of cabinet government. Stafford also clashed with the governor over control of native affairs, which was eventually to fall within the premier&#x27;s powers.

===Party leadership===

Premiers were initially supported by unorganised factions based on personal interests, and their governments were short-lived. The political position of the premier was enhanced by the development of modern political parties. Premier John Ballance organised the first formal party in New Zealand, the Liberal Party, forming the Liberal Government in 1891. There was little real parliamentary opposition until 1909, when William Massey organised his conservative faction to form the Reform Party. Thereafter political power centred on parties and their leaders. (Subsequent governments were led by prime ministers from the Reform, United, Labour and National parties.) Although not every government would have a large majority, the party system and tight control of party members by whips helped heads of government to direct the passage of legislation in the House of Representatives. In 1893, the premier gained the ability to restrict the term of appointments to the Legislative Council.

After 1900, Richard Seddon, the incumbent head of government, used the title of &quot;prime minister&quot;. The change of title was reflected in the &quot;New Zealand Official Yearbook&quot; of that year. Seddon&#x27;s immediate successor, William Hall-Jones, was the first to be sworn in as &quot;prime minister&quot;, in 1906.

The expanding power of the prime minister was kept in check by the need to build consensus with other leading members of the Cabinet and of the governing party, including those who represented various ideological wings of the party. Other institutions, including Parliament itself and the wider state bureaucracy, also acted as limits on prime ministerial power; in 1912 Thomas Mackenzie was the last prime minister to lose power through an unsuccessful confidence motion in the House of Representatives.

===Towards modern leadership===
One change brought about by the First World War was direct participation in governing the British Empire. Previously, New Zealand prime ministers had attended occasional colonial and imperial conferences, but they otherwise communicated with London through the governor (a position then appointed by the British government). In 1917, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered the New Zealand prime minister a seat in the Imperial War Cabinet, the British Empire&#x27;s wartime coordinating body. In 1919, Prime Minister William Massey signed the Treaty of Versailles on behalf of New Zealand, signalling the independence of New Zealand within the empire, although Massey downplayed the event as an ardent imperialist.

Constitutional conventions adopted in 1930, following the Imperial Conference held that year, increased the domestic and international prestige of the prime minister. The Statute of Westminster 1931 confirmed that Dominions had exclusive power to make their laws. New Zealand initially resisted greater autonomy and did not adopt the statute until 1947. Increasingly New Zealand began to act independently in foreign affairs. During the 1940s the prime minister&#x27;s profile rose as New Zealand signed several international treaties. In 1967, Keith Holyoake became the first New Zealand prime minister to select candidates for the position of governor-general without any involvement of the British government. Holyoake advised the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, to appoint Sir Arthur Porritt, the first New Zealand-born governor-general.
After the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system was introduced in 1996, prime ministers have had to manage minority governments. The skill of MMP management was exemplified by Helen Clark&#x27;s nine years as prime minister (1999–2008), when her Labour government remained in power thanks to a range of confidence-and-supply agreements with five smaller parties.

Until the premiership of Helen Clark, it was customary for senior members of the legislature, executive and judiciary—including the prime minister—to be appointed to the British Privy Council, granting them the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. This practice was discontinued at the same time as the abolition of knighthoods and damehoods in 2000 from the New Zealand royal honours system. National&#x27;s John Key became prime minister in 2008 and moved to restore titular honours, but did not resume appointments to the Privy Council, meaning Key was styled &quot;The Honourable&quot;. On 3 August 2010, the Queen granted the prime minister, along with the governor-general, speaker of the House of Representatives and chief justice, the style &quot;Right Honourable&quot; upon appointment.

On 21 June 2018, Labour&#x27;s Jacinda Ardern became the first prime minister of New Zealand (and second elected head of government in the world) to give birth while in office. Ardern was also the first prime minister to lead a single-party majority government since the introduction of MMP, doing so from 2020 to 2023.

== Deputy prime minister ==

An office titled &quot;deputy prime minister&quot; has existed since 1949. The deputy typically holds important ministerial portfolios and, by convention, becomes acting prime minister in the absence or incapacity of the prime minister. The deputy is commonly a member of the same party as the prime minister, but not necessarily so; in coalition governments, the parliamentary leader of a junior party may be offered the post. Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First, has been deputy prime minister since 27 November 2023.

<text>Mmabatho (Tswana for &quot;Mother of the People&quot;) is the former capital of the North-West Province of South Africa. During the apartheid era, it was the capital of the former &quot;Bantustan&quot; of Bophuthatswana, separated from the adjacent Mafeking which temporarily remained outside Bophuthatswana. 

Following the end of apartheid in 1994, Bophuthatswana was integrated into the newly established North-West Province and Mmabatho was proclaimed the provincial capital. However, Mmabatho&#x27;s status as the provincial capital was short-lived. Later in 1994, the North West provincial legislature voted to rename the capital to Mahikeng (the town of Mafikeng having been merged with Mmabatho in 1980 and treated as a suburb of Mmabatho between 1980 and 1994), reducing Mmabatho to a suburb of Mafikeng. The city is an enclave within the latter.
Mmabatho contains many provincial government buildings, a shopping complex called Mega City and a Sports Stadium formerly called the Independence Stadium. The North-West University, formerly the University of Bophuthatswana, is located in Mmabatho.

Situated just south of the Botswana border, the town is connected by main roads to South Africa&#x27;s national capital of Pretoria in the east and to Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, in the north. A railway runs north and south from the neighbouring town of Mafikeng. The city is served by Mmabatho International Airport, handling flights to and from Johannesburg.

<doc id="106327" wikidata="Q1814766" url="?curid=106327" title="The Coup">
<text>The Coup is an American hip hop band from Oakland, California. Their music is an amalgamation of influences, including funk, punk, hip hop, and soul. Frontman Boots Riley&#x27;s revolutionarily-charged lyrics rank The Coup as a renowned political hip hop band aligned to radical music groups such as Crass, Dead Prez and Rage Against the Machine.

The Coup&#x27;s music is driven by assertive and danceable bass-driven backbeats overlaid by critical, hopeful, and witty lyrics, often with a bent towards the literary. The Coup&#x27;s songs critique, observe, and lampoon capitalism, American politics, white patriarchal exploitation, police brutality, marijuana addiction, romance, and disparities among races and social classes.

==History==
===First decade===
The Coup&#x27;s debut release was 1991s &quot;The EP&quot; and almost all of the songs on it (except &quot;Economics 101&quot;) were put on 1993&#x27;s &quot;Kill My Landlord&quot;. In 1994, the group released its second album, &quot;Genocide &amp; Juice&quot;. The group took a four-year recording hiatus to work as community activists before releasing &quot;Steal This Album&quot; (the title of which pays tribute to 1960s radical Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s yippie manifesto, &quot;Steal this Book&quot;) to critical acclaim in 1998. &quot;Steal This Album&quot; featured the stand-out single, &quot;Me and Jesus the Pimp in a ’79 Granada Last Night.&quot; The online magazine &quot;Dusted&quot; called &quot;Steal This Album&quot; &quot;the best hip-hop album of the 1990s&quot;.

===&quot;Party Music&quot; and post-9/11 aftermath===
In 2001, The Coup released &quot;Party Music&quot; to widespread praise. However, in part because of distribution problems, sales of the album were low. The original album cover art depicted group members Pam the Funkstress and Riley standing in front of the twin towers of the World Trade Center as they are destroyed by huge explosions, and Riley is pushing the button on a guitar tuner. The cover art was finished in June 2001 and the album was scheduled to be released in mid-September. However, in response to the similarity of the artwork with the September 11, 2001 attacks, the album release was delayed until November of that year with the cover featuring a hand with a flaming martini glass.

The attention generated concerning the album&#x27;s cover art precipitated some criticism of the group&#x27;s lyrical content as well, particularly the &quot;Party Music&quot; track &quot;5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO.&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics includes lines such as &quot;You could throw a twenty in a vat of hot oil/When he jump in after it, watch him boil.&quot; Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin cited the song in calling the Coup&#x27;s work a &quot;stomach-turning example of anti-Americanism disguised as highbrow intellectual expression.&quot;

=== Mid-2000s ===
On November 15, 2005, Tarus Jackson (AKA Terrance), who had joined the group as a promoter, was fatally shot during a robbery at his home in Oakland.

December 2, 2006 saw another tragedy for the Coup: About two hours following a performance at the San Diego House of Blues, the tour bus in which the group was riding drove off the road and flipped over before becoming engulfed in flames. All passengers managed to climb out alive, although some were badly injured. The group did, however, lose all of its clothes, computers, cash, identification, house/car keys, cell phones, all of its instruments, and sound equipment. The ensuing insurance payment was delayed in its arrival, and the group was forced to cancel the rest of its tour.

The group’s songs &quot;My Favorite Mutiny&quot; and &quot;Pork &amp; Beef&quot; were featured in the 2007 film, &quot;Superbad&quot;, with the former also being featured in the HBO miniseries &quot;24/7 Flyers-Rangers&quot;, as well as in the video game &quot;NBA Live 07&quot;, while &quot;Ride the Fence&quot; was featured in EA&#x27;s 2007 skateboarding video game &quot;Skate&quot;. The song “Captain Sterling’s Little Problem” accompanied the closing credits of &quot;Sir, No, Sir&quot;, a documentary about the GI anti-war movement.

=== 2010–2020 ===

On Wednesday January 13, 2010, The Coup’s bassist Dewey Tucker was shot and killed on the I-80 freeway in Hercules, CA, while driving from his home in Vallejo, CA, to rehearsal with The Coup in Oakland, CA. It was later found to be a case of mistaken identity.

The Coup&#x27;s sixth album, a concept album entitled &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot;, was released on October 30, 2012, to wide acclaim. The first track, &quot;The Magic Clap&quot;, was leaked by the band themselves and posted below an article on August 13, 2012. 

The album &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; was inspired by a screenplay written by Riley, &quot;a dark comedy with magical realism&quot; that drew inspiration from his time spent working as a telemarketer. The film&#x27;s screenplay was published by &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot; in 2014. Riley was able to secure funding to turn the script into the film &quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot;, which was released in theaters by Annapurna Pictures on July 6, 2018. The film, which follows a young African-American telemarketer who adopts a white accent in order to thrive at his job, stars Lakeith Stanfield, with Armie Hammer, Tessa Thompson, Terry Crews, and Danny Glover in supporting roles. 

Having taken six years after their last album, The Coup recorded a full soundtrack to the film, entitled &quot;The Soundtrack to Sorry to Bother You&quot;, and released the first single, &quot;OYAHYTT (feat. Lakeith Stanfield)&quot;, on July 13, 2018. Guest artists included Janelle Monae, Killer Mike, and E40. Songs from the 2012 album were not in the actual film. Vinyl for the album was released in February 2020.

== Band members ==

===Boots Riley===
Among other things, Boots Riley is known for charismatic, and seemingly inexhaustibly energetic, punk-like stage presence.

In 1991, he and other artists founded the Mau Mau Rhythm Collective, a group set up to use the power of hip hop music to publicize other efforts and movements. The next year, Riley founded The Coup.

In July 2002, Riley was a guest on Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; and repeatedly referred to himself as a communist. Maher criticized him by saying that communists don&#x27;t sell records.

Riley was charged with abusive language for allegedly using profanity on stage while performing with the band Galactic in Downtown Norfolk, Virginia, in the city&#x27;s annual Bayou Boogaloo Festival at Town Point Park in June 2008. This was a result of controversy that started a few weeks prior in the same park when, at a different festival, singer Ray-J used language some found offensive. Riley&#x27;s charge only carried a small fine. However, the American Civil Liberties Union decided to help him fight it on free speech grounds before the charge was ultimately dismissed by the city shortly thereafter.

During Tom Morello&#x27;s Fall 2008 tour as the Nightwatchman, Riley appeared on selected dates, and the two debuted a song from an upcoming project called Street Sweeper Social Club. In March 2009, a Web site appeared at the url streetsweepermusic.com, which debuted its first single &quot;Fight! Smash! Win!&quot; It was also announced that the band would be the opening act on the upcoming tour with Nine Inch Nails and Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

Boots Riley is also an active political/social organizer and speaker. He has been known to work with eviltwinbooking.org and speakoutnow.org, among other groups.

===Silk-E===
Silk-E is a vocalist with The Coup, performing in-studio and on stage. She joined The Coup in 2003, during promotion of the &quot;Party Music&quot; album. Known for her wild, engaging performance antics, energetic dancing, and her soulful, gravelly voice. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said she &quot;sings and struts like Tina Turner raised on hip-hop.
Part of her prowess is due to the fact that she started her career as a rapper. She has a solo album in which she is mainly rapping, entitled &quot;Urban Therapy&quot;.

There was a single and video from the album, &quot;Hard Times&quot;, which received some MTV airtime.

===Hassan Hurd===
Hassan Hurd is the drummer for The Coup. Hassan grew up in the church and was first known as a gospel drummer. He is known for the unshakable lock on his groove, explosive power and velocity, and crazy chops. At one point, he quit The Coup for a couple of years to pursue college football.

===JJ Jungle===
JJ Jungle is the bassist for The Coup. He joined the group after bassist Dewey Tucker died. JJ Jungle is known for his energy, his never-failing lock into pocket, and his on stage acrobatics. JJ Jungle also has a band with Mike Dillon called Mike Dillon&#x27;s Go-Go Jungle.

===Grego Simmons===
Grego Simmons plays guitar for The Coup. He also plays with Goapele and Ursus Minor.

===B&#x27;nai Rebelfront===

Prince gave Pam the name &quot;Purple Pam&quot;. In addition to DJing, she owned and operated a successful catering business in Northern California. Pam did not usually tour with The Coup. On December 22, 2017, Pam died at age 51, due to complications following organ transplant surgery.

===E-roc===
Eric Davis, known as E-roc, was part of The Coup as a rapper for the first 2 albums and then left the group in 1997 to become a longshoreman with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.

===Lionel &quot;LJ&quot; Holoman===

===DJO===

== Cultural impact ==

===Literature===
*The 2001 novel &quot;Too Beautiful For Words&quot;, by Monique W. Morris, was based on The Coup&#x27;s 1997 7-minute opus &quot;Me And Jesus The Pimp In A &#x27;79 Grenada Last Night&quot;. Morris kept the original storyline and main characters of the song as the setting for her work. Some of the dialogue in the book is directly from the song as well. The title of the novel is from the refrain of the bridge in The Coup&#x27;s song. Published by HarperCollins Publishers.
*Vijay Prashad&#x27;s 2002 book, &quot;Fat Cats and Running Dogs&quot; starts with a quote from The Coup&#x27;s &quot;Fat Cats and Bigga Fish&quot;.
*The 2013 book &quot;Party Music&quot;, by Rickey Vincent, was inspired by the concept of The Coup&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Party Music&quot; and discussions that the author had with Boots Riley about the subject. The book is a history of The Lumpen, the Black Panther Party&#x27;s funk band. Riley wrote the introduction to the book.
*&quot;My Favorite Mutiny Zine&quot; is a zine named after The Coup&#x27;s song of the same name. It was based in Wyoming and appears to have stopped printing in 2011 or 2012.

===Music===

*The 1993 song &quot;Practice Lookin&#x27; Hard&quot;, by E40, has a chorus and a concept built around the lyric &quot;I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin&#x27; hard&quot;, from The Coup&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;Not Yet Free&quot;. Boots Riley performs the vocal in the E40 song, and performs in the video alongside Tupac Shakur and E40.
*The 1998 song &quot;Way Past Dark&quot; was released as an exclusive track to the ICU (Ill Crew Universal) album &quot;The Revival.&quot;
*The 2013 song &quot;Romantisch&quot;, by Jel of Anticon fame, has a chorus which is a vocal sample of Boots Riley from The Coup&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;The Name Game&quot;.

===Film===

The 1997 film &quot;Money Talks&quot; starring Chris Tucker, has exactly the same opening scene as the opening scene of The Coup&#x27;s 1993 video for &quot;Not Yet Free&quot;. In both, the protagonist is riding around in an expensive looking Mercedes-Benz, pulls up to the car wash to park and gets out. In both, it is at this time that we figure out that the protagonist merely works at the car wash. In both, the protagonist holds the keys out in front of the actual owner and feigns as if he&#x27;s going to hit the owner.
