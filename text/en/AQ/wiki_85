<text>Let&#x27;s Take It to the Stage is the seventh album by American funk rock band Funkadelic. It was released on April 21, 1975 on Westbound Records. The album charted at number 102 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 14 on the R&amp;B Albums.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Take It to the Stage&quot; is a funk rock album. The opening track, &quot;Good to Your Earhole&quot;, features extensive guitar parts and a pronounced funk groove played by the rhythm section. According to Funkadelic bandleader George Clinton, the guitar solo for &quot;Get Off Your Ass and Jam&quot; was performed by &quot;a smack addict&quot; guitar player who had found his way into the studio. He asked Clinton if he could play for some cash and proceeded to play &quot;like he was possessed&quot;, soloing over the entire duration of the song. He received $50 for his efforts without Clinton ever learning his name. In a July 2009 interview with &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot;, guitarist Paul Warren said that he played the solo.

The closing track &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, which begins with a monologue by Clinton about &quot;dicks and clits&quot;, appropriates an extended organ coda from Johann Sebastian Bach. &quot;Get Off Your Ass and Jam&quot; has been sampled on several hip hop hits, including Brand Nubian&#x27;s &quot;Slow Down&quot;, Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;, and N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;100 Miles and Runnin&#x27;&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing the album in 1975, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine called it a collection of Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;usual good mix of soul and jazz sounds, mixed in with singing and street raps&quot;, citing the title track and &quot;Baby I Owe You Something Good&quot; as highlights. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said Funkadelic finally does on record &quot;what they&#x27;ve always promised to do in the hype—make the Ohio Players sound like the Mike Curb Congregation.&quot; Years later, he wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981) that, despite the group&#x27;s &quot;disturbingly occultish bent&quot;, the music is &quot;tough-minded, outlandish, very danceable, and finally, I think (and hope), liberating&quot;; for &quot;Blender&quot;, he said it is their &quot;tightest album ... all 10 tracks rock on.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett found &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It to the Stage&quot; to be one of the band&#x27;s most comical records with &quot;more P-Funk all-time greats as well, making for a grand balance of the serious and silly.&quot; Sasha Frere-Jones, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said it was &quot;a summing-up of everything Funkadelic had done to date, and is still their most playable record.&quot; He felt that, although Clinton&#x27;s &quot;sexual politics weren&#x27;t at their best&quot; on tracks such as &quot;No Head No Backstage Pass&quot;, the album is exemplary of the band&#x27;s musicianship.

<doc id="113707" wikidata="Q8053961" url="?curid=113707" title="Yiye Ávila">
<text>José Joaquín Ávila Portalatín (September 11, 1925 – June 28, 2013), better known as Yiye Ávila, was a Puerto Rican Pentecostal Evangelist and writer of Sephardic origins. His preaching and messages were characterized in proclaiming that the coming of Christ is imminent. He is considered one of the most influential Protestant preachers of the Spanish language. He was also the second runner-up for Mr. North America in 1953.

==Early life==
José Joaquín Ávila Portalatín was born in Camuy, Puerto Rico. His parents, Pablo Ávila and Herminia Portalatin, were both Sephardic Jew schoolteachers that had converted to Christianity, and he eventually followed in their footsteps. He enrolled at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico San Germán campus, with plans to study medicine. There he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in natural sciences and completed his pre-medical studies. He chose to return to his hometown of Camuy and teach chemistry and biology at the local high school, where he taught for the next 22 years. Eventually a change of careers would come about that would take him to over 100 countries.

==Sporting life==
He began playing baseball in the Double A level and training as a weight lifter. In 1952, he competed and won the Mr. Puerto Rico bodybuilding contest, and would go on to become the second runner-up for the title of Mr. North America in 1953.

While training for the summer Olympic Games of 1956, Ávila experienced terrible pain in parts of his body and, after various tests, was diagnosed with chronic arthritis by his doctors. This prevented him from participating in the Olympics or in any other future sporting event. The pain was so intense that Ávila suffered limited mobility and could not even perform everyday chores. He turned to Christianity and began praying, seeking divine intervention for his situation. According to him, he received a divine revelation through the reading and study of the Protestant Bible, where he received healing from Jesus Christ. From that time on, he dedicated himself to ministry.

==Evangelism==
Although Yiye Ávila was always deeply interested in Christianity, he reportedly was convinced to dedicate all his life and work to evangelism after watching a Christian television show hosted by Oral Roberts, an American televangelist, in the early 1960s. In 1967, Ávila retired after 22 years as a teacher and began to concentrate on Christian work instead.

He became a full-time preacher and, in 1972, he invited several friends, family, and neighbors to form the Escuadron Relampago Cristo Viene (&quot;Christ Is Coming Lightning Squadron&quot;), which congregated in a small room in his house to discuss the Bible, salvation, Christianity, and the Apocalypse. Eventually, his ministry and followers increased dramatically, and a new three-story building near the PR # 2 state road was built to accommodate the attending public. His preaching was followed by various church groups and many Latin American evangelists invited him to preach to their local communities and churches. This demand prompted Yiye to create a radio program and, eventually, a television network called Cadena Del Milagro (Miracle Network) so that his preaching could reach those same communities that he visited.

The network and his ministry has grown considerably over the years, expanding to magazines, books, audio tapes, videos and televised scheduled programming. The three-story building which he and his close followers originally built now serves as the headquarters for Yiye&#x27;s ministry and his television network.

Beginning in the 1970s, Yiye became a laborious evangelist, visiting almost all Latin American countries, many North American cities, and parts of Europe. He appeared on a daily morning telecast preaching selected verses from the Bible and receiving prayer petitions from viewers. He also appeared every Saturday night on the network&#x27;s flagship show, &quot;Campaña Por TV&quot; (Campaigning Through TV), where he preached selected verses of the New Testament, presented Evangelical Christian music groups, and invited viewers to convert to Evangelical Christianity.

In his shows, he encouraged viewers to congregate by going to Evangelical Christian churches and to form Evangelical Christian groups to discuss the Bible and current events. These shows and many other programs are broadcast in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and are transmitted via satellite to Latin America, the continental United States and certain parts of Europe.

In addition to his television shows and public preaching, Yiye Ávila was a prolific writer, publishing numerous works throughout his ministry years. Many of his public preachings have been recorded and published on tapes and compact discs.

==Personal life and death==
Yiye Ávila was married to Carmen Delia Talavera (better known as Yeya) and had three daughters: Noemí, Doris Myrna, and Carmen Ilia. In 1989, his daughter Carmen Ilia was murdered by her husband. On April 28, 2009, his daughter Noemi Ávila, an Evangelical pastor herself, died in a car accident in Freites, Venezuela.

Although his ministry has expanded across three continents and he has become a household name among Evangelical Christian families in Latin America, he preferred a humble life, reportedly living in the same house he owned and in the same conditions before his ministry began. In 2009, he suffered a debilitating stroke that limited his speech capabilities, and he retired from public preaching. On June 28, 2013, Yiye Ávila died from cardiac arrest at the age of 87. He was buried at Cementerio Municipal el Remanso de Paz in Camuy, Puerto Rico.

<doc id="113713" wikidata="Q1143058" url="?curid=113713" title="Second Kok cabinet">
<text>The second Kok cabinet, also called the second [[Purple (government)|Purple]] cabinet, was the executive branch of the Dutch government from 3 August 1998 until 22 July 2002.

The cabinet was a continuation of the previous first Kok cabinet and was formed by the social-democratic Labour Party (PvdA), the conservative-liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the social-liberal Democrats 66 after the election of 1998. The cabinet was a centrist grand coalition and had a substantial majority in the House of Representatives with Labour Leader Wim Kok serving as Prime Minister. Prominent Liberal politician Annemarie Jorritsma, the Minister of Transport and Water Management in the previous cabinet, served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs, while former progressive-liberal leader Els Borst continued as Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport and also served as Deputy Prime Minister.

The cabinet served during the economic expansion of the late 1990s and early unstable 2000s. Domestically, it was able to implement several major social reforms such as legalising same-sex marriage, and had to deal with the assassination of Pim Fortuyn. Internationally, it had to deal with several crises such as the fallout of the Srebrenica massacre and the response to September 11 attacks. The cabinet suffered several major internal and external conflicts including multiple cabinet resignations; the cabinet itself resigned prematurely on two occasions: first following a major political crisis in May 1999 (it later came back on its resignation), and second, following the conclusions of a report into the Srebrenica massacre on 16 April 2002. It continued in a demissionary capacity until it was replaced following the election of 2002.

==Formation==
The new cabinet was the successor of the First Kok cabinet (First Purple cabinet) and was formed from the same coalition of Labour Party, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democrats 66. It was also known as the &#x27;tweede paarse kabinet&#x27; (&#x27;second purple cabinet&#x27;) called such because it contained both the social-democratic Labour Party (red) and the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (blue).

==Term==
The aim of the cabinet was to continue the policy of cabinet Kok I, which was concerned with economizing, tax reduction and making an end to unemployment. Wim Kok was the Prime Minister, Annemarie Jorritsma as the Deputy Prime Minister for the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, and Els Borst for Democrats 66. There was no strong opposition in the parliament. The cabinet completed processes of liberalisation which were started by the previous cabinet: the legalisation of prostitution in 2000, same-sex marriage in 2001 and Euthanasia in 2002. This cabinet was notable for resigning twice. The first time was in May 1999, when Democrats 66 stepped out of the coalition when proposed legislation entered by this party was blocked; through negotiations the crisis was solved and the cabinet stayed together. The second and final time was on 16 April 2002, just one month before the next election, when Prime Minister Kok wished to resign over the NIOD report into the genocide of Srebrenica in 1995 and the other ministers had no choice but to follow him. The Second Kok cabinet remained in place as a Demissionary cabinet until 22 July 2002, when it was replaced by the First Balkenende cabinet.

===Changes===
On 7 June 1999 Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Fisheries Haijo Apotheker (D66) resigned citing that as a former mayor he could not adjust to national politics. Minister of Social Affairs and Employment Klaas de Vries (PvdA) served as acting Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Fisheries until 9 June 1999 when Member of the European Parliament Laurens Jan Brinkhorst (D66), a former State Secretary for Foreign Affairs was appointed as his successor.

On 13 March 2000 Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Bram Peper (PvdA) resigned after a report was released about inappropriate declarations he had made when he served as Mayor of Rotterdam. Minister for Integration and Urban Planning Roger van Boxtel (D66) served as acting Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations until 24 March 2000 when Minister of Social Affairs and Employment Klaas de Vries (PvdA) was installed as his successor. That same day State Secretary for Finance Willem Vermeend (PvdA) was appointed as Minister of Social Affairs and Employment and Member of the House of Representatives Wouter Bos (PvdA) was installed as State Secretary for Finance.

On 1 January 2001 State Secretary for Justice Job Cohen (PvdA) resigned after he was appointed as Mayor of Amsterdam. That same day Member of the House of Representatives Ella Kalsbeek (PvdA) was installed as his successor.

<text>Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) is an intergovernmental scientific program, launched in 1971 by UNESCO, that aims to establish a scientific basis for the &#x27;improvement of relationships&#x27; between people and their environments.

MAB engages with the international development agenda, especially the Sustainable Development Goals and the Post 2015 Development Agenda. The MAB programme provides a platform for cooperation in research and development. , 759 sites across 136 countries, including 22 transboundary sites, have been included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The reserves cover more than 5% of the world’s surface and are home to over 260 million people.

==Biosphere reserves==
Biosphere reserves are areas comprising terrestrial, marine and coastal ecosystems. Its biosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the states where they are located. Their status is internationally recognized. Biosphere reserves are &#x27;Science for Sustainability support sites&#x27;.

Biosphere reserves have three zones:
* The core area(s) comprises a strictly protected ecosystem.
* The buffer zone surrounds or adjoins the core areas and is used for ecological practices.
* The transition area is the part of the reserve where most activity is allowed.

=== IUCN classification ===
The first biosphere reserves were designated in 1976 in several countries including the US, UK, Uruguay, Thailand, Iran and Poland.

In 1996, the IUCN and MAB published a guideline for how to assess UNESCO biosphere reserves in the IUCN classification system. The IUCN distinguishes between the biosphere core area, buffer zones, transition zones, and each individual biosphere reserve. Biosphere core zones were in IUCN category I; either Ia (strict nature reserve) or Ib (wilderness area). Biosphere buffer zones would fall into categories IV, V or VI, and transition zones would be categorized as either V or VI, if possible. In the 2020s, the zones are categorized as follows: core (category I-IV), buffer (category V-VI), transition (uncategorized).

==Programme&#x27;s structure==

Participating countries establish MAB National Committees that define and implement each country&#x27;s activities. MAB currently operates through 158 national committees established among the 195 member states and nine associate member states of UNESCO.

The agenda of the MAB programme is defined by its main governing body, the International Coordinating Council. The MAB Council consists of 34 member states elected by UNESCO&#x27;s General Conference. The council elects a chair and five vice-chairs from each of UNESCO&#x27;s geopolitical regions, one of which functions as a rapporteur. These constitute the MAB Bureau.

The MAB Secretariat is based at UNESCO&#x27;s Division of Ecological and Earth Sciences, at UNESCO&#x27;s headquarters in Paris. It works with field offices at national and regional levels. MAB is funded by UNESCO and mobilizes funds in trust granted by Member States, bilateral and multilateral sources, and extra-budgetary funds provided by countries, the private sector and private institutions.

==World Congress of Biosphere Reserves ==

The first World Congress of Biosphere Reserves was held in Minsk, Belarus in 1983; the congress created an &#x27;Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves&#x27; which was adopted the following year. 

The second World Congress was held in Seville, Spain in March 1995. 

The third World Congress was held in Madrid, Spain from February 4–9, 2008.

The fourth World Congress of Biosphere Reserves took place in Lima, Peru, from March 14–17, 2016.

The fifth World Congress is due to be held in Hangzhou, China from September 22–27 2025.

== Networks ==
The World Network of Biosphere Reserves are as follows:
* The African Biosphere Reserves Network (AfriMAB) was created in 1996 and comprises 33 African countries.
* The ArabMAB Network was officially launched in 1997 and represents 18 Arab countries.
* The East Asian Biosphere Reserve Network was launched in 1994. Today, it consists of China, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation.
* EuroMAB is the network of biosphere reserves in Europe and North America. Created in 1987, it is the largest MAB Regional Network with 53 countries.
* The Ibero-American MAB Network (IberoMAB) was created in 1992. It comprises 22 countries from Latin American and the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal.
* The Pacific Man and the Biosphere Network (PacMAB) was created in 2006 and comprises the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Tonga.
* The South and Central Asia MAB Network (SACAM) was created in 2002 and comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<doc id="113723" wikidata="Q13186" url="?curid=113723" title="Raisin">
<text>A raisin is a dried grape. Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, the word &quot;raisin&quot; is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape, with &quot;sultana&quot; being a golden- or green-colored dried grape, and &quot;currant&quot; being a dried small Black Corinth seedless grape.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;raisin&quot; dates back to Middle English and is a loanword from Old French; in modern French, &quot;raisin&quot; means &quot;grape&quot;, while a dried grape is a &quot;raisin sec&quot;, or &quot;dry grape&quot;. The Old French word, in turn, developed from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;a bunch of grapes.&quot;

==Varieties==


Raisin varieties depend on the types of grapes used and appear in a variety of sizes and colors, including green, black, brown, purple, blue, and yellow. Seedless varieties include sultanas (the common American type is known as Thompson Seedless in the United States), Zante currants (black Corinthian raisins, &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; L. var. Apyrena), and Flame grapes. Raisins are traditionally sun-dried but may also be artificially dehydrated.

Golden raisins are generally dried in dehydrators with controlled temperature and humidity, which allows them to retain a lighter color and more moisture. They are often treated with sulfur dioxide after drying.

Black Corinth or Zante currants are small, sometimes seedless, raisins that are much darker and have a tart, tangy flavor. They are usually called currants. Muscat raisins are larger and sweeter than other varieties.

Grapes used to produce raisins in the Middle East and Asia include the large black monukka (or manucca) grapes that produce large raisins. 

==Processing==
Raisins are produced commercially by drying harvested grape berries. For a grape berry to dry, water inside the grape must be removed completely from the interior of the cells onto the surface of the grape where the water droplets can evaporate. However, this diffusion process is very difficult because the grape skin contains wax in its cuticle, which prevents the water from passing through. In addition to this, the physical and chemical mechanisms located on the outer layers of the grape are adapted to prevent water loss. The three steps to commercial raisin production include pre-treatment, drying, and post-drying processes.

===Pre-treatment===
Pre-treatment is a necessary step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process. A faster water removal rate decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins. The historical method of completing this process was developed in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids. This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.

Recently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.

===Drying===

The three types of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and mechanical drying. Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and microbial deterioration can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.

Mechanical drying can be done in a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave drying. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave drying produces puffed raisins.

===Post-drying processes===
After the drying process is complete, raisins are sent to processing plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process. Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing to ensure that the added moisture has been removed.

All steps in the production of raisins are very important in determining the quality of raisins. Sometimes sulfur dioxide is applied to raisins after the pre-treatment step and before drying to decrease the rate of browning caused by the reaction between polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds. Sulfur dioxide also helps to preserve flavor and prevent the loss of certain vitamins during the drying process.
==Production==
Estimated global production of raisins in 2023–24 was 1.1 million tonnes, led by Turkey, China, Iran, and the United States as the largest producers.

==Nutrition==

Raisins are 15% water, 79% carbohydrates (including 4% fiber), and 3% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). In a reference amount of , raisins supply 299 kilocalories and moderate amounts (10–19% DV) of the Daily Value (DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B6, and several dietary minerals rich in content (above 20% DV), including potassium and copper (table).

==Toxicity in animals==

Raisins can cause kidney failure in both cats and dogs. The cause of this is not known.

<doc id="113724" wikidata="Q163248" url="?curid=113724" title="World Network of Biosphere Reserves">
<text>The UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) covers internationally designated protected areas, known as biosphere or nature reserves, which are meant to demonstrate a balanced relationship between people and nature (e.g. encourage sustainable development). They are created under the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB).

==Mission==
The World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR) of the MAB Programme consists of a dynamic and interactive network of sites. It works to foster the harmonious integration of people and nature for sustainable development through participatory dialogue, knowledge sharing, poverty reduction, human well-being improvements, respect for cultural values and by improving society&#x27;s ability to cope with climate change. It promotes north–south and South-South collaboration and represents a unique tool for international cooperation through the exchange of experiences and know-how, capacity-building and the promotion of best practices.

==The network==

 total membership had reached 738 biosphere reserves in 134 countries (including 22 transboundary sites) occurring in all regions of the world. This already takes into account some biosphere reserves that have been withdrawn or revised through the years, as the program&#x27;s focus has shifted from simple protection of nature to areas displaying close interaction between man and environment.

In 2023, ten more biospheres were announced.

In 2024, eleven more biospheres were announced; this brings a total of 759 sites across 136 countries at the end of 2024.

===Criteria and periodic review process===
Article 4 of the defines general criteria for an area to be qualified for designation as a biosphere reserve as follows:
Article 9 of the Statutory Framework states that &quot;the status of each biosphere reserve should be subject to a periodic review every ten years, based on a report prepared by the concerned authority, on the basis of the criteria of Article 4&quot;. If a biosphere reserve no longer satisfies the criteria contained in Article 4, it may be recommended the state concerned take measures to ensure conformity. Should a biosphere reserve still does not satisfy the criteria contained in Article 4, within a reasonable period, the area will no longer be referred to as a biosphere reserve which is part of the network.

===Withdrawals===
Article 9 of the Statutory Framework gives a state the right to remove a biosphere reserve under its jurisdiction from the network.
, a total of 45 sites had been withdrawn from the World Network of Biosphere Reserves by 9 countries.
Some reserves have been withdrawn after they no longer met newer, stricter criteria for reserves, for example on zonation or area size.

In June 2017, during the International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB ICC) meeting in Paris, the United States has withdrawn 17 sites (out of the country&#x27;s previous total of 47 sites) from the program.

<doc id="113726" wikidata="Q184975" url="?curid=113726" title="Hekla">
<text>Hekla (), or Hecla, is an active stratovolcano in the south of Iceland with a height of . Hekla is one of Iceland&#x27;s most active volcanoes; over 20 eruptions have occurred in and around the volcano since the year 1210. During the Middle Ages, the Icelandic Norse called the volcano the &quot;Gateway to Hell&quot; and the idea spread over much of Europe.

The volcano&#x27;s frequent large and often initially explosive eruptions have covered much of Iceland with tephra, and these layers can be used to date eruptions of Iceland&#x27;s other volcanoes. Approximately 10% of the tephra created in Iceland in the last thousand years has come from Hekla, amounting to . Cumulatively, the volcano has produced one of the largest volumes of lava of any in the world in the last millennium, around .

==Etymology==
In Icelandic &quot;Hekla&quot; is the word for a short hooded cloak, which may relate to the frequent cloud cover on the summit. An early Latin source refers to the mountain as &quot;Mons Casule&quot;.

==Reputation==
After the eruption of 1104, stories, probably spread deliberately through Europe by Cistercian monks, told that Hekla was the gateway to Hell. The Cistercian monk Herbert of Clairvaux wrote in his &quot;De Miraculis&quot; (without naming Hekla): A poem by the monk Benedeit from about the voyages of Saint Brendan mentions Hekla as the prison of Judas.
In the &quot;Flatey Book Annal&quot; it was recorded that during the 1341 eruption, people saw large and small birds flying in the mountain&#x27;s fire which were taken to be souls.
In the 16th century Caspar Peucer wrote that the Gates of Hell could be found in &quot;the bottomless abyss of Hekla Fell&quot;. The belief that Hekla was the gate to Hell persisted until the 19th century. There is still a legend that witches gather on Hekla during Easter.

==Geography==
Hekla is part of a volcanic ridge, long. The most active part of this ridge, a fissure about long named , is considered to be within Hekla proper. Hekla looks rather like an overturned boat, with its keel being a series of craters, two of which are generally the most active.

==Geology==

Hekla has a morphological type between that of a fissure vent and stratovolcano (built from mixed lava and tephra eruptions) sited at a rift-transform junction in the area where the south Iceland seismic zone and eastern volcanic zone meet. The unusual form of Hekla is found on very few volcanoes around the world, notably Callaqui in Chile. The &quot;Heklugjá&quot; fissure opens along its entire length during major eruptions and is fed by a magma reservoir estimated to have a top below the surface with centroid lower. The chamber extends to an unusual depth of more than , and the more silicic lavas have matured at more than .

Many of the eruptions commence with thicker more explosive rhyolite, dacite or andesite eruptives which create tephra and have the potential for pyroclastic flows. Other or the later part of eruptions come from thinner basalt tending magma which forms lava fields.

The tephra produced by its eruptions is high in fluorine, which is poisonous to animals. Hekla&#x27;s basaltic andesite lava generally has a SiO2 content of over 54%, compared to the 45–50% of other nearby transitional alkaline basalt eruptions (see TAS classification).
It is the only Icelandic volcano to produce calc-alkaline lavas.
Phenocrysts in Hekla&#x27;s lava can contain plagioclase, pyroxene, titanomagnetite, olivine, and apatite.

When not erupting Hekla is often covered with snow and small glaciers; it is also unusually aseismic with activity only starting 30–80 minutes before an eruption. Hekla is located on the mid-ocean ridge, a diverging plate boundary.
Hekla is closely studied today for parameters such as strain, tilt, deformation and other movement and seismic activity. Earthquakes in the volcano&#x27;s vicinity are generally below magnitude 2 while it is dormant and magnitude 3 when erupting.

==Eruption history==

The earliest recorded eruption of Hekla took place in 1104. Since then there have been between twenty and thirty considerable eruptions, with the mountain sometimes remaining active for periods of six years with little pause. Eruptions in Hekla are varied and difficult to predict. Precursor seismic activity may only be for a couple of hours or less. Some are very short (a week to ten days) whereas others can stretch into months and years (the 1947 eruption started 29 March 1947 and ended April 1948). But there is a general correlation: the longer Hekla goes dormant, the larger and more catastrophic its opening eruption will be. The most recent eruption was on 26 February 2000.

===Prehistoric eruptions===

One of the largest Holocene eruptions in Iceland was the Hekla 3 (or H3) eruption , which threw about of volcanic rock into the atmosphere, placing its Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) at 5. This would have cooled temperatures in the northern parts of the globe for a few years afterwards. Traces of this eruption have been identified in Scottish peat bogs, and in Ireland a study of tree rings dating from this period has shown negligible tree ring growth for a decade. The dates were recently recalibrated of the major eruptions and a table is given below as the difference in dates could cause confusion.

Unless otherwise stated eruption dates in Year (2019 values) column are from Global Volcanism Program and Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes, As other sources can disagree, there has been a recent literature update. The values and range given in the Year (2024 values) column used IntCal20 for H-5 and H-3 and ice core data for H-4 which were not available in 2019.

Hekla 3, 4, and 5 produced huge amounts of rhyolitic ash and tephra, covering 80% of Iceland and providing useful date markers in soil profiles in other parts of Europe such as Orkney, Scandinavia, and elsewhere. H3 and H4 produced the largest layers of tephra in Iceland since the last ice age. During the last 7,000 years, one third of the volcanic ash deposited in Scandinavia, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom originated from Hekla.

===1104 to 1878 ===
;1104 (H1)

Hekla had been dormant for at least 250 years when it erupted explosively in 1104 (probably in the autumn), covering which is over half of Iceland with 1.2 km3 / 2.5 km3 of rhyodacitic tephra. This was the second largest tephra eruption in the country in historical times with a VEI of 5. Farms upwind of the volcano in Þjórsárdalur valley, at Hrunamannaafréttur and at Lake Hvítárvatn were abandoned because of the damage. The eruption caused Hekla to become famous throughout Europe.

;1158
A VEI-4 eruption began on 19 January 1158 producing over of lava and of tephra. It is likely to be the source of the &quot;Efrahvolshraun&quot; lava on Hekla&#x27;s west.

;1206
The VEI-3 eruption began on 4 December.

;1222
The VEI-2 eruption and the 1206 eruption distributed around of tephra mainly to the northeast.

;1300–1301

This VEI-4 eruption, which started on 11 July and lasted for a year, was the second largest tephra eruption of Hekla since Iceland was settled, covering 
of land with of tephra. Over of lava was also expelled. The tephra caused significant damage to the settlements of Skagafjörður and Fljót, leading to over 500 deaths that winter.
The material output from this eruption had SiO2 levels of between 56% and 64%, and apart from a slight abundance of olivine the lava, was typical of Hekla eruptions.

;1341
A small eruption (VEI-3) started on 19 May and deposited around of tephra over the areas west and southwest of Hekla, leading to many cattle deaths, probably mainly from fluorosis.

;1389
In late 1389 Hekla erupted again (VEI-3), starting with a large ejection of tephra to the southeast. Later &quot;the eruption fissure moved itself out of the mountain proper and into the woods a little above Skard&quot;. Skard and another nearby farm were destroyed by a large lava flow that now forms the &quot;Nordurhraun&quot;. In total around of lava and of tephra were produced.

;1440
An eruption may have occurred around 1440 at Raudölder; despite being close to Hekla this is not classed as an eruption of Hekla based on the SiO2 content of the lava.

;1510

Details of the 1510 eruption were not recorded until a century later. It started on 25 July and was particularly violent (VEI 4), firing volcanic bombs as far as Vördufell, west. Tephra was deposited over Rangárvellir, Holt and Landeyjar, in total. A man in Landsveit was killed.

;1597
A VEI-4 eruption began on 3 January and lasted for over 6 months, with of tephra being deposited to the south-southeast, damaging Mýrdalur.

;1636–1637
A small (VEI-3) eruption began on 8 May 1636 and lasted for over a year. The of tephra from the eruption damaged pasture to the northeast causing death of livestock.

;1693
Starting 13 February and lasting for over 7 months the eruption was one of Hekla&#x27;s most destructive (VEI-4). Initially tephra was produced at 60,000 m3·s−1, during the entire eruption, which also caused lahars and tsunami. The tephra was deposited to the northwest, destroying and damaging farms and woodland in Þjórsárdalur, Land, Hreppar and Biskupstungur. Fine ash from the eruption reached Norway. There was damage to wildlife with significant numbers of trout, salmon, ptarmigan and farm animals dying.

;1725

A very small eruption, possibly only VEI-1, took place on 2 April 1725, producing flows of lava from locations around Hekla which have since been covered by later lava flows. These eruptions are not classed as of Hekla itself based on the SiO2 content of the lava.

;1766–1768
The eruption of 1766 was large (VEI-4) and produced the second largest lava flow, covering , and third largest tephra volume, , of any Icelandic volcano during the inhabited era. The eruption started at around 3:30 am on 5 April 1766 and ceased in May 1768. Initially a 2–4 cm layer of tephra was deposited over Austur-Húnavatnssýsla and Skagafjördur, resulting in the deaths of both fish and livestock. Rangárvellir, Land and Hreppar also suffered damage. During the eruption up to lava bombs were thrown away, and flooding was caused by the sudden melting of snow and ice on Hekla&#x27;s slopes.

;1845–1846

Hekla was dormant for more than sixty years before 1845, when it suddenly burst forth on 2 September at 9 am:

The eruption ceased around 5 April 1846. Initially in this VEI-4 eruption tephra was produced at 20,000 m3·s−1. The tephra deposition of a total amount of was mainly to the east-southeast; immediately to the east of Hekla the layer was deep. Fine ash was carried to the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. Lava flows to the west and north-west covered an area of with a volume of of lava. Large quantities of dark ash were deposited over pasture in the same directions leading to many livestock deaths through fluorosis for the next two years.

;1878

A small eruption (VEI-2) occurred between 27 February 1878 and April 1878, around east of Hekla, and produced of lava from two parallel fissures covering .

=== 1913 to 1948 ===
;1913

A small eruption (VEI-2) occurred between 25 April 1913 and 18 May 1913, around east of Hekla, and caused large fissures at Mundafell and Lambafit which produced of lava respectively.

;1947–1948
The VEI-4 eruption started on 29 March 1947 and ended on 21 April 1948. It is likely that this was both the second greatest lava eruption of Hekla whilst Iceland was inhabited and the second greatest lava eruption in the world in the period 1900–1970. A total lava volume was produced with of tephra. The height of Hekla was before the eruption, increasing to a maximum of , before dropping to subsequently.

The eruption occurred over a century after the last eruption of Hekla proper, the longest dormant period since 1104. Before the eruption the volcano had been visible from the surrounding area but nothing remarkable was noticed. The eruption occurred at 6:41 am ± 3 min with a loud roar; later eruptions could be heard throughout Iceland. An earthquake at 6:50 am measured 6 on the Mercalli intensity scale and increased the eruption intensity until it covered a fissure on the ridge. The cloud from the eruption had ascended to a height of 30 km by 7:08 am, the wind then carried it southwards towards Eyjafjallajökull, turning it black. Pumice first landed on Fljótshlíð at around 7:10 am, and tephra and ash continued falling until it formed a layer. A lava bomb that landed from Hekla was across and weighed . Between Vatnafjöll and Hekla, a layer of tephra up to thick was deposited, and this included bombs with a diameter larger than . Bombs with surface areas of were dropped onto the slopes of Hekla, for up to . 51 hours after the eruption had started, ash fell on Helsinki, Finland, having covered in this time.

The initial tephra production rate in the first 30 minutes of the eruption was 75,000 m3·s−1, dropping to 22,000 m3·s−1 for the next half-hour. The initial phase produced of tephra, equating to of Dense-rock equivalent, covering of land and sea. 98 farms were damaged by the eruption, but only 2 were no longer farmed in 1970. A large volunteer effort was mobilized to clear the tephra – around 1000 man-days by the end of July. The eruption produced around of water (snowmelt and directly from the fissure) which caused flooding of the Ytri Rangá river.

In the first 20 hours of the eruption approximately 3,500 m3·s−1 of lava was produced from the fissure, dividing into various branches and covering . On the second day, 8 distinct eruption columns were discernible. A crater formed at called the Lava Crater (&quot;Hraungígur&quot;), producing a constant flow of lava. Another crater named the Shoulder Crater (&quot;Axlargígur&quot;) produced a column of smoke every 10 seconds together with loud explosions that created visible compression waves in the smoke. By the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, the eruption was greatly diminished, and only the shoulder and summit craters were erupting explosively.
The explosive eruption increased in strength from 9–12 April and then from 28 April it reduced again. On 3 May, the volcano stopped throwing out lava in sudden explosions from its craters and changed to continuously ejecting tephra and ash for long periods, until early June when this reduced. On 2 September, the Shoulder Crater had a circumference at its top and the Summit Crater a circumference at its highest point, above the ridge. Sandy tephra and ash fell over Iceland in May and June, sometimes making it dark in the daytime near Hekla. The tephra caused fluorine poisoning of grazing sheep, making them unable to walk. That winter more craters formed, building up cones. Explosive activity had ceased six months after the first eruption. Lava flowed from the Lava Crater continuously during the eruption, starting at a rate of over 100 m3·s−1, dropping to 5–10 m3·s−1 in April and early May at a speed of around 20 cm·s−1 before increasing, eventually reaching 150 m3·s−1 at the end of June and at similar levels until mid-July with a peak flow speed of 2–2.5 m·s−1. From there it gradually decreased to under 10 m3·s−1 in November. Initially the lava comprised 57–58% SiO2 and 11% Fe2O3, from the time of peak flow onwards this changed to 54% SiO2 and 13.5% Fe2O3.

The lava river sometimes ran through lava tubes before emerging again. The lava front had a height of up to . On 15 and 16 June, a branch of lava flow to the south of Melfell traveled over in 30 hours before slowing and stopping by 21 June, from the Lava Crater. The longest lava stream produced was long and stopped in Stóraskógsbotnar. A scientist filming one of the lava streams on 2 November was hit by a block of lava and was killed.

The lava flow stopped after 13 months on 21 April, having covered and with a maximum depth of . The lava beds produced were mainly the ʻAʻā lava type with Pāhoehoe and &quot;lava a budella&quot; (lava tubes) areas. In April and May 1948 CO2 emitted from cracks in the ground pooled in hollows near to Hekla, killing 15 sheep and some wild animals and birds. In total of CO2 was emitted. Ditches were dug by farmers to drain these hollows, and the CO2 emission had stopped by the end of the year.

===1970 to 1991===
;1970

The 1970 eruption of Hekla started at 9:23 pm on 5 May 1970 and lasted until 5 July. It had a VEI of 3 and produced of lava covering an area of and 6.6×10 7 m³ of tephra, deposited over an area of , mainly to the northwest of the volcano.

The main Hekla fissure only erupted at its far southwest end, most of the eruption was from other fissures nearby. The eruption stopped in the south-southwest on 10 May and in Hlídargígar on 20 May, but a new fissure opened on the same day and lava flowed from this until 5 July. The lava was andesite containing olivine, similar to the lava produced later in the eruption of 1947.

Before the eruption, a greater than normal amount of snow melting had occurred, indicating the volcano was heating up. Earth tremors began at 8:48 pm on the evening of the eruption; the largest had a magnitude of 4. The eruption started weakly at 9:23 pm IMT ± 2 min before increasing in power. The first pumice fell on Búrfell power station, away, at 9:35 pm causing people to evacuate. The eruption seems to have started in two locations at the same time – to the Shoulder crater&#x27;s south-southwest and below the Lava Crater. At 10:30 pm a crater at was producing a lava column which reached an altitude of around . During the night a high lava fountain was thrown up from the main crater. A long fissure starting below the Lava Crater opened, and lava fountains and other lava flows emanated from it. One hour into the eruption, a new fissure opened to the northeast, producing two main lava fountains, and shortly after another adjoining fissure opened producing lava fountains to a height of . At around midnight, another fissure opened northwest of the Lava Crater, later hurling an over long lava fountain, into the air. By midnight lava had already covered over and this extended to by next morning implying a flow rate of around 1500 m³/s.

For the first two hours, tephra was produced at the rate of 10000 m³/s. The cloud from the eruption, which had reached by 10:10 pm, caused a lightning storm. The tephra was transported northwards by the wind, causing the sky to turn black in places – away at Blönduós tephra fell from midnight until 2 am, and ash fell on a trawler away at 2 am. Icelanders sampled the tephra fall in their locality by putting a plate outside to capture everything that fell onto it. This, and other measurements, showed the area covered was long and narrow with the 1 mm contour (an equivalent of 8 tonnes per hectare) extending to the north coast.
By 5:30 on 6 May, the lava flow measured long. Many lava bombs were found near the main crater, one had an area of and a likely weight of 12 tons. Xenoliths formed around 2% of the material produced by the craters. These were of rock types including basalt, andesite, ignimbrite and sedimentary rock.

The eruption became stronger at Skjólkvíar on 12 May, with columns of steam attaining a height of . The eruption intensity then gradually reduced until it stopped on 20 May. The lava field then had an area of . Later that day a long fissure opened 1 km north of the main Hlídargígar crater. That night it contained 17 lava fountains, each in height. By the evening of the next day, 10–12 craters had formed, each throwing pieces of lava in the air. This row of craters was named Öldugígar. Gradually the number of active craters decreased, the most active of these built a cone higher than the level of the ridge. Lava flowed from its base until mid-June when the lava cut through the north crater wall. The larger cones produced more tephra, occasionally with lightning within the tephra cloud. By 5 July, the eruption had stopped.

During eruptions of Hekla, fluorine is produced and sticks to the surfaces of the grains of tephra. Fine grains can have a fluorine content of 350 ppm, and fluorine poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25 ppm. At 250 ppm, death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably as a result of fluorosis caused by the eruption of Lakagígar. Some of the ash produced in this eruption had a fluorine content of 0.2%, and two days after the eruption contaminated grass had a dry weight content of up to 0.4% fluorine. 450 farms and 95,000 sheep were affected by the eruption. Some sheep were kept inside and fed on hay or moved, but other farmers were forced to graze their flocks outside.

;1980 and 1981
This VEI-3 eruption started at 13:28 on 17 August 1980 and lasted until 20 August 1980. It was a mixed eruption producing a lava volume of and a tephra volume of . The fissure opened along a length. Shortly before the eruption started a steam column was produced; eventually the eruption column reached a height of . The main tephra deposits were to the north-northeast and lasted for around 2 hours. Deposits were thick from the summit, decreasing to less than at the coast away.
Lava was initially produced from close to the summit, spreading to other parts of the fissure and covering an area of in around 24 hours. The last scoria were seen on the morning of 20 August. This was an unusual eruption both in the short time since the previous eruption – the shortest since 1104, and the length – previous eruptions had lasted from 2 months to 2 years rather than just 3 days.

The 1981 eruption, which is regarded as being a continuation of the previous year&#x27;s eruption, began at 3 am on 9 April 1981, had a VEI of 2 and produced of lava, lasting until 16 April 1981. The eruption threw ash to a height of , and a new crater formed at the summit from which 3 lava flows originated. These extended to a maximum of from the volcano, covering .

;1991

A VEI-3 eruption occurred from 17 January 1991 to 11 March 1991, producing of lava and of tephra. The eruption, which was preceded by sulphurous smells and earthquakes, started as a Plinian eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of within 10 minutes which had travelled over north-northeast to the coast within 3 hours. The eruption then began producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of to an average depth of . Initially, part of the Heklugjá fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching in height. By the second day, the activity stopped in all but one fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2 days, 800 m³/s of lava were produced, slowing to between 1 m³/s and 14 m³/s for most of the eruption. This low viscosity lava had a SiO2 content of approximately 54%.

===2000===

The most recent eruption was relatively short; it started at 18:18 on 26 February 2000 and lasted until 8 March. It was a VEI-3 eruption producing a lava volume of , DRE and m3 of tephra. The eruption went through four phases:
#initial explosive stage
#fire fountains
#bursts of Strombolian eruption
#effusion of lava

Eruption activity was at a maximum in the first hour, and by the first night the fissure on Hekla had opened to a length of . The steam column rose to a height of almost , and ash was transported to Grímsey on the North coast of Iceland. During this eruption, a NASA DC-8 aeroplane accidentally flew through the plume with all instruments switched on, resulting in unprecedented measurement of a young volcanic plume.

Up until this eruption, it had been assumed that Hekla was incapable of producing the most dangerous of volcanic phenomena, the pyroclastic flow. In January 2003, however, a team from the Norvol Institute in Reykjavík, under the leadership of Dr. Ármann Höskuldsson, reported that they found traces of a pyroclastic flow, roughly 5 km long, stretching down the side of the mountain. This will call for a reappraisal of volcanic eruptions of the basic rock type, which up to now were generally thought not to produce large pyroclastic flows. It will also require that the public and curious spectators who always rush to the scene at the start of a new outbreak, be kept much further away from the volcanic activity than was thought necessary during previous outbreaks.

=== Eruption Summary ===
==Flora and fauna==
The Hekla area was once forested. Forest and some grasses are much more resilient to ash and pumice fall than low vegetation, but the combined effect of human habitation and the volcanic activity has left an unstable surface very susceptible to erosion. Hekluskógar, a reforesting project is attempting to restore the birch and willow woodland to the slopes of Hekla, starting with soil fertilisation and grass sowing. This would stabilize the large areas of volcanic ash, help to reduce wind erosion of the frost heaved surface, slow drainage rates and hence water erosion, and ultimately increase biodiversity. It is the largest reforestation of its type in Europe. After an eruption, almost all of the &#x27;safe sites&#x27; on new lava flows are colonised by mosses within 20 years expanding to a homogeneous layer up to thick typically within 50 years.

Past eruptions have been associated with death of birds and live-stock related to either the high fluoride content of the tephra, carbon dioxide suffocation or toxic carbon monoxide gas release, and must have had local die back in the ecosystems. Local plant succession on the lava fields after eruptions has been better studied and there are four broad stages of natural succession with importantly the potential for regression:
#In first 70 years colonization and cover coalescence of moss &quot;Racomitrium lanuginosum&quot; and the Stereocaulon mosses 
#Moss secondary colonization to Racomitrium lanuginosum dominance which can take between 170 to 700 years
#After 600 years vascular plant dominance evolving towards the birch wood land climax ecosystem in Iceland if no disturbance
#Highland conditions/retrogression after tephra deposition which had occurred up to 860 years after the initial lava flow
Local factors and other disturbances influence these rates but the 1991 laval flow first stage was completed in 24 years. The basaltic volcanic soil development is typical for Iceland. Vegetation height prior to a tephra fall is the single most important factor for vascular plant survival so the presence of a woodland before a further large tephra deposit enhances regrowth.

==Sport and recreation==
Hekla is a popular destination for hiking. Following the most recent eruption the path goes most of the way to the summit; the walk takes 3 to 4 hours.
In spring, skiing is possible on short routes around the rim of the crater. In summer, there are easy (F) mountaineering routes also around the crater rim, and it is possible to snowcat to the top in winter. The volcano can be reached using the buses to Landmannalaugar further east, and it is possible to stay or camp at farms in the area. A visitor centre, The Hekla Center at Leirubakki Farm, opened in 2007.

==In popular culture==
Hekla has featured in artistic works since the time of its medieval infamy.

=== Architecture ===
The Tour Hekla, a 220 metre-tall skyscraper in La Défense, Paris, France, built in 2022, is named after the volcano.

===Films===
In the Spanish apocalyptic science fiction film, &quot;Los Últimos Días&quot; (2013), some news reporters speculate that three recent eruptions of Mount Hekla could have caused the spreading form of agoraphobia that kills affected people who go outside.

The climax of Robert Eggers&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;The Northman&quot; takes place on the slopes of Hekla.

===Food===
In the Boston, Massachusetts area, Hekla pastries can be found – large, upside-down cinnamon rolls with white sugar icing spooned over the top to look like the snow-topped volcano.

===Literature===
The British poet William Blake showed Winter being banished to Hekla in &quot;To Winter&quot;, one of the works from his &quot;Poetical Sketches&quot;.

In &quot;To Lie With Lions&quot;, by Dorothy Dunnett, a party of merchants visiting Iceland in the year 1471 witnesses the spectacular (fictional) eruption of both Hekla and Katla.

Mt. Hekla is referenced in the third chapter of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, in EE Ryan&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Saga of the American and a Curious Icelandic Flock&quot;, and in the final chapters of Joan Aiken&#x27;s novel &quot;Is&quot;.

The Hekla 3 eruption and the ensuing volcanic winter play a large role in Stephen Baxter&#x27;s alternate-history novel &quot;Bronze Winter&quot;.

===Music===
The piece &quot;Hekla&quot;, Op 52 (1964) by Icelandic composer Jón Leifs, has been called the &quot;loudest classical music of all time&quot;. The requirements for a performance of &quot;Hekla&quot; include four sets of rocks hit with hammers, steel plates, anvils, sirens, cannons, metal chains, choir, a large orchestra, and organ.

===Transportation===
A small Danish cruiser launched in 1890 was named &quot;Hekla&quot;; it was scrapped in 1955.

A Danish steamer called Hekla also saw combat in the First Schleswig War.

Icelandair named one of their aircraft after Hekla.

There have been several ships of the Royal Navy named HMS &quot;Hecla&quot;

===Organizations===
In October 2011 a German left-wing militant group called the &quot;Hekla-Empfangskomitee&quot; (Hekla Reception Committee) set at least 17 incendiary devices on railways in the Berlin area, with 2 of them going off.

The DBU Copenhagen football club &quot;Boldklubben Hekla&quot; play at Hekla Park.

<text>Cædmon (; fl. c. 657–684) is the earliest English poet whose name is known. A Northumbrian cowherd who cared for the animals at the double monastery of Streonæshalch (now known as Whitby Abbey) during the abbacy of St. Hilda, he was originally ignorant of &quot;the art of song&quot; but learned to compose one night in the course of a dream, according to the 8th-century Christian historian and saint Bede. He later became a zealous monk and an accomplished and inspirational Christian poet. He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism, with a feast day on 11 February.

Cædmon is one of twelve Anglo-Saxon poets identified in mediaeval sources, and one of three of these for whom both roughly contemporary biographical information and examples of literary output have survived. His story is related in the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;) by Bede, who wrote, &quot;[t]here was in the Monastery of this Abbess a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven.&quot;

Cædmon&#x27;s only known surviving work is &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot;, a nine-line alliterative vernacular praise poem in honour of God. The poem is one of the early attested examples of Old English and is, with the runic Ruthwell Cross and Franks Casket inscriptions, one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of Old English poetry. It is also one of the early recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language. In 1898, Cædmon&#x27;s Cross was erected in his honour in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church in Whitby.

==Life==

===Bede&#x27;s account===
The sole source of original information about Cædmon&#x27;s life and work is Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;. According to Bede, Cædmon was a lay brother who cared for the animals at the monastery Streonæshalch (now known as Whitby Abbey). One evening, while the monks were feasting, singing, and playing a harp, Cædmon left early to sleep with the animals because he knew no songs. The impression clearly given by St. Bede is that he lacked the knowledge of how to compose the lyrics to songs. While asleep, he had a dream in which &quot;someone&quot; (&quot;quidam&quot;) approached him and asked him to sing &quot;principium creaturarum&quot;, &quot;the beginning of created things.&quot; After first refusing to sing, Cædmon subsequently produced a short eulogistic poem praising God, the Creator of heaven and earth.

Upon awakening the next morning, Caedmon remembered everything he had sung and added additional lines to his poem. He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the abbess, believed to be St Hilda of Whitby. The abbess and her counsellors asked Cædmon about his vision and, satisfied that it was a gift from God, gave him a new commission, this time for a poem based on &quot;a passage of sacred history or doctrine&quot;, by way of a test. 

When Cædmon returned the next morning with the requested poem, he was invited to take monastic vows. The abbess ordered her scholars to teach Cædmon sacred history and doctrine, which after a night of thought, Bede records, Cædmon would turn into the most beautiful verse. According to Bede, Cædmon was responsible for a large number of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics.

After a long and zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: receiving a of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey&#x27;s hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has been argued that such assertions are incorrect.

The details of Bede&#x27;s story, and in particular of the miraculous nature of Cædmon&#x27;s poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt the existence of a poet named Cædmon. Bede&#x27;s narrative has to be read in the context of the Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.

===Dates===
Bede gives no specific dates in his story. Cædmon is said to have taken holy orders at an advanced age and it is implied that he lived at Streonæshalch at least in part during Hilda&#x27;s abbacy (657–680). Book IV Chapter 25 of the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; appears to suggest that Cædmon&#x27;s death occurred at about the same time as the fire at Coldingham Abbey, an event dated in the E text of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; to 679, but after 681 by Bede. 

The reference to &quot;his temporibus&quot; &quot;at this time&quot; in the opening lines of Chapter 25 may refer more generally to Cædmon&#x27;s career as a poet. However, the next datable event in the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; is King Ecgfrith&#x27;s raid on Ireland in 684 (Book IV, Chapter 26). Taken together, this evidence suggests an active period beginning between 657 and 680 and ending between 679 and 684.

===Modern discoveries===
The only biographical or historical information that modern scholarship has been able to add to Bede&#x27;s account concerns the Brittonic origins of the poet&#x27;s name. Although Bede specifically notes that English was Cædmon&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; language, the poet&#x27;s name is of Celtic origin: from Proto-Welsh &quot;Cadṽan&quot; (from Brythonic &quot;Catumandos&quot;). Several scholars have suggested that Cædmon himself may have been bilingual on the basis of this etymology, Hilda&#x27;s close contact with Celtic political and religious hierarchies, and some (not very close) analogues to the &quot;Hymn&quot; in Old Irish poetry. Other scholars have noticed a possible onomastic allusion to &#x27;Adam Kadmon&#x27; in the poet&#x27;s name, perhaps suggesting that the entire story is allegorical.

===Other medieval sources===
No other independent accounts of Cædmon&#x27;s life and work are known to exist. The only other reference to Cædmon in English sources before the 12th century is found in the 10th-century Old English translation of Bede&#x27;s Latin &quot;Historia&quot;. Otherwise, no mention of Cædmon is found in the corpus of surviving Old English. The Old English translation of the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; does contain several minor details not found in Bede&#x27;s Latin original account.

Of these, the most significant is that Cædmon felt &quot;shame&quot; for his inability to sing vernacular songs before his vision, and the suggestion that Hilda&#x27;s scribes copied down his verse &quot;&quot; &quot;from his mouth&quot;. These differences are in keeping with the Old English translator&#x27;s practice in reworking Bede&#x27;s Latin original, however, and need not, as Wrenn argues, suggest the existence of an independent English tradition of the Cædmon story.

====&quot;Heliand&quot;====
A second, possibly pre-12th-century allusion to the Cædmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the Old Saxon &quot;Heliand&quot; poem. These texts, the &quot;Praefatio&quot; (Preface) and &quot;Versus de Poeta&quot; (Lines about the poet), explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation (for which the &quot;Heliand&quot; is the only known candidate) in language strongly reminiscent of, and indeed at times identical to, Bede&#x27;s account of Cædmon&#x27;s career. According to the prose &quot;Praefatio&quot;, the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor Louis the Pious. The text then adds that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until he was ordered to translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream.

The &quot;Versus de Poeta&quot; contain an expanded account of the dream itself, adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself had come through the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle. While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th-century edition by Flacius Illyricus, both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition. This apparent debt to the Cædmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Old English biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures.

===Sources and analogues===
In contrast to his usual practice elsewhere in the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon&#x27;s life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.

Perhaps as a result of this lack of documentation, scholars have devoted considerable attention since the 1830s to tracking down possible sources or analogues to Bede&#x27;s account. These parallels have been drawn from all around the world, including biblical and classical literature, stories told by the aboriginal peoples of Australia, North America and the Fiji Islands, mission-age accounts of the conversion of the Xhosa in Southern Africa, the lives of English romantic poets, and various elements of Hindu and Muslim scripture and tradition. 

Although the search was begun by scholars such as Sir Francis Palgrave, who hoped either to find Bede&#x27;s source for the Cædmon story or to demonstrate that its details were so commonplace as to hardly merit consideration as legitimate historiography, subsequent research has instead ended up demonstrating the uniqueness of Bede&#x27;s version: as Lester shows, no &quot;analogue&quot; to the Cædmon story found before 1974 mirrors Bede&#x27;s chapter in more than about half its main properties; the same observation can be extended to cover all analogues since identified.

==Work==

===General corpus===
Bede&#x27;s account indicates that Cædmon was responsible for the composition of a large oeuvre of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan, Cædmon&#x27;s poetry is said to have been exclusively religious. Bede reports that Cædmon &quot;could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion&quot;, and his list of Cædmon&#x27;s output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the Old and New Testaments, and songs about the &quot;terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, ... joys of the heavenly kingdom, ... and divine mercies and judgments.&quot; 

Of this corpus, only his first poem survives. While vernacular poems matching Bede&#x27;s description of several of Cædmon&#x27;s later works are found in London, British Library, Junius 11, traditionally referred to as the &quot;Junius&quot; or &quot;Cædmon&quot; manuscript, the older traditional attribution of these texts to Cædmon or Cædmon&#x27;s influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with Cædmon&#x27;s original &quot;Hymn&quot;, and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede&#x27;s discussion of Cædmon&#x27;s oeuvre. 

The first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while &quot;Christ and Satan&quot; could be understood as partially fitting Bede&#x27;s description of Cædmon&#x27;s work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, Bede&#x27;s list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of Cædmon&#x27;s actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the catechism. Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.

===&quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot;===
The only known survivor from Cædmon&#x27;s oeuvre is his &quot;Hymn&quot; (audio version). The poem is known from 21 manuscript copies, making it the best-attested Old English poem after Bede&#x27;s &quot;Death Song&quot; (with 35 witnesses) and the best attested in the poetic corpus in manuscripts copied or owned in the British Isles during the Anglo-Saxon period. The &quot;Hymn&quot; also has by far the most complicated known textual history of any surviving Old English poem.

It is found in two dialects and five distinct recensions (Northumbrian &#x27;, Northumbrian &#x27;, West-Saxon &#x27;, West-Saxon &#x27;, and West-Saxon &quot;&quot;), all but one of which are known from three or more witnesses. It is one of the early attested examples of written Old English and one of the early recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language. Together with the runic Ruthwell Cross and Franks Casket inscriptions, &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot; is one of three candidates for the early attested example of Old English poetry.

There is continuing critical debate about the status of the poem as it is now available to us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon&#x27;s original, others argue that they originated as a back-translation from Bede&#x27;s Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.

====Manuscript evidence====
All copies of &quot;Hymn&quot; are found in manuscripts of the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; or its translation, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede&#x27;s Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, in the case of the Old English version, a replacement for Bede&#x27;s translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede&#x27;s work, the &quot;Hymn&quot; does not appear to have been transmitted with the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the &quot;Hymn&quot; in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, &quot;Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243&quot;, &quot;Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43&quot;, and &quot;Winchester, Cathedral I&quot;, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. 

Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript&#x27;s main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin &quot;Historia&quot;: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin &quot;Historia&quot; sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.

====Earliest text====
The oldest known version of the poem is the Northumbrian recension. The surviving witnesses to this text, Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date to at least the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede&#x27;s own monastery and lifetime, though there is little evidence to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.

The following text, first column on the left below, has been transcribed from M (mid-8th century; Northumbria). The text has been normalised to show a line-break between each line and modern word-division. A transcription of the likely pronunciation of the text in the early 8th-century Northumbrian dialect in which the text is written is included, along with a modern English translation.

Bede&#x27;s Latin version runs as follows:
:&quot;Now we must praise the author of the heavenly realm, the might of the creator, and his purpose, the work of the father of glory: as he, who, the almighty guardian of the human race, is the eternal God, is the author of all miracles; who first created the heavens as highest roof for the children men, then the earth.&quot;

<text>Geothermal energy is thermal energy extracted from the Earth&#x27;s crust. It combines energy from the formation of the planet and from radioactive decay. Geothermal energy has been exploited as a source of heat and/or electric power for millennia.

Geothermal heating, using water from hot springs, for example, has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since Roman times. Geothermal power (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century. Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity&#x27;s energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries.

The cost of generating geothermal power decreased by 25% during the 1980s and 1990s. Technological advances continued to reduce costs and thereby expand the amount of viable resources. In 2021, the US Department of Energy estimated that power from a plant &quot;built today&quot; costs about $0.05/kWh.

In 2019, 13,900 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power was available worldwide. An additional 28 gigawatts provided heat for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination, and agricultural applications as of 2010. As of 2019 the industry employed about one hundred thousand people.

The adjective &quot;geothermal&quot; originates from the Greek roots (), meaning Earth, and (), meaning hot.

== History ==

Hot springs have been used for bathing since at least Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is at the site of the Huaqing Chi palace. In the first century CE, Romans conquered &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot;, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to supply public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal energy. The world&#x27;s oldest geothermal district heating system, in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 15th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.

In 1892, the US&#x27;s first district heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered by geothermal energy. It was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in 1900. The world&#x27;s first known building to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, beginning in 1907. A geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charles Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Geyser steam and water began heating homes in Iceland in 1943.

In the 20th century, geothermal energy came into use as a generating source. Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904, at the Larderello steam field. It successfully lit four light bulbs. In 1911, the world&#x27;s first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. It was the only industrial producer of geothermal power until New Zealand built a plant in 1958. In 2012, it produced some 594 megawatts.

In 1960, Pacific Gas and Electric began operation of the first US geothermal power plant at The Geysers in California. The original turbine lasted for more than 30 years and produced 11 MW net power.

An organic fluid based binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in 1967 in the USSR and later introduced to the US in 1981. This technology allows the use of temperature resources as low as 81 °C. In 2006, a binary cycle plant in Chena Hot Springs, Alaska, came on-line, producing electricity from a record low temperature of .

==Resources==
The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031 joules (3·1015 TWh), About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion; the remainder is attributed to past and current radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes. For example, a 5275 m deep borehole in United Downs Deep Geothermal Power Project in Cornwall, England, found granite with very high thorium content, whose radioactive decay is believed to power the high temperature of the rock.

Earth&#x27;s interior temperature and pressure are high enough to cause some rock to melt and the solid mantle to behave plastically. Parts of the mantle convect upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary can reach over .

The Earth&#x27;s internal thermal energy flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of 44.2 terawatts (TW), and is replenished by radioactive decay of minerals at a rate of 30 TW. These power rates are more than double humanity&#x27;s current energy consumption from all primary sources, but most of this energy flux is not recoverable. In addition to the internal heat flows, the top layer of the surface to a depth of is heated by solar energy during the summer, and cools during the winter.

Outside of the seasonal variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is per km of depth in most of the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1 MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by combinations of fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal circulation.

The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. Applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux most easily from a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. An artificial hot water reservoir may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture bedrock. The systems in this last approach are called enhanced geothermal systems.

2010 estimates of the potential for electricity generation from geothermal energy vary sixfold, from depending on the scale of investments. Upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as , although 20th century wells rarely reached more than deep. Wells of this depth are common in the petroleum industry. 
==Geothermal power==
Geothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy. Dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle power stations have been used for this purpose. As of 2010 geothermal electricity was generated in 26 countries.

As of 2019, worldwide geothermal power capacity amounted to 15.4 gigawatts (GW), of which 23.86 percent or 3.68 GW were in the United States.

Geothermal energy supplies a significant share of the electrical power in Iceland, El Salvador, Kenya, the Philippines and New Zealand.

Geothermal power is considered to be a renewable energy because heat extraction rates are insignificant compared to the Earth&#x27;s heat content. The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5 percent of that of coal-fired plants.

Geothermal electric plants were traditionally built on the edges of tectonic plates where high-temperature geothermal resources approach the surface. The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland, was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the US. In Myanmar over 39 locations are capable of geothermal power production, some of which are near Yangon.

==Geothermal heating==

Geothermal heating is the use of geothermal energy to heat buildings and water for human use. Humans have done this since the Paleolithic era. Approximately seventy countries made direct use of a total of 270 PJ of geothermal heating in 2004. As of 2007, 28 GW of geothermal heating satisfied 0.07% of global primary energy consumption. Thermal efficiency is high since no energy conversion is needed, but capacity factors tend to be low (around 20%) since the heat is mostly needed in the winter.

Even cold ground contains heat: below the undisturbed ground temperature is consistently at the Mean Annual Air Temperature that may be extracted with a ground source heat pump.

==Types==

=== Hydrothermal systems ===
Hydrothermal systems produce geothermal energy by accessing naturally-occurring hydrothermal reservoirs. Hydrothermal systems come in either &quot;vapor-dominated&quot; or &quot;liquid-dominated&quot; forms.

==== Vapor-dominated plants ====
Larderello and The Geysers are vapor-dominated. Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300 °C that produce superheated steam.

==== Liquid-dominated plants ====
Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) are more common with temperatures greater than and are found near volcanoes in/around the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. Flash plants are the common way to generate electricity from these sources. Steam from the well is sufficient to power the plant. Most wells generate 2–10 MW of electricity. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators and drives electric generators. Condensed liquid returns down the well for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system was Cerro Prieto in Mexico, which generates 750 MW of electricity from temperatures reaching .

Lower-temperature LDRs (120–200 °C) require pumping. They are common in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, such as in the Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a heat exchanger in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new plants. Binary plants have no emissions.

=== Engineered geothermal systems ===
An engineered geothermal system is a geothermal system that engineers have artificially created or improved. Engineered geothermal systems are used in a variety of geothermal reservoirs that have hot rocks but insufficient natural reservoir quality, for example, insufficient geofluid quantity or insufficient rock permeability or porosity, to operate as natural hydrothermal systems. Types of engineered geothermal systems include &quot;enhanced geothermal systems&quot;, &quot;closed-loop or advanced geothermal systems&quot;, and some &quot;superhot rock geothermal systems&quot;.

==== Enhanced geothermal systems ====

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to flow freely. The technique was adapted from oil and gas fracking techniques. The geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Instead proppants such as sand or ceramic particles are used to keep the cracks open and producing optimal flow rates. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand the reservoir size.

Small-scale EGS have been installed in the Rhine Graben at Soultz-sous-Forêts in France and at Landau and Insheim in Germany.

==== Closed-loop geothermal systems ====
Closed-loop geothermal systems, sometimes colloquially referred to as Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS), are engineered geothermal systems containing subsurface working fluid that is heated in the hot rock reservoir without direct contact with rock pores and fractures. Instead, the subsurface working fluid stays inside a closed loop of deeply buried pipes that conduct Earth&#x27;s heat. The advantages of a deep, closed-loop geothermal circuit include: (1) no need for a geofluid, (2) no need for the hot rock to be permeable or porous, and (3) all the introduced working fluid can be recirculated with zero loss. Eavortm, a Canadian-based geothermal startup, piloted their closed-loop system in shallow soft rock formations in Alberta, Canada. Situated within a sedimentary basin, the geothermal gradient proved to be insufficient for electrical power generation. However, the system successfully produced approximately 11,000 MWh of thermal energy during its initial two years of operation.&quot;

==Economics==

As with wind and solar energy, geothermal power has minimal operating costs; capital costs dominate. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and not all wells produce exploitable resources. For example, a typical well pair (one for extraction and one for injection) in Nevada can produce 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10 million to drill, with a 20% failure rate, making the average cost of a successful well $50 million.

Drilling geothermal wells is more expensive than drilling oil and gas wells of comparable depth for several reasons: 
* Geothermal reservoirs are usually in igneous or metamorphic rock, which is harder to penetrate than the sedimentary rock of typical hydrocarbon reservoirs.
* The rock is often fractured, which causes vibrations that damage bits and other drilling tools.
* The rock is often abrasive, with high quartz content, and sometimes contains highly corrosive fluids.
* The rock is hot, which limits use of downhole electronics.
* Well casing must be cemented from top to bottom, to resist the casing&#x27;s tendency to expand and contract with temperature changes. Oil and gas wells are usually cemented only at the bottom.
* Well diameters are considerably larger than typical oil and gas wells.

As of 2007 plant construction and well drilling cost about €2–5 million per MW of electrical capacity, while the break-even price was 0.04–0.10 € per kW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4 million per MW and break-even above $0.054 per kW·h.

Between 2013 and 2020, private investments were the main source of funding for renewable energy, comprising approximately 75% of total financing. The mix between private and public funding varies among different renewable energy technologies, influenced by their market appeal and readiness. In 2020, geothermal energy received just 32% of its investment from private sources.

=== Socioeconomic benefits ===
In January 2024, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) report &quot;Socioeconomic Impacts of Geothermal Energy Development&quot; was published, highlighting the substantial socioeconomic benefits of geothermal energy development, which notably exceeds those of wind and solar by generating an estimated 34 jobs per megawatt across various sectors. The report details how geothermal projects contribute to skill development through practical on-the-job training and formal education, thereby strengthening the local workforce and expanding employment opportunities. It also underscores the collaborative nature of geothermal development with local communities, which leads to improved infrastructure, skill-building programs, and revenue-sharing models, thereby enhancing access to reliable electricity and heat. These improvements have the potential to boost agricultural productivity and food security. The report further addresses the commitment to advancing gender equality and social inclusion by offering job opportunities, education, and training to underrepresented groups, ensuring fair access to the benefits of geothermal development. Collectively, these efforts are instrumental in driving domestic economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues, and contributing to more stable and diverse national economies, while also offering significant social benefits such as better health, education, and community cohesion.

== Development ==
Geothermal projects have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. Many projects are canceled during the stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, which are unsuitable for traditional lending. At later stages can often be equity-financed.

=== Precipitate scaling ===

A common issue encountered in geothermal systems arises when the system is situated in carbonate-rich formations. In such cases, the fluids extracting heat from the subsurface often dissolve fragments of the rock during their ascent towards the surface, where they subsequently cool. As the fluids cool, dissolved cations precipitate out of solution, leading to the formation of calcium scale, a phenomenon known as calcite scaling. This calcite scaling has the potential to decrease flow rates and necessitate system downtime for maintenance purposes.

==Sustainability==
Geothermal energy is considered to be sustainable because the heat extracted is so small compared to the Earth&#x27;s heat content, which is approximately 100 billion times 2010 worldwide annual energy consumption. Earth&#x27;s heat flows are not in equilibrium; the planet is cooling on geologic timescales. Anthropic heat extraction typically does not accelerate the cooling process.

Wells can further be considered renewable because they return the extracted water to the borehole for reheating and re-extraction, albeit at a lower temperature.

Replacing material use with energy has reduced the human environmental footprint in many applications. Geothermal has the potential to allow further reductions. For example, Iceland has sufficient geothermal energy to eliminate fossil fuels for electricity production and to heat Reykjavik sidewalks and eliminate the need for gritting.

However, local effects of heat extraction must be considered. Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers experienced reduced output because of local depletion. Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. Reducing production and injecting additional water could allow these wells to recover their original capacity. Such strategies have been implemented at some sites. These sites continue to provide significant energy.

The Wairakei power station was commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173 MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering. In 1982 it was down-rated to intermediate pressure and the output to 157 MW. In 2005 two 8 MW isopentane systems were added, boosting output by about 14 MW. Detailed data were lost due to re-organisations.

==Environmental effects==

Fluids drawn from underground carry a mixture of gasses, notably carbon dioxide (), hydrogen sulfide (), methane () and ammonia (). These pollutants contribute to global warming, acid rain and noxious smells if released. Existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of of per megawatt-hour (MW·h) of electricity, a small fraction of the emission intensity of fossil fuel plants. A few plants emit more pollutants than gas-fired power, at least in the first few years, such as some geothermal power in Turkey. Plants that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are typically equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust. New emerging closed looped technologies developed by Eavor have the potential to reduce these emissions to zero.

Water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic elements such as mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can damage surroundings if released. The modern practice of returning geothermal fluids into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental impact.

Construction can adversely affect land stability. Subsidence occurred in the Wairakei field. In Staufen im Breisgau, Germany, tectonic uplift occurred instead. A previously isolated anhydrite layer came in contact with water and turned it into gypsum, doubling its volume. Enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes as part of hydraulic fracturing. A project in Basel, Switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the Richter Scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection.

Geothermal power production has minimal land and freshwater requirements. Geothermal plants use per gigawatt of electrical production (not capacity) versus and for coal facilities and wind farms respectively. They use of freshwater per MW·h versus over per MW·h for nuclear, coal, or oil.

==Production==
===Philippines===

The Philippines began geothermal research in 1962 when the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology inspected the geothermal region in Tiwi, Albay. The first geothermal power plant in the Philippines was built in 1977, located in Tongonan, Leyte. The New Zealand government contracted with the Philippines to build the plant in 1972. The Tongonan Geothermal Field (TGF) added the Upper Mahiao, Matlibog, and South Sambaloran plants, which resulted in a 508 MV capacity.

The first geothermal power plant in the Tiwi region opened in 1979, while two other plants followed in 1980 and 1982. The Tiwi geothermal field is located about 450 km from Manila. The three geothermal power plants in the Tiwi region produce 330 MWe, putting the Philippines behind the United States and Mexico in geothermal growth. The Philippines has 7 geothermal fields and continues to exploit geothermal energy by creating the Philippine Energy Plan 2012–2030 that aims to produce 70% of the country&#x27;s energy by 2030.

===United States===

According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) installed geothermal capacity in the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, in 2013. This increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012. GEA revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 MW, bringing installed US geothermal capacity to 3,386 MW.

===Hungary===

The municipal government of Szeged is trying to cut down its gas consumption by 50 percent by utilizing geothermal energy for its district heating system. The Szeged geothermal power station has 27 wells, 16 heating plants, and 250 kilometres of distribution pipes.

<doc id="113735" wikidata="Q1130354" url="?curid=113735" title="Huastec people">
<text>The Huastec or Téenek (contraction of &quot;Te&#x27; Inik&quot;, &quot;people from here&quot;; also known as Huaxtec, Wastek or Huastecos) are an indigenous people of Mexico, living in the La Huasteca region including the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas concentrated along the route of the Pánuco River and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.

There are approximately 66,000 Huastec speakers today, of which two-thirds are in San Luis Potosí and one-third in Veracruz, although their population was probably much higher, as much as half a million, when the Spanish arrived in 1529.

The ancient Huastec civilization is one of the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures. Judging from archaeological remains, they are thought to date back to approximately the 10th century BCE, although their most productive period of civilization is usually considered to be the Postclassic era between the fall of Teotihuacan and the rise of the Aztec Empire. The Pre-Columbian Huastecs constructed temples on step-pyramids, carved independently standing sculptures, and produced elaborately painted pottery. They were admired for their abilities as musicians by other Mesoamerican peoples.

About 1450, the Huastecs were defeated by Aztec armies under the leadership of Moctezuma I; the Huastecs henceforth paid tribute to the Aztec Empire but retained a large degree of local self-government.

The Huastecs were conquered by the Spanish between 1519 and the 1530s. After the Spanish Conquest, many Huastecs were sold as slaves in the Caribbean by the Spanish.

The first grammatical and lexical description of the Huastec language accessible to Europeans was by Fray Andrés de Olmos, who also wrote the first such grammars of Nahuatl and Totonac.

==Migration history==

===Splitting from the rest of the Maya===
Studies of language change, especially glottochronology (that is, words changing in form or being replaced by borrowed synonyms), have given linguists the tools to estimate the point in time when many pairs of languages diverged from their common ancestral tongue. The procedure depends on the assumption that languages change, in the absence of widespread literacy, at a constant rate.

Of all the languages descended from Proto-Mayan, the proto-Huastecan language was the first to split from Mayan proper. The second split, in the non-Huastecan main branch, was between proto-Yucatecan, now spoken across the Yucatán Peninsula, and the ancestors of all other Maya languages. The only other language, besides Huastec, which arose from proto-Huastecan was Chicomuceltec (also called Cotoque), a language once spoken in Chiapas near Comitán, but now extinct.

Linguists have approximated that the precursor to the language of the Huastecs diverged from the Proto-Mayan language between 2200 and 1200 BCE. Linguist Morris Swadesh posited the later date as the latest possible time for this split to have occurred, and gave the Huastec/Chicomuceltec &quot;inik&quot; (&quot;man&quot;) versus other-Maya &quot;winik&quot; as a typical contrast. McQuown suggests 1500 BCE, Manrique Castaneda 1800 BCE, and Dahlin 2100 BCE as the most likely dates for the split. Kaufman&#x27;s proposed date of about 2200 BCE would require two regular phonological (sound) changes that are attested in all Maya languages, &quot;r&quot; changing to &quot;y&quot; and &quot;q&quot; to &quot;k&quot;, to have happened independently after the split, in both the Huastec/Chicomuceltec branch and in the branch of all other Mayan languages.

Robertson&#x27;s work on verb affixes in the Mayan languages implies that the Huastecs were in contact with the proto-Tzeltal branch of Mayan. In Proto-Mayan, absolutives could be marked either by a prefix or a suffix, depending on the presence of a tense/aspect marker. This feature was retained in Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al (a Maya language, spoken in the Cuchumatanes mountains of Guatemala), but lost in other branches. (Yucatecan always uses a suffix for absolutives, while Kʼicheʼ always uses a prefix.) Huastec appears to have been influenced by proto-Tzeltal, resulting in such innovations as the preposition &quot;ta&quot;, used with the object of a verb in the third person. If, as seems likely, the Huastec-Maya split occurred around 2000 BCE, the Huastecs probably did not travel far from the Guatemala-Chiapas borderlands until after 1100 BCE, more or less, by which time the proto-Tzeltalans had been established as a separate branch.

===Art===
The Huastec people historically lived north of the Totonacs in the northeastern corner of Mesoamerica, which helped their influence with distinct style of art. Their art was influenced by the coastal area resulting in shell artifacts.

Amongst their art they also made pots, gaming stones, platform pipes, and sculptures. These items were often made from shells and made into shape of human heads, engraved shell gorgets, fan headdresses, and of hunchbacked humans. 

===Arrival in the Huasteca region===

The Huasteca region of Mexico extends from the easternmost limestone ranges of the Sierra Madre Oriental, across the coastal plain and the Otontepec hills to the Gulf of Mexico, in northern Veracruz state, eastern San Luis Potosí state, and (by some definitions) southern Tamaulipas. At least three indigenous languages are spoken in parts of the region today: Nahuatl (a Uto-Aztecan language), spoken especially in Veracruz, but also in San Luis Potosí; Pame (an Oto-Manguean language). spoken in the hilly borderlands of San Luis Potosí and Querétaro; and Huastec (Wastek) (a Maya language), spoken in San Luis Potosí and northernmost Veracruz, and formerly in Tamaulipas. Some would include the Totonac-speaking area, in north-central Veracruz, as part of the Huasteca. The Huastec region was known to the Aztecs (ancestors of today&#x27;s Nahuatl speakers, who arrived in the Huasteca around 1450) for its fertile abundance, and includes the northernmost patches of tropical moist forest and cloud forest in the Americas.

The Huastecs arrived in the Huasteca between 1500 BCE and 900 BCE. The linguistic evidence is corroborated by archaeological discoveries. In 1954, Richard Stockton MacNeish found ceramics and figurines in the Middle Formative period, called &quot;Pavon de Panuco&quot; in the Panuco River sites of the Huasteca, which resemble Preclassic objects from Uaxactun, a Petén-region Maya site. A date of no earlier than 1100 BCE for the Huastecs’ arrival at their present location seems most likely, since they probably had not arrived at the north-central Veracruz site of Santa Luisa until about 1200 BCE, the phase at the end of the Early Formative period known locally as the &quot;Ojite phase.&quot; Artifacts of the period include Panuco-like basalt &quot;manos&quot; and &quot;metates&quot;. (The Huastecs remained in Santa Luisa, located east of Papantla near the Gulf coast, until supplanted or absorbed by the Totonacs around AD 1000).

One nexus of carved iconographic traditions, the &quot;yoke-palm-axe&quot; complex, was found from Jaina Island in coastal Campeche to the Huasteca (and in between, in Aparicio, Veracruz), in association with the pelota ballgame, decapitation, and tooth mutilation; however, this may reflect coastal trade contacts after the Huastecs were established in the Huasteca.

===Huastec–Maya separation===
Proto-Maya, the common ancestor of all Maya languages, was probably spoken in west-central Guatemala, around the highland pine-oak forests of the Cuchumatanes mountain chain: north of the Motagua and Grijalva river valleys, through patches of cloud forest, and down to the edge of the tropical forest lowlands near the Ixcán and Chixoy (Negro) rivers, which flow into the Usumacinta River. Evidence that this region was the Maya &quot;heartland&quot; include its being located near the center of present-day language diversity of the Maya language family (and therefore requiring the minimum number of moves to place the languages in their current locations), the fact that proto-Maya included words for flora and fauna from both highland and lowland areas, and the debatable idea that it is easier for a group of people to spread from a highland region to a lowland one than vice versa. Not all archaeological evidence agrees with this conclusion: there are older, unbroken ceramic traditions from Loltun Cave in Yucatán, as well as Cuello in Belize, which suggest alternative Maya homelands.

Whether the proto-Huastecs split from the rest of the Maya in 2200 or in 1200 BCE, the separation occurred at least a millennium before the rise of classic Maya culture. It is no surprise, therefore, that the word &quot;to write&quot; is different in proto-Huastec &quot;(θuc-)&quot; and in the other Maya language branch &quot;(c’ib)&quot;.

2000 BCE is a reasonable date for the Huastec/Maya split, and the slopes of the Cuchumatanes range as a reasonable location for the speakers of proto-Maya, it seems likely that the split occurred after these proto-Maya speakers (or a portion of them) began to migrate north, probably along the Usumacinta River, and before the two groups resulting from the split began to move in opposite directions: the proto-Huastec speakers moving northwest (and, soon thereafter, the proto-Chicomuceltec west into the Chiapas highlands), and the proto-Yucatec/other Maya-speakers spreading northeast (one branch of which became Chontal, presumed by many from its widespread loan words and hieroglyphic evidence to be the dominant language of the classic Peten Maya heartland) (see Fig. 1). While we have no direct archaeological evidence to explain the split itself, we can assume by linguistic evidence that contact was soon cut off between the two groups, despite there being no geographical feature that would automatically isolate them from each other.

The intervening feature, then, was likely a powerful linguistic-cultural group. What group occupied the Usumacinta River-Gulf Coast lowlands (mainly in today&#x27;s Mexican state of Tabasco) between 2000 BCE (when the proto-Huastecs began their journey) and 1000 BCE (by which time the proto-Yucatecs had arrived in Yucatán, the Chicomuceltecs had been isolated from the Huastecs, and the Huastecs were arriving in central Veracruz)? Most scholars propose that this region was inhabited by speakers of the Mixe–Zoque family. While speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages are today confined to the mountains of northeast Oaxaca, along the backbone of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and into extreme western Chiapas, it is likely that they once occupied the entire Gulf Coast lowland from the isthmus to the Tuxtla mountains – in other words, the Olmec heartland, soon dominated by the presumably Mixe–Zoque-speaking Olmec civilization of about 1400 to 500 BCE. One line of evidence that the Olmecs spoke Mixe–Zoque are the words that the proto-Huastecs borrowed from proto-Mixe–Zoque as they passed through the southern Gulf lowlands; for example, &quot;ciw&quot;, meaning &quot;squash.&quot; 

Thus, there is some reason to ascribe the linguistic isolation of early Huastecs from other Maya speakers to proto-Olmecs speaking a Mixe–Zoque language, themselves recently arrived after migrating northward from the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast and across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. There is much stronger evidence that the push for the Huastecs’ further migration up the Gulf coast was caused by the active presence of the early Olmecs (c. 1400 to 1100 BCE) of San Lorenzo and associated sites. If this is true, most of the distance that the Huastecs migrated during their entire history, from Guatemala to the Huasteca, was traveled in only a century or two at most: the portion between the Olmec heartland around San Lorenzo, and the environs of San Luisa.

The Huastecs and the Yucatán Maya were reunited, in a way, during the late nineteenth century, when Huastec chicle-tappers and lumbermen were transported to the state of Campeche to work the similar forests there, mainly employed by U.S.-based companies. A cross-Gulf steamship trade developed at the same time, with products such as salt exported from Campeche to Tuxpan (a Huastec-region port), and items such as sugar from Tuxpan to Campeche.

<text>Quattro Pro is a spreadsheet program developed by Borland and now sold by Alludo, most often as part of Alludo&#x27;s WordPerfect Office suite.

== Characteristics ==
Historically, Quattro Pro used keyboard commands close to those of Lotus 1-2-3. While it is commonly said to have been the first program to use tabbed sheets, Boeing Calc actually utilized tabbed sheets earlier. It currently runs under the Windows operating system. For years Quattro Pro had a competitive advantage, in regard to maximum row and column limits (allowing a maximum worksheet size of one million rows by 18,276 columns). This avoided the 65,536 row by 256 column spreadsheet limitations inherent to Microsoft Excel (prior to Excel 2007). Even with the maximum row advantage, Quattro Pro has been a distant second to Excel, in terms of sales numbers, since approximately 1996 to the present.

When version 1.0 was in development, it was codenamed &quot;Buddha&quot; since it was meant to &quot;assume the Lotus position&quot;, #1 in the market. When the product was launched in 1988, its original name, suggested to Mr. Kahn by Senior VP, Spencer Leyton at a Vietnamese restaurant in Santa Cruz, was Quattro (the Italian word for &quot;four&quot;, a play on being one step ahead of &quot;1-2-3&quot;). Borland changed the name to Quattro Pro for its 1990 release.

The common file extension of Quattro Pro spreadsheet file is .qpw, which it has used since version 9. Quattro Pro versions 7 and 8 used .wb3, version 6 used .wb2, version 5 used .wb1, and DOS versions used .wq2 and .wq1.

==Origins==
The original Borland Quattro electronic spreadsheet was a DOS program, the initial development of which was done by three Eastern Europeans, one of whom, the Hungarian Lajos Frank, was later hired by Microsoft. An article appeared in &quot;PC Week&quot; in 1985, quoting a maker of spreadsheet templates saying that he was in close contact with Borland, and that Borland was developing a spreadsheet. At the time, there was absolutely no such development being undertaken by Borland. After they both read the article, Philippe Kahn and Spencer Leyton had a casual conversation where they joked, half seriously, about perhaps developing a spreadsheet to compete with Lotus Development&#x27;s 1-2-3. That led to Mr. Kahn setting an appointment with an agent for some Eastern European software developers, Robert Stein of Andromeda Software, which was also involved with the game &quot;Tetris&quot;. That led to an agreement negotiated by Mr. Leyton and Mr. Stein, providing for the development of the original Quattro.

Quattro was written in assembly language and Turbo C, principally by Adam Bosworth, Lajos Frank, and Chuck Batterman. It was praised mainly for superior graphics on DOS. Borland acquired a replacement product called &quot;Surpass&quot;, written in Modula-2. The main designers and programmers of Surpass were also hired by Borland to turn Surpass into Quattro Pro: Bob Warfield, Dave Anderson, Weikuo Liaw, Bob Richardson and Tod Landis. They joined other Borland programmers including Chuck Batterman, Lajos Frank, Tanj Bennett, Rich Reppert and Roger Schlafly. Bob Warfield later became Vice President of R&amp;D at Borland. All eventually left Borland.

Quattro Pro shipped in the final quarter of 1989. The Borland main office was near the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake and the building was severely damaged when large and heavy air conditioners on the roof of Borland&#x27;s main building were thrown upward by the quake, and came crashing down upon the glulam beams running across the top of the building. The beams were damaged to the point where they required injections of epoxy in order to make them sturdy enough to support the building again. In addition, the sprinkler system was triggered. The building was closed for months. All the computers were removed, placed on the tennis courts, washed down (acoustic ceilings rained gray mush onto everything when the sprinklers ran) and dried with hair dryers. Those that booted up were put to work. Quattro Pro finished final quality assurance testing and was sent to manufacturing from those computers running on the tennis courts in the (fortunately) sunny and dry autumn weather.

==Lawsuit==
Some have claimed that Quattro Pro was the first to use the tabbed notebook metaphor, but another spreadsheet, Boeing Calc, used tabs to multiple sheets, and allowed three-dimensional references before Quattro Pro was on the market. (Boeing Calc was so slow that its multiple sheet capabilities were barely usable.)

Quattro Pro was the subject of a major lawsuit by Lotus against Borland. Lotus argued that Quattro could not copy Lotus 1-2-3&#x27;s menus. Borland supplied the 1-2-3 menus as an alternative because keystroke compatibility was needed in order to run macros in 1-2-3 worksheets. Borland argued that most cars operate the same, but they are not necessarily made the same. So, Lotus could not rationally &quot;own&quot; the way its program behaved. The district court ruled in favor of Lotus, but the appellate court ruled that the 1-2-3 menus were functional and not copyrightable. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court which split 4 to 4 (Justice Stevens recused himself). This left the lower court ruling intact, which was a victory for Borland. However, the broader issue of whether a company can own and protect the way its program behaves remained unresolved.

By the time the case was resolved, Borland no longer owned Quattro Pro. Borland sold the spreadsheet to Novell six months before the final decision was handed down.

==Quattro Pro for Windows==

Quattro Pro began as a DOS program (like Lotus 1-2-3) but with the growing popularity of Windows from Microsoft, a Windows version of Quattro needed to be written. There was almost nothing from the DOS code that could be moved to the Windows project, so the Quattro Pro for Windows (QPW) was written from scratch.

Both the QPW and Paradox for Windows codebases (the latter being another Borland database application) were based on Borland&#x27;s internal pilot project with object oriented UI code for Windows. This project ran simultaneously with the Borland language group investigating the desirability of a C++ compiler, and the company decided to make a bet on C++. However, the C++ compiler was not ready at first, and OO code for both projects was started in C with OO emulation through macros. As the Borland Turbo C++ compiler became available internally the projects converted to using C++.

Charlie Anderson was put in charge of the project and he soon had Istvan Cseri, Weikuo Liaw, Murray Low, Steven Boye, Barry Spencer, Alan Bush, Dave Orton, Bernie Vachon, Anson Lee, Tod Landis, Gordon Ko and Chuck Batterman working on the project. Other engineers joined later. Eventually the team numbered nearly 20. The object model was inspired by the NeXT object model, modified by Mr. Cseri. Mr. Liaw and Mr. Spencer were in charge of the spreadsheet engine (written in assembly language) while Mr. Low wrote a large chunk of the UI.

The product was internally codenamed &quot;Thor&quot; for the Norse god of Thunder. QPW featured two major innovations. First, it was the first Windows spreadsheet with multiple pages with cells that could be linked together seamlessly, a feature from Quattro Pro which QPW extended. Second, it was the first released Windows program to have an attribute menu (or property pane) available by right-clicking on the object. Although this idea was first seen on the Xerox Alto, the idea had not been implemented on a major Windows program. Paradox for Windows shared this feature, and it was shown off by Phillipe Kahn at a Paradox user conference over a year before QPW was released. Both these ideas became widespread in the software industry.

QPW was one of the first big applications written in C++ on Windows, and it pushed the Borland C++ compiler to the limit. One reason why the Borland C++ Compiler was so good was that it had to compile and link the massive QPW code base successfully.

The technical risk of the QPW project was immense. The object model was untried and might not have worked for a spreadsheet. The user interface (UI) was new (for Windows programs at least). No one knew if the C++ compiler could generate fast enough code. As it turned out, the program worked. It was fast, it was close in feature set to Lotus 123 and Excel, and the &quot;right-click for properties&quot; user design was reasonably understandable.

At one point, it was hoped that QPW and Paradox for Windows would be able to share a common object model. That proved impossible despite serious thought and design efforts.

QPW was finally released in September 1992. The Quattro Pro marketing team had chosen to bundle both Quattro Pro for DOS and Quattro Pro for Windows in the same box labeled &quot;WIN-DOS&quot; at a price of $495. Customers and reviewers expecting a pure Windows application responded with confusion and outrage, believing the product was merely a DOS application with windowing capabilities. Shortly thereafter QPW was re-packaged by itself and priced $129, receiving accolades for Borland&#x27;s long-delayed pure Windows spreadsheet and its popular price.

Eventually it sold well (after the price was slashed to just $49 a copy). Work was started immediately on a new version with a brand new team of engineers led by Joe Ammirato; including Bret Gillis and Peter Weyzen. Borland purchased DataPivot from Brio Technology to add a new feature to the program. Colin Glassey came from Brio to help with the integration of that technology.

After a year and the merging of the old team and the new team, QPW 5 was released (the reason for the jump in version number had to do with keeping up with the DOS version as well as it looked good). QPW 5 sold well also, though the Microsoft Excel + Word combination was gaining steam.
Work then started on version 6 (now with Steven Boye as project lead). Midway through the development of version 6 a strategic decision to work closely with the WordPerfect word processor was made. It was a direct attempt to push back at the Microsoft Office one-two punch of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. The other big issue with Version 6 was the advent of Windows 95. This was a significant modification to the Windows operating system with a major change to user interface guidelines.

In an odd set of events, Novell purchased both WordPerfect Corporation and the Quattro Pro code base and team of engineers from Borland. Novell was going to try to be a real competitor to Microsoft. Although Version 6 was released and some effort was made to unify the user interface between WordPerfect and QPW, the effort was far from complete.

In another lawsuit, Novell claims that Microsoft had &quot;deliberately targeted and destroyed&quot; its WordPerfect and QuattroPro programs to protect its Windows operating system monopoly. The US Supreme Court refused to halt the antitrust lawsuit in March 2008.

==Novell&#x27;s exit==
The release of Windows 95 in August 1995 was the beginning of the end for Novell and its plans to compete with Microsoft. Not only did Microsoft release a new operating system, but Microsoft also released new versions of Word and Excel to accompany it. Sales of Novell PerfectOffice (and Lotus applications as well) sank to almost nothing while sales of the Microsoft products were huge. Within three months, Novell announced they were going to sell their applications to someone (eventually that proved to be Corel). By mid-1996, Microsoft had 95% of the market for business applications. , Microsoft still dominates the market for Windows business application software, although Quattro Pro and WordPerfect, which pre-dated the MS Office 4.2 suite, are still both updated and sold.

== File formats ==

Quattro Pro file formats use various filename extensions, including WB1, WB2, WB3, wq1 and wq2; some of these (WB2, wq1, and wq2) may open in the desktop applications of Collabora Online, LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice and then be saved into the OpenDocument format or other file formats, Microsoft dropped support for Quattro Pro file formats after Office 2007.

==Early life==
Penn was born in Santa Monica, California, to actor and director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan (&quot;née&quot; Annucci). His older brother is musician Michael Penn. His younger brother, actor Chris Penn, died in 2006. His father was a Jew whose parents were emigrants from Merkinė in Lithuania, and his mother was a Catholic of Irish and Italian descent.

Penn was raised in a secular home in Malibu, California, and attended Malibu Park Junior High School and Santa Monica High School. He began making short films with some of his childhood friends including actors Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen, who lived near his home.

==Career==
===1974–1989: Early work and breakthrough===

Penn appeared in a 1974 episode of the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; television series as an extra when his father, Leo, directed some of the episodes. Penn launched his film career with the action-drama &quot;Taps&quot; (1981), where he played a military high school cadet. That same year he made his Broadway debut in the Kevin Heelan play &quot;Heartland&quot; at the Century Theatre. A year later, he appeared in the hit comedy &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), in the role of surfer-stoner Jeff Spicoli; his character helped popularize the word &quot;dude&quot; in popular culture. Next, Penn appeared as Mick O&#x27;Brien, a troubled youth, in the drama &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1983). The role earned Penn favorable reviews and jump-started his career as a serious actor. He returned to Broadway that same year acting in the John Byrne play &quot;Slab Boys&quot; acting alongside Kevin Bacon, Val Kilmer, Jackie Earl Haley, and Madeleine Potter at the Playhouse Theatre.

Penn played Andrew Daulton Lee in the film &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; (1985), which closely followed an actual criminal case. Lee was a former drug dealer, convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and originally sentenced to life in prison, but was paroled in 1998. Penn later hired Lee as his personal assistant, partly because he wanted to reward Lee for allowing him to play Lee in the film; Penn was also a firm believer in rehabilitation and thought Lee should be successfully reintegrated into society, since he was a free man again. Penn starred in the drama &quot;At Close Range&quot; (1986) which received critical acclaim. He stopped acting for a few years in the early 1990s, having been dissatisfied with the industry, and focused on making his directing debut.

===1990–1999: Leading man roles and stardom===
In 1990, Penn portrayed Detective Terry Noonan in the neo-noir &quot;State of Grace&quot; opposite Ed Harris and Gary Oldman. The following year, Penn made his directorial debut with &quot;The Indian Runner&quot; (1991), a crime drama film based on Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;, from the 1982 album &quot;Nebraska&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Flirting constantly with the dangers of pure self-indulgence, Mr. Penn still manages to keep the improvisatory quality of this painful family drama from becoming overwhelming. For all its hazy excesses, the film seldom loses sight of its story&#x27;s raw essence.&quot; He also directed music videos, such as Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;Dance with the One That Brought You&quot; (1993), Lyle Lovett&#x27;s &quot;North Dakota&quot; (1993). After a brief hiatus from acting, he returned to star in the Brian De Palma crime drama &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993) acting opposite Al Pacino. Film critic Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Penn reminds viewers of what they’ve been missing in his performance as Carlito’s ambitious, amoral lawyer. Without stooping to caricature, he effortlessly captures what is most heinous in the profession.&quot; Penn was he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

He also directed the indie thriller &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; (1995) starring Jack Nicholson. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Penn is a slugger of a film maker, whether pummeling his audience with the obvious or hammering home the heartfelt and true. His second feature...has the same brute force that made his &quot;Indian Runner&quot; such a gripping oddity, bearing the distinctive stamp of Mr. Penn&#x27;s raw, searching style&quot;. That same year he acting alongside Susan Sarandon starring in the Tim Robbins directed crime drama playing a racist murderer on death row in &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995). Critic Roger Ebert wrote &quot;Penn proves again that he is the most powerful actor of his generation&quot;. For his performance he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he acted in Nick Cassavetes directed romantic drama &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot; (1997) opposite his then-wife Robin Wright Penn. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the film to the works of John Cassavetes and wrote that Penn&#x27;s performance &quot;is so full of heart and talent&quot;. Penn won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor. That same year he acted in the Oliver Stone directed neo-noir crime drama &quot;U Turn&quot;, and David Fincher&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;The Game&quot;.

In 1997, he starred in the independent drama &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; based on the 1984 play of the same name by David Rabe. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Sean Penn ends up dominating the film, sweating anxiety and rage from every pore. His charisma and screen presence are undeniable&quot;. For his performance he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice International Film Festival. That same year he had a leading role in the Terrence Malick epic about the World War II battle for Guadalcanal in &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998) based on the 1962 novel of the same name by James Jones. The following year he portrayed an egotisitcal jazz guitarist in the Woody Allen film &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999). Roger Ebert described Penn&#x27;s performances as &quot;master classes in the art of character development&quot;. For his performance he was nominated for his second Academy Award for Best Actor.

===2000–2011: Established actor and acclaim===

In 2000, Penn acted in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s drama &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; opposite Javier Bardem and Kathryn Bigelow&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; with Elizabeth Hurley.
The following year he guest starred on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; portraying Eric, a man who was engaged to Phoebe Buffay&#x27;s sister Ursula, both of whom are played by Lisa Kudrow. He appeared in two episodes in the eighth season. That same year he portrayed a mentally handicapped father in the family drama &quot;I am Sam&quot; (2001). His performance led him to his third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

In 2003, he starred in the Clint Eastwood directed Boston crime drama &quot;Mystic River&quot; portraying a grieving father looking for his daughter. Penn acted alongside Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kevin Bacon. Film critic Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;[The] Casting is immaculate. Penn is in top form as the reformed hood whose basic instincts overtake him.&quot; Penn received widespread acclaim for his performance earning numerous accolades including the Academy Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor as well as nominations for the BAFTA Award and Screen Actors Guild Award. That same year he acted in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;21 Grams&quot; opposite Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro. For his performance he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor at the 57th British Academy Film Awards.

In 2004, Penn played Samuel Bicke, a character based on Samuel Byck, who in 1974 attempted and failed to assassinate President Richard Nixon, in &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot; (2004). The same year, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Next, Penn portrayed governor Willie Stark (based on Huey Long) in an adaptation of Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s classic 1946 American novel &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (2006). The film was a critical and commercial failure, named by a 2010 &quot;Forbes&quot; article as the biggest flop in the last five years. During this time he directed the mystery film &quot;The Pledge&quot; (2001) and Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot; (2002). Penn gained acclaim for directing the biographical drama survival film &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007).

Kirk Honeycutt for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;Penn is one of those actors in complete control of his entire instrument. He uses voice, body movements, line readings and something indefinable within his own psyche to transmigrate into another person’s body and mind&quot;. For his performance he was nominated for Best Actor by the British Academy Film Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Independent Spirit Awards. Penn won his second Academy Award for Best Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.

In &quot;Fair Game&quot; (2010), Penn starred as Joseph C. Wilson, whose wife, Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts), was outed as a CIA agent by Bush advisor Scooter Libby in retaliation for an article Wilson wrote debunking Bush&#x27;s claim that Iraq was building a nuclear bomb as a rationale for invading the country. The film is based upon Plame&#x27;s 2007 memoir &quot;Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House&quot;. Penn reunited with Terrence Malick drama &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; (2011), which won the at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. That same year he starred in the Paolo Sorrentino directed comedy-drama &quot;This Must Be the Place&quot; (2011) opposite Frances McDormand. In the film Penn plays Cheyenne, a former rock star. The film received positive reviews with Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Penn dominates the film, of course, although it’s a performance that slithers between the genuine and the stunt-like&quot;.

===2012–present: Focus on directing and television roles===
In 2015, Penn starred in &quot;The Gunman&quot;, a French-American action thriller based on the novel &quot;The Prone Gunman&quot;, by Jean-Patrick Manchette. Jasmine Trinca, Idris Elba, Ray Winstone, Mark Rylance, and fellow Oscar-winner Javier Bardem appear in supporting roles. In &quot;The Gunman&quot;, Penn played Jim Terrier, a sniper on a mercenary assassination team who kills the minister of mines of the Congo. During this time Penn directed the drama film &quot;The Last Face&quot; (2016) starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem and the crime/drama film &quot;Flag Day&quot; (2021) with Dylan Penn and Josh Brolin. In March 2018, Atria Books published Penn&#x27;s novel &quot;Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff.&quot; After the book&#x27;s release, Penn went on a highly publicized press tour. He claimed that he no longer had &quot;a generic interest in making films&quot;, and being a writer will &quot;dominate my creative energies for the foreseeable future&quot;.

In 2018 Penn starred in his first leading role in a television series portraying Tom Hagerty, an astronaut chosen to be one of the first people to visit Mars in the Hulu science fiction drama series &quot;The First&quot; created by Beau Willimon. Daniel Fienberg of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;You can quickly see why Penn gravitated toward this as his series debut. His physical transformation and high-intensity confrontations...are showy, but the slowly unfolding role also lets him play quiet moments, and even light ones&quot; adding, &quot;It’s funny that I’m always surprised by how game Penn is to be a goofball. The guy who starred in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; is still in there somewhere.&quot; The series received positive reviews but on January 18, 2019, Hulu canceled the series after one season. In 2020 Penn played himself in a cameo role in the &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; season 10 episode &quot;The Spite Store&quot;.

In 2021, Penn portrayed Jack Holden, an actor based on William Holden, in the Paul Thomas Anderson directed coming of age comedy-drama &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;. Penn returned to television starring in the Starz political thriller limited series &quot;Gaslit&quot; (2022) portraying John N. Mitchell opposite Julia Roberts as Martha Mitchell. The role required transformational prosthetics. Ben Travers of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote of his performance, &quot;Penn manages to bring life to his makeup-constructed character&quot; adding &quot;Even his manner of speech, spitting curse words while clenching his wooden pipe, befits the boil of a man that John Mitchell becomes&quot;. For his performance he was nominated for the Hollywood Critics Association Award for Best Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series.

In 2023 Penn directed his first documentary film, &quot;Superpower&quot;, profiling the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival. The film follows Penn as he travels to Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy, the soldiers and observe firsthand how the Russo-Ukrainian War is being waged. Penn starred as a cab driver in Christy Hall&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Daddio&quot; (2023) acting opposite Dakota Johnson. Film critic Todd McCarthy of &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; wrote, &quot;Sean Penn is at his absolute best here in a tremendously engaging performance as a salty working-class guy with an endless supply of opinions and ways of drawing out his passengers&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===

Penn was engaged to actress Elizabeth McGovern, his co-star in &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; (1984). He also dated Demi Moore and Susan Sarandon.

Penn met singer-songwriter Madonna on set of her &quot;Material Girl&quot; music video in January 1985. On August 16, 1985, they married on Madonna&#x27;s 27th birthday; Penn turned 25 the next day. The two starred in the panned &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; (1986), directed by Jim Goddard, and Madonna dedicated her third studio album &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986) to Penn, referring to him in the liner notes as &quot;the coolest guy in the universe&quot;. Their marriage was marred by Penn&#x27;s violent outbursts against the press. Madonna filed for divorce in December 1987, but withdrew the papers two weeks later. In January 1989, Madonna filed for divorce again and reportedly withdrew an assault complaint against Penn following an incident at their Malibu, California, home during the New Year weekend. Penn was alleged to have struck Madonna on multiple occasions during their marriage in the book &quot;Madonna Unauthorized.&quot; Madonna denied the allegations stating they were &quot;completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false&quot; in 2015.

In 1989, Penn began dating actress Robin Wright, and their first child, a daughter named Dylan Frances, was born April 13, 1991. Their second child, son Hopper Jack, was born August 6, 1993. Penn and Wright separated in 1995, during which time he developed a relationship with Jewel, after he spotted her performing on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. He invited her to compose a song for his film &quot;The Crossing Guard&quot; (1995) and followed her on tour. Penn reconciled with Wright and they married on April 27, 1996. The couple filed for divorce in December 2007 but reconciled several months later, requesting a court dismissal of their divorce case. In April 2009, Penn filed for legal separation, only to withdraw the case once again when the couple reconciled in May. On August 12, 2009, Wright filed for divorce again. The couple&#x27;s divorce was finalized on July 22, 2010; the couple reached a private agreement on child and spousal support, division of assets, and custody of Hopper, who was almost 17 at the time.

In December 2013, Penn began dating South African actress Charlize Theron. Their relationship ended in June 2015. Despite reports that they were engaged, Theron stated that they were never engaged. Theron starred in Penn&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Face&quot; (2016), which they filmed while still a couple.

In 2016, Penn began a relationship with Australian actress Leila George, daughter of actors Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Greta Scacchi. They married on July 30, 2020. George filed for divorce on October 15, 2021. Their divorce was finalized on April 22, 2022. In June 2023, Penn began a relationship with Ukrainian Olga Korotyayeva.

===Legal issues===
In October 1985, Penn pled no contest to charges that he assaulted two journalists when they tried to photograph him and Madonna in Nashville in June 1985. He was fined $50 on each of two misdemeanor charges of assault and battery. In January 1986, Penn was charged for allegedly assaulting Leonel Borralho, Macau correspondent for the Hong Kong Standard newspaper, after he photographed Madonna and Penn as they arrived at their hotel room. In June 1986, Penn was charged with misdemeanor battery for assaulting songwriter David Wolinski at Helena&#x27;s nightclub in Los Angeles. Wolinski said Penn accused him of trying to kiss Madonna. Penn pled not guilty to the charge.

In April 1987, Penn violated probation and was arrested for punching a film extra, Jeffrey Klein, on set of the movie &quot;Colors&quot;. Penn was sentenced to 60 days in jail for this assault and reckless driving in June 1987, of which he served 33 days. According to Penn himself, he was incarcerated in the same jail holding Richard Ramirez, a serial killer awaiting trial. Ramirez wrote to Penn, to which Penn wrote back saying he had no kinship for his fellow inmate and hopes Ramirez receives capital punishment via the gas chamber. In May 2010, Penn pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge stemming from an altercation with photographer Frank Mateljan in October 2009. He was sentenced to perform 300 hours of community service and undergo 36 hours of anger management counseling.

In an interview published September 16, 2015, director and showrunner Lee Daniels responded to criticism about Terrence Howard&#x27;s continued career in light of his domestic violence issues by referencing Penn&#x27;s rumored history of domestic violence, saying: &quot;[Terrence] ain&#x27;t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he&#x27;s some f—in&#x27; demon.&quot; In response, Penn launched a $10 million defamation suit against Daniels, alleging that he had never been arrested for or charged with domestic violence. Penn dropped the lawsuit in May 2016 after Daniels retracted his statement and apologized.

==Political views and activism==
Penn has been outspoken in supporting numerous political and social causes. On December 13–16, 2002, he visited Iraq to protest against the Bush administration&#x27;s apparent plans for a military strike on Iraq. On June 10, 2005, Penn visited Iran, where, acting as a journalist on an assignment for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, he attended a Friday prayer at Tehran University.

On January 7, 2006, Penn was a special guest at the Progressive Democrats of America, where he was joined by author and media critic Norman Solomon and activist Cindy Sheehan at their &quot;Out of Iraq Forum&quot; in Sacramento, California, organized to support and promote the anti-Iraq War movement. On December 18, 2006, Penn received the Christopher Reeve First Amendment Award from the Creative Coalition for his commitment to free speech.

In August 2008, Penn attended one of Ralph Nader&#x27;s &quot;Open the Debates&quot; super rallies, protesting against Nader and other third-party candidates&#x27;s exclusion. In October 2008, Penn visited Cuba, where he met with and interviewed then Cuban president Raúl Castro.

In 2021, Penn denounced cancel culture, describing it as &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

===George W. Bush administration===

On October 18, 2002, Penn placed a $56,000 advertisement in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, publicly asking then President George W. Bush to end military hostilities in Iraq and elsewhere. The advertisement was written as an open letter and referred to the planned attack on Iraq and the War on terror.

In the letter, Penn also criticized the Bush administration for its &quot;deconstruction of civil liberties&quot; and its &quot;simplistic and inflammatory view of good and evil.&quot; Penn visited Iraq briefly in December 2002. The criticism drew praise from Penn&#x27;s ex-wife Madonna, who said, &quot;Sean is one of the few. Good for him. Most celebrities are keeping their heads down. Nobody wants to be unpopular. But then Americans, by and large, are pretty ignorant of what&#x27;s going on in the world.&quot;

The &quot;Post&quot; advertisement was cited as a primary reason for the development of his relationship with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. In one of his televised speeches, Chávez used and read aloud an open letter Penn wrote to Bush. The letter condemned the Iraq War, called for Bush to be impeached, and also called then U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice &quot;villainously and criminally obscene people.&quot;

On April 19, 2007, Penn appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and had a &quot;Meta-Free-Phor-All&quot; versus Stephen Colbert that was judged by Robert Pinsky following Penn&#x27;s criticisms of Bush. In the appearance, Penn said, &quot;We cower as you point your fingers telling us to support our troops. You and the smarmy pundits in your pocket– those who bathe in the moisture of your soiled and blood-soaked underwear–can take that noise and shove it.&quot; He won the contest with 10,000,000 points to Colbert&#x27;s 1.

On December 7, 2007, Penn said he supported Ohio Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, and again criticized Bush&#x27;s handling of the Iraq War. Penn questioned whether Bush&#x27;s daughters, Jenna and Barbara, supported the war in Iraq.

===Natural disasters===
In September 2005, Penn traveled to New Orleans, to aid Hurricane Katrina victims. He was physically involved in rescuing people, although there was criticism that his involvement was a PR stunt as he hired a photographer to come along with his entourage. Penn denied such accusations in an article he wrote for &quot;HuffPost&quot;. Director Spike Lee interviewed Penn for Lee&#x27;s documentary about Hurricane Katrina, &quot;When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts&quot; (2006).

After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Penn founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization, which operated a 55,000 person tent camp. Prior to founding the organization, Penn acknowledged he had never visited Haiti and did not speak French or Creole. When asked about critics who questioned his experience on Haiti, he said he hopes they &quot;die screaming of rectal cancer&quot;.

On January 31, 2012, due largely to his visibility as an on-the-ground advocate for rescue and aid efforts in the aftermath, Penn was designated by then Haitian president Michel Martelly as Ambassador-at-Large for Haiti, the first time a non-Haitian citizen has held the position in the country&#x27;s history. Also in 2012, at the 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, Penn was recognized with the Peace Summit Award.

===Gender and sexual orientation===
On February 22, 2009, Penn received the Academy Award for Best Actor for the film &quot;Milk&quot;. In his acceptance speech, he said: &quot;I think that it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame and the shame in their grandchildren&#x27;s eyes if they continue that way of support. We&#x27;ve got to have equal rights for everyone!&quot; In 2022, Penn expressed his position on masculinity, saying, &quot;I am in the club that believes that men in American culture have become wildly feminised...I don&#x27;t think that [in order] to be fair to women, we should become them.&quot; He later told &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;I think that men have, in my view, become quite feminised...There are a lot of, I think, cowardly genes that lead to people surrendering their jeans and putting on a skirt.&quot;

===International affairs===
Penn gained significant attention in Pakistan media when he visited Karachi and Badin in 2012. On March 23, 2012, accompanied by U.S. Consul General William J. Martin, Penn visited flood-stricken villages in Karim Bux Jamali, Dargah Shah Gurio, and Peero Lashari in the Badin District, where he distributed blankets, quilts, kitchen items, and other goods to flood survivors.

On March 24, 2012, during his visit to Pakistan, Penn visited Bilquis Edhi Female Child Home and met Pakistani humanitarian worker Abdul Sattar Edhi and his wife Bilquis Edhi and laid floral wreaths at the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi in honor of him.

Penn is also believed to have played a role in securing the release of American entrepreneur Jacob Ostreicher from a Bolivian prison in 2013, and was credited by Ostreicher for having personally nursed him back to health after his release.

Penn is the founder of the nonprofit organization Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE), which distributed aid in Haiti following the country&#x27;s 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew and administered free COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2021, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that Penn and CORE violated U.S. federal labor law, contending that Penn &quot;impliedly threatened&quot; his employees with reprisals after they complained about working conditions, which allegedly included 18-hour work days.

In February 2012, during the Syrian civil war, Penn stood beside Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez as Venezuela supported the government of Syria, led by Bashar al-Assad. In March 2010, Penn called for the imprisonment of journalists who referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez as a dictator. 
Penn&#x27;s was criticized by conservative and libertarian media sources, including &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;.

Penn and Chávez maintained a friendship; when Chávez died in 2013, Penn said: &quot;Venezuela and its revolution will endure under the proven leadership of Vice President Nicolás Maduro. Today the United States lost a friend it never knew it had. And poor people around the world lost a champion. I lost a friend I was blessed to have.&quot; Penn&#x27;s friendship with Chávez and his praise for Cuban dictator Raúl Castro have been criticized by human rights activist Thor Halvorssen and media, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, and &quot;The Advocate&quot;, each of which alleged that Castro and Chávez&#x27;s strong anti-LGBT stances clashed with Penn&#x27;s support for LGBT groups. 
Actress María Conchita Alonso, who co-starred with Penn in &quot;Colors&quot;, also issued an &quot;Open Letter to Sean Penn&quot;, attacking his views on Chávez. In December 2011, Alonso and Penn began verbally fighting at an airport, during which Penn called her &quot;a pig&quot; and Alonso called Penn a communist.

On January 9, 2016, a day after Mexican officials announced the capture of fugitive Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán in a militarized raid, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that Penn and actress Kate del Castillo had conducted a secret interview with El Chapo prior to his arrest. Del Castillo was contacted by Guzmán&#x27;s lawyer, who was then under CISEN surveillance, to discuss producing a biographical film about Guzmán, and communication between the two increased following Guzmán&#x27;s escape from a Mexican prison in July 2015. The deal for the interview was brokered by del Castillo.

According to text messages released between Penn and del Castillo, El Chapo did not know who Sean Penn was. CISEN released photographs of del Castillo at the meetings with Guzmán&#x27;s lawyers and of Penn and del Castillo arriving in Mexico. The interview was criticized by White House, which called it &quot;maddening&quot;. Mexican authorities said they sought to question Penn over the interview, which had not been approved by either the American or Mexican government. Penn and del Castillo&#x27;s meeting with Guzmán was investigated by the Attorney General of Mexico.

In October 2020, Penn tweeted support for Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. He also criticized Turkey&#x27;s involvement in the conflict and close Turkey–United States ties and simultaneously endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Penn said, &quot;Armenians are being slaughtered by Trump pal Erdogan with weapons WE provided. THIS is NOT America! Biden for America&#x27;s new birth!&quot;.

====Ukraine====
In 2022, Penn visited Ukraine to film a documentary about the Russian invasion of that country. Penn attended press briefings in Kyiv, met with officials and spoke to journalists and military personnel about the Russian invasion. On February 25, 2022, Penn said, &quot;If we allow it [Ukraine] to fight alone, our soul as America is lost.&quot;

Penn also praised the response from the Ukrainian government and its citizens. As Penn and his team prepared to leave Ukraine, they abandoned their car and walked with their luggage for miles to the Polish border. Russia is sanctioning Penn over his Ukraine support.

In Kyiv in November 2022, Penn lent an Oscar statuette to President Zelenskyy, saying, &quot;This is for you. It&#x27;s just a symbolic silly thing...When you win, bring it back to Malibu.&quot; Zelensky, in turn, awarded Penn the Ukrainian Order of Merit.

====Falkland Islands====

In February 2012, Penn met with the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, in Buenos Aires, where he commented on the long-running dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, saying: &quot;I know I came in a very sensitive moment in terms of diplomacy between Argentina and the UK over the Falkland Islands. And I hope that diplomats can establish true dialogue in order to solve the conflict as the world today cannot tolerate ridiculous demonstrations of colonialism. The way of dialogue is the only way to achieve a better solution for both nations.&quot;

The comments were taken as support of Argentina&#x27;s claim to the islands and evoked reactions in British media, including a satirical article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; requesting that Penn &quot;return his Malibu estate to the Mexicans&quot;.

In February 2012, Penn&#x27;s comments on the Falklands dispute were criticized by Falklands War veteran and political activist Simon Weston, who said, &quot;Sean Penn does not know what he is talking about and, frankly, he should shut up. His [Penn&#x27;s] views are irrelevant and it only serves to fuel the fire of the Argentinians and get them more pumped up.&quot; British Conservative MP Patrick Mercer called Penn&#x27;s statement on the Falklands &quot;moronic&quot;. Lauren Collins wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;As of today, Sean Penn is the new Karl Lagerfeld—the man upon whom, having disrespected something dear to the United Kingdom, the British papers most gleefully pile contempt&quot;.

Penn later claimed said his comments were misrepresented in British press and that his criticism of &quot;colonialism&quot; was a reference to the deployment of Prince William as an air-sea rescue pilot, describing it as a &quot;message of pre-emptive intimidation&quot;. He claimed that the Prince&#x27;s posting meant &quot;the automatic deployment of warships&quot;, and stated: &quot;My oh my, aren&#x27;t people sensitive to the word &#x27;colonialism&#x27;, particularly those who implement colonialism.&quot;

In an op-ed written in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Penn wrote that &quot;the legalisation of Argentinian immigration to the Malvinas/Falkland Islands is one that it seems might have been addressed, but for the speculative discovery of booming offshore oil in the surrounding seas this past year&quot; and that it was &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot; to suggest &quot;that I had taken a specific position against those currently residing in the Malvinas/Falkland Islands, that they should either be deported or absorbed into Argentine rule. I neither said, nor insinuated that&quot;.

==Acting credits and accolades==

Penn has appeared in over 50 films and won several awards during his career as an actor and director, including two Academy Awards for Best Actor for &quot;Mystic River&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Milk&quot; in 2008, and was nominated three more times in the same category for &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1995), &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; (1999), and &quot;I Am Sam&quot; (2001).

==Published works==
* &quot;Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff&quot; (Atria Books, 2018)
* &quot;Bob Honey Sings Jimmy Crack Corn&quot; (Rare Bird Books, 2019)

==In popular culture==
* The vocal progressive opinions and activism of Penn, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, and Tim Robbins are parodied in the 2004 film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;. In the film, a satirical puppet version of Penn makes outlandish claims about Baathist Iraq, claiming it was a utopia with &quot;rainbow skies&quot; and &quot;rivers made of chocolate&quot; before the U.S. military and the Coalition of the Willing invaded and removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. In response to the film, Penn sent an angry letter to its creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, inviting them to tour Iraq with him and ending with the statement, &quot;fuck you&quot;.

<text>The State Anthem of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic was the anthem of Estonia from 1945 to 1990 when it was a part of the Soviet Union.

==Background==
The anthem was presented to the central government of the USSR in May 1944, three months after the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR had issued a decree on 3 February 1944, &quot;On the State Anthems of the Soviet Republics.&quot;

The melody of the anthem was composed by Gustav Ernesaks, and the lyrics written by Johannes Semper. The anthems of the Estonian SSR, the Karelo-Finnish SSR, and the Georgian SSR were the only Soviet regional anthems not to mention the Russian people. After the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died in 1953, during the following period of de-Stalinization in the USSR, on 21 July 1956, the third stanza of the lyrics of the Estonian SSR anthem were changed to remove all mentions of Stalin.

During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, performing or reciting the melody or lyrics of &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; was forbidden by law, and considered a punishable criminal offence by the Soviet regime. While another song with Ernesaks&#x27; melody &quot;Mu isamaa on minu arm&quot;, served as means of expressing national feelings, and was widely regarded by Estonians as their &quot;unofficial anthem&quot;. On 8 May 1990, &quot;Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm&quot; was restored as the state anthem, together with the blue-black-white Estonian flag and state official name &quot;Republic of Estonia&quot;.

Originally the community was settled by Irish and German immigrants in the early 19th century. The settlement became known as Pin Oak in 1844, the name originating from the many pin oak trees native to the area and after the rural post office located near there.

On May 17, 2004 several buildings in town were either damaged or destroyed when major storms ripped through the area. One notable casualty was the Holy Cross Catholic Church. The church suffered serious damage when part of its roof was ripped off in the storm. The interior of the church suffered water damage from the rain. Following the storm, a new roof was placed on the church building, and the interior was also repaired.

<doc id="113759" wikidata="Q785057" url="?curid=113759" title="Peosta, Iowa">
<text>Peosta is a city in Dubuque County, Iowa, United States, and an exurb of the city of Dubuque. It is part of the Dubuque, Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,908 in the 2020 census, an increase of 193% from 651 in 2000. Peosta experienced a 70% increase in population (estimated) from 2000 to 2007, making it the state&#x27;s 10th fastest-growing city during that period. Peosta is currently the sixth-largest city in Dubuque County. The community is home to the 2015 ASA D Northern Nationals Men&#x27;s Slow Pitch Champions, Kass &amp; Company, a large industrial park, the largest campus of Northeast Iowa Community College, and a handful of new commercial businesses. However, the city is increasingly becoming a bedroom community, much like nearby Asbury, made up of suburban subdivisions.

==History==
Peosta is named after the leader of a local Native American people that once lived in Dubuque County. Chief Peosta, of the Meskwaki people, was a close friend of Julien Dubuque, one of the first European settlers in the area. Dubuque was also the founder of the City of Dubuque, Iowa, and was allegedly married to Chief Peosta&#x27;s daughter, who was reportedly named &quot;Potosa&quot;.

For most of its history, and even as recently as 1990, Peosta was a quiet rural town of approximately 100 people. A post office opened in Peosta in 1858. The groundwork for later growth was laid in the 1960s, when the new four-lane U.S. Route 20 opened along the city&#x27;s southern edge, providing quick access to Dubuque. The city was also aided by the opening of Northeast Iowa Technical Institute (later NICC) in 1979. However, it was only when the city&#x27;s industrial park began to flourish in the 1990s that the population began to soar. Peosta grew from 128 people in 1990 to over 1,300 today, and it continues to climb rapidly. This 1000% growth in 20 years has helped attract new businesses and services to Peosta as well. The city now boasts two elementary schools, its own community center, hotel, church, industrial park and expanding neighborhoods.

==Law and government==
Peosta has a mayor–council form of government, employing a full-time city clerk, and part-time city council (mayor and five at-large city council members). The city administrator is Annette Ernst, the city clerk is Marcie Winkelman, and the current mayor is Russell Pfab, and the council members are: Gerry Hess, John Kraft, Justin Lau, Alexis Lundgren and Brian Schatz. The city council meets at 6 P.M. on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month at the Peosta Community Centre.

Peosta has three city departments: Public Safety (police and fire), Public Works, and Parks &amp; Recreation. The Parks &amp; Recreation Dept. operates the Peosta Community Centre and Peosta&#x27;s city park.

In the Iowa General Assembly, Peosta is represented by Senator Carrie Koelker (R) in the Iowa Senate, and Representative Shannon Lundgren (R) in the Iowa House of Representatives. At the federal level, Peosta is located within Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Ashley Hinson (R) in the U.S. House of Representatives. Peosta, and all of Iowa, are represented by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R) and Joni Ernst (R).

==Geography==
Peosta&#x27;s longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal form are 42.449157, -90.846420.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Economy==
Peosta is home to a large and growing industrial park. The city&#x27;s manufacturing, warehousing, and shipping companies form the main part of the economy. Most of the companies in the city are relatively new, which has led to a significant number of commuters driving to Peosta&#x27;s employers from Dubuque, Asbury, or Dyersville. Some of the larger employers in the city include: Berry Plastics, First Gear, Mi-T-M, Bodine Electric, and Colony Brands. Also, Northeast Iowa Community College employs hundreds of people at its Peosta Campus.

<text>Sherrill is a city in Dubuque County, Iowa, United States. The population was 189 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 186 in 2000.

== History ==
Sherrill was named for two brothers, Adam and Isaac Sherrill, and was originally called Sherrill&#x27;s Mound or Mount, since the city is at the base of a prominent hill. In 1856, Peter Fries, an Austrian immigrant, built a large, stone inn at the main crossroads of the city. It was popular with newlyweds, and Jesse James and his gang were reported to have stayed there before their famous raid on Northfield, Minnesota. The structure has survived and been restored as the Black Horse Inn. Large numbers of German immigrants settled in Sherrill and the surrounding rural area in the 19th century. German Catholic (SS. Peter and Paul), German Lutheran (St. Matthew), German Methodist, and German Evangelical churches were founded and remain active. Sherrill was one of ten &quot;Beer Towns&quot; incorporated in Dubuque County in 1933 to ensure that the city&#x27;s taverns could serve beer, under a possibly mistaken interpretation of Iowa law that licenses to dispense beer could only be granted to premises inside incorporated places. Sherrill&#x27;s post office was established in 1858, with Peter Fries as postmaster. Its Zip Code is 52073.

<text>Worthington is a city in Dubuque County, Iowa, United States. The population was 382 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 381 in 2000. Iowa Highway 136 passes through Worthington, which is situated north of Cascade and south of Dyersville.

==History==

The land on which Worthington is currently located was originally purchased by David Lovelace from the United States Government. The Dubuque South-Western Railroad — the local branch of the Chicago-Milwaukee and St. Paul lines — was contracted to establish a line from Farley to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In 1858, an Englishman named Amos Worthington came to the area to establish a general store. By November of that year, the area became an unincorporated town known as the village of Worthington. By May of the following year regular rail service was established. A plat of Worthington was established with the Dubuque county recorder in 1858.

In 1861, Worthington sold his store to a William Moore and left for Cincinnati, Ohio. Eventually this store became known as the Heffner and Lattner Store. Settlers also began arriving in the area, with a number of people setting up businesses.

Soon a Baptist church was established in Worthington, with James Hill as Pastor. In 1868 Father Kortenkamp of St. Francis parish in Dyersville decided that Worthington was large enough to merit its own Catholic parish, and St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church was begun.

On October 1, 1892, a number of local citizens filed a petition in the District Court of Iowa in and for Dubuque County asking for Worthington to be formally incorporated as a town. On November 23, the court called for village inhabitants Peter Baum, W. Lattner, G.A. Dando, Louis Hoppleu, and Theodore Ament to act as commissioners. As commissioners they were to call for a special election of all qualified people in the proposed area to vote on the matter of being incorporated. This election was held on January 2, 1893. There were 42 votes cast — 32 were for the proposal and ten were against. On January 10, 1893, the Clerk of the District Court reported that the election was held.

The notice of the incorporation election was posted in the Dyersville Commercial for several weeks, with the last notice being published on February 17, 1893. Then on March 6, 1893, the results of the election were formally certified by the District Court Clerk — finalizing the incorporation of Worthington, Iowa. The formal date of incorporation of Worthington was set as January 10, 1893 when the special election had taken place.

Estherville was named after Esther A. Ridley, one of the first white female settlers in the area. Many of Estherville&#x27;s current residents are the descendants of the original Scandinavian, German and Irish immigrants that arrived in the community in the 1870s.

A large meteor impacted near Estherville on May 10, 1879. A report shared with the Royal Astronomical Society (UK) indicated that one fragment weighed about 500 lbs. A smaller fragment was found that weighed 170 lbs. The University of Minnesota acquired several pieces for examination.

==History==
The area had previously been the home of Sioux and Winnebago Indians. After the 1846 Winnebago Treaty, Indians were forcibly removed from the area by the US military and moved to Minnesota. In the summer of 1848, a flood of white settlers arrived. Matthew Conner built a log cabin and general store and the settlement was first called &quot;Shin Bone Valley.&quot; Surveyor K. M. Marcks renamed the town &quot;Elgin&quot; in 1851 in honor of his hometown, Elgin, Illinois. Benjamin Dimond became the postmaster at Elgin in 1852, the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railway came through in 1872, and the &quot;Elgin Times&quot; newspaper was established in 1875. The town subsequently became a major destination for Swiss immigrants.

<doc id="113776" wikidata="Q1903323" url="?curid=113776" title="Oelwein, Iowa">
<text>Oelwein is a city in Fayette County, Iowa, United States. The population was 5,920 at the time of the 2020 census, a decrease of 11.5% from the 2000 census. The largest community in Fayette County, it is located at the junction of State Highways 3 and 150.

== History ==
The town of Oelwein was laid out in a corn field purchased from pioneer settler Gustav Oelwein on the coming of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Minnesota Railroad (later called the Rock Island) in 1872. Some years later the two dividing streets of Oelwein were named after his sons, Frederick and Charles.

Oelwein&#x27;s present site was entered in 1852 by J. B. Burch. The hamlet of Oelwein was instituted in 1873, and was incorporated as a town in 1888, with Dr. Israel Pattison becoming its first mayor. The town suffered its chief setback in 1887, when nearly all of the old Main Street business district (now First Avenue SE) was destroyed by fire. In 1890 the census gave the population as 830.
By January 1892, Oelwein was chosen to become the center of the Chicago Great Western Railway; the CGW made the town the site of their locomotive and car repair shop, where four lines converge. Clearing the land for the shops began in June 1894. The shops were completed and put into operation in May 1899. Thus, Oelwein became known as the &quot;Shop City&quot; and later the &quot;Hub City&quot; because of the rail lines coming into town and the repair shops located here.

By 1895 the population had increased to 1,928, and in 1897 Oelwein was incorporated as a city. In 1900, Oelwein had 5,142 people within the city limits, of whom 789 were foreign-born. Oelwein was one of few Iowa towns to experience an influx of Italian immigrants who were employed in the railroad industry. In 1910, the population was 6,028, and in 1940, 7,801.

In 1968, the town suffered another setback when a large tornado swept through the main business district. 68 homes were destroyed, including some in F5 damage, 132 sustained major damage and 600 sustained less damage. Every business in the district suffered damage including 51 that were destroyed. Two churches, an elementary school, and the middle school were destroyed. Extensive damage was also done in nearby Maynard. Along the path, 5 people died (one in Oelwein), 156 were injured, and $21 million worth of ($18 million in Oelwein) damage was done, inflated to $130.4 million today.

Oelwein remained a &quot;railroad town&quot; until the early 1980s when most of the railroad tracks to the East, North and then West directions were abandoned. Transco Railway Products exists in Oelwein today. That business employs about 190 people repairing railroad cars. Transco employees donated their time to refurbish a Chicago Great Western EMD FP7 diesel locomotive that is displayed near the Hub City Heritage Museum, 26 2nd Avenue SW, the museum of railroad memorabilia.

===&quot;Methland&quot; controversy===
The 2009 book &quot;Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town&quot; by Nick Reding (Bloomsbury Press) documents the drug culture and how it ties into larger issues of rural flight and small town economic decline placed in the historic context of the drug trade. While Reding&#x27;s book received positive reviews from the &quot;New York Times&quot; Sunday Book Review and &quot;Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; Book World, it was severely criticised by Cedar Rapids columnist Laura Behrens, who wrote, &quot;it is so ridden with errors of basic reporting that the credibility of its larger premises is crippled&quot;, pointing out several factual errors.

<text>West Union is a city in Fayette County, Iowa, United States. The population was 2,490 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Fayette County.

==History==
Originally called Knob Prairie, the community was founded by William Wells, naming it for his hometown, also called West Union, in Ohio. The vacuum cleaner was invented here.

==Geography==
West Union is located at (42.962035, -91.810055).

West Union is the home of the North Fayette Valley Community School District, which comprises the communities of West Union; Clermont; Elgin; Wadena; Hawkeye; Fayette, the unincorporated town of Alpha and the surrounding rural areas.

North Fayette and Valley Community Schools combined services in 2013 with the high school in West Union and the middle school in Elgin. The new school&#x27;s mascot is called the Tigerhawks, due to the merging of the schools mascots, the Valley Tigers and the North Fayette Hawks. This agreement came about as a result of low enrollment and less state aid. The agreement was intended to last until the end of the 2015–2016 school year, when the school boards could decide to either: continue the whole-grade sharing agreement, end the agreement and go back to the North Fayette and Valley school districts, or officially consolidate the two districts. In July, 2018, after overwhelming majorities from both districts agreed to the merger, the district officially became North Fayette Valley.

<text>Charles City is a city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Iowa, United States. Charles City is a significant commercial and transportation center for the area. U.S. Routes 18 and 218, Iowa Highway 14, and the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railroads serve the city. The population was 7,396 at the time of the 2020 census, a decrease of 5.3%, from 7,812 in 2000.

== History ==
The Ho-Chunk people, also known as Winnebago, had long occupied this area and had a village along the Cedar River.

In 1851 Joseph Kelly, the first-known European-American settler in the area, came here after the Ho-Chunk had been pushed out. He believed that the site was ideal for a town, as it had water from the Cedar River and adjacent timberland to supply building needs. The settlement was first called &quot;Charlestown&quot; after his son. By 1852, twenty-five other settler families had joined Kelly. The town name was changed, first to &quot;St. Charles&quot; and then to &quot;Charles City,&quot; to avoid duplication of other Iowa town names.

Charles City became the county seat after Floyd County was established in 1851 and officially organized in 1854. Floyd County was named for Sergeant Charles Floyd, a member of the 1804 Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Charles City is known for the role it played in the history of the American tractor. A native son Charles Walter Hart, whose father owned three local farms, met Charles H. Parr in college. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Hart and Parr developed a two-cylinder gasoline engine. They set up their Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company in Charles City in 1897. In 1901 the two founders coined the word &quot;tractor&quot;, with Latin roots and a combination of the words &quot;traction&quot; and &quot;power&quot;. In 1903 the firm built fifteen &quot;tractors&quot;, the first successful production-model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000-pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States. It is displayed at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

In 1929, Hart-Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm-New Idea Equipment Co. At its peak in the mid-1970s, the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers. The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993. As of 2013, the vacant site stands ready for re-use.

Although best known for producing tractors, the Hart-Parr company also made some of the first washing machines. They sold for $155 in the 1920s, and the buyer had the option of ordering either an electric or gasoline engine.

The Floyd County Historical Museum preserves the plant&#x27;s history and memories in an extensive collection of documents and artifacts.
Charles City is the location of the last lynching in Iowa, that of James Cullen in 1907.

National women&#x27;s rights leader Carrie Lane Chapman Catt spent her girlhood years on a farm south of Charles City. Catt is well known as a prominent leader of the woman&#x27;s suffrage movement and was instrumental in gaining passage of the 19th Amendment, ratified on August 18, 1920, which granted women the right to vote.

==Geology==

Rockford is in close proximity to a world-class fossil collecting locale. The Floyd County Fossil and Prairie Park Center is a nature center located just west of Rockford. Originally a clay pit for the now-defunct Rockford Brick and Tile Company, the Floyd County acquired the property in 1990 and it is currently open to the public as a County Park.

A great number of fossil marine species are present within the Devonian strata of the Park, but the abundance of brachiopods is noteworthy. What makes this location special is that the calcareous ocean-bottom sediment that was deposited here never turned to hard stone as it does almost everywhere else in the region. This allows the fossils to weather out as discrete, often complete museum-grade specimens. Also, this is one of the few geological preserves in the United States where admission is free and collecting fossils for private use is allowed.

<text>Hamburg is a city in Fremont County, Iowa, United States, that is the most southwestern city in Iowa, hugging the borders of Missouri to the south and Nebraska to the west. It is situated between the Nishnabotna and Missouri rivers. The population was 890 at the time of the 2020 census. It derives its name from the German city of Hamburg.

==History==
The city is less than a quarter mile from the Missouri state line. The first settlers in the community were people who actually thought they were settling in Missouri following the Platte Purchase of former Indian territory there across the state line opened up settlement. The first formal settlement in the Hamburg vicinity were by the brothers James McKissick, Cornelius McKissick, Daniel McKissick who established McKissick&#x27;s Grove. A survey was made when Iowa entered the union in 1846, and only then did the settlers discover that they were in Iowa and not Missouri.

The brothers were also involved in another border irregularity when they bought McKissick Island a mile south of Hamburg. They thought at the time the island in the Missouri River was attached to Nebraska territory. The river changed course in 1867 resulting in the island becoming physically attached by dry land to Missouri and cut off from Nebraska by the main channel. Missouri and Nebraska both claimed the island and it was decided in 1904 by the U.S. Supreme Court that it belonged to Nebraska, although the states did not formally agree to the arrangement until 1999. In the meantime students from the Nebraska island passed through Missouri en route to being educated in Hamburg in Iowa.

Hamburg was formally laid out in 1857 at the behest of Augustus Borchers (August Heinrich B., August 26, 1817, Harburg near Hamburg, Germany - November 23, 1885, Hamburg (Ia.)) who named for the German city and was formally incorporated on April 1, 1867 at about the same time as it was reached by the Council Bluffs and St. Joseph Railroad. A second railroad Nebraska City Branch of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (which came from Red Oak, Iowa) came through in 1870.

Alex and Arthur Vogel started Vogel and Son Popcorn Company in 1948. The company grew to the point where he bought the city&#x27;s old water tower and train station to store his popcorn - the two structures hold a million pounds of popcorn. In 1960 the city started its Popcorn Days festival (replacing an earlier named peony festival). Vogel Popcorn is now owned by ConAgra Foods but remains headquartered in the city. Its popcorn is used in Act II and Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s.

The city gets considerable publicity during periods of Missouri River flooding, including most recently the 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods, which left the city without sewage, water or gas. In 2012, residents sought to raise funds for repairs to the city&#x27;s flood control levee with a flash mob dance video of &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; but did not receive the $5 million needed.

== Arts and culture ==
=== Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower ===
Completed in October 1966 at nearly 14 stories or in height, the Mahanay Memorial Bell Tower is named for Floyd Mahanay who left an endowment of $350,000 to have the tower built. However, the funds were not sufficient to provide for a full carillon of bells on top. In 2016, upon the 50th anniversary of the tower being built, $440,905 funds were acquired to add a four-octave, 47-bell carillon at the top of the tower. The bells are expected to be chiming the summer of 2017 and will be operated by a digital piano to give tunes for weddings, birthdays, funerals and even the local high school&#x27;s fight song after games. Every 15 minutes, the tower provides the current time with a recording of the Westminster Chimes. An elevator in the tower takes visitors to the observation deck which overlooks five Iowa counties. As of 2016, there were more than seventeen other buildings in Iowa taller than the Mahanay Tower: 12 in Des Moines, 3 in Cedar Rapids, and 2 in Davenport.

=== Festivals ===
Since 1980 annually on the second Saturday of June, the Bell Tower Festival has a parade in the morning and a street dance in the evening.

==Education==
Residents are in the Greene County Community School District, which operates Greene County Elementary, Greene County Middle, and Greene County High schools in Jefferson.

In the late 1800s Rippey had a high school in the town itself, as well as an area township high school and eleven local grade schools in the surrounding rural area. Area residents voted in favor, on a 154 to 23 basis, in November 1919 to establish the Rippey Consolidated School, which replaced all of the previous schools and was built in 1921 for $147,000. In 1957 the athletic facility, Wisecup Memorial Gymnasium, opened. In 1963 the city joined the East Greene Community School District, which began operating the Rippey School at that time. The Rippey School served as the East Greene district&#x27;s elementary school, while middle and high school students attended school in Grand Junction.

East Greene closed Rippey School on May 18, 2012. In 2012 elementary grades moved to Grand Junction while secondary students began attending schools operated by the Jefferson–Scranton Community School District. The East Greene district arranged for the demolition of the Rippey School before it consolidated into the Greene County district, which took control of the Rippey School. The districts consolidated into the Jefferson County district on July 1, 2014. In October 2014 the Rippey School was demolished, and the property was given to the City of Rippey. A monument and time capsule designed by Rippey School alum Keith Devilbiss was put in its place in 2015. A park was also put at the former school site. The gymnasium remains standing.

==Windfarm==
Located near Rippey, a 50 megawatt (MW) windfarm was constructed in 2012. The Rippey windfarm is owned by RPM Access and consists of 20 Nordex 2.5 MW turbines mounted on tall towers. Central Iowa Power Cooperative is purchasing the power generated by the project under a long-term power purchase agreement and is distributing the power to its member cooperatives.

==BRR - Bicycle Ride to Rippey==
Annually since 1977 on the first Saturday in February, the Bicycle Ride to Rippey, known as BRR, occurs. BRR was founded on February 6, 1978, by Dennis &quot;Doc Savage&quot; Hurley along with Jim Walstrom who both wanted to get a ski trip going but instead put together the &quot;Coldest Day of the Year Bike Ride&quot;. The first year, BRR had 22 riders who made it to warm up at Larry Vodenik&#x27;s Rippey Tap and, the next year, only 12 rode. In 2016, 500 pre registered with over 1700 bicyclists riding the route and, in 2017, 650 pre registered with more than 2000 riders participating on the day of BRR. Starting in Perry and ending in Perry (map of the route), this often frozen fun ride is the beginning of RAGBRAI season. The Perry Lions Club hosts a breakfast starting at 7am and packet pickup begins at 7:30am in Hotel Pattee, 1112 Willis Ave. At 10am, the bicycle riders depart for Rippey from one block east of Highway 144 at the intersection of Second Street and Willis near Hotel Pattee. The participants are encouraged to leave Rippey by 3pm. The route support ends at 7pm. In 2017, the cost to support the event with advance purchase through Eventbrite is $17 without merchandise or $25 with merchandise or $33 with merchandise and a breakfast. $35 on the day of the event gets you a BRR 2017 shirt, hot chocolate, SAG services, admission to the Rec Center and other local discounts. The Perry Chamber of Commerce sponsors the activity, but the highlight of the ride is the warm welcome always given to the riders by the town of Rippey.

Scranton formerly had a public school building of its own, which had a three-story section built in 1915. The school closed in 2008; the school district had notified the city government in 2006 so the city could plan for the future of the school. In 2010 the city government acquired the building, paying $1 for it, and converted it into a community center; the city government considered converting the school facility into an apartment block, but it determined it would have required too much money. The city government determined that it could not find a purpose for the 1913 section; therefore its razing occurred in 2012. The current Greene County district, as of 2014, rented the school gymnasium for athletic meetups.

==Community==

==History==
Jamaica was platted in 1882.

Towne was a local grocery store owner for several decades, a business founded by his father in the early 1900s. In March 1921, Maylen M. Heater was Jamaica&#x27;s first traffic victim when his car overturned just west of town. He was the vice president of his father&#x27;s bank. On July 4, 1919, Clarence Kinney and his son Guy tragically drowned in the high waters of the Raccoon River near the old saw mill. In 1921, the local garage was destroyed by fire when a local resident believed his Model T was leaking gas. He crawled under the automobile and lit a match, which resulted in an explosion. In the 1930s, the flu epidemic killed several local residents.
