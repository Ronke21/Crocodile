==History==
In 1870 when the Leavenworth, Lawrence &amp; Galveston Rail Road (later the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, now the BNSF Railway) crossed the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line within the limits of Neosho county four rival towns sprang up, in the vicinity of the junction: New Chicago, Chicago Junction, Alliance, and Tioga. Two years of the most bitter animosity ensued until the four were consolidated in 1872, and the name of Chanute given it in honor of Octave Chanute, a railroad civil engineer.

Settlers had begun populating the area as early as 1856. With the LL&amp;G Railroad set to arrive shortly thereafter, the early residents of the towns of Tioga, Chicago Junction, Alliance, and New Chicago needed an innovative solution to an escalating dispute over which town would claim the right to house the LL&amp;G Railroad&#x27;s new land office. The towns were unable to settle their differences until an individual by the name of Octave Chanute came to town. Octave was the Chief Engineer and General Superintendent of the LL&amp;G Railroad. In 1872, he suggested the towns merge to end the bickering. On January 1, 1873, the towns merged and became Chanute.

With the Southern Kansas Railroad locating a division headquarters in Chanute, the city began to flourish. In 1887, Chanute boasted a rapid growth in flourmills, grain elevators, banks, drug and hardware stores, and natural gas. In 1903, the City of Chanute established the electric utility, and in the years to follow, established the gas, water, wastewater, refuse utilities. Ash Grove Cement Company, the sixth largest cement manufacturer in North America, commenced cement manufacture in 1908 in Chanute. In September 2011 Spirit AeroSystems announced the expansion of an assembly facility which will grow to 150 employees in five years and boost the local economy.

AT&amp;T, which currently offers only 6 megabit DSL service to the town (at a higher price), filed a petition with the Kansas Corporation Commission to intervene in the city&#x27;s proposed offering, arguing it has the right to intervene since a 1947 law requires the commission to approve any bond issue the city would use to finance the construction.
In April 2015, incoming city commissioners voted not to issue bonds and to temporarily halt the plans on municipal operated broadband, pending further public discussion and a public vote.

==History==
A settlement named &quot;Erie&quot;, later referred to as &quot;Old Erie&quot; and &quot;Beantown USA&quot;, was platted northwest of the present townsite, while another community, known as Crawfordsville, was started two miles northeast of the current site. In 1866, the proprietors of these two towns made a compromise to abandon the towns and combine with the settlement at the present Erie site. Four men gave 40 acres each, that butted together, out of their 160-acre shares, to create the city plat of Erie. These men were: David Bray, Luther Puckett, John Himmelwright and Peter Walter. In November of that year the Erie Town Company was formed. Each member of this company donated forty acres of land in the center of Section 32, Township 28, Range 20 east. Each member was to buy city plots and improve them.

Erie&#x27;s first fire company was established in November 1866; its charter members were those men who had donated the land on which the community was built. The first log home in Erie was built in 1866, while the first businesses were built in the following year. By 1883, the city had two general stores, two blacksmith shops, one drug store, two hotels, one newspaper office, two churches, and a population of about 300.

Erie was incorporated on December 25, 1869. On December 30, the trustees met and declared Erie to be a city of the 3rd class.

In 1872, Erie was designated the county seat of Neosho County, defeating &quot;Osage Mission&quot; (later renamed Saint Paul) in a contentious election. After a lawsuit reached the Kansas Supreme Court, Erie retained the position of county seat.

==Old Soldiers and Sailors Reunion==
Erie is famous for its annual Old Soldiers and Sailors Reunion held during the second full week of July, including the annual Free Bean Feed. This reunion has been conducted continuously since 1873 and is claimed to be the oldest consecutively running Old Soldiers and Sailors Reunion in the country.

Salt pork and navy beans were a staple food for soldiers in the Civil War. So it was natural to serve kettles of beans during these reunions. Soon it became a tradition. Now over 1,400 pounds of beans are cooked in more than 50 iron kettles on the Courthouse lawn by the American Legion Post. Other events include the Rodeo held on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings during Reunion Week. The Old Soldiers and Sailors Reunion culminates on Friday night when Mainstreet Memories brings in Country and Western Recording Artists from Nashville each year. 
==Education==
The community is served by Erie–Galesburg USD 101 public school district, which serves Erie, Galesburg, Stark and rural Parsons in Neosho County. On September 18, 2007 the district passed a $21.9 million bond issue. They built a new green high school in Erie which opened for classes in the Fall 2010 semester. In addition, they have rebuilt the old high school into a grade school facility and added a new gym at Galesburg Middle School. The mascot for Erie High School is the Red Devil. The mascot for Galesburg Middle School is the Timber Wolf.

The demolition of the old Erie Grade and Middle School brick building began in May 2013 and lasted into July, with the Amish assisting.

<text>St. Paul or Saint Paul is a city in Neosho County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 614.

==History==
Father John Schoenmakers, S.J. founded Osage Mission on April 28, 1847. Called the &quot;Apostle to the Osage&quot; and the &quot;Father of civilization in Southeast Kansas,&quot; he served for 36 years as spiritual director, doctor, steward, lawyer, judge, catechist and preacher to the Osage. He served as an officially appointed U.S. postmaster of Osage Mission from 1851 to 1864. With the relocation of the Osage he ministered to the needs of the newly arrived settlers. He built the present St. Francis Church stone structure. Father Schoenmakers is buried in St. Francis Cemetery one quarter mile east of the Church.

The other leading man in the Osage Mission was Kentucky-born John Allan Mathews. He was married to Mary Williams and after her death to her sister Sarah Williams. The Williams sisters were the daughters of William S. Williams and his Osage wife, A-Ci&#x27;n-Ga. They first met Mathews while attending school in Kentucky after their mother died. Mathews was a slaveholder and souther-sympathizer. He married Mary in Jackson County, Missouri in 1835 and was appointed blacksmith for the Senaca in 1837 and for the Osage in 1839. In about 1861 he gathered a group of Osage who tried to force Schoenmakers to flee the area because they disagreed with Schoenmakers&#x27; abolitionist ideas. Matthews was killed by the 6th Kansas Cavalry under Gen. James G. Blunt in fighting at Chetopa, Kansas on Sep. 18, 1861.

During the Civil War both Union and Confederate troops took an interest in Osage Mission. From about December 1862 to June 1865 Union soldiers intermittently were stationed at or near the Mission. At least a couple times Confederate supporters entered Osage Mission or were in the immediate vicinity. For more see Osage Mission&#x27;s post.

As early as 1883 there was agitation to change the name of Osage Mission because it suggested it was still an Indian Mission. Neona was suggested to honor the daughter of Chief Little Bear, but local protests favored the name of St. Paul. The reigning judge decided to allow the citizens to vote on the new name and St. Paul was chosen in an election held on April 11, 1895. Some claim the new name was selected to honor the Apostle Paul, but it was most probably selected in honor of St. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionists, who had just then established a home in Osage Mission. The name of the post office was officially changed from Osage Mission to Saint Paul in May 1895.

The historic St. Francis Hieronymo Church dedicated in 1884 has undergone its latest renovation in 2007 due to a storm on June 30, 2005 that knocked off the steeple. The Osage Mission-Neosho County Museum is directly south of the church. The Lone Elm School, a one-room school house that operated from 1867 through 1951 stands on the museum grounds.

A visit to the St. Francis Parish Cemetery reflects much of the history of the Osage Mission, as does the only remaining structure of the girls&#x27; school established by Mother Bridget Hayden when she arrived at the Mission in 1847. The Osage Mission Infirmary &amp; Guest House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is managed under the name, St. Ann&#x27;s Bed and Breakfast. The owners strive to maintain its history and authentic design.

St. Paul&#x27;s homecoming is called Mission Days. It is held annually on Memorial Day Weekend with activities that begin on Thursday and conclude on Monday, including: races, music shows, dances, pony &amp; draft horse pulls, parade, horseshoe tournament, carnival, kids games, golf tournament, calf penning &amp; Calcutta, and Memorial Day services at the local cemeteries.

==History==
Culver was laid out &quot;circa&quot; 1878. It was named after George Washington Culver, who was living in Ottawa County in August 1868 when he was recruited to be a scout for Col. George Forsyth, following the first Spillman-Bacon Creek Indian raid. At daybreak on September 17, 1868 Forsyth&#x27;s band of 50 civilian scouts was attacked by approximately 1,000 of Roman Nose&#x27;s dog soldier warriors in northeastern Colorado Territory. This was known as Beecher Island. They took cover on a small sandy island in the middle of the Arickaree fork of the Republican River, about 17 miles south of present-day Wray, Colorado. The next three days were spent fighting and by the time the fighting ended, the scouts were out of rations and living on horse and mule meat. About half of the scouts were wounded at the outbreak of the fighting. Culver was one of five scouts killed or mortally wounded. Culver was buried at the battleground, later moved to Fort Wallace Cemetery and eventually to Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. Before Beecher Island, during the Civil War he served as 2nd Lt, Co E, Second Colorado Cavalry. Following the Civil War, he worked for a time as a watchmaker in Junction City, Kansas, and shortly before his death was elected to public office in Ottawa County. The town and township of Culver were named in honor of him.

A post office was opened at Culver in 1873 and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1984.

Named in honor of John Bissel, Fort Bissel was built in 1872 to protect against perceived hostility from Native Americans and closed in 1878. The Fort was reconstructed in city park in 1962. The first cemetery in the town, Close cemetery, was established on March 19, 1879 by the Fairview cemetery association and was deeded to the city on June 4, 1889.

<doc id="114830" wikidata="Q2736390" url="?curid=114830" title="Louisville, Kansas">
<text>Louisville is a city in Pottawatomie County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 131.

==History==
The community was founded in 1857 by Robert Wilson as Rock Post. The area was once part of the Potawatomi Hunting grounds and a large majority of the settlers were either associated with the Pottawatomie Indian Reservation or commerce on the Oregon Trail. Louisville was named for Robert Wilson&#x27;s son, Louis, and for Louis Vieux, a successful businessman in the area. The town was a contender for county seat of Pottawatomie County but lost to St. George in 1861 and Westmoreland in 1882.

On November 8, 1875, Louisville was struck by an earthquake. In 1882, with the county seat in Westmoreland and the Union Pacific Railroad built through Wamego, the town&#x27;s population swiftly declined.

===Louis Vieux===
Louis Vieux Sr. was a prominent citizen of Louisville who operated a trail crossing across the Vermillion River. He was born in 1809 in Wisconsin to Angelique Roy, a Potawatomi woman, and Jacques Vieux, a Canadian-French trader. Vieux and his wife, Sha-Note, moved first to Cedar Bluffs, Iowa in 1832 until moving to Indianola, Kansas (northwest of Topeka along Soldier Creek) in 1846. Sha-Note died in 1857 and Vieux moved to the Vermillion River near present-day Louisville. Vieux began his trail crossing business and worked as a caller for the U.S. Government working the pay station in St. Mary&#x27;s and he also served on the tribal council and made trips to Washington, D.C., on behalf of the Pottawatomies. Vieux also signed the treaty that split the Pottawatomies into two separate tribes-the Prairie Band and Citizen Potawatomi Nation. Vieux died in 1872 and left behind a 200-page will leaving half the town of Louisville, all of Belvue and other personal property to his wife and children.

===Oregon Trail crossing===

About three miles east of Louisville was the Vermillion Crossing of the Oregon Trail operated by Louis Vieux. Vieux is buried in the Vieux Family Cemetery on top of a hill. Nearby, on the banks of the river, is a cholera cemetery from 1849, which is estimated to contain at least fifty graves, although only two stones—both native sandstones—remain.

<text>Pratt is a city in and the county seat of Pratt County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 6,603. It is home to Pratt Community College.

==History==

===19th century===
Pratt was founded in 1884 and named after Caleb S. Pratt, a young Civil War officer from the Kansas Infantry, who was killed in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek near Springfield, Missouri The first post office in Pratt was established in June 1884.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as St. Louis and Southwestern &quot;Cotton Belt&quot; Railroad, a subsidiary of Southern Pacific Railroad which merged in 1996 with Union Pacific. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

===20th century===
Built in 1930, Hotel Roberts is the largest and most highly styled historic hotel in Pratt. Construction of the hotel was initiated by the Pratt Chamber of Commerce, which formed a committee in the late 1920s specifically to facilitate the construction of a large new hotel. Seen as a potentially valuable asset for the community, the hotel was financed in part through a public subscription campaign, and constructed on land provided by the Chamber. The Pratt Hotel Company owned and operated the hotel and hired Wichita architect Samuel S. Voigt and Kansas City contractor Webster L. Elson to design and build the building. Elson not only supervised the rapid construction of the &quot;fire-proof&quot; building, he was a founding member of the Pratt Hotel Company, and he retained an ownership interest in the property for many years. The community hospital was established on the eighth floor of the building in 1932, complete with an operating room and an x-ray machine. Architecturally, the building is significant as an early and sophisticated example of the Art Deco style in central Kansas. The hotel opened as the Hotel Roberts in 1930, and continued under that name until 1959, when it was purchased by Monte Parrish and renamed the Hotel Parrish. In January 2015 it was listed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places for its local significance in the areas of architecture and community planning and development.

During World War II, the nearby Pratt Army Airfield was the first base used for training Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber crews and also served as a staging area for getting early aircraft combat-ready, in what became known as the Battle of Kansas.

The Miss Kansas Parade and Pageant are held here.

The state headquarters of Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks was constructed southeast of the town.

<doc id="114847" wikidata="Q676758" url="?curid=114847" title="District of Franklin">
<text>The District of Franklin was a regional administrative district of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories. The district consisted of the Canadian high Arctic Islands, notably Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, and Victoria Island. The district also contained the mainland Melville Peninsula and Boothia Peninsula.

English navigators Martin Frobisher and Henry Hudson were the first Europeans known to have visited the area (although Viking sailors, coming from Greenland, may have made occasional landings and hunting treks on Baffin Island in the 11th and 12th centuries). The area was transferred from British colonial authority to the Dominion of Canada in 1894 and named after Sir John Franklin in the following year; however, the northernmost islands were claimed by Norway until the year 1930.

Along with the District of Keewatin and the District of Mackenzie, it was one of the three districts of the old Northwest Territories before the formation of Nunavut in 1999, at which point the district ceased to exist, although as an administrative district of the NWT it had ceased to function several years prior to the splitting off of Nunavut. The area of the former District of Franklin was divided between the remaining portion of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. In the process, Victoria Island was divided with approximately two-thirds of its area falling in Nunavut, and several other islands were also divided between the two territories.

===Rodeo===
Abbyville hosts the annual Abbyville Frontier Days PRCA Rodeo and BBQ the third weekend of May. Current events of the rodeo include barrel racing, mutton bustin&#x27;, bull riding, calf roping, steer wrestling, and other special events. It is now a PRCA sanctioned event.

Clifford &quot;Pinky&quot; Busick was the creator of this rodeo, starting with a loan of $10 from his father. The first rodeo was a celebration of the Kansas Centennial, and it was held on July 15, 1961. The events at this initial celebration included a bonnet contest, beard contest, antique display, horse show, carnival, and bean dinner. &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was performed in the evening as the main entertainment. The event was such a great success for Abbyville that Pinky worked to continue the rodeo as an annual event.

The second rodeo was held on the third weekend of May in 1963, and it has continued yearly ever since. Locals, both from Abbyville and from nearby towns, ran every aspect of the rodeo and took great pride in it. Many traditions of the early rodeos still continue today, including a Saturday morning parade, ham and chicken noodle lunch, and a BBQ dinner with fresh pie for dessert. Two 5- or 6-year-old children are crowned &quot;Miss Little Britches&quot; and &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; in the parade.

Despite Abbyville being such a small town, the rodeo has continued to this day, and it has kept Abbyville on the map.

Hollerado filmed the official music video for their single &quot;Good Day at the Races&quot; at the Abbyville rodeo grounds.

==Education==
The community is served by Fairfield USD 310 public school district. Before the creation of USD 310, the old Abbyville High School mascot was the Lions.

<doc id="114849" wikidata="Q365489" url="?curid=114849" title="Adolph Ochs">
<text>Adolph Simon Ochs (March 12, 1858 – April 8, 1935) was an American newspaper publisher and former owner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot;, which is now the &quot;Chattanooga Times Free Press&quot;. Through his only child, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, and her husband Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Ochs&#x27;s descendants continue to publish &quot;The New York Times&quot; through the present day.

==Early life and education==
Ochs was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 12, 1858, to Julius Ochs and Bertha Levy, both German Jewish immigrants. His father had left Bavaria for the United States in 1846. Julius was a highly educated man, fluent in six languages, and he taught at schools throughout the South. He supported the Union during the Civil War. Ochs&#x27; mother Bertha came to the United States in 1848, fleeing the German Revolutions in Rhenish Bavaria, and lived in the South prior to her 1853 marriage to Julius. She sympathized with the Confederacy during the American Civil War, but the conflicting sympathies between husband and wife did not separate their household.

Following the end of the Civil War, the family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in the eastern, Union-affiliated part of the state. In Knoxville, Adolph studied in the public schools. During his spare time, he delivered newspapers.

==Career==
At age 11, Ochs went to work at the &quot;Knoxville Chronicle&quot; as an office assistant to the newspaper&#x27;s editor, William Rule, who became a mentor. In 1871, Ochs worked as a grocer&#x27;s clerk in Providence, Rhode Island, while attending night school. He returned to Knoxville, where he was an apprentice to a pharmacist for some time.

In 1872, Ochs returned to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; as a printer&#x27;s devil, who looked after various details in the composing room of the newspaper. His siblings also worked at the newspaper to supplement the income of their father, a lay religious leader for Knoxville&#x27;s small Jewish community. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; was the only Republican, pro-Reconstruction, newspaper in the city, but Ochs counted Father Ryan, the Poet-Priest of the Confederacy, among his customers.

===Chattanooga Times===

At the age of 19, Ochs borrowed $250 from his family to purchase a controlling interest in the &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot;, becoming its publisher.

The following year, he founded a commercial paper that he called &quot;The Tradesman&quot;. He was one of the founders of the Southern Associated Press and served as president.

===The New York Times===
In 1896, at the age of 38, he was advised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Henry Alloway that the paper could be bought at a greatly reduced price due to its financial losses and wide range of competitors in New York City.

After borrowing money to purchase the &quot;Times&quot; for $75,000, Ochs formed The New York Times Company, placed the paper on a strong financial foundation, and became the majority stockholder.

In 1904, Ochs hired Carr Van Anda as his managing editor. They focused on objective journalism at a time when newspapers were openly and highly partisan. They also decreased the newspaper&#x27;s cost from 3 cents per issue to 1 cent, which led to the newspaper&#x27;s survival. The newspaper&#x27;s readership increased from 9,000 at the time of his purchase to 780,000 by the 1920s. He also added the &quot;Times&quot;″ well-known masthead motto: &quot;All the News That&#x27;s Fit to Print&quot;.

In 1904, Ochs moved &quot;The New York Times&quot; to a newly built building on Longacre Square in Manhattan, which the City of New York then renamed as Times Square.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1904, Ochs had pyrotechnists illuminate his new building at One Times Square with a fireworks show from street level.

Beginning with 1896, there was issued weekly a supplement, eventually called &quot;The New York Times Book Review and Magazine&quot;. Other auxiliary publications were incrementally added, including &quot;The Annalist&quot;, a financial review appearing on Mondays, &quot;The Times Mid-Week Pictorial&quot; on Thursdays, &quot;Current History Magazine&quot;, a monthly, started during World War I, &quot;The New York Times Index&quot;, started in 1913, published quarterly, and comparable only to the &quot;Index&quot;, published by &quot;The Times&quot; in London.

On August 18, 1921, the 25th anniversary of reorganization, &quot;The New York Times&quot; employed 1,885 people. It was classified as an independent Democratic publication, and consistently opposed William Jennings Bryan in his presidential campaigns. By its fairness in the presentation of news, editorial moderation and ample foreign service, it secured a high place in American journalism, becoming widely read and influential throughout the United States.

===Philadelphia Public Ledger===

In 1901, Ochs became proprietor and editor of the Philadelphia &quot;Times&quot;, which was later merged into the Philadelphia &quot;Public Ledger&quot;. Ochs was the sole owner of the Philadelphia-based newspaper from 1902 to 1912, when he sold it to Cyrus H. K. Curtis.

According to Wolfgang Disch,

In 1916, Ochs communicated one of his most famous quotes, saying, &quot;I affirm that more than 50% of money spent on advertising is squandered and is a sheer waste of printers&#x27; ink.&quot; The quote might be the origin of the common marketing saying, &quot;I know half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, but I can never find out which half&quot;, a quote that has been attributed to John Wanamaker.

Ochs was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1931.

==Personal life==

In 1884, Ochs married Effie Wise, a daughter of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of Cincinnati, who was the leading exponent of Reform Judaism in the United States, and the founder of Hebrew Union College.

In 1928, Ochs built the Mizpah Congregation Temple in Chattanooga, Tennessee in memory of his parents, Julius and Bertha Ochs. The Georgian colonial building was designated as a Tennessee Historical Preservation Site in 1979.

Ochs fought anti-Semitism during his career. He was active in the early years of the Anti-Defamation League, where he served as an executive board member, and used his influence as publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to convince other newspapers nationwide to cease the unjustified caricaturing and lampooning of Jews in the American media.

Ochs was an opponent of a Jewish state in Palestine.

==Death==
Ochs died on April 8, 1935, during a visit to Chattanooga, Tennessee. He is buried at the Temple Israel Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County, New York.

==Legacy==

Ochs&#x27; daughter, Iphigene Bertha Ochs, married Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who became publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; following his death. Her son-in-law, Orvil Dryfoos, was publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1961 to 1963, and he was succeeded by her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. Her daughter, Ruth Holmberg, became publisher of &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot;. Ruth Holmberg&#x27;s son, Arthur Golden, authored &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. served as publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1992 until 2017, when he was succeeded by his own son, A. G. Sulzberger.

One of Ochs&#x27;s nephews, Julius Ochs Adler, worked at &quot;The New York Times&quot; for more than 40 years, becoming general manager in 1935, after Ochs died. Another nephew, John Bertram Oakes, the son of his brother George Washington Ochs Oakes, in 1961 became editor of its editorial page, a position he held until 1976. Ochs was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1982. Another nephew, Adolph Shelby Ochs, was treasurer and a director of &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot;. He was married to Mrs. Theodosia Fitzgerald Gray of Danville, Virginia, granddaughter of Dan River Inc. founder T.B. Fitzgerald, niece of Wachovia Bank founder James Alexander Gray and cousin of Bowman Gray Sr., former president and chairman of R. J. Reynolds.

<text>Arlington is a city in Reno County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 435.

==History==
Arlington was founded in 1877. It was named after Arlington, Massachusetts. The first post office in Arlington was established in February 1878.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Arlington to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980, reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, and merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

In 1980, Arlington (with 503 residents at the time) was profiled by the Associated Press as a town that &quot;has not had a murder in its entire history&quot;. The police chief at the time, Ralph Almquist, had been hired in 1974, marking the first time that Arlington had had a full-time police force, and boasted that &quot;We don&#x27;t have any murders here because I don&#x27;t allow crime.&quot;

<text>Buhler is a city in Reno County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,325.

==History==

The first post office in Buhler was established in 1888.

Buhler was primarily inhabited by Mennonite families that had emigrated from Russia during the 1880s.

In September 2012, the City of Buhler received a letter from the Freedom from Religion Foundation regarding a complaint about perceived constitutual violations about the city seal having a cross in it. In November 2012, the city stated that every legal opinion it had received indicated the city has no supportable case in the event that it was sued to legally force us to remove the seal and sign. If the city lost, it would be obligated to pay all the legal fees of the prevailing party. The city decided to hold a contest in January 2013 to redesign the city seal without specific reference to religion.

<text>Haven is a city in Reno County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 1,170.

==History==
Haven was laid out in 1886, and incorporated as a city in 1901. The first post office in Haven was established in 1873.

The local high school football team was on the winning side of a lopsided football game against another school from across the county in Sylvia. Played in 1927 with a final score of 256–0, the game produced multiple national and state high school records. As of 2016, the state records include: Total points scored, points by both teams, widest margin, widest shutout, most touchdowns (38), and most rushing touchdowns (30). Also, Haven student Elvin McCoy holds state records for both individual points per game with 90 and individual touchdowns scored per game with 13. The introduction of the mercy rule means that many of these records will likely never be broken.

In 2022, the mayor and council unanimously voted to remove “In God We Trust” decals from the city&#x27;s police vehicles. However, after public outcry, the council voted to put the decals back onto the city&#x27;s police cars.

<text>Hutchinson is the largest city in and the county seat of Reno County, Kansas, United States. The city is located on the Arkansas River. It has been home to salt mines since 1887 (thus its nickname of &quot;Salt City&quot;) but locals call it &quot;Hutch&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 40,006.

Each year, Hutchinson hosts the Kansas State Fair, and National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Men&#x27;s Basketball Tournament. It is the home of the Hutchinson Community College, the Cosmosphere aerospace museum, and Strataca underground salt museum.

==History==

The city of Hutchinson was founded in 1871 when frontiersman Clinton &quot;C.C.&quot; Hutchinson contracted with the Santa Fe Railway to make a town at the railroad&#x27;s crossing over the Arkansas River. The town actually sprang up about one-half mile north, on the banks of Cow Creek, where a few houses already existed. Hutchinson later founded the Reno County Bank in 1873, and by 1878 had erected the state&#x27;s first water mill at Hutchinson. The community earned the nickname &quot;Temperance City&quot; due to the prohibition of alcohol set by its founder who placed a deed restriction on every lot prohibiting the sale or gifting of any alcoholic beverage which, if violated, would result in forfeit of the lot, improvements and payments associated with its sale and purchase. Hutchinson was incorporated as a third class city in August 1872.

In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a main line from Herington through Hutchinson to Pratt. In 1888, this line was extended to Liberal. Later, it was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. It foreclosed in 1891 and was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which shut down in 1980 and reorganized as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad, merged in 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad, merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the &quot;Rock Island&quot;.

Also in 1887, local salt deposits were discovered for the first time, when Ben Blanchard, a land speculator who founded South Hutchinson, drilled for oil in the area. Salt mining would become a major industry in Hutchinson, with the city eventually earning the nickname &quot;Salt City&quot;.

Hutchinson had been holding county fairs since 1873. By 1900, many referred to the Hutchinson Fair as the Kansas State Fair, even though there was no state-supported Kansas State Fair yet. In 1913, after lobbying in the Kansas Legislature, Hutchinson gifted the State of Kansas the land that became the Kansas State Fairgrounds. The official Kansas State Fair has been held in Hutchinson ever since.

In 1943, German and Italian prisoners of World War II were used in Kansas and other Midwest states as a means of solving the labor shortage caused by American men serving in the war effort. Large prisoner-of-war camps were established in Kansas: Camp Concordia, Camp Funston (at Fort Riley), Camp Phillips (at Salina under Fort Riley). Fort Riley established 12 smaller branch camps, including Hutchinson.

On January 17, 2001, of compressed natural gas leaked from the nearby Yaggy storage field. It sank underground, then rose to the surface through old brine or salt wells, making around 15 gas blowholes. An explosion in the downtown area at 10:45 am destroyed two businesses and damaged 26 others. An explosion the next day in a mobile home park killed two people. The Kansas National Guard was called in to help evacuate parts of the city because of the gas leaks, and a team of specialists checked the city for leaks after the event. These events were televised on news stations across the country.

On June 21, 2013, following a grassroots campaign in an effort to promote Smallville Con, a comic-book convention hosted at the Kansas State Fair, the mayor of Hutchinson decreed the city&#x27;s name would be changed to &quot;Smallville&quot; for one day in honor of Superman&#x27;s fictional Kansas hometown of the same name. The tradition has continued annually, coinciding with the convention for two days every June.

The entire town of Cuba moved to its present location in 1884 in order to be on the railroad that had been built through that region.

The town has received attention due to its small town America nature documented by photographer Jim Richardson. Cuba, Kansas and Jim Richardson were highlighted on the &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; show in 1983 and in 2004, as well as the May 2004 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

<text>Scandia is a city in Republic County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 344.

==History==

The first American flag to be flown in what is now Kansas was raised in 1806 near the area of Scandia. The area was not settled until much later by Swedish immigrants and was first called New Scandinavia. The settlement of Scandia was promoted by crop failures during the 1860s in Sweden. In 1868, the Scandinavian Agricultural Society of Chicago purchased 12 sections of land along the Republican River and formed a colony. The name was changed to Scandia in 1876, according to post office records. Scandia was incorporated as a city in 1879. From there it became a transition point for trade and travel in the early 1900s. It is now a small rural community.

Scandia is the site of several historic houses dating to the early days of settlement. The three-story Wohlfort Mansion was built in the early 1890s by Thure Wohlfort (1835-1916) who was an early member of the society and one of the original founders of Scandia.

In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion and McPherson counties chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company. In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson; in 1880 it was extended to Lyons and in 1881 was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase and Ellinwood.

Chase was laid out in 1880 when the railroad was extended to that point. The city was named after a railroad official. The first post office in Chase was established in 1881.

<doc id="114874" wikidata="Q1023008" url="?curid=114874" title="Frederick, Kansas">
<text>Frederick is a city in Rice County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 8.

==History==
Frederick was incorporated in 1909. It was a shipping point at the junction of the Missouri Pacific and the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco railroads.

A post office was opened in Frederick (also spelled historically Frederic) in 1887, and remained in operation until being discontinued in 1954.

In July 2015, Government officials report considering un-incorporating the city. As of August 2015, for the first time in nearly 130 years, the city doesn&#x27;t have a city council and no one ran for mayor in April 2015. The future of Frederick is uncertain because Rice County doesn&#x27;t have the power to unincorporate the city. According to state law, residents must bring a petition to the city council, then a special election will be called for a vote, but since there is no city council, then it is impossible.

In November 2016, the community voted on whether to dissolve Frederick. Election workers at the Eureka Township voting location accidentally gave the wrong ballots to township residents who didn&#x27;t actually live in Frederick. Twenty people voted, 13 voting to keep the community alive, but currently, only nine people live in Frederick. The mistake was caught more than a week after the vote was certified, which was, therefore, after the five-day window to contest a vote, thus Kansas law locked the outcome: Frederick is still a city.

In November 2017, another ballot issue was voted on whether to dissolve the city. The vote was 2-2.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.
